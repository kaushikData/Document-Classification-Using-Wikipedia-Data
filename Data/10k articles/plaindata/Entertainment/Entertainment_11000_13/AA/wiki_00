{"id": "6724790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6724790", "title": "3 Ring Circus", "text": "3 Ring Circus\n\n3 Ring Circus is a 1954 American comedy film directed by Joseph Pevney and starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The picture was shot from February 17 to March 31, 1954, and released on December 25 by Paramount Pictures. The supporting cast includes Joanne Dru, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Wallace Ford, Sig Ruman, Nick Cravat, and Elsa Lanchester.\n\nPete Nelson, a smooth operator who has just been discharged from the Army, joins forces with his old buddy, the loud Jerome X. Hotchkiss, and together they join a circus. The Clyde Brent Circus, to be exact. Jerry has taken a job as apprentice lion tamer. He is set on being a circus clown, but his plans are squandered when they meet the circus manager Sam Morley and owner Jill Brent, who is also ringmaster. The circus has financial problems, so the only way that both Pete and Jerry can be hired if they help out wherever needed.\n\nJerry dutifully reports to the designated lion tamer, Colonel Schlitz, but is terrified when Schlitz forces him into the lions' cage with only a whip and chair for protection. Schlitz keeps calling at him to behave coolly and to show no fear, but all Jerry can do is to nervously try to befriend the beasts. Schlitz pulls him out of the cage.\n\nLater in the day Jerry and Pete are washing the elephants when Jill stops by to chat. Pete starts flirting, which she finds both attractive and annoying. Jerry sneaks into Puffo the Wonder Clown's tent and tries on his hats. Morley catches him red-handed and scolds him.\n\nOne night while working in a custard stand. Pete and Jerry are overwhelmed by the crowd and lose control of the machine. Morley sends Jerry to help Puffo dress for his performance. The arrogant clown rejects Jerry’s help. Jerry's next assignment is to hand Nero, the tightrope walker, a unicycle. The audience roars with laughter at Jerry's fumbling attempts to climb a rope ladder while holding the bike. When Jerry accidentally ends up riding the unicycle on the tightrope, the crowd hushes. Pete and the clowns rush in with a net and catch him when he falls.\n\nSaadia, the Queen of the Trapeze, is up to perform. She goes into the ring and Pete is indeed breath-taken by her great beauty. Jill, however, dislikes the egotistical, greedy Saadia. Morley insists the circus would go bankrupt without her. To Jill's disgust, Pete agrees to become Saadia's personal assistant.\n\nMorley then talks Jerry into becoming a human cannonball. Pete, wearing nothing on his upper body, shows off for Saadia, giving her a private demonstration of his skills on the parallel bars. Saadia is attracted to Pete, and they end up kissing. They are interrupted by the slightly jealous Jill, who informs Saadia that, for financial reasons, there will be an extra show on Saturday.\n\nSaadia is well aware of that the survival of the circus depends on her, but she refuses to do the extra show. Pete, watching her perform to a capacity crowd, gets an idea how to save the circus.\n\nMorley finally allows Jerry to go into the ring in place of a sick clown. Jerry is ecstatic, but one performer unhappy with Jerry’s big break is Puffo. He resents the cheap laughs that Jerry gets from the audience and starts bullying him in the ring. The audience is upset and starts to boo Puffo, wanting him to go off. After the show Jerry tells Puffo that he is not angry with him.\n\nPete flirts with a very receptive Jill, but when he asks about the circus's profits, she is furious and slaps him. Soon after, in Saadia's tent, Pete explains to Jill his plan to increase the profits with gambling. A skeptical Jill, who inherited the circus from her father, allows Pete to set up some gaming tables on the midway.\n\nThe circus continues its tour. On Jill’s birthday, Pete and Jerry throw her a big party. Puffo gets quite drunk and interrupts the festivities to declare he is quitting. He will consider staying on if Jerry and Pete are fired. Pete gets angry and punches Puffo in frustration. Jill later fires Puffo from the circus and replaces his act with Jerry.\n\nJerry starts performing under the name Jerricho. He is an instant hit with the audience, even bigger than Saadia, who gets jealous. So jealous she too threatens to quit unless the circus gets rid of Jerry. Tired of her ego, Pete tells her \"drive carefully\" and sends her on her way. Jill is quite relieved that the alluring Saadia is out of her way.\n\nHowever, her relief is short-lived. She witnesses a fight between Pete's shell-game operator and a customer, then demands that Pete stop the gambling operation. Pete refuses and announces he is leaving the circus, too. Sure that the loyal Jerry will go with him, Jill insists on leaving instead, preferring to leave the circus to Pete than lose it entirely.\n\nJerry verbally attacks Pete for canceling a benefit performance for disadvantaged children. Pete then tells Jerry he \"ain't nice\" anymore, and quits. Jerry and the other clowns decide to perform the show anyway, and Jill meets them at the outdoor arena.\n\nJerry’s words ring in Pete’s head while Jerry performs and delights the children with his clowning. Jerry goes to great lengths to get a sad-faced handicapped girl to laugh. A car arrives in the ring out of it comes Pete, dressed in a clown suit. Jerry and Jill are delighted to see Pete join in the fun.\n\n\nThe film was the first starring Martin and Lewis to be shot in VistaVision. A clip from it was shown in a promotional short film, \"Paramount Presents VistaVision\".\n\nAn edited version, removing, among other things, the early military and circus scenes of Martin and Lewis together, plus Martin's later music numbers, was released by Paramount in 1978 and shown at children's matinees. As the new title \"Jerrico The Wonder Clown\" implied, the resulting edit lessened Martin's screen-time and threw the emphasis to Lewis' character even more than in the original film.\nDue to unknown reasons, the film remains the only Martin and Lewis film without a home release.\n\n"}

The anime is produced by Satelight, with Shōji Kawamori as chief director and writer. The first season aired in Japan between April and July 2012 whilst the second season aired between January and March 2013.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, an interplanetary war broke out. Earth's ecosystem was severely damaged, and humanity was forced to flee the planet, hence begin a new history with the Star Calendar starting from the year 0000. In several planets of this new society led by a totalitarian government, the Deep Galactic Trade Organization [DGTO], things that \"disturb the heart\" like music and art are forbidden. The legendary idol group AKB48 is later resurrected as the interplanetary troupe AKB0048, made up of girls who carry on the title and spirit of the original members. Since the government sees the existence of the idol group as illegal, the idol group cannot hold their concerts officially. AKB0048 also changed their concept from \"idols you can meet\" to \"idols who see fans\". Held as heroines by some and labeled as terrorists by others, they take up arms to bring their music to their fans wherever they are. The story follows a group of young hopefuls as they train to become the next generation of AKB0048.\n\nFour years prior to the story, Chieri Sono, while visiting Lancastar with her father, invites Nagisa Motomiya, Orine Aida and Yuuka Ichijo to watch AKB0048's dangerous performance at the planet's mining site as they battle the DES soldiers which attracts and inspires them to join the idol group. Four years later, Star Calendar Year 0048, Nagisa, Orine and Yuuka pass the idol group's first found audition and thus embark on a journey to Akibastar, the homeland of AKB0048 despite Nagisa's father's disapproval of joining the idol group. Meanwhile, Chieri escapes her father who does not approve of her in the same way as Nagisa's father and joins Nagisa, Orine and Yuuka. Also joining are Makoto Yokomizo, the timid girl, Suzuko Kanzaki, a bespectacled girl and Sonata Shinonome, an energetic young girl. All of them pass the second round audition conducted by Tsubasa Katagiri, the manager of AKB0048 and are chosen as the 77th generation trainees.\n\nArriving at Akibastar, the chosen 77th generation trainees settle down. Joining them are 75th generation trainees, Kanata Shinonome who is Sonata's sister and Mimori Kishida who is Kanata's teammate. Kanata's relationship with her sister is hostile at first because she does not want the latter to risk her life, but soon she comes to accept her as part of the idol group. And so, the trainees undergo a life of concert performance training, singing and dancing, although sometimes they have a monthly day off. All the choreographies are planned by Mr. Ushiyama, a cross dressing man. Inside AKB0048, the trainees come into close relationships with successors Minami Takahashi the 5th (Shiori Arisawa), Yuuko Ooshima the 9th (Hikari Kimishima), Mayu Watanabe Type 3, Sayaka Akitomo the 10th (Akira Igarashi), Yuki Kashiwagi the 6th (Ayako Kuroki), Haruna Kojima the 8th (Chiharu Sakuragi) and Sae Miyazawa the 10th (Youko Asamiya) as they train and perform concerts together and meet fans at both handshake events and concerts held at entertainment-banned planets. Orine meets her hater, who is hostile to her at first but slowly gives her constructive suggestions to help her improve.\n\nTakamina once begins to self-doubt when the kiraras choose Kanata as the ideal successor of Minami Takahashi. So she loses her form and becomes injured while fighting the DES machine. The group performs at Tundrastar, but Takamina forces herself to perform although being forced to be replaced by Kanata and at the end of the concert catches the succession fever in the process, but has recovered since then. After AKB's meeting, a gravure shoot for all the members, including the understudies is held at Atamistar. Tsubasa meets up with the camerawoman, Mikako Minamino, who is the former successor of Minami Minegishi and a former Center Nova. Minami declares she is against the idea of the Center Nova position being resurrected. When the idol group holds its concert at Lancastar, the DES know about it already and enforces stronger control over Lancastar; the WOTA (hardcore fans) protect the idol group along the way. Nagisa's father is caught by the DGTO authorities at the same time. Nagisa becomes worried about her father and soon loses her voice. The concert is held despite the threats and Nagisa's loss of voice but is interrupted in the middle by a DES attack. AKB suddenly hear Acchan's voice, the last Center Nova and with Acchan's voice the idol group is persuaded to fight on. WOTA rescue Nagisa's father and Nagisa later regains the voice back after she finds confidence in herself. Meanwhile, the Kirara are so impressed by Takamina's determination during the concert that they choose her as Minami Takahashi's rightful successor again. But as the DES attack becomes too intense, the concert ends earlier, and the group is forced to move out of Lancastar, heading to their next stage.\n\nIn the year since the 77th generation joined AKB0048, the Deep Galactic Trade Organization [DGTO], a totalitarian galactic government and its national armed force, Destroy Entertainment Soldiers [DES] have stepped up their attacks on entertainment. AKB0048 continue their next stage and performs the concert at Atamistar. Manager Tsubasa announces to bring back the general elections and the Center Nova position. The same night after the concert, Chieri, Ayako and Sonata were caught by the DES to be tried in a High Court in Kasumigastar, the DGTO's capital, but are later freed by the rest of AKB0048 with the help of WOTA. The trial itself made Chieri famous throughout the galaxy and receives more work (such as photoshoots). Chieri's father starts developing artificial Kiraras while Tsubasa becomes curious as to how they were able to break into Kasumigastar so easily earlier. The understudies are now thrown into a new competition directly against the successors especially when the general election is approaching.\n\nSoon later, the results of the general elections are announced with Hikari (Yuuko) announced winner of the top 10 list along with other successors in their respective rankings. Also included in the top 10 list were 77th generation trainee Chieri Sono in 6th place and 75th generation trainee Mimori Kishida in 10th place. The elected members are chosen for a concert on Baltistar, a planet completely under the entertainment ban. Meanwhile, the 77th generation trainees are chosen to infiltrate a nearby military base to undercover and investigate reports of people visiting the base and discover a hidden illegal casino there. The girls target the nuclear reactor hidden in the base, shut down the casino and escape with Higashino, the DES guard helped them in the process. Some time later, the Kirara of Succession show the original Atsuko's image, foretelling that someone may succeed her soon. Mikako is brought in as the group's official camerawoman as the group rehearse for a concert. After the rehearsal, Mimori comes down with a succession fever and Nagisa is chosen to stand in for her in the concert after Mimori collapsed during the break.\n\nMimori recovers from her fever and debut as a successor, inherited the name of Mariko Shinoda the 8th. Mikako unknowingly informs Chieri's father of the three conditions required for initiating the Center Nova phenomenon. Knowing this, the latter orders his company Zodiac, under the DES to go after an element known as Dualium that is hidden in Akibastar by launching a DES Force attack there one day when AKB hold another concert, putting the city into chaos and forcing AKB to struggle against the DES. AKB retreat from Akibastar due to escalating battle. During DGTO's occupation of Akibastar, AKB0048 barely manage to escape the DES in their ship and arrive above a strange planet to be repaired because it sustained the DES attack. The trainees are sent to gather data on the planet they landed on and in the process meet with the creatures there. A new bond of friendship is made as they defend the planet together and defeat the Zodiac machines that came out of the blue to attack the planet for dualium but sacrificing the nature there. Chieri and Nagisa later sneak on board of one of Zodiac's ships, taking them to Sagittariusstar so that Chieri can confront her father face to face. Chieri finally reaches her father and is told to exhibit her singing skills but witnesses her father assassinated by a person unknown in front of her when it just seems as if the former became friendlier towards her again. Chieri was sad and distraught over the death of her father. Nevertheless, she and her teammates show their fighting spirit to reclaim Akibastar. Back in Akibastar, the people there shows sign of hatred towards AKB because they feel betrayed by their retreat and turned against them since the DES is strongly controlling the planet. Despite this, Chieri, Nagisa and the others combine their feelings with the nameless emotions across the galaxy and fight back with love and music, getting the DES to withdraw, returning peace to Akibastar with Nagisa promoted as Atsuko Maeda the 14th and Chieri as the new Center Nova.\n\nThe story focuses mainly on a group of girls who are in AKB0048. In the Japanese dub, they were voiced by actual members from AKB48 and its sister groups, and are grouped as NO NAME to sing the opening and closing credits. The Successors are veteran members who are titled after members of the original AKB48 troupe, but their roles are performed by professional voice actresses. The other characters are also voiced by professional voice actor and actresses. In contrast to the Japanese dub, in the English dub they are all voiced by professional voice actors and actresses.\n\nThe Successors are members of AKB0048 whose stage names are based on AKB48 members along with their ordinal numbers.\n\nPrior to the anime's release, four manga series based on original concepts began serialisation in Kodansha's \"Nakayoshi\", \"Bessatsu Friend\", \"Magazine Special\" and \"Bessatsu Shonen Magazine\" publications during December 2011 and January 2012.

It was written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden for the short-lived BBC radio series \"Third Division\", and was featured in the second edition on 2 February 1949. It compared the area, during postwar austerity, to faraway exotic locations depicted in travelogues of the day. One memorable part of the sketch is the pronunciation of Balham as \"Bal-Ham\" in an American accent, instead of the British pronunciation \"Ballum\".\n\nThe original sketch was performed by Peter Sellers as narrator, with others such as Benny Hill and Michael Bentine contributing other voices. The script features the narration of exaggerated claims regarding the attractions of the area. The sketch was later performed solo by Peter Sellers, in a parody of the American newsreel-travelogue host James A.

Broadcasts in full colour started in 1980. About 2 million televisions receive transmissions from the network's 17 relay stations.\n\nBTV has a national channel which is broadcast from Dhaka. This transmission is relayed to the whole country via local relay stations in major cities of the country. There is also a regional station located in Chittagong which broadcasts local programmes in the evening. In the mid-1990s the national TV channel started to broadcast the news programs of BBC and CNN. In 2004, BTV started worldwide broadcasts through its satellite based branch, BTV World.\n\nBTV is primarily financed through the television licence fees. Although it has produced many award-winning programmes, it has often been criticised for being the mouth-piece of the ruling government and their lack of quality entertaining programmes.\n\nBTV started its black-and-white transmission on 25 December 1964, as a pilot project in the then East Pakistan, airing a song by the singer Ferdausi Rahman. It began from the DIT Bhaban (present Rajuk Bhaban) on a four-hour basis. In 1972, after the independence of Bangladesh, the previously autonomous organisation was made a full-fledged government department. In 1975, the offices and studios were shifted to Rampura, Dhaka.\n\nBTV started colour transmission in 1980 through a programme named \"Desher Gaan\" produced by Selim Ashraf.

Myerson is the only Jewish woman to win the title. \n\nHer achievement, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, was seen as an affirmation of the Jewish place in American life. She was a hero to the Jewish community, where \"she was the most famous pretty girl since Queen Esther.\"\n\nMyerson made frequent television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s. She was a commissioner in the New York City government and served on presidential commissions from the 1960s through the 1980s, and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Her career in public service ended in the late 1980s when she was indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges. She was acquitted after a highly publicized trial.\n\nMyerson was born in The Bronx, New York to Louis Myerson and Bella (née Podell), who were Jewish immigrants from Russia. Myerson's father worked as a housepainter, handyman, and carpenter. After Myerson's birth, the family moved from the South Bronx to Shalom Aleichem Houses, a cooperative apartment complex in the northern Bronx. She had three siblings: a younger sister, Helen; an elder sister, Sylvia; and a brother, Joseph, who died at the age of three before Myerson was born.\n\nHer upbringing emphasized the importance of scholarship, not physical beauty. In addition to tradesmen, her neighbors included poets, writers, and artists. Myerson reached her adult height when she was 12, towered over other children, and has said she felt \"awkward and gawky\" during her preadolescence. Myerson recalled one of her worst childhood memories was playing the Popeye character, Olive Oyl, in an elementary school play.\n\nMyerson began studying piano when she was nine years old and was in the second class of New York's High School of Music and Art in 1937, graduating in 1941. She went on to Hunter College, graduating with honors in 1945 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in music. To support herself and her family while in college she gave piano lessons for fifty cents an hour, and worked as a music counselor at a girl's summer camp in Vermont.\n\nBy the time she was 21, Myerson was tall with \"luxuriant brown hair\". Myerson was entered into the Miss New York City competition, without her knowledge, by John C. Pape, a retired steel magnate and amateur photographer who had employed her as a model while she was in college. When Myerson was told about the pageant by her sister, Sylvia, who was acquainted with Pape, Myerson was angry as she felt that the beauty business was \"embarrassing.\" However, she was persuaded to compete by Sylvia, and she competed in the swimsuit competition using a borrowed bathing suit.\n\nMyerson went on to enjoy competing in the pageant, in which she stood out from the other contestants because of her height. She won on August 15, 1945, and moved on to the Miss America competition, partly motivated by the $5,000 scholarship awarded to the winner. She later told interviewers she wanted to buy a black Steinway grand piano with the scholarship money.\n\nMyerson was the Miss New York entry in the 1945 Miss America pageant, and she competed in the talent portion of the contest by performing the music of Edvard Grieg and George Gershwin. Prior to the competition she was pressured to use a pseudonym that \"sounded less Jewish.\" Myerson refused and was subjected to substantial antisemitism. After she won the title on September 8, 1945, three of the pageant's five sponsors withdrew from having her represent their companies as Miss America.\nWith the pageant scholarship money, she paid for graduate studies at Juilliard and Columbia University. An aspiring pianist, she briefly gave recitals on the vaudeville circuit before realizing audiences were more interested in seeing her in a bathing suit. She also played with the New York Philharmonic and appeared at Carnegie Hall.\n\nWhile Myerson was on her year-long tour as Miss America, she encountered \"No Jews\" signs posted in places such as hotels and country clubs. Such experiences led her to conduct lectures on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) entitled \"You Can't Be Beautiful and Hate\". Myerson became a vocal opponent of antisemitism and racism, and her speaking tour became the highlight of her Miss America reign.\n\nAt her death, the Religion News Service observed that at the time that she won the pageant, emaciated concentration camp survivors had only just shed their prison clothes. \"Bess Myerson represented the resurrection of the Jewish body—the journey from degradation to beauty.\" \n\nA few years after hearing her speak at an ADL function, television producer Walt Framer hired Myerson for the 1950s game show \"The Big Payoff\". She was the \"Lady in Mink\" modeling the grand prize mink coat, and introducing guests and prizes, throughout the 1951 to 1959 network run of the program. Recognized for her wit and hard work, as well as her beauty, in 1954 Myerson was a panelist on the game show \"The Name's the Same\" and from 1958 through 1967 a panelist on \"I've Got a Secret\". She regularly substituted for Dave Garroway on the \"Today Show\". She was also a host of the television broadcast of the Miss America pageant from 1954 to 1968.\n\nMyerson stepped down from her other commitments in 1969 when appointed by Mayor John V. Lindsay to become the first Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs. Her career as a commercial pitchwoman for a number of products throughout the 1950s and 1960s had led to her becoming a consultant to several consumer products companies. In her consumer affairs position, which she held until 1973, she became a pioneer in consumer protection law. She also served on several presidential commissions on violence, mental health, workplace issues, and hunger in the 1960s and 1970s. Throughout the late 1970s and the beginning of his mayoral ambitions, Myerson was a frequent public companion of then-Congressman Ed Koch and later chaired his successful 1977 campaign for New York City mayor.\n\nIn 1980, Myerson vied for the Democratic nomination in New York's U.S. Senate race against Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci, and Lindsay. Myerson lost to Holtzman by a slim margin. Holtzman was subsequently defeated by Al D'Amato, who had defeated incumbent Senator Jacob Javits in the Republican primary.\n\nIn 2002, Myerson appeared in the documentary film \"Miss America\" as a former Miss America interviewee.\n\nAfter assuming a prominent role in the Koch administration in 1983 as Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, her career became overshadowed by scandal. She became romantically involved with a married sewer contractor, Carl Andrew Capasso. It soon emerged that Hortense Gabel (the judge involved in Capasso's divorce case) had started socializing with Myerson. Judge Gabel's daughter (Sukhreet) was also hired by Myerson. After Gabel cut Capasso's child support payments, investigations began as to whether or not she had been bribed. In April 1987, after she invoked the Fifth Amendment, Myerson was forced to resign her position with the Koch administration. The scandal became known as the \"Bess Mess\".\n\nIndicted a year later by the office of then–U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, Myerson, Capasso, and Gabel were tried on federal charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, and using interstate facilities to violate state bribery laws, accused of conspiring to reduce Capasso's child support payments. With Sukhreet as the prosecution's chief witness, the main issue at the U.S. District Court trial was whether Myerson's decision to hire Sukhreet constituted bribery. After four months of trial proceedings, all three defendants were acquitted. Capasso was separately convicted of unrelated tax charges.\n\nIn October 1946, Myerson married Allan Wayne, a recently discharged U.S. Navy captain. They had one daughter, Barbara, born in 1948. The marriage was marred by domestic violence, and the couple divorced after eleven years. Myerson's second marriage was to attorney Arnold Grant, and he legally adopted her daughter in 1962. The couple divorced in the early 1970s. Daughter Barbara later became an actress, director, and screenwriter who is now known as Barra Grant.\n\nBefore her federal trial began, Myerson was arrested in May 1988 for shoplifting in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. She pleaded guilty to retail theft and was ordered to pay a fine.\n\nMyerson survived ovarian cancer in the 1970s and experienced a mild stroke in 1981, from which she made a full recovery. She moved to Florida in 2002, and later moved to California, where she remained until her death. Myerson donated funds to help build \"Bessie's Bistro\" at the Jewish Museum of Florida-FIU in memory of her parents Bella and Louis Myerson who lived in the neighborhood near the Museum. In 2013, she was reported to be suffering from dementia.\n\nMyerson died on December 14, 2014, in Santa Monica, California, at age 90. Her death was not publicly announced and was confirmed by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office three weeks after she died. Myerson was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica.\n\n"}

{"id": "5221861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5221861", "title": "Cinema of Bangladesh", "text": "Cinema of Bangladesh\n\nThe cinema of Bangladesh is the Bengali language film industry based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It has often been a significant film industry since the early 1970s and is frequently referred to as \"Dhallywood\" (), which is a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and Hollywood. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is melodramatic cinema, which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by the Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company, Picture House, was opened. A 1928 short silent film titled \"Sukumari\" (\"The Good Girl\") was the first Bengali-produced film in the region. The first full-length film, \"The Last Kiss\", was released in 1931. Following the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dhaka became the center of the Bangladeshi film industry, and has generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences for Dhallywood films. \"The Face and the Mask\", the first Bengali-language full-length feature film of Bangladesh was produced in 1956. During the 1970s, many Dhallywood films were inspired by Indian films, with some of the films being unofficial remakes of those films. The industry continued to grow, and many successful Bangladeshi films were produced throughout the 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.\n\nDirectors such as Fateh Lohani, Zahir Raihan, Alamgir Kabir, Khan Ataur Rahman, Subhash Dutta, Ritwik Ghatak, Ehtesham, Chashi Nazrul Islam, Abdullah al Mamun, Sheikh Niamat Ali, Gazi Mazharul Anwar, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Morshedul Islam, Humayun Ahmed, Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, Zahidur Rahim Anjan, Khijir Hayat Khan, Kamar Ahmed Saimon, Bijon Imtiaz, Amitabh Reza Chowdhury, Fakhrul Arefeen Khan, Giasuddin Selim, Nurul Alam Atik, Dipankar Sengupta Dipon and others have made significant contributions to Bangladeshi mainstream cinema, parallel cinema, and art films. Some have also won global acclaim.\n\nOn 28 December 1895, the Lumière brothers began commercial bioscope shows in Paris, with the first bioscope shows of the Indian subcontinent occurring the following year, including one in Calcutta and another at the Crown Theatre in Dhaka. The Bradford Bioscope Company of Calcutta arranged the show, which featured very short news items and other short features including footage of the jubilee of Queen Victoria, battles between Greek and Turkish forces, and the French underground railway. The price of a ticket to the show was an expensive eight anas to three taka. Bioscope shows continued to be shown throughout the region, inclding in Bhola, Manikganj, Gazipur, Rajbari, and Faridpur. These became the first films ever to be released in Bangladesh.\n\nThe first seeds of Bengali cinema were sown by Hiralal Sen, a native of Bogjuri who is considered a stalwart of Victorian era cinema. Sen founded a company named The Royal Bioscope Company in 1898, producing scenes from the stage productions of a number of popular shows at the Star Theater, Minerva Theater, and Classic Theater in Kolkata. He pioneered film-making in the Calcutta in 1901, and shot footage in his home region. This was the first filming of what is now the nation of Bangladesh.\n\nAt the time when Calcutta-based film production houses were forming, East Bengal cinema halls were showing films produced in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Hollywood, and Paris. Sequential bioscope shows were started in Dhaka in 1913–14 in a jute store. It was named Picture House, becoming the first theater to be built in present-day Bangladesh.\n\nThe Madan Theatre started making films in Calcutta in 1916. The first Bengali feature film, \"Billwamangal\", was produced and released in 1919 under the banner of the Madan Theatre. The movie was directed by Rustomji Dhotiwala and produced by Priyonath Ganguli, the son of a nawab estate of Dhaka. A Bengali film organization named the Indo British Film Co was soon formed in Calcutta under the ownership of Dhirendra Nath Ganguly, a relative of Rabindranath Tagore. Ganguly directed and wrote \"Bilat Ferat\" in 1921. The film was the first production of the Indo British Film Co. The Madan Theatre production of \"Jamai Shashthi\"(1931) was the first Bengali talkie directed by Amar Choudhury.\n\nIn 1927–28, the Dhaka nawab family produced a short film named \"Sukumari\" (The Good Girl). The film's producers included Khaza Adil, Khaza Akmol, Khaza Nasirulla, Khaza Azmol, Khaza Zohir, Khaza Azad, Soyod Shahebe Alom, and professor Andalib Shadini. They wanted to make a film with their own actors and without the help of a studio. The male lead was played by Khaza Nosrulla, and the female lead was played by a male actor named Soyod Abdus Sobhan owing to laws against the depiction of women in film. Nosrulla went on to become a politician and Sobhan became the first Bengali secretary of the Pakistan Central Civil Service. One still picture of \"Sukumary\" is kept in Bangladesh Film Archive.\n\nAfter the success of \"Sukumari\", the royal family went for a bigger venture. To make a full-length silent film, a temporary studio was made in the gardens of the family, and they produced a full-length silent film titled \"The Last Kiss\", released in 1931. The main actor was Khaza Azmol. The physical teacher of Jagannath College, Ambujgupta, directed the film and made the Bengali and English subtitles for it. Professor Andalib Shadani of the Dhaka University made the Urdu subtitles. \"The Last Kiss\" was released in the Mukul Hall of Dhaka. Historian Dr. Romesh Chondro Mojumder started the premier show of the film. The print of the film was taken to the Aurora Company of Calcutta for bigger presentation. The developers of the film wanted to make Dhaka unique in art, literature and cinema and named their production house “Dhaka East Bengal Cinematograph Society”. It was the first film-producing organization of Bangladesh.\n\nBy 1947, there were around 80 cinemas in Bangladesh.After the partition of India in 1947, there were efforts to turn Dhaka into East Bengal's cultural center, with various individuals like Abbasuddin Ahmed creating short-lived film production companies in the city. In March 1948, when the Governor-General of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnah came to visit East Pakistan, the radio broadcaster and filmmaker Nazir Ahmed was commissioned to create the informational film \"In Our Midst\" with the help of Calcutta-based film technicians. It was the first informational film of Bangladesh.\n\nTwo years after the creation of the Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the film-making company \"Co-operative Film Makers, Ltd.\" was formed in Dhaka under the leadership of Shohidul Alam, Abdul Jabbar Khan, and Kazi Nruzzaman. The company produced \"Salamot\" (1954) under the direction of Nazir Ahmed. The film was commercially successful and allowed the company to grow. In 1955, during the rule of the United Front, Chief Secretary N.M. Khan created a film studio and laboratory in Dhaka's Tejgaon Thana. The first full-length feature film with sound made in East Pakistan was \"The Face and the Mask\", which was directed by Abdul Jabbar Khan and released on 3 August 1956. Editing, printing and all other film processing for this movie were done in Lahore, Pakistan. Abdul Jabbar directed and starred in the film, which also starred Inam Ahmed, Purnima Sen, and Nazma.\n\"The East Pakistan Film Development Corporation Bill, 1957\", establishing a national film development corporation, was introduced by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh. The bill was passed in the East Bengal Provincial Assembly, and Nazir Ahmed was appointed as the first creative director.\n\nInitially, the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation allowed only specific directors to make films. Fateh Lohani directed the rural art film \"Asiya\", the first film produced by the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation, with Nazir Ahmed supervising the production. \"Asiya\" received the President Award for best Bangla film in 1961. Other early films released by the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation include \"Akash Ar Mati\" (\"The Sky and The Earth\"), a song film directed by Fateh Lohani in 1959.\n\nA. J. Kardar directed the Bengali-Urdu film \"The Day Shall Dawn\" in 1959, with Zahir Raihan working as the assistant director. The film was based on the 1936 Bengali novel \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (\"The Boatman on The River Padma\") by Bengali novelist Manik Bandopadhyay. It was an internationally acclaimed movie. The film was submitted as the Pakistani entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 32nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. It was also entered into the 1st Moscow International Film Festival, where it won a Golden Medal.\n\nThe establishment of the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation led to the growth of the East Bengal film industry and gave rise to three prominent studios: the Popular Studio, Bari Studio, and Bengal Studio. Prominent directors Abdul Jabbar Khan, Fateh Lohani, Ehtesham, and Mohiuddin worked with these studios. Notable films from these directors include \"Matir Pahar\" (\"The Clay Hill\") (1959) by Mohiuddin and \"E Desh Tomar Amar\" (1959) by Ehtesham. The East Pakistan Film Development Corporation's own films sometimes struggled to achieve financial success.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, 20-35 films were produced every year. Fateh Lohani's \"Asiya\" and Ehtesham's \"Rajdhanir Buke\" (\"In the heart of the capital\") were both positively reviewed by critics. In addition to directing, Lohani also acted in a number of East Bengali films throughout the 1960s, including \"Tanha\" (1964), \"Agun Niye Khela\" (1967) and \"Julekha\" (1967). Other notable directors of the 1960s include Salahuddin, who made a number of social drama films like \"Je Nodi Morupothe\" (1961), and Khan Ataur Rahman, who directed \"Nawab Sirajuddaula\" (1967). Rahman was also an actor and a singer, and featured in \"Kokhono Asheni\" (\"Never Came\") (1961), \"Kancher Deyal\" (\"Crystal Wall\") (1963).\n\nZahir Raihan was a star director of East Bengali cinema in the 1960s, and directed films like \"Kokhono Asheni\" (\"Never Came\") (1961), \"Shangam\" (1964) (The first Pakistani colour film), and \"Jibon Theke Neya\". \"Jibon Theke Neya\", a political satire based on the Bengali Language Movement under the rule of Pakistan, is considered a classic of Bangladeshi cinema.\n\nSome notable actors from the 1960s include Rahman, Sumita Devi, Khan Ataur Rahman, Rawshan Jamil, Anwar Hossain, Anwara Begum, Golam Mustafa, Abdur Razzak, Kabori Sarwar, Shabana, Farida Akhter Bobita, Farooque, Shabnam, Shawkat Akbar, Rosy Samad, Baby Zaman, and Kohinoor Akhter Shuchanda. The most well-known Bangladeshi actor to date had been Abdur Razzak, who was deemed the \"Nayok Raaj Rajjak\" (King of Heroes) by his fans. He started his career as a side actor in 1965 and became a leading actor in 1967. Abdur Razzak and Kabori Sarwar was the most popular pair from 1967 to the 1970s.\n\nA total of 41 films were released in 1970, including \"Shorolipi\" by Nazrul Islam, \"Taka Ana Paay\" and the \"Jibon Theke Neya\" by Zahir Raihan. \n\n\"Jibon Theke Neya\", considered a milestone film in the history of Bengali cinema, was a political satire based on the Bengali Language Movement under the rule of Pakistan. It stars Shaukat Akbar, Anwar Hossain, Khan Ataur Rahman, Rawshan Jamil, Abdur Razzak, Kohinoor Akhter Shuchanda, Amjad Hossain and Rosy Samad. The film has been described as an example of \"national cinema\", using discrete local traditions to build a representation of the Bangladeshi national identity. Other significant works of 1970 were \"Mishor Kumari\" of Karigir, \"Tansen\" of Rafiqul Bari, \"Bindu Theke Britto\" of Rebeka, \"Binimoy\" of Subhash Dutta, \"Kothay Jeno Dekhechi\" of Nizamul Hoque.\n\nOnly 6 Bengali films and two Urdu films made in East Bengal were released in 1971 before the Bangladesh Liberation War. Some notable social drama films include \"Nacher Putul\" by Ashok Ghosh, \"Sritituku Thak\" by Alamgir Kumkum, and \"Shukh Dukkho\" by Khan Ataur Rahman. \n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War, Raihan made the documentary \"Stop Genocide\" to draw attention to the plight of the people of East Bengal. It was one of the first internationally-acclaimed films of Bangladesh. \n\nIn December 1971, the \"East Pakistan Film Development Corporation\" changed its name to the \"Bangladesh Film Development Corporation\", which had the only major film studio and colour lab of the Bangladeshi film industry until the 2010s. Most Bangladeshi films were produced from this studio. Production quantity continued to increase after Bangladesh gained its independence; by the 1990s, over 90 films per year were released. At that time, the film department was under the leadership of Abdul Jabbar Khan. The Bangladeshi film industry was successful both critically and commercially through the first half of the 1990s. \n\nMany Bangladeshi movies of the 1970s were about the war. The first full-length feature film of independent Bangladesh was \"Ora Egaro Jon\" released in 1972. The movie was directed by Chashi Nazrul Islam. Other filmmakers who made critically acclaimed war films in the 1970s include Alamgir Kabir, Chashi Nazrul Islam, and Subhash Dutta. Three of Kabir's feature films are featured in the \"Top 10 Bangladeshi Films\" critics' choice list by the British Film Institute. His films include \"Dhire Bohe Meghna\" (1973), \"Shurjo Konya\" (1976), \"Shimana Periye\" (1977), \"Rupali Shoykte\" (1979), \"Mohona\" (1982), \"Porinita\" (1984) and \"Mohanayok\" (1985). Other notable directors in the 1970s include Narayan Ghosh Mita, Abdullah al Mamun, Johirul Haque, and Amjad Hossain. Haque's \"Rongbaaj\" was one of the first commercial action films of Bangladesh.\n\nAfter independence, one of the first international acclaimed film was \"A River Called Titas\" released in 1973, directed by prominent Indian Bengali director Ritwik Ghatak and starring Prabir Mitra in the lead role. \"Titash Ekti Nadir Naam\" topped the list of 10 best Bangladeshi films in the audience and critics' polls conducted by the British Film Institute in 2002. Some other notable films of 1970s include \"Joy Bangla\" (1972) of Fakrul Alom; \"Lalon Fokir\" (1972) of Syed Hasan Imam; \"Obhuj Mon\" (1972) of Kazi Jhohir; \"Shongram\" (1974) by Chashi Nazrul Islam, \"Arunodoyer Agnishakkhi\" (1972), \"Bashundhara\" (1977) by Subhash Dutta; \"Alor Michil\" (1974), \"Lathial\" (1975) by Narayan Ghosh Mita; \"Megher Onek Rong\" (1976) by Harunur Rashid; \"Golapi Ekhon Traine\" (1978) by Amjad Hossain; \"Sareng Bou\" (1978) by Abdullah al Mamun; \"Oshikkhito\" (1978) by Azizur Rahman; \"The Father\" (1979) by Kazi Hayat, and \"Surjo Dighal Bari\" (1979) by Sheikh Niamat Ali and Moshiuddin Shaker. \"Surjo Dighal Bari\" was a critically acclaimed movie and it re-introduced Bangladeshi films to the international audience. The movie was based on a novel of the same name by Abu Ishaque. In 1975, the government started a national film award, as well as a donation fund for creative films.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s were a golden era for Bangladeshi film industry commercially and critically. At this time, a lot of actors and actresses enjoyed popularity, including Abdur Razzak who was the most successful actor commercially during this period, as well as Kabori Sarwar, Shabana, Farida Akhter Bobita, Farooque, Shabnam, Kohinoor Akhter Shuchanda, Alamgir, Sohel Raana, Amol Bose, Bulbul Ahmed, Zafar Iqbal, Wasim, Ilias Kanchan, Jashim, Rozina, Parveen Sultana Diti, Champa and others.\n\nIn the 1980s most of the Bangladeshi commercial films were influenced in film-making, style and presentation by Indian movies, mostly Hindi movies from Maharashtra. But many of the films were original or adaptation from literary works. Some notable original and adapted films include, \"Chhutir Ghonta\" (1980) by Azizur Rahman; \"Emiler Goenda Bahini\" (1980) by Badal Rahman; \"Shokhi Tumi Kar\" (1980), \"Akhoni Shomoy\" (1980) by Abdullah Al Mamun; \"Lal Shobujer Pala\" (1980), \"Obichar\" (1985) by Syed Hasan Imam; \"Koshai\" (1980), \"Jonmo Theke Jolchi\" (1981), \"Bhat De\" (1984) by Amjad Hossain; \"Devdas\" (1982), \"Chandranath\" (1984), \"Shuvoda\" (1987) by Chashi Nazrul Islam; \"Smriti Tumi Bedona\" (1980) by Dilip Shom; \"Mohona\" (1982), \"Porinita\" (1986) by Alamgir Kabir; \"Boro Bhalo Lok Chhilo\" (1982) by Mohammad Mohiuddin; \"Puroshkar\" (1983) by C.B Zaman; \"Maan Shomman\" (1983) by A.J Mintu; \"Nazma\" (1983), \"Shokal-Shondha\" (1984), \"Fulshojja\" (1986) by Subhash Dutta; \"Rajbari\" (1984) by Kazi Hayat; \"Grihilokkhi\" (1984) by Kamal Ahmed; \"Dahan\" (1986) by Sheikh Niamat Ali; \"Shot Bhai\" (1985) by Abdur Razzak; \"Ramer Shumoti\" (1985) by Shahidul Amin; \"Rajlokkhi-Srikanto\" (1986) by Bulbul Ahmed; \"Harano Shur\" (1987) by Narayan Ghosh Mita; \"Dayi Ke\" (1987) by Aftab Khan Tulu; \"Tolpar\" (1988) by Kabir Anowar and \"Biraj Bou\" (1988) by Mohiuddin Faruk.\n\nThe parallel cinema movement was officially started from this decade, though there were many off-track movies were made of different genres from the 60s. But the 80s movies were strictly commercial influenced by Indian Hindi commercial films, so there was a necessity of a realism and naturalism cinema movement. The movement was started by Alamgir Kabir. From this movement some intellectual filmmakers came such as, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud and Morshedul Islam.\n\nIn the 1990s most of the Bangladeshi movies were dominate by mainstream commercial movies. There were many successful films produced in this time.\nIn 1990s, definition of Bangla mainstream commercial movies had changed, because most of the movies were very much influenced by commercial Indian Hindi movies and most of them were direct copies from those cheap Indian commercial Hindi films full with action, dance, song and jokes. In the 1990s some new directors and actors came to the industry. Intellectual Directors such as Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Morshedul Islam, Humayun Ahmed, Nasiruddin Yousuff, Akhtaruzzaman and Mustafizur Rahman made some critically and internationally acclaimed films at that time. Two of Tanvir Mokammel's feature films are featured in the \"Top 10 Bangladeshi Films\" list by British Film Institute's critics choice.\n\nMost successful male actors during this time was Alamgir, Jashim, Ilias Kanchan, Nayeem, Salman Shah. Other successful actors during this time included Manna who gained success through the film Danga (1991), Riaz (noted for Praner Cheye Priyo in 1997) and Omar Sani (noted for Coolie in 1997) among others.\n\nDuring the 2000s, most Bangladeshi films began doing poor business and Bangladesh produced about 100 low-budget movies a year. Viewership of Bangladeshi films in general dropped, and the industry was criticized for producing low-quality films whose only appeal was that of cheap melodrama.\n\nAfter a drastic decline in the 2000s, the Bangladeshi film industry tried to bounce back after 2006-07. With the help of the Bangladeshi Government and the emergence of big production companies, the Bangladeshi film industry started growing slowly.\n\nAmong the successful films that released in the 2000s are Monpura, Priya Amar Priya, Koti Takar Kabin, Chacchu, Khairun Sundori, Amar Praner Swami, Pitar Ason, Tumi Swapno Tumi Shadhona, Mone Prane Acho Tumi, Amar Shopno Tumi, Bolbo Kotha Bashor Ghore, among others. Most of the successful films during this period starred Shakib Khan followed by Manna. Moderately successful actors during this period included Ferdous Ahmed and Riaz.\n\nSince 2012, Bangladesh has developed several big production and distribution companies, such as Monsoon Films, Jaaz Multimedia and Tiger Media Limited and the films produced by them have been doing better business than others for their large budget and glamorous appearance. Four of the top ten highest grossing Bangladeshi films were released in the 2010s. In 2014 India's Reliance Entertainment Limited had expressed their interest in producing Bangladeshi films. However, the Bangladesh Film Corporation didn't respond due to the ban on Indian films in Bangladesh. Another notable film was released in the year 2010 named \" Jagoo \" directed by one of the prominent and young director named Khijir Hayat Khan. And \"Jaago\" is the first sports-based film in Bangla Cinema. Top actors during this period included Shakib Khan, as well as Ananta Jalil, Arifin Shuvo, Bappy Chowdhury, Symon Sadik, Jayed Khan.\n\nInternationally acclaimed Bangladeshi films include, Zahir Raihan's \"Stop Genocide\" (1971); Ritwik Ghatak's \"A river called Titas\" (1973); Sheikh Niamat Ali and Moshiuddin Shaker's \"Surjo Dighal Bari\" (1979); Tareque Masud's \"Song of Freedom\" (1995), \"Story of Freedom\" (1999) and \"The Clay Bird\" (2002); Tanvir Mokammel's \"Quiet Flows the River Chitra\" (1999), \"Lalsalu\" (2001) and \"Lalon\" (2004); Abu Sayeed's \"kittonkhola\" (2000), \"Shankhonad\" (2004), \"Rupantor\" (2008); Kamar Ahmed Saimon's \"Are You Listening!\" (2012); Humayun Ahmed's \"Aguner Poroshmoni\" (1994) and \"Shyamol Chhaya\" (2004); Morshedul Islam's \"Dipu Number Two\" (1996), \"Duratta\" (2004) and \"Amar Bondhu Rashed\" (2011); Enamul Karim Nirjhar's \"Aha!\" (2007); Golam Rabbany Biplob's \"On the Wings of Dreams\" (2007); Giashuddin Selim's \"Monpura\" (2009); Mostofa Sarwar Farooki's \"Third Person Singular Number\" (2009), \"Television\" (2013) and \"\"; Tauquir Ahmed's \"Joyjatra\" (2004) and \"Oggyatonama\" (2016); Bijon Imtiaz's \"Matir Projar Deshe-Kingdom of Clay Subjects\" (2016), Amitabh Reza Chowdhury's \"Aynabaji\" (2016) etc. These films won highly international acclaims and they introduced Bangladeshi films to a wide international audiences. The late Tareque Masud is regarded as one of Bangladesh's outstanding directors due to his numerous productions on historical and social issues. Masud was honored by FIPRESCI at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 for his film \"The Clay Bird\" (2002).\n\nThe government of Bangladesh played a huge role in the re-emergence of Bangladeshi films. The Bangladesh Film Development Corporation was established as an assistance hub for Bangladeshi cinema. The government also spends about $1 million annually for the development of Bangladeshi parallel cinema and art cinema. Bangladesh Awami League, the present government has spend more than $10 million in 2012 and 2014–15 for the modern technical supports in Bangladeshi cinema.\n\nThere are more than 100 production houses in the Bangladeshi film industry, but few have managed to be successful in the market. Such production houses and distribution houses have helped Bangladeshi movies to reach a national and international platform, releasing films and distributing them to audiences overseas. Some well-known production houses in the Bangladeshi cinema include, Impress Telefilm Ltd., Monsoon Films, Jaaz Multimedia, Tiger Media Limited, The Abhi Pictures, Fatman Films and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "915354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=915354", "title": "Concertmaster", "text": "Concertmaster\n\nThe concertmaster (from the German Konzertmeister) in the U.S. and Canada is the leader of the first violin section in an orchestra (or clarinet in a concert band) and the instrument-playing leader of the orchestra. After the conductor, the concertmaster is the second-most significant leader in an orchestra, symphonic band or other musical ensemble. Another common term in the U.S. is \"First Chair.\" In the U.K., Australia and elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the term commonly used is \"leader.\"\n\nIn an orchestra, the concertmaster is the leader of the first violin section. There is another violin section, the second violins, led by the principal second violin. Any violin solo in an orchestral work is played by the concertmaster (except in the case of a concerto, in which case a guest soloist usually plays). It is usually required that the concertmaster be the most skilled musician in the section, experienced at learning music quickly, counting rests accurately and leading the rest of the string section by their playing and bow gestures.\n\nThe concertmaster sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience, in what is called the \"first chair,\" \"first [music] stand\" or outside of the US \"first desk.\" (In one instance, Ferdinand David had been concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra since Felix Mendelssohn became conductor in 1835. In 1847, Joseph Joachim joined David on the first desk.) The concertmaster makes decisions regarding bowing and other technical details of violin playing for the violins, and sometimes all of the string players. They lead the orchestra in tuning before concerts and rehearsals, and other technical aspects of orchestra management. Leading the orchestral tuning is not a mere formality; if the concertmaster believes that a section is not adequately tuned, they will signal to the oboe player to play another \"A.\" Several larger orchestras have one or more assistant concertmasters, who lead the orchestra in the concertmaster's absence.\n\nThe concertmaster, along with the conductor and section principals, will normally participate in the auditions of important musicians (e.g., principal players) in the orchestra.\n\nIn a standard concert band, the concertmaster is the principal clarinet, oboe, or flute and leads the ensemble's tuning. The first-chair clarinet concertmaster will, in common practice, play all solos for their instrument. Often the lead flautist will receive similar responsibilities to the clarinet concertmaster, depending on several factors such as age, skill and time spent in the ensemble. The concertmaster will, in both orchestral and wind band settings, also coordinate with other principals and section leaders, in most cases being their senior in terms of group pecking order.\n\nIn brass bands, the role of concertmaster is often filled by the principal solo cornet or trumpet.\n\nThe duties and tasks of the concertmaster are myriad. Primarily, they act as the conduit between conductor and orchestra and are accountable to both parties.\n\nOne of the principal tasks of the concertmaster is to provide bowings for the 1st violins prior to rehearsal. This entails a great knowledge of historical playing styles in addition to complete idiomatic understanding of the mechanics of string playing. Section leaders among the other strings will base their bowings on those of the concertmaster and these section leaders (called principals) may confer during rehearsal in order to ensure unity and cohesion of execution between the string sections. Ensemble cohesion emanates directly from the contact and connection between these vital front desk positions. The concertmaster assumes responsibility for the tone and execution of the entire section of 1st violins, in addition to performing any solo passages that occur in a given piece.\n\nAnother primary duty of the concertmaster is to translate instructions from the conductor into specific technical language for the strings. Some conductors prefer to speak more broadly and defer to the concertmaster on such matters out of respect for the musicians who are expert specialists while the conductor is, often (unless he or she is a string player), a generalist.\n\nFull-time professional orchestras work with several conductors through the course of a regular season. Accordingly, while the conductor may change week to week or month to month, the concertmaster lends a sense of stable and constant leadership day to day. While the impetus for the orchestra to play is given by the conductor's gestures, oftentimes for reasons of precision, the orchestra will actually follow the bow of the concertmaster as their cue to play. This is because the conductor's gestures exist in the abstract whereas the concertmaster produces sound along with their fellow musicians. Further, the idiosyncratic technique of some conductors can make it difficult for the orchestra to enter together. Yet another duty of the concertmaster is to maintain a sense of decorum during rehearsals by setting a personal example and by monitoring the room to ensure all members of the orchestra are being cooperative. It is more appropriate for the concertmaster to ask for quiet if there is a bit of chatter than it is for a guest conductor unfamiliar with the orchestra. \nIn performances given in America and/or featuring American or British orchestras, the concertmaster will usually walk onstage individually after the rest of the orchestra is seated, and bow and receive applause before the conductor appears. In continental European orchestras, this practice is uncommon. There, the concertmaster usually walks onstage with the rest of the orchestra. As the representative of the orchestra, the concertmaster will usually shake hands with the conductor at the beginning or end of a concert as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1267530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1267530", "title": "Cueca", "text": "Cueca\n\nCueca () is a family of musical styles and associated dances from Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. In Chile, the cueca holds the status of national dance, where it was officially selected on September 18, 1979.\n\nWhile cueca's origins are not clearly defined, it is considered to have mostly European Spanish and arguably indigenous influences. The most widespread version of its origins relates it with the zamacueca which arose in Peru as a variation of Spanish Fandango dancing with \"criollo\". The dance is then thought to have passed to Chile and Bolivia, where its name was shortened and where it continued to evolve. Due to the dance's popularity in the region, the Peruvian evolution of the zamacueca was nicknamed \"la chilena\", \"the Chilean\", due to similarities between the dances. Later, after the Pacific War, the term marinera, in honor of Peru's naval combatants and because of hostile attitude towards Chile, was used in place of \"la chilena.\" In March 1879 the writer and musician Abelardo Gamarra renamed the “chilena” as the “marinera”. The Marinera, Zamba and the Cueca styles are distinct from each other and from their root dance, the zamacueca.\n\nAnother theory is that Cueca originated in the early 19th century bordellos of South America, as a \"pas de deux\" facilitating partner finding.\n\nThe usual interpretation of this courting dance is zoomorphic: it tries to reenact the courting ritual of a rooster and a hen. The male displays a quite enthusiastic and at times even aggressive attitude while attempting to court the female, who is elusive, defensive and demure. The dance often finishes with the man kneeling on one knee, with the woman placing her foot triumphantly on his raised knee.\n\nIn Bolivia, there are many variations throughout the different regions. Cueca styles of La Paz, Potosí and Sucre are the elegant and static versions, whereas in Cochabamba and Tarija the style is much livelier and free. The same could be said with the music where in different regions rhythm and speed slightly differ amongst the regions. While dancing, handkerchiefs are used by both male and female dancers by twirling over the head. It is said the twirling of the handkerchief is a way to lure the woman.\n\nIn Chile the cueca was developed and spread in the bars and taverns, which in the 19th century were popular centers of entertainment and parties. During Fred Warpole’s stay in Chile between 1844 and 1848 he described some of the characteristics of the dance: guitar or harp accompaniment, drumming of hands or a tambourine to keep the rhythm, high pitched singing and a unique strumming pattern, where the guitarist strums all of the strings, returning each time with a slap on the guitar body.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century the cueca was spread to diverse Latin American countries and the dance was known simply as the \"chilena\" (Chilean). In Argentina the dance was first introduced in Cuyo, which is in the central west of the country close to the border with Chile; there is documented presence of the cueca in this region in approximately 1840. Unlike in the northeast and central west of Argentina in Buenos Aires the dance was known as the \"cueca\" instead of the \"chilena\" and there is documentation of the cueca being present in Buenos Aires as early as the 1850s. Similarly to the majority of Argentina the cueca was known as the \"chilena\" in Bolivia as well. Chilean sailors and adventurers spread the cueca to the coast of Mexico in the cities of Guerrero and Oaxaca, where the dance was also known as the \"chilena\". In Peru the dance transformed into one of the most popular dances during the 1860s and 1870s and was also known as the “chilena”.\n\nDuring the 20th century the cueca was associated with the common man in Chile and through them the dance was spread to the pre-industrialized urban areas where it was adopted by neighborhoods like La Vega, Estación and Matadero, which at the time were located on the outskirts of the city of Santiago.\n\nThe cueca was named the national dance of Chile due to its substantial presence throughout the history of the country and announced as such through a public decree in the Official Journal (Diario Oficial) on November 6, 1979.\n\nThe clothing worn during the cueca dance is the traditional Chilean clothes. They wear blue, white, red or black costumes and dresses. The men in the dance wear the huaso's hat, shirts, flannel poncho, riding pants and boots, short jacket, riding boots, and spurs. Women wear flowered dresses. Cueca dancing resembles a rooster-chicken relationship. The man approaches the woman and offers his arm, then the women accompanies him and they walk around the room. They then face each other and hold their handkerchief in the air, and begin to dance. They never touch, but still maintain contact through facial expressions and movements. During the dance, the pair must wave the white handkerchief.\n\nThe basic structure of the cueca is that it is a compound meter in or and is divided into three sections.\n\nSome differences can be noticed depending on geographical location. There are three distinct variants in addition to the traditional cueca:\n\n\nCurrently, the cueca is mainly danced in the countryside, and performed throughout Chile each year during the national holidays in September 18 eve. Cueca tournaments are popular around that time of year.\n\nIn Bolivia, there are lots of different Cueca styles according to the region: Cueca Paceña, Cueca Cochabambina, Cueca Chuquisaqueña, Cueca Tarijeña, Cueca Potosina y Cueca Chaqueña. What they have in common is their rhythm, but they differ quite a lot in velocity, costumes and style. The Cueca styles of La Paz, Potosí and Sucre are the elegant ones, whereas in Cochabamba and Tarija the style is much more lively.In Bolivia, it is usually called \"Cuequita Boliviana\"\n\nIn Argentina, there are many ways of dancing Cueca. Cueca is mostly danced in the northern and western Argentine provinces of Mendoza, Chaco, Salta, Jujuy, Catamarca, La Rioja etc. Each Argentine province has its own style and way of dancing Cueca.\n\nTarija, Bolivia, has a few traditional songs which are accompanied by dances. One of which is the Cueca Tarijena. Although it may have the same name as the dances in the other departments, such as Cueca Pacena which represents La Paz, each department’s dance varies significantly. My hometown’s is known for being the most upbeat, fun, and playful in comparison to the others which are more tranquil. Additionally, we were the first place to incorporate a violin into our song, thus giving it more flare and excitement. The Cueca, since its origin, has been a source of happiness for the dancers because the music is generally lively and the dances require partners to be excited about dancing with each other.\n\nThe interesting thing about Cueca is that it is danced with a hanker chief, and this is how one shows affection for others. Everyone begins the dance with the hanker chief in their right hand and twirls it in circles near their shoulder and then proceeds to waive it by the left side of their waist during certain beats. During the entirety of the dance, the man is attempting to “win over” his partner by showing his dancing talents. The dance demonstrates how Bolivian gender roles remain quite male-dominated. Throughout most the dance, the women simply sway their hips side to side, whereas the men turn in circles and do more complicated movements. This dance is designed for women to show off their beauty and men to demonstrate their talent. The women always follow the male lead because when they are facing each other, it is up to him to decide if he’d like to flirt with his partner by putting his hanker chief near her neck and shoulders, if he’d like to hold the hanker chief behind her neck holding it with both hands, or if he doesn’t want to flirt with her, he will simply continue waiving his hanker chief near his shoulder and waist. This is the determining factor to see if they will dance together in the next part of the song, or if they would need to find other partners. Although we’re in 2018 and most places are working towards equality between women and men, this dance represents how my hometown remains traditional by letting the man choose if he likes his partner with the woman having no say about how she feels. \n\n\n"}

It was previously known as Fox Kids, then Jetix. There are several variations of the channel which broadcast simultaneously in seven languages (using DVB audio technology): Romanian, English, Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Russian. Advertising is shown in Romanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Czech, and Russian.\n\nDisney Channel Central Europe is broadcast in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nDisney Channel Eastern is broadcast in Romania and Bulgaria and has different programming to Disney Central Europe, other variations of Disney Channel were also broadcast in many other regions including ex-Yugoslav countries and formerly Ukraine.\n\n\nOn August 11, 2008 Jetix started broadcasting a block of \"Disney Stars\" in Romania and Bulgaria, featuring the series \"Kim Possible\", \"Phineas and Ferb\", \"\" and \"Hannah Montana\". \"High School Musical\" aired on August 22, 2008 and \"High School Musical 2\" aired on November 1, 2008. It was fully dubbed into Romanian, and an old Bulgarian translation of \"Kim Possible\" (once aired on BNT Channel 1) was made available on October 20, 2008. \"High School Musical 2\" was also dubbed. Subsequently, \"Phineas and Ferb\" and \"American Dragon\" were also dubbed by Media Link using voice-over dubbing (unlike all pre-2005 Disney cartoon series, which were all dubbed with synchronized voices). This way of dubbing is very common in Bulgarian television, because it costs less and takes less time to produce (as the voices of actors are just placed directly over a quieted original voice track). Usually, only theatrically or home video-released animated films are dubbed with synchronized voices, and in the 1990s only Disney's animated series were dubbed this way for television. Only starting in 2008, Disney allowed Bulgarian broadcasters to dub films themselves, and all of them were using voice-over dubbing.\n\nAfter Disney XD successfully launched on February 13, 2009 in the US, it was expected to be rolled out to European territories in 2009. Later, however, Disney announced that the Jetix channel in certain countries (Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Bulgaria and Israel) will be renamed to Disney Channel, marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. The change took place on September 19, 2009 in the CEE region. Disney Channel Romania & Bulgaria are broadcast as a single video feed with two audio channels and there is also a Russian audio channel.\n\nOn September 19, 2009, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. But the Russian feed was still broadcasting under the Jetix name until it was announced that a separate Disney Channel would launch. After the launch of Disney Channel in Romania and Bulgaria, the Jetix feed in Russia began to be independent and got localized, with Russian titlecards and banners with Russian hours\n\nOn August 10, 2010, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in CIS.\n\nOn October 16, 2010, Disney Channel CEE launched a Ukrainian audio for audience in Ukraine, which was deleted on 1 January 2013 for unknown reasons.\n\n\nOn the Romanian and Bulgarian version of Disney Channel, at the commercial break ident it shows just the Romanian word for \"commercials\": RECLAME, without the Bulgarian word, like on Jetix, where it showed first \"RECLAME\", then \"РЕКЛАМА\".\n\nDisney Channel is broadcast in Romania by all cable TV and DTH operators. The Romanian version of the channel is also included in the list of channels of various Moldovan cable operators as well as in the basic package of the digital platform \"Digi TV\" in Serbia and Croatia.\n\nDisney Channel Romania is broadcast in 24/7 mode by all cable and satellite TV operators .\nFox Kids, then Jetix, and now Disney Channel have been available in all cable operators in Bulgaria since around 1999 and were mostly broadcast with either the Russian or English language audio track. In October 2007, a Bulgarian audio track was added to for some of the shows on Jetix. Jetix was previously shown in Bulgaria on bTV, which continued to air a Jetix block even after Fox Kids was sold to Disney. Translation and distribution for the channel's Bulgarian version was handled by Media Link. It was expected that the channel would reach 100% translation of its shows in 2008. However, this was achieved only in early 2009, with many shows being withheld from broadcast after February 2009 until translation of their episodes was completed. In May and June many such programs were returned to the channel, since translation had advanced a lot. \"Hannah Montana\" was the only untranslated show, but it was available in Bulgarian on BNT 1 since March 28, 2009. Promos aired in English and not in Bulgarian.\n\nJetix in Russia was based on this channel, but all things related to Disney were automatically replaced with Jetix promos. Certain shows which then did not air on the regular Jetix CEE (\"W.I.T.C.H.\", \"Iggy Arbuckle\") were part of the hour-and-a-half long programming block that replaced the Disney block. When Jetix CEE was changed to Disney Channel, the Russian language transmission ceased. Jetix Russia continued to exist as a separate channel til August 10, 2010.\n\nPlayhouse Disney was launched the same day as Disney Channel as a block. In 2010, Playhouse Disney was launched as a channel, replacing Jetix Play. In June 2011, Playhouse Disney was replaced by Disney Junior.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10197311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10197311", "title": "Eric Morley", "text": "Eric Morley\n\nEric Douglas Morley (26 September 1918 – 9 November 2000) was a British TV host and the founder of the Miss World pageant and \"Come Dancing\" TV programme. His widow, Julia Morley, is now head of the pageant and his son Steve Douglas is one of its presenters.\n\nMorley was born in Holborn, London, England. He claimed that his father \"was at Oxford and spoke nine languages\" but he died young. Morely was 11 when his mother and stepfather died of tuberculosis. He attended Whitstable Grammar School in Kent. London County Council sent him to the Royal Navy training ship HMS Exmouth, which was moored at Grays. Here, he broke bars of chocolate to sell to his peers. He joined the Royal Fusiliers at 14 and played french horn in the band. During the war he became a captain in the Royal Army Service Corps, organising entertainment for the troops and fighting in Dunkirk.\n\nMorley started his career in the entertainment business in 1945 when he resigned his commission to manage a travelling show in Scotland, and then, in 1946, joined the Mecca organisation as a publicity manager. In 1949, he was able to introduce ballroom dancing onto BBC television through the \"Come Dancing\" programme, encouraging viewers to visit Mecca's dance halls. His family is now beneficial of Dancing with the Stars franchise globally.\n\nIn 1952, he was Mecca's general manager of dancing, and was made a director in 1953. With Mecca, Morley helped to populise bingo which was played at Mecca venues throughout the United Kingdom. He changed the company from a small catering and dancing firm into a leading entertainment and catering company in the UK. It employed 15,000 people and covered dance halls, catering, bingo, gambling, ice-skating rinks, bowling alleys, discos and several restaurants. The company also provided catering and entertainment services for several of the biggest football clubs in London; Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nIn 1978, he left Mecca after a disagreement with the then parent company, Grand Metropolitan, becoming chairman of the Belhaven Brewery company in Scotland.\n\nMorley was a confirmed supporter of Margaret Thatcher and also had political ambition. A resident of Herne Hill, he nearly won in the 1979 general election, reducing the 7,500 majority of Labour's Sam Silkin to a mere 122 in Dulwich, south London, having previously stood in the October 1974 election, where the Conservative vote fell by 2.1%.\n\nMorley had adapted the seaside beauty contest into fashion shows at Mecca dance halls; he developed this into a national beauty pageant and a TV concept. 'Miss Festival of Britain' began in 1951 as a promotional tool for Mecca and once international contestants arrived in London for the event, the press dubbed it 'Miss World', initially holding the competitions in Mecca halls. The first competition coincided with the Festival of Britain. When an American rival Miss Universe contest was launched, Morley turned Miss World into an annual event held every November, initially at the Mecca owned Lyceum Theatre and later in the Royal Albert Hall. It was first televised in 1959, and became a popular fixture with Morley's announcement of: \"I shall announce the result of Miss World, in reverse order\".\n\nThe pageant was watched by 27.5 million in Britain at its peak in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, flour bombs were thrown at the compere, Bob Hope, by protestors. Morley answered his critics saying, \"If it is shameful to women, then the best thing they can do is turn it off\". The competition raised more than £30 million for charity. In 1983 he floated Miss World Group on the Unlisted Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange, keeping a 51 per cent stake. To counter feminist critics of the show, he tried to reduce the emphasis on the bathing-costume round and emphasise the girls' other attributes by drawing attention to their \"poise, personality, talent, figure, facial beauty, deportment, ability to be interviewed and so forth\". Although the terrestrial TV channels no longer broadcast the show in Britain, it remains popular worldwide, and in 1997 was capable of attracting a TV audience of 2.5 billion across 155 countries.\n\nThe competition—and its related events such as Miss United Kingdom, Miss England and Miss Scotland—could generate great earnings and Morley controversially acted as agent to the winners, keeping them under tight supervision. On one occasion (Miss World 1973) he dethroned the winner who he thought had acted improperly. At the Miss World 1979, Venezuelan contestant Tatiana Capote, popped out of her swimsuit during a preview of the final judging. Morley hastily adjusted her swimsuit.\n\nMorley had married his wife Julia in 1960 after meeting at a dance hall. In 1968, she took over the day-to-day running of Miss World and, following Morley's death in 2000, became chairman of the pageant.\n\nAt the age of 63, Morley completed the London Marathon despite a damaged hamstring, and supported both the Variety Club of Great Britain and Variety Clubs International, the latter as president in 1978.\nOn 9 November 2000, the day after the contestants first paraded at the Millennium Dome in preparation for the 2000 Miss World finals, he had a heart attack and died in the Princess Grace Hospital, west London. A service of thanksgiving was held in the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh being represented. He left an estate valued at £10.6 million, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery, London.\n\n"}

CE 50) was written around CE 30 or 31. It is a collection of approximately a thousand short stories that Valerius wrote during the reign of Tiberius (42 BCE – CE 37). The stories are a variety of anecdotes illustrating how the ancient Romans lived. While the majority of the stories are of Roman life, he does have some foreign stories at the end of some chapters. Most of these are of Greek life and most of those are about Greek philosophers or famous kings.\n\nSeveral of the stories relate to moral subjects that parallel those in the Old Testament and New Testament. Valerius refers to his moral stories as \"examples\" that were to be used as moral guidance. Valerius' work on the preservation of moral values of the Roman Republic of the past was widely popular through the Age of Enlightenment, a literary life-span of some 1,700 years. People read Valerius' work for practical guidance in their everyday tasks for living a moral life. This work was especially used as a reference by writers and professional orators.\n\nIt is estimated that Valerius's work on these nine books took over a decade. He obtained material from Cicero, and from Livy, Sallust, Pompeius Trogus, Marcus Terentius Varro and other ancient historians. Each of the nine books has several chapters. Each chapter is outlined and grouped thematically and contains several stories illustrating that theme. This work is the earliest known use of a hierarchical organization system for topics of a book. There are a total of 91 chapters covering a wide variety of subjects drawn from Roman life. Valerius arranges his chapters focused on particular virtues, moral and immoral habits, religious practices, superstitions and ancient traditions. There is a thematic guide at the end of the work.\n\nOne example of Valerius' balanced subject themes covered is where he writes stories about omens. He notes that the observations of omens had a connection to religion in ancient Rome since many people of that time believed that omens were from divine providence. Valerius records that omens had played an important role when Rome had been demolished by the Gauls in 390 BCE. The Senate was debating whether they should then move Rome to Veii or rebuild the city walls. While they were deciding some cohorts had just returned from guard duty. Their centurion then just happened to shout in the assembly place, \"Standard-bearer, set up the standard; this is the best place for us to stay.\" The city was rebuilt in the same place then, since they interpreted these words as an omen.\n\nOne of the subject themes that Valerius wrote about was the superstition of auspices in Book 1 Chapter 4. Auspices means \"bird observations.\" It is from the Latin words of \"avis\" (bird) and \"spicere\" (to sight or watch). Before doing anything of great importance, the Romans would \"take the auspices\" in order to determine what the gods approved. This was an examination of the behavior of birds in flight or eating. It was interpreted by an augur as to the will of the gods from this behavior.\n\nA Roman story that Valerius writes about is the founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus. He records that the founding of the city was based on the auspices. Remus was the first to \"take the auspices\" by seeing six vultures. Romulus later however saw twelve vultures. Romulus claimed he had a stronger claim because he saw a larger quantity, even though Remus was the first to spot vultures.\n\nAnother \"foreign\" story Valerius writes on this theme for a comparison is on the founding of the city of Alexandria in Egypt. It was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE. The architect was Deinocrates. He records that when Deinocrates was going to design a great city in Egypt, he had no chalk to use for writing. Instead he used a large quantity of barley, and drew out the plans on the ground. A group of birds then came from a nearby lake and ate the barley. The Egyptian augur interpreted this to mean that there would be plenty of food for a large city there.\n\nValerius writes on the theme of modesty in Book 4 Chapter 5 about the fact that there was no separate seating for the Conscript Fathers (Roman Senators) at the theater. This was from the beginnings of Rome in the 8th century BCE until the time of the consulship of Scipio Africanus and Tiberius Sempronius Longus in 194 BCE. In spite of this no member of the plebs ever sat in front of the Conscript Fathers. Their respect for this tradition was also shown when one day Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was to stand in the very back of the theater. He was placed there because he had been removed from the Roman Senate by Cato the Censor and Lucius Valerius Flaccus. Flamininus already held the office of consul and was the brother of Titus Flamininus (consul 192 BCE), who had defeated Philip V of Macedon in 197 BCE. In spite of this he still was forced to go to the back of the theater by Cato the Elder. Out of respect however, the entire audience moved Flamininus to the very front so that nobody was in front of him.\n\nValerius illustrates another story of modesty when he writes of Gaius Terentius Varro. Varro devastated the Roman Republic when he started the Battle of Cannae, one of the worst battles of recorded history. His sense of shame would not allow him to accept dictatorship, even though it was offered to him. The people of the Republic attributed the great loss to the anger of the gods. On the inscription under his death mask shows his good character which brought him more honor that most men receive from the dictatorship position itself.\n\nValerius records another story of modesty where king Hiero II of Syracuse hears of the disastrous defeat of the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene. He immediately sends as a gift to Rome 70,000 bushels of wheat, 50,000 bushels of barley, and 240 pounds of gold. So that the gold was accepted and not returned he presented it in the form of a statue of victory. This was so the Roman people would accept it on religious grounds.\n\nAnother example of Valerius' themes is where he writes stories about Roman parents and the affection they had toward their children. A story in Book 4 Chapter 4 on \"Poverty\" is about the Gracchus brothers, Gaius Gracchus and his younger brother Tiberius Gracchus. The story relates how one day Cornelia Africana, their mother (daughter of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus), was pestered by a lady guest that was showing off her elegant jewellery. Cornelia patiently endured this lady until her sons came home from school. Then, introducing them to this lady, she proclaimed proudly, \"These are my jewels.\"\n\nAnother example in Book 8 Chapter 8 is about the philosopher Socrates. He writes of him showing an intimate side which did not distract from his stature because, as Valerius puts it, \"no part of wisdom was hidden from him.\" He tells how Socrates one time made a hobbyhorse out of reed for his sons. He would then play with the hobbyhorse with them showing Socrates' personal parental side.\n\nValerius writes many stories of other Roman fathers which generally are contrary to the stereotypical image of being brutal and harsh. Some of these examples are in Book 5 Chapter 7 titled \"The Love and Indulgence of Parents towards Their Children.\" He writes that the real fathers are the ones that are benignly permissive and show indulgence. He reports with delight that this kind of father could be found in the streets of Rome and that these fathers \"were as gentle as fathers in a comedy.\" He does, however, describe in Book 5 Chapter 8 \"Fathers who were severe with their children\" some all-powerful Roman abusive fathers as being tyrannical patriarchs killing and murdering others including of their own blood. He clearly reports these that are extremely strict and severe as no longer in the role of being a loving father.\n\nValerius writes of Lucius Junius Brutus, who killed his sons for failing in their military duties, \"He left the role of a father so that he could play the part of a consul.\" Other examples of these role changes can be found in Book 6. In Chapter 1.5 where Valerius tells the story of Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus, Eburnus had carried out the highest public offices with great splendor and finished off his career with much dignity; however, he had his son punished for a chastity that was dubious. In Chapter 1.6 Valerius writes about Publius Atilius Philiscus who was abused as a child. When he became an adult, Philiscus became a strict father on chastity. Learning of his daughter's premarital sex, he murdered her.\n\nValerius writes of Roman women being generally in seclusion. He reports in Book 6 on \"Chastity\" the stereotypical woman as being well-behaved and who would rather face death than dishonor. One story is of Lucretia in Book 6 Chapter 1.1. He writes that she was violently forced to have sex with Sextus Tarquinius, the son of King Tarquin the Proud. Lucretia could not bear the disgrace and committed suicide. Another example is about Hippo, a Greek woman. She committed suicide rather than being raped by drunken sailors. Valerius even writes in Book 2, Chapter 6.14, of suttee being an admired practice model for all women to follow in his day.\n\nValerius writes about homosexuality, which was an unusual category for that time period of writers. This aspect of private life was kept under wraps. The only relationship along these lines that was tolerated by law was that between a master and a slave. Valerius, however, does report on male homosexuality in the Roman army and the upper class. He does not report on female homosexuality nor \"gay women\" as some writers did at the time.\n\nIn the stories of the Roman army, Valerius always records high-ranking military personnel taking advantage of their position. In Book 6 Chapter 1.10 Valerius tells the story of Gaius Cornelius. He was rewarded four times by his superiors to be the senior centurion of his legion. However Gaius Pescennius, a \"triumvir capitalis\" (prison manager) in CE 149, had Cornelius thrown in jail and shackled in irons for having sexual relations with a young boy of free birth. Cornelius did not deny the charges and was prepared to make a \"sponsio\" (legal guarantee). In so doing, Cornelius was making a statement and putting down a sum of money as a guarantee of truth. If the guaranteed statement was found to be false, the young boy was to be paid this amount. His statement was to say that the boy openly and willingly sold his body for cash. The tribunes refused to allow this, since they thought soldiers of the Roman Republic should not make deals in which they could pay for pleasures at home by facing dangers overseas. Cornelius spent the rest of his life in prison.\n\nIn Book 6 Chapter 1.11 Valerius tells the story of Marcus Laetorius Mergus. Cominius and a tribune of the plebs summoned Mergus, a high-ranking military career person, before the people because of sexual relations with young men and women outside his marriage. He was prosecuted and sent to prison.\n\nIn Book 6 Chapter 1.12 Valerius tells the story of Chiomara. Chiomara was the wife of Ortiagon. During the Galatian War with Rome of 189 BC, Gnaeus Manlius Vulso was victorious in a campaign against the Galatian Gauls. One of his centurions was put in charge of a group of captives including Chiomara. The centurion made sexual advances towards her and she rejected him. Under violence and force he raped her. The centurion then offered, to assuage his shame, to ransom her back to her relatives. When he received his ransom and was counting the gold pieces, Chiomara secretly indicated to her relatives to murder him and cut off his head. She later presented the head of the centurion to her husband.\n\nThe political views of ordinary Romans basically were not written on by most ancient writers. Valerius, however, did write about the grassroots customs of Rome as a democratic society. He points out that the poorer Romans had goals as to where they wanted to ultimately be and in what direction they wanted to go.\n\nOne example of how political views were looked upon in his days is where he writes a story on Sextus Titus, who kept a picture in his residence of a murdered radical called Lucius Appuleius Saturninus. Titus was popular with the people because of a new land reform law he proposed; however, he was prosecuted and punished just because of the picture and his political views. He writes that the Romans felt a personal loyalty to the memory of these reformers. The tribal assembly of plebeians felt that this memory could be led astray if there was an association to a radical.\n\nMany times there were imposters that said they were sons of populist leaders like Tiberius, Gaius Marius, Gracchus, and Publius Clodius Pulcher. The people of Rome loved them. In fact, he records that one claimed to be the grandson of Gaius Marius and drew a crowd as what Caesar himself would obtain.\n\nValerius records the attitudes of the aristocracy and the contempt to which the lower class was subjected by the Roman elite. He demonstrates this with a story about Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Scipio one day preached to a group of plebs that basically they are nothing other than just a level above being slaves. He tells them they don't even deserve to call Italy their home. Valerius shows a similar concept with Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio. The story goes that Nasica treated a poor man with ridicule and contempt because his hands were so rough from manual labor. Valerius writes of still another example where the aristocratic Claudia had hoped for more of the Roman common people to have been finished off in the First Punic War.\n\nValerius gives examples of generosity in Book 5 Chapter 8. Valerius writes that generosity is given to those that are poor. The Latin word for generosity is \"liberalitas\". The god of wine is Liber. The god Liber and the word \"liberalitas\" come from the word \"liber\", meaning \"free.\" Here he tells the story of how, after the Romans captured Asia from King Antiochus III the Great in 190 BCE, they gave a large portion of it to their ally King Eumenes II of Pergamum free as a permanent gift.\n\nAnother example of generosity which Valerius writes about occurs after the Romans had defeated Philip V of Macedonia. In 196 BCE, the Greeks had the Isthmian Games. Here Titus Quinctius Flamininus proclaimed the independence of the Greek states from Macedonian rule. At the games, the stadium was full of people and Titus had the herald make the following proclamation: \"The Roman people and Senate, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, their general, having vanquished the Macedonians and Philip, their king, order that Greece shall be free from foreign garrisons, not subject to tribute, and shall live under her own customs and laws.\"\n\nThe themes in Chapter 1 of Book 5 are kindness and compassion; Valerius gives several examples based on these concepts. He considered these lesser virtues than generosity, although companions of it. Valerius writes that kindness is shown to those that are in trouble and compassion is for those whose luck has turned against them. He considered generosity to be the one that derived its name from a god, and should receive the most approval of these three.\n\nOne Roman story is where Valerius gives an example of generosity, kindness and compassion. Here he explains that one day the Roman Senate was offered a large sum of ransom money for the release of 2,743 Carthaginian soldiers and refused it. The Senate released the soldiers to the representatives that had come to get them, and forgave the crimes. The representatives were astonished and even admitted that they themselves would not have been so kind and generous.\n\nAnother Roman story in which Valerius writes about kindness is where king Syphax of western Numidia died in prison in Tibur (modern day Tivoli, Italy) in 201 BCE. The Senate gave him a state funeral with a proper burial.\n\nAnother similar Roman story in which Valerius writes about compassion is where the Senate sent a quaestor to Alba (in Latium) in 167 BCE. There King Perseus of Macedonia was banished to and had just died there. They wanted to give him honor and provided a state funeral for the king.\n\nValerius gives examples of gratitude in Book 5 Chapter 2 as the theme. One example is when Valerius writes about how Capua was being besieged by Quintus Fulvius Flaccus at the first Battle of Capua; there were two Campanian women who had kind feelings for Rome. They devoted much of their time and property to its benefit. One was Vestia Oppia, a married woman with a family, who labored everyday for the Roman army. Another was Cluvia Facula, a prostitute, who supplied food to the Roman prisoners of war. When Capua was defeated, the Roman Senate gave back their freedom and property and rewarded them. These two momen were even praised at an important Senate meeting in 210 BCE.\n\nValerius gives another example of gratitude when he writes of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (c. 280 BC – 203 BC), called Cunctator (\"the Delayer\"). Fabius died in 203 BCE after being consul for five terms. Many people of Rome generously gave money to his funeral in gratitude for his leadership. When he was still alive, to show gratitude of his outstanding service to the Roman people, a referendum of the plebs gave equal power to his magister equitum Marcus Minucius Rufus as co-dictator in 217 BCE.\n\nValerius gives as the theme \"ingratitude\" in Book 4 Chapter 3. Valerius writes that Scipio Aemilianus, grandson of famous general Scipio Africanus, had destroyed two major cities, Numantia and Carthage, that were major threats to Rome. However, in Rome later, he met his death in mysterious circumstances in 129 BCE. There was never anyone in the Roman Forum that avenged his death.\n\nValerius writes of another example on ingratitude being the circumstances around Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio. Nasica had led a group of conservative senators of the Roman Senate to kill the populist tribune of the plebs Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BCE. He soon afterward had to withdraw from public life because the people of Rome had judged his merits unfairly. Nasica, a Pontifex Maximus, went to Pergamum ostensibly as a diplomat and never returned. He died there, but never missed his country because the Roman people were so ungrateful for what he considered a great deed he had done for them.\n\nOn another theme, Valerius writes of several examples of infamous crimes in Book 8 Chapter 1 and how they related to jealousy.\n\nOne example Valerius records of acquittal \"(absoluti)\" is where Marcus Horatius is found guilty by King Tullus Hostilius of killing his sister. Horatius was acquitted of the crime when he appealed to the public. The brutal nature of the killing influenced King Tullus to convict him; however, the motive for which Horatius did it influenced the people. In a battle defending Rome Horatius defeated the Curiatius brothers and killed them. His sister was in love with one of these brothers and planned on marrying him. She wept over him, hearing of his death. Horatius murdered her then because of her premature love affair with the enemy. The people of Rome felt this was harsh punishment rather than an actual crime of the Roman Republic. Horatius received glory for not only killing the Curiatius brothers, the enemy, but for killing his sister. In this case the Roman people were acting as a strict guardian of chastity.\n\nAnother case Valerius records is where the Roman people were acting as an unfair, lax judge. In this case Servius Sulpicius Galba was being harshly denounced at the rostra by Lucius Scribonius Libo, tribune of the plebs in 149 BCE. Cato the Elder supported the tribune's charges in a grand speech at a Roman assembly as is recorded in his \"Origins\". Galba had committed an atrocious war crime against the Lusitanians. He had made a peace agreement with the Lusitanians, but then massacred 8,000 of them while he was governor of Spain in 150 BCE. Galba, being a great speaker in his own right, had no real defense for his crimes. Through bribery and bringing forth his children and the orphan child of a relative before the public in a speech for mercy, he procured his acquittal.\n\nAnother case where Valerius records ancient history crimes is about Gaius Cosconius, praetor in 89 BCE and governor of Illyria from 78 to 76 BCE. He was accused of misgovernment under the Servilian Law passed in 101 BCE. There was no doubt that he was guilty; however, he recited a poem about his accuser, Valerius Valentinus, and got an acquittal. The poem was about how Valerius seduced a young man in a striped toga and a young freeborn woman. Valerius was then convicted by the acquittal of Cosconius.\n\nValerius reports in Book 9 Chapter 5 under Foreign Stories that Alexander the Great had three stages of arrogance. One was that he looked down on his father Philip II of Macedon and claimed that Jupiter Hammon was his real father. Another was that he took up the ways of the Persian people by dressing and behaving their way. Still another was that Alexander believed himself to be a god, not a human being.\n\nValerius writes another foreign story here of Xerxes I of Persia. To show his outrageous behavior and arrogance, he tells how Xerxes summoned all the leaders of Asia together. Just as he was about to declare war on Greece, he tells them, \"I did not want people to think that I was acting on my own initiative, so I brought you together here. But remember that it is your duty to obey me rather than persuade me.\" Valerius reports that in the invasion, Xerxes suffered such a defeat that one would wonder if his words were just arrogance or stupidity.\n\nValerius writes on still another foreign story of Hannibal and how arrogant he was after his success at the Battle of Cannae. He tells how Hannibal had delusions of grandeur and would not then receive any of his fellow citizens directly. He would only communicate through a go-between. He even insulted his cavalry commander Maharbal, who had said in front of his tent in a loud voice that he had planned things so that Hannibal would be dining on the Capitol in Rome within a few days.\n\nSome other subjects that Valerius wrote about included:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1626438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1626438", "title": "Grailquest", "text": "Grailquest\n\nGrailQuest is a series of gamebooks by J. H. Brennan. The books are illustrated by John Higgins. The stories follow the adventures of a young hero named Pip, who is often called upon by Merlin to right wrongs and save the realm from evil. The series is light in tone and does not take itself seriously, often spoofing the fantasy genre and inserting slapstick humor or nonsensical elements.\n\nThe series is mostly set in King Arthur's realm of Avalon, although the fourth volume, \"Voyage of Terror\", takes place almost entirely in ancient Greece, after Merlin's summoning spell goes wrong.\n\nWhile there were eight total books published in the series, books seven and eight were never published in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe rules of GrailQuest are quite simple when compared to current RPGs. The player must roll two six-sided dice and add the results. If the result exceeds 6 (which will happen 58.3% of the time), then the enemy is injured and loses a number of Life Points - how much depends on what the dice shows, as every point over 6 will count as a point of damage. When a character's Life Points reach zero, the character is dead, and when they are at 5, they are knocked out.\n\nIf wielding a weapon, the number needed to hit may be lower, and extra damage will usually be inflicted. For instance, Excalibur Junior hits on a roll of 4 (hitting 91.7% of the time) and provides a bonus 5 points of damage.\n\nThere is no defence roll, but damage is reduced by a set amount by any armor the character is wearing.\n\nInitiative is determined by an initial, opposed roll where the highest roll gets the first attack. From then on, the character and the enemy take turns to attack. Surprise is sometimes involved (for example, in \"Gateway of Doom\", a giant spider gets first strike automatically due to Pip being in its home territory).\n\nIf the character dies, the player must go to section 14, which describes his afterdeath and tells him to calculate his Life Points again. Merlin then resurrects Pip, who has to start from the beginning of the adventure again - although some books will only require him to start from a certain point, such as \"Gateway of Doom\" allows Pip to restart at the beginning of the Ghastly Kingdom of the Dead, or \"Realm of Chaos\" allows him to start from the beginning of a certain location. However, all previously killed enemies remain dead, and any treasure the player found is gone for good. (In some books, killed enemies return to life with half the Life Points they had the first time around.)\n\nIn some of the books, Merlin provides Pip with magic spells. In the first book, Pip has only two spells - ten firefingers (lightning bolts) and two powerful fireballs. The firefinger lightning bolts hit automatically for a straight 10 points of damage, while the fireballs score a massive 75 points of damage each, but require a 6 or better on two dice or else they miss completely.\n\nIn the second book, Merlin provides Pip with a spell book. This provides Pip with more spells of various uses in and out of combat. Pip also receives ten new firefingers (different from the firefingers on the previous book) and two new fireballs. If the player has finished the first book, he can keep any unspent spells from the previous book, and also the dragonhide jacket, which would otherwise be unavailable.\n\nPip's use of magic is limited by three rules that must be adhered to at all times. First, every spell thrown costs three Life Points whether it is cast successfully or not. Second, no spell can be thrown more than three times in any given adventure (and once thrown, it is used whether or not it is successfully cast). And third, no spell thrown is successfully cast unless a 7 or better is rolled on two dice.\n\n\nIn the third book, Merlin provides Pip with a new spell book. When Pip wonders why this second spell book is shorter than the first one, Merlin tells Pip that spell books require a great deal of research and development, making them quite expensive, and he is not made of money. These spells follow the same three rules of magic described in the second book.\n\n\nSpell books, Firefingers, Fireballs, the dragonhide jacket and even E.J. are not available in the fourth book. Both spell books are also unavailable in books five and six; in the former case because Merlin has run out of time, and in the latter because no magic will work on account of the curse on Camelot.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56139093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56139093", "title": "I Hate Running Backwards", "text": "I Hate Running Backwards\n\nI Hate Running Backwards is a top-down shooter rogue-like endless runner developed by Binx Interactive, produced by Croteam and published by Devolver Digital. It was developed for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is an indie game which contains characters from the \"Serious Sam, Nuclear Throne, Broforce, Shadow Warrior, Enter The Gungeon and Hotline Miami\" series of video games. The player picks a hero, who runs backwards and shoots downwards at enemies. The aestetic is described as similar to that of Minecraft.\nIn addition to guns, the player will also be able to destroy obstacles, deflect projectiles using a melee weapon. The world of the game is completely destructible. The game was released on 22 May 2018.\n\n\"I Hate Running Backwards\" is a top-down shooter rogue-like endless runner. The game has two main game modes. single player and local cooperative multiplayer mode. Single player mode can be extended with the daily run which has its own leader-board. The daily run can be played only once a day, it has a random character (even ones that the player hasn't unlocked yet) each day, and the generated world is predefined for all players to have a similar game-play experience. The player controls one of 12 characters, 9 of which must be unlocked through game-play. Each character has two different primary weapons they use, except the character \"The Bullet\", which has only one weapons. Each character also has a unique ability be it an ultimate ability that he/she has to charge or a passive ability that is always active. These abilities offer a different play-style for each of the characters.\n\nThe player progresses through 5 different environments that are procedurally generated. The environments follow a set path, the order is always Sand, Jungle, Medieval, Mines, Greek. At the end of every environment the player faces one of the games 6 bosses. The last environments boss, Ugh Zan, has two different forms, and it's fought as two different bosses. After killing the final boss the player enters a time portal that teleports them to the first environment but with increased difficulty. Loops can be run endlessly and get more difficult each time. Loops increase the number of enemies and all the games enemies can be spawned on all environments after the first loop. The increase in difficulty also raises the number of environmental traps that can kill the player.\n\nKilling the games bosses unlocks shrines in the games lobby that can activate curses. Curses add additional mechanics to the game that makes it more difficult. The curses range from additional environmental traps, like poison, to death lasers that follow the player around the game world. Each curse also adds a modifier to the final score. The curses add a way for the players to naturally increase the difficulty to the point that suits them.\n\nThe player character starts of with a basic pistol weapon that has infinite ammo and a melee weapon. During gameplay the player can pickup ammo for his primary weapons or destroy weapon crates to get special weapons. The 34 special weapons each have a unique twist to them, for example the biomedic sniper can heal the player, while the gravity gun can group up enemies and make short work of them. The player unlocks new special weapons by completing different tasks in the game.\n\nWhile playing the player defeats enemies and destroys the environment to gather Mojo, the games equivalent to experience. When enough mojo is gathered the player level ups and gains a perk which he can select from a group of three different perk per level. The perk he/she will get on the next level up is also indicated to make it possible to plan out builds one level in advance.\n\n\"I Hate Running Backwards\" is set in the universe of Serious Sam at an undisclosed moment in time. One of Mentals subordinates, Ugh-Zan has been put together from the parts of Ugh-Zan and Hugo and sent to the future to stop the group of heroes in fighting Mental. Ugh-Zans mind was uploaded to the new mechanized body and he can also transfer it to the tank module that is store inside his body as a last defense mode.\n\nSam and his group of heroes travel through time to defeat Mentals minions once and for all.\n\n\"I Hate Running Backwards\" features characters from different franchises that were published by Devolver Digital, with the exception of Nuclear Throne which was published and Developed by Vlambeer.\nThe characters that are featured in the game are Serious Sam, Dancing Denzell and Fast Finger Freddie from the Serious Sam franchise, Richard from Hotline Miami, Rambro from Broforce, The Bullet from Enter the Gungeon, Crystal from Nuclear Throne and Lo Wang from Shadow Warrior. The other 4 characters in game are unique characters from I Hate Running Backwards.\n\nDevelopment on \"I Hate Running Backwards\" started in 2016. The developers of the game, Binx Interactive are a small team consisting of only five developers who worked on video games as a hobby, but were showing up to game developer conferences in Croatia. On one of the Conferences Croteams CEO Roman Ribaric and CMO Damjan Mravunac decided to give Binx a chance in their new incubator program. The idea of the program was to provide local developers with the support and equipment to make full-fledged video games.\n\nThe idea for the game came from Serious Sams catch phrase: \"I hate running backwards\" alluding to him constantly having to run backwards from enemies to avoid them killing him. The game was first structured as a simple action endless runner game with the focus on leading enemies into environmental traps that were spawned behind the player. The challenge in the game would come from the player having to avoid the same traps he would have to lead the enemies into. One of the games programmers, Denis Mraović came up with the idea to add the hammer swing mechanic into the game at one point, as he felt that the constant shooting tired him out, and he wanted to have something more to do during game-play.\n\nThe game was first shown to the public at Reboot-Infogamer in 2016. where the game won the best game-play award. The games hammer mechanic led the developers to introducing a redesign in graphics and the world. The whole game world was made destructible with the goal to make the experience more hands on. During the development cycle the game took shape as a rogue-like endless runner that turned the shoot-em-up genre on its head.\n\nSomewhere during 2017. Croteam and BinxInteractive got Devolver-Digital on board as the games publisher. As the development moved on the team felt that they needed more distinct characters to fill the rooster of heroes. Devolver came up with the idea to use characters from their other IPs. Many of the games that inspired the team like \"Nuclear throne\" and \"Enter the Gungeon\" had ties to Devolver directly or from previous projects. The game features twelve characters. Three characters are from the Serious Sam universe (Sam, Denzell and Fast Finger Freddie), Richard from Hotline Miami, Rambro from Broforce, The Bullet from Enter the Gungeon, Crystal from Nuclear Throne, Lo Wang from Shadow Warrior and 4 unique new characters (Dumpster Dave, Zombie Zed, Chux and Lady Death).\n\nThe game was named as one of the best games at PAX East 2018 by GamesRadar.\nThe game received mixed reviews upon release on the PC platform, currently holding an aggregated score of 69 on Metacritic. PC PowerPlay gave it 8/10 stating \"The game is really quite brutal, but individual runs quite short. It’s a perfect palate-cleaner game – quick to load, easy to switch to from other applications, and over pretty fast. Unless you’re good at it, which, you know… I’m pretty much not. But it’s also just wonderfully silly fun. Bright, chaotic in the all the best ways, and always surprising.\".\n"}

Each range is divided into a multitude of channels. Countries apply their own regulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum power levels within these frequency ranges. The ISM band ranges are also often used.\n\nFourteen channels are designated in the 2.4 GHz range, spaced 5 MHz apart from each other except for a 12 MHz space before channel 14.\n\nFor 802.11g/n, it is not possible to guarantee orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) operation, thus affecting the number of possible non-overlapping channels depending on radio operation.\n\nAs the protocol requires 16.25 to 22 MHz of channel separation (as shown above), adjacent channels overlap and will interfere with each other. Leaving three or four channels clear between used channels is recommended to avoid interference. The exact spacing required depends on the protocol and data rate selected as well as the electromagnetic environment where the equipment is used.\n\nWhen two or more 802.11b transmitters are operated in the same airspace, their signals must be attenuated by -50 dBr and/or separated by 22 MHz to prevent interference. This is because the DSSS algorithm transmits data logarithmically along a 20 MHz bandwidth. \n\nThe remaining 2 MHz gap is used as a guard band to allow sufficient attenuation along the edge channels. This guardband is mainly used to accommodate older routers with modem chipsets prone to full channel occupancy, as most modern WiFi modems are not prone to excessive channel occupancy.\n\n\"Nations apply their own RF emission regulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum power levels within these frequency ranges. Network operators should consult their local authorities as these regulations may be out of date as they are subject to change at any time. Most of the world will allow the first thirteen channels in the spectrum.\"\n\nIn the US, 802.11 operation on channels 12 and 13 is allowed under low power conditions. The 2.4 GHz Part 15 band in the US allows spread-spectrum operation as long as the 50 dB bandwidth of the signal is within the range of 2,400–2,483.5 MHz which fully encompasses both channels 12 and 13.\nA Federal Communications Commission (FCC) document clarifies that only channel 14 is forbidden and that low-power transmitters with low-gain antennas may operate legally in channels 12 and 13. Channels 12 and 13, however, are not normally used in order to avoid any potential interference in the adjacent restricted frequency band, 2,483.5–2,500 MHz, which is subject to strict emission limits set out in 47 CFR § 15.205. Per recent FCC Order 16-181, \"an authorized access point device can only operate in the 2483.5–2495 MHz band when it is operating under the control of a Globalstar Network Operating Center and that a client device can only operate in the 2483.5–2495 MHz band when it is operating under the control of an authorized access point\"\n\nIn Canada, 12 channels are available for use, 11 of which at full power and the other (channel 12) is transmit power limited. Few devices, however, have a method to enable a lower powered channel 12.\n\nChannel 14 is valid only for DSSS and CCK modes (Clause 18 a.k.a. 802.11b) in Japan. OFDM (i.e., 802.11g) may not be used. (IEEE 802.11-2007 §19.4.2)\n\n\"Except where noted, all information taken from Annex J of IEEE 802.11y-2008\"\n\nThis range is documented as only being allowed as a licensed band in the United States. Please see IEEE 802.11y for details.\n\nCountries apply their own regulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum power levels within these frequency ranges.\n\nA 40 MHz band is available from 3655–3695 MHz. It may be divided into eight 5 MHz channels, four 10 MHz channels, or two 20 MHz channels, as follows:\n\n50 MHz of spectrum from 4940 MHz to 4990 MHz (WLAN channels 20–26) are in use by public safety entities in the United States. Within this spectrum space, there are two non-overlapping channels allocated, both with a width of 20 MHz. The most commonly used channels are 22 and 26.\n\nSource:\n\nCountries apply their own \nregulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum power levels within these frequency ranges. Network operators should consult their local authorities as these regulations may be out of date as they are subject to change at any time.\n\nEuropean standard EN 301 893 covers 5.15–5.725 GHz operation, and v1.8.1 is in force.\n\nIn 2007, the FCC (United States) began requiring that devices operating on 5.250–5.350 GHz and 5.470–5.725 GHz must employ dynamic frequency selection (DFS) and transmit power control (TPC) capabilities. This is to avoid interference with weather-radar and military applications. In 2010, the FCC further clarified the use of channels in the 5.470–5.725 GHz band to avoid interference with TDWR weather radar systems. In FCC parlance, these restrictions are now referred to collectively as the \"Old Rules\". On 10 June 2015, the FCC approved a \"new\" ruleset for 5 GHz device operation (called the \"New Rules\"), which adds 160 and 80 MHz channel identifiers, and re-enables previously prohibited DFS channels, in Publication Number 905462. This FCC publication eliminates the ability for manufacturers to have devices approved or modified under the Old Rules in phases; the New Rules apply in all circumstances as of 2 June 2016.\n\nGermany requires DFS and TPC capabilities on 5.250–5.350 GHz and 5.470–5.725 GHz as well; in addition, the frequency range 5.150–5.350 GHz is allowed only for indoor use, leaving only 5.470–5.725 GHz for outdoor and indoor use.\n\nSince this is the German implementation of EU Rule 2005/513/EC, similar regulations must be expected throughout the European Union.\n\nAustria adopted Decision 2005/513/EC directly into national law. The same restrictions as in Germany apply, only 5.470–5.725 GHz is allowed to be used outdoor and indoor.\n\nSource for South Africa: \n\nJapan's use of 10 and 20 MHz-wide 5 GHz wireless channels is codified by Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB) document STD-T71, \"Broadband Mobile Access Communication System (CSMA)\". Additional rule specifications relating to 40, 80, and 160 MHz channel allocation has been taken on by Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC).\n\nIn Brazil, the TPC use in 5.150–5.725 GHz band is optional. DFS is required only in the 5.470–5.725 GHz band.\n\nAs of 2015, some of the Australian channels require DFS to be utilised (a significant change from the 2000 regulations, which allowed lower power operation without DFS). As per AS/NZS 4268 B1 and B2, transmitters designed to operate in any part of 5250–5350 GHz and 5470–5725 GHz bands shall implement DFS in accordance with sections 4.7 and 5.3.8 and Annex D of ETSI EN 301 893 or alternatively in accordance with FCC paragraph 15.407(h)(2). Also as per AS/NZS 4268 B3 and B4, transmitters designed to operate in any part of 5250–5350 MHz and 5470–5725 MHz bands shall implement TPC in accordance with sections 4.4 and 5.3.4 of ETSI EN 301 893 or alternatively in accordance with FCC paragraph 15.407(h)(1).\n\nNew Zealand regulation differs from Australian.\n\nSingapore regulatory - IMDA requires DFS and TPC capabilities on 5.250–5.350 GHz above 100 mW (e.i.r.p.) and below or equal to 200 mW (e.i.r.p.), requires DFS capability on 5.250–5.350 GHz below or equal to 100 mW (e.i.r.p.), and requires DFS and TPC capabilities on 5.470-5.725 below or equal to 1000mW (e.i.r.p.). Operating 5.725-5.850 GHz above 1000mW and below or equal to 4000mW (e.i.r.p) shall be approved on exceptional basis.\n\nChina MIIT expanded allowed channels as of 31 December 2012 to add UNII-1, 5150 ~ 5250 GHz, UNII-2, 5250 ~ 5350 GHz (DFS/TPC), similar to European standards EN 301.893 V1.7.1.\n\nThe 802.11p amendment, also known as Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), published on 15 July 2010, specifies WLAN in the licensed Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) band of 5.9 GHz (5.850–5.925 GHz). The 802.11p standard is intended for use in vehicular communication systems.\n\nThe 802.11ad/ay, also known as WiGig. This operates in 60 GHz ISM band.\n\n802.11ah operates in sub-gigahertz unlicensed bands. Each world region supports different sub-bands, and the channels number depends on the starting frequency of the sub-band it belongs to. Thus, there is no global channels numbering plan, and the channels numbers are incompatible between world regions (and even between sub-bands of a same world region).\n\nThe following sub-bands are defined in the 802.11ah specifications:\n"}

It is owned by Altel Holdings/Altel Communications and was planned to start broadcasting by mid-2015. The DTT service is officially branded as myFreeview since August 2015, though the legal name of the company remained unchanged. A billion MYR deal have been signed with Telekom Malaysia to distribute the services. The set top box has been available for sale as of February 2017, after long delays of building infrastructure and other issues.\n\nIts in-house service MyFreeview was officially launched at 6 June 2017. Its main competitor would be the free-to-view satellite based service Astro NJOI which has far more channels to view. Current coverage for this service is roughly 93% of population, to which it will expand to 98% in the future.\n\nTaiwanese company Allion Labs, Inc. has been awarded accreditation from the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) to become the first lab facility for digital television in Malaysia. Around 30 channels have been set to broadcast in the first stage. HbbTV services are also integrated into MYTV service with the usage of Sofia Digital's HbbTV technology.\n\nEast Coast Peninsular Malaysia has been chosen as the first site for testing followed by East Malaysia, and northern and southern Peninsular Malaysia before reaching Klang Valley. In Sabah, around 1,500 households have been selected for the test.\n\nAccording to MYTV, the initial annual rental fee for a 24-hour free-to-air TV channel was RM 12 million for a SDTV channel and RM 25 million for a HDTV channel for a continuous 24 hour slot. However, following reports of Media Prima might quit free-to-air transmission due to unviable fees, MYTV may introduce bandwidth based charging, which is already in consideration. On a statement given by MYTV CEO Michael Chan announced that transmission fees will be waived until June 2018, when Malaysia completes DTT migration by terminating analogue transmission. Rebates will be also given on a case-by-case basis for six months up to the end of 2018. He is also looking to bring the transmission fee down to between RM8 million and RM18 million, since the Malaysian TV market do not accept fees of RM12 million or RM25 million per channel. The transmission cost for each SD and HD channel was eventually revised to RM6.7 milion and RM7.4mil respectively per year. \n\nAccording to former Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek, the MYTV Basic decoder would be distributed to around two million select Malaysian households while other recipients would be determined later. All 2 million households had now been determined and it would be sent to recipients house via PosLaju.\n\nThere would be 3 types of set top boxes planned for use by MYTV, all with approved certification by \"DTTV Malaysia\". The first one is the trial test decoder, which was distributed to selected households for test transmission (which itself need to return to MYTV andeventually replaced by MYTV Basic STB). There are two standard set-top boxes issued, the first being the \"MYTV Basic\" decoder to be given to 2 million selected households nationwide for free, while the other is the standard \"MYTV Advance\" decoder, which is sold for RM299 excluding GST at Pos Malaysia branches and selected electrical stores. CI slots comes as a standard for both set top boxes, which it may be used for pay TV in the future. The major differences for these set-top boxes is the latter one (MYTV Advance) comes with support for HbbTV while MYTV Basic did not come with such support. MYTV has sign an agreement with Pensonic to distribute MYTV Advance set top box exclusively on 29 November 2016. Digital televisions with \"DTTV Malaysia\" certification can also be used to receive transmission. \n\n\nWhile households that are not listed as recipients of government aid could get the free decoders from branches which would be set up in every state after the launch in 2017. The temporary decoder would be replaced with a new decoder (known as MYTV Basic) in the final DTT test broadcasts at the end of 2016 with remote areas being distributed by Pos Malaysia.\n\nThe following channels and services are carried or planned to be carried on MyFreeview platform:\nAccording to MYTV, there are 13 test phase sites which will be operate on the first stage, which it currently covers around 80% of population. MYTV will eventually develop 60 main transmitters and 40 gap fillers which it will cover 98% of population. Based on the information provided by myFreeview, 34 transmission sites are utilized to cover around 93% of Malaysian population via outdoor antenna. \n\nmyFreeview viewers residing in some/all parts of Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka and Perak are facing prolonged no transmission issues since 11 and 25 October 2018, which 20 of 34 transmission sites has been taken down due to a payment dispute between Telekom Malaysia (TM) and MYTV Broadcasting. The remaining 14 sites was planned to taken down by TM at 1 November but those sites was eventually not taken down after intervention by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). This dispute places analogue switch-off, which is planned on first quarter of 2019, in question.\n"}

In Japan managers may attempt to discourage their artists from dating or engaging in behavior that may tarnish their images by keeping a busy schedule and only letting artists know about their schedules a day at a time. Artists who break this contract, as in the case of Minami Minegishi from AKB48, run the risk of getting dropped from their music group or contract.\n\nKorea has similar rules for musical pop artists. Artists have more freedom to date and get married, however managers have strong control over their personal lives and behaviors.

The show was groundbreaking, delving into religious, psychological and philosophical themes on an otherwise standard mecha backdrop. There was some debate over the controversial ending of the television series. In response, two films were made to provide an alternate ending for the show: \"\", released in March 1997, and \"The End of Evangelion\" released in July 1997. \"Death\" is a compilation of clips from the TV series, with some new footage added, and \"Rebirth\" comprises the first 30 minutes or so of \"End of Evangelion\".\n\nThe popularity of the show spawned numerous additional media, including video games, radio dramas, audio books, a novel, pachinko machines, and a tetralogy of films titled \"Rebuild of Evangelion\".

Treated as a tool by his father, Shinji joins Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu as mankind's last hope against the mysterious beings known as the \"Angels\". As the series progresses, the true natures of NERV, the Evangelions, and the Angels are revealed.\n\n\"\" is a super deformed parody OVA series that ran for 24 episodes as an adaptation of the \"Petit Eva\" and \"Petit Eva Bokura Tanken Dōkōkai\" manga. \"Petit Eva\" is a spin-off work that centers around high school life in a manner similar to \"\".\n\n\"Death and Rebirth\", originally released on March 15, 1997, is a film that consists of a highly condensed character-based recap and re-edit of the episodes 1-24, titled \"Death\", and the first half of an unfinished new ending, titled \"Rebirth\", a retelling of episodes 25 and 26 of the television series as the events of the Human Instrumentality Project unfold from an external point of view.\n\n\"The End of Evangelion\", released on July 19, 1997, is the completed version of \"Rebirth\", an alternate version of the final episodes of the television series. SEELE attacks NERV, using their Mass Production Evangelion units, all in an attempt to complete the Human Instrumentality Project and initiate the Third Impact.\n\nOn September 9, 2006, Gainax confirmed a new animated film series called \"Rebuild of Evangelion\", consisting of four movies presenting an alternate retelling of the TV series (including new scenes, settings, and characters) and a completely new conclusion to the story. The first film was released in Japan on September 1, 2007, with the and released on June 27, 2009 and November 17, 2012. The final film is slated for a 2020 release date.\n\nDevelopment of a live-action movie version of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" by Gainax, Weta Workshop Ltd., and ADV Films (then the worldwide distributor of the \"Evangelion\" series outside of Asia and Australia) was announced at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2003. Early coverage included ADV Films raising \"about half of the $100 million to $120 million needed to produce the film\" and some concept art produced by Weta Workshop.\n\nAs time passed without any official announcements of production, the film project showed increasing signs of being in development hell. At Anime Expo 2008, ADV founders Matt Greenfield and John Ledford revealed that they had hired the producer John Woo, pitched the idea to other producers such as Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg, and seen increased interest in the wake of the success of the 2007 film \"Transformers\". At Ohayocon 2009, Matt Greenfield announced that several U.S. studios were competing for final rights to the project, predicting an official announcement naming the studio, director, and perhaps casting information within the next nine months (he later noted that the closer he got to sealing a deal, the less he could say anything about it). Though the sudden collapse and asset sale of A.D. Vision in September 2009 raised concerns over the project's viability, Greenfield, Ledford, and producer Joseph Chou insisted the project was still actively searching for a director (claiming delays owed more to the general deterioration of the American anime market than to ADV's internal issues).\n\nIn August 2011, Vision sued Gainax, claiming their refusal to accept an option payment for the perpetual live-action rights to \"Evangelion\" was a breach of contract and resulted in losing an opportunity to produce the film with a major studio. A.D. Vision has asked to be awarded the full live-action rights and any accruing legal fees.\n\nA number of manga series based on the anime have been released, mostly notably the official series by series character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, which was first serialized in February 1995 (eight months before the series' official premiere, in order to promote interest), and ended in November 2014, 19 years later. Three other manga have been created: \"\" by Fumino Hayashi, \"Shinji Ikari Raising Project\" by Takahashi Osamu, and \"\" by Min Min.\n\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" has spawned a number of video games. These range from action games such as the same titled game for the Nintendo 64 and its sequel on the PlayStation 2, the fighting game \"\", the visual novels \"\" and \"\", and the rhythm game \"3nd Impact\" (read \"Sound Impact\"). Characters from \"Evangelion\" also make numerous appearances in other titles such as in the \"Super Robot Wars\" series by Banpresto. The hit mobile game \"Monster Strike\", by the Japanese company Mixi, did a collaboration featuring dungeons and collectible units from the series.\n\nThe \"Evangelion\" franchise has spread from the original anime into a number of different media, with some following the official canon (of the 26-episode anime series and its three related films or the new \"Rebuild\" series) and others differing on important plot points originally introduced in the anime.\n\n\nA parody radio drama, \"Neon Genesis Evangelion – After the End\", was released in 1996 as part of the \"NEON GENESIS EVANGELION ADDITION\" album. The story features the anime's original cast reuniting to star in a new Evangelion series, while attempting to change various themes of the series to make it more popular/accessible than it already is. A separate Evangelion audio cassette drama was released in 1996.\n\n\"Evangelion\" has had numerous soundtrack releases since its debut on television, with most of the music composed by Shirō Sagisu. The television series' opening theme song \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" has become an iconic anime theme song. Four releases titled \"Evangelion Classic\", each one contained the classical music of Beethoven, Verdi, Handel, and J.S. Bach respectively.\n\nA number of Evangelion-themed \"pachinko\" and \"pachisuro\" machines are offered at pachinko parlors:\n\nAs of March 2018, \"Evangelion\" pachinko manufacturer Fields Corporation revealed that the \"Evangelion\" franchise has sold a total of 2.317million pachinko and pachislot machines, including 1.752million pachinko machines and 540,000 pachislot machines. At an average unit price of $5,000, the \"Evangelion\" franchise has grossed approximately from sales of pachinko and pachislot machines.\n\n\"Evangelion\" is also popular among doujinshi, inspiring notable titles such as \"Evangelion RE-TAKE\" (an unofficial sequel to the End of Evangelion) by Studio Kimigabuchi and even works by famous manga artists, such as \"Birth of Evangelion\" by Yun Kōga.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, Fuji-Q Highland opened a 1,460m section devoted to \"Evangelion\", featuring a lifesize entry plug and statue of Mari Makinami, an approximately 3-meter titanium Lance of Longinus, NERV hallways with character cutouts that lead to a hangar room with the 1:1 bust of Eva Unit-01, SEELE monoliths, appropriate cosplay, Eva-themed hotel rooms, and food products. A bust of Eva Unit-02 modeled after a scene in \"Evangelion: 2.0\" was installed in 2011.\n\nA Transformers x Evangelion comic and toy line featured a Transformers and Evangelion crossover.\n\n"}

Fosser's puppet production Opera in Focus is a troupe which performs opera and musical theater with some of the world's most sophisticated puppets. The Opera in Focus puppet opera theater is located in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.\n\nFosser, a puppeteer and artistic director of the legendary Kungsholm Miniature Opera in Chicago, began designing the puppets that would eventually be used in his Opera in Focus productions in the late 1930s. The cost involved in building each elaborately articulated puppet prevented him from constructing them until 1956. He presented the first Opera in Focus performances—by invitation only—in 1958 in a rented store on the north side of Chicago, where they were received with great enthusiasm.\nIn order to support the puppet opera, Fosser made a living as a set designer and art director in the motion picture industry, working on such films as \"Ordinary People\", \"Home Alone\", \"Backdraft\", \"Weird Science\", \"Music Box\", \"\", \"The Breakfast Club\", \"A League of Their Own\" and \"Groundhog Day\". He also worked as a set designer for live theatrical productions, designing scenery for the Lyric Opera of Chicago, as well as the Candlelight, Ivanhoe, and Drury Lane theaters. He spent his free time further developing and perfecting his puppets and the presentation of his elaborate miniature operatic productions. Due to the hectic nature of his career in the film industry, performances of Opera in Focus were infrequent, except for periods in 1962-1963 and 1978-1979 when Opera in Focus enjoyed residencies in Detroit and at the now-defunct Magic Pan restaurant in Chicago.\n\nIn 1993 the Rolling Meadows Chamber of Commerce offered Fosser a permanent home in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, where Opera in Focus has been performed weekly ever since.\n\nIn 2005 Fosser received the President's Award from the Puppeteers of America. Opera in Focus has received a number of awards including the prestigious Dorothy Mullen Award from the National Parks and Recreation Association for Fine Arts Programming.\n\nWilliam Fosser died of congestive heart failure and pneumonia on February 19, 2006, in Resurrection Hospital, in Chicago. He was buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.\n\nThe theater continues to present a stunning sampling of fully staged scenes from well-known operas & musicals. Each hour-long performance may offer between three and five scenes, depending on the length of the individual segments. A narration of the action by the well-known actor, Tony Mockus, precedes each scene. The 16\" puppets are manipulated from below the stage floor and are capable of very lifelike action and dramatic gestures for which opera singers are so famous.\n\nA demonstration of the puppet operation and a tour of the highly technical backstage area follow each performance. Despite the small stage (only five feet wide and two feet deep), the illusion of live opera prevails. The puppet opera performances are capable of charming a wide range of audiences - from the lovers of opera and musical theater to those simply fascinated by the fine art of puppetry.\n\n\n"}

The CPB would have the funds to help local stations create innovative programs, thereby increasing the service of broadcasting in the public interest throughout the country.\n\nThe act was supported by many prominent Americans, including Fred Rogers (\"Mister Rogers\"), one of the founders of NPR and creator of All Things Considered Robert Conley, and Senator John O. Pastore, then chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, during the House and United States Senate hearings in 1967.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives passed the bill 266-91 on September 21, 1967, with 51 members voting \"present\" and two not voting.\n\nWhen President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act into law on November 7, 1967, he described its purpose as:\n\nIt announces to the world that our nation wants more than just material wealth; our nation wants more than a 'chicken in every pot.' We in America have an appetite for excellence, too. While we work every day to produce new goods and to create new wealth, we want most of all to enrich man's spirit. That is the purpose of this act.\n\nIt will give a wider and, I think, stronger voice to educational radio and television by providing new funds for broadcast facilities. It will launch a major study of television's use in the Nation's classrooms and its potential use throughout the world. Finally — and most important — it builds a new institution: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\"\n\nThe act was originally to be called the \"Public Television Act\" and focus exclusively on television, worrying supporters of public radio. However, in a sudden change of fortune, Senator Robert Griffin suggested changing the name to the \"Public Broadcasting Act\" when the bill passed through the Senate. After several revisions, including last-minute changes added with Scotch Tape, the law signed by Johnson included radio. This set the path for the incorporation of National Public Radio (NPR) in 1970.\n\nIn addition to the progress made by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, other areas such as educational television (ETV) made headway as well. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had reserved almost 250 channel frequencies for educational stations in 1953, although, seven years later, only 44 such stations were in operation. However, by 1969, the number of stations had climbed to 175.\n\nEach week, the National Education Television and Radio Center (renamed in 1963 to National Educational Television) aired a few hours of relatively inexpensive programs to educational stations across the country. These programs were produced by a plethora of stations across the nation, such as WGBH in Boston, WTTW in Chicago, and KQED in San Francisco. Unfortunately, with the growth of commercial radio and television, the more poorly-funded educational programming was being largely ignored. The higher budgets of the commercial media were making it difficult for the educational programs to compete, due to their smaller budgets.\n\nThe networks airing educational programming began to favor the commercial entertainment programs because they lured more people, and thus more advertising dollars. Locally run, nonprofit television and radio tried to \"fill in the gaps\" but, due to the technology gap created by budget constraints, it was increasingly difficult to produce the high-tech programming that consumers were used to.\n\nIn 1965, the increasing distance between commercial and educational programming led to the Carnegie Corporation of New York ordering its Commission on Education Television to conduct a study of ETV and, from that study, derive changes and recommendations for future action regarding ETV. The report created from the study was published about two years later and became a \"catalyst and model\" for the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.\n\nWith the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, smaller television and radio broadcasters were able to be heard by a wider range of audiences, and new and developing broadcasters were encouraged to display their knowledge to the country. Before 1967, commercial radio and television was widely used by major networks in order to attract advertisers. Smaller networks were unable to make much impact due to their lack of budget. The act provided a window for broadcasters to get their message across and, in some cases, straight to the point. Even people who could not afford premium channels were always provided with PBS as an additional network to the Big Three.\n\nMany adults and children today would have grown up without some of the more well-known PBS shows, such as \"Sesame Street\" and \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" without this act. Many other shows are informative to everyday needs or concerns. Local events and special offers were a bonus but were generally targeted at larger audiences so they were not always beneficial for the station.\n\nPublic broadcasting includes multiple media outlets, which receive some or all of their funding from the public. The main media outlets consist of radio and television. Public broadcasting consists of organizations such as CPB, Public Broadcasting Service, and National Public Radio, organizations independent of each other and of the local public television and radio stations across the country.\n\nCPB was created and funded by the federal government; it does not produce or distribute any programming.\n\nPBS is a private, nonprofit corporation, founded in 1969, whose members are America's public TV stations — noncommercial, educational licensees that operate nearly 360 PBS member stations and serve all 50 states, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. The nonprofit organization also reaches almost 117 million people through television and nearly 20 million people online each month.\n\nNPR is a multimedia news organization and radio program producer, with member stations and supporters nationwide.\n\nBob McDonnell, the governor of Virginia, slashed $424,000 from the annual budget of public broadcasting in that state in 2012.\n\nPublic broadcasting exec to speak at KBBG banquet\n\nPBS anchor Jim Lehrer said that there is a need to increase federal funding in order to meet the need of serious journalism as broadcasters and commercial newspapers see decline. Lehrer said, \"Public media needs to produce more local news and serious journalism because other channels are being used to tease and to entertain and only to inform across the surface. I have a good source on why this is a problem. The source is Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson told the folks back when this country was founded that the only way this democratic society we just created is going to work is if there is an informed electorate.\"\n\nPublic broadcasting funding is to retain most of what President Barack Obama had set aside for it.\n\n\n"}

Also known as \"playing the studio\", the approach is typically embodied by artists or producers who place less emphasis on simply capturing live performances in studio and instead favor the creative use of studio technology in completing finished works. Techniques include the incorporation of non-musical sounds, overdubbing, tape edits, sound synthesis, audio signal processing, and combining segmented performances (takes) into a unified whole.\n\nComposers have been exploiting the potentials of multitrack recording since the technology was made available to them. Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a faithful rendition of a real-life performance. Following the advent of three-track tape in the mid 1950s, recording spaces became more accustomed for in-studio composition. By the late 1960s, in-studio composition had become standard practice, and remained so into the 2010s. Despite the widespread changes that have led to more compact recording set-ups, individual components such as digital audio workstations are still referred to as \"the studio\".\n\n\"Playing the studio\" is critical shorthand for in-studio composition. There is no consensus as to how to define the criterion of a musical instrument. It is also unclear whether the \"studio as instrument\" concept extends to using multi-track recording simply to facilitate the basic music writing process. According to academic Adam Bell, some proposed definitions may be consistent with music produced in a recording studio, but not with music that relies heavily on digital audio workstations (DAW). Various music educators alluded to \"using the studio as a musical instrument\" in books published as early as the late 1960s.\n\nRock historian Doyle Greene defines \"studio as compositional tool\" as a process in which music is produced around studio constructions rather than the more traditional method of capturing a live performance as is. Techniques include the incorporation of non-musical sounds, overdubbing, tape edits, sound synthesis, audio signal processing, and combining segmented performances (takes) into a unified whole. Despite the widespread changes that have led to more compact recording set-ups, individual components such as DAWs are still referred to as \"the studio\".\n\nComposers have been exploiting the potentials of multitrack recording since the technology was made available to them. Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a faithful rendition of a real-life performance. Writing in 1937, the American composer John Cage called for the development of \"centers of experimental music\" places where \"the new materials, oscillators, turntables, generators, means for amplifying small sounds, film phonographs, etc.\" would allow composers to \"work using twentieth-century means for making music.\"\n\nIn the early 1950s, electronic equipment was expensive to own, and for most people, was only accessible through large organizations or institutions. However, virtually every young composer was interested in the potential of tape-based recording. According to Brian Eno, \"the move to tape was very important\", because unlike gramophone records, tape was \"malleable and mutable and cuttable and reversible in ways that discs aren't. It's very hard to do anything interesting with a disc\". In the mid 1950s, popular recording conventions changed profoundly with the advent of three-track tape, and by the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados.\n\nIn-studio composition became standard practice by the late 1960s and early 1970s, and remained so into the 2010s. During the 1970s, the \"studio as instrument\" concept shifted from the studio's recording space to the studio's control room, where electronic instruments could be plugged directly into the mixing console. As of the 2010s, the \"studio as instrument\" idea remains ubiquitous in genres such as pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

Originally a folk dance, it first appeared into the salons in Prague in 1829 and fell out of fashion by 1840, though in the meantime it had spread beyond Bohemia.\n\nThomas Hillgrove states that the redowa was introduced to London ballrooms in 1846. Like other popular ballroom dances of the mid-nineteenth century, including the polka, it was danced in Paris prior to its appearance in London.\n\nLike most dances currently described as waltzes, the redowa is danced in time, with the couple performing a full rotation every six beats.\n\nA basic redowa step contains one long reaching step and two small leap-steps. The long reaching step can be danced on either the 1 or the 2 of each bar of music, depending on what feels best with the tune that is playing.\n\nCellarius (1849) describes a three-part redowa consisting of a pursuit part (\"la poursuite\"), followed by the style of waltz commonly described as the redowa, and ending with a particular type of valse à deux temps. During the \"pursuit\" the partners hold each other hands facing each other and moving up and down at will and doing the \"balance\" forward and back, with lady following the cavalier.\n\nDancers generally start in closed (waltz) position with the outside hands pointing line of direction. (This description is for the case when the \"reach\" step is on count two.) To begin a redowa, the leader will take a small leap step (count 1) around in front of his/her partner with the left foot so that the leader is backing, then take a long scooping or gliding step (count 2) straight back with the right (pointing right toe, bending the knee of the left leg, keeping the torso upright), followed by another small leap step (count 3) with the left to complete a 180-degree turn clockwise. The second half of the six-count pattern begins with a small leaping step (count 4) along the line of dance, so the leader faces forward on the line of dance. The left leg now reaches straight forward (count 5; pointing left toe, bending right knee, etc.), directly under the partner's right leg, which is extended back. A small leap (count 6) onto the right foot completes the pattern, completing the second half (180 degree) turn in preparation for the next six count pattern.\n\nThe follow is the opposite portion of the lead's sequence. The follower's movement on the first three beats are essentially the same movements the leader makes on the second set of three beats, and vice versa.\n\n"}

The Robopanda uses interchangeable cartridges that contain personalities, stories and songs, and is controlled directly by touch and sound sensors. Robopanda is labeled for use by children ages 9 and up.\n\n\nThe Robopanda is animated by 8 motors, controlling its arms, legs, head tilt, head rotate, eyebrows and ears. Touch sensors are located in hands, feet,head, belly and back. A tilt sensor is used to sense when Robopanda is lying down, leaning, or being carried. An RFID sensor in the belly is used to detect the presence of the minipanda accessory. Safety/pinch sensors in the armpits and back of neck will inhibit motion if triggered. Robopanda requires 6 x C and 4 x AA size batteries.\n\nRobopanda operates in three different modes controlled by a 3 way power switch: Training mode, Friend mode, or Menu mode. After 4 minutes without touch input, Robopanda will enter Sleep mode. The power/mode switch must be manually turned off and on again to exit Sleep mode. In Training mode, Robopanda will explain his various functions and sensors. Volume may also be adjusted while in Training mode by moving an arm (volume up) or leg (volume down). In Friend mode, Robopanda will converse, tell jokes and ask for touch stimulation. Robopanda will also recognize the minipanda accessory (with embedded RFID) when in Friend mode. Menu mode is broken down into 3 'settings' that are accessed by the touch sensors: touching a foot enters Free Roam setting; touching the belly enters the Games setting; touching a hand enters the Tricks setting; and touching a head sensor enters the Song/Story setting. The back touch sensor is used to return to the main menu of Menu mode.\n\nRobopanda can be 'programmed' by moving its arms and legs while in the Tricks setting of Training mode. Robopanda will then play back the sequence of movements; this is similar to the Puppet mode in other WowWee robots such as Robosapien v2. The program memory holds a limited number of movements, and the sequence of moves is retained in the cartridge only while it is inserted in Robopanda. The behavior of Robopanda can be changed by inserting a different personality cartridge.\n\n"}

Kubrick was enthusiastic about the novel and hired novelist Calder Willingham to write a screenplay; however, Production Code restrictions hindered the realization of the project. The script, once thought to be lost, was found in 2018 and is nearly completed to be developed by film-makers. Kubrick had previously expressed interest in adapting a Willingham novel \"Natural Child\", but was also prevented by the Production Code on that occasion.\n\nAfter the success of \"2001\", Kubrick planned a large-scale biographical film about Napoleon Bonaparte. He \"tried to see every film that was ever made on the subject,\" including Abel Gance's \"Napoléon\" and the Soviet film series \"War and Peace\", neither of which he liked.\nHe also conducted research, read books about the French emperor, and wrote a preliminary screenplay which has since become available on the internet. With the help of assistants, he meticulously created a card catalog of the places and deeds of Napoleon's inner circle during its operative years. Kubrick scouted locations, planning to film large portions of the film on location in France, in addition to the use of United Kingdom studios. The director was also going to film the battle scenes in Romania and had enlisted the support of the Romanian army; senior army officers had committed 40,000 soldiers and 10,000 cavalrymen to Kubrick's film for the paper costume battle scenes.\n\nIn a conversation with the British Film Institute, Kubrick's brother-in-law Jan Harlan stated the film was set to enter production with David Hemmings as the title figure Napoleon (later, that role went to Jack Nicholson) and Audrey Hepburn as Kubrick's preference for the character Josephine. In notes that Kubrick wrote to his financial backers, preserved in the book \"The Kubrick Archives\", Kubrick expresses uncertainty in regard to the progress of the Napoleon film and the final product; however, he also states that he expected to create \"the best movie ever made.\"\n\n\"Napoleon\" was eventually canceled due to the prohibitive cost of location filming, the Western release of Sergei Bondarchuk's epic film version of Leo Tolstoy's novel \"War and Peace\" (1968), and the commercial failure of Bondarchuk's Napoleon-themed film \"Waterloo\" (1970). A significant portion of Kubrick's historical research would influence \"Barry Lyndon\" (1975), the storyline of which ends in 1789, approximately fifteen years prior to the commencement of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nIn March 2013 Steven Spielberg announced his intention to create, in conjunction with Kubrick's family, a television miniseries based on Kubrick's screenplay. In May 2016, HBO announced that they will produce a miniseries based on Kubrick's screenplay with Cary Fukunaga as director.\n\nIn August 2018, French opera singer and actor David Serero adapted the screenplay for the stage, in New York, in which he stars as Napoleon. The play was scheduled to open August 23.\n\nIn 1976, Kubrick sought out a film idea that concerned the Holocaust and tried to persuade Isaac Bashevis Singer to contribute an original screenplay. Kubrick requested a \"dramatic structure that compressed the complex and vast information into the story of an individual who represented the essence of this man-made hell.\" However, Singer declined, explaining to Kubrick, \"I don't know the first thing about the Holocaust.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, Kubrick nearly entered the production stage of a film adaptation of Louis Begley's \"Wartime Lies\", the story of a boy and his aunt as they are in-hiding from the Nazi regime during the Holocaust—the first-draft screenplay, entitled \"Aryan Papers\", was penned by Kubrick himself. \"Full Metal Jacket\" co-screenwriter Michael Herr reports that Kubrick had considered casting Julia Roberts or Uma Thurman as the aunt; eventually, Johanna ter Steege was cast as the aunt and Joseph Mazzello as the young boy. Kubrick traveled to the Czech city of Brno, as it was envisaged as a possible filming location for the scenes of Warsaw during wartime, and cinematographer Elemér Ragályi was selected by Kubrick to be the director of photography.\n\nKubrick's work on \"Aryan Papers\" eventually ceased in 1995, as the director was influenced by the 1993 release of Spielberg's Holocaust-themed film \"Schindler's List\". According to Kubrick's wife Christiane an additional factor in Kubrick's decision was the increasingly depressing nature of the subject as experienced by the director. Kubrick eventually concluded that an accurate Holocaust film was beyond the capacity of cinema and returned his attention to the \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" film project.\n\nIn 2009 Kubrick's brother-in-law Jan Harlan announced his intention to produce the film and hire Ang Lee or Roman Polanski for direct but nothing has been specified.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Kubrick, a keen listener of BBC Radio, heard the radio serial drama \"Shadow on the Sun\"; written by Gavin Blakeney, \"Shadow on the Sun\" is a work of science fiction in which a virus is introduced to earth through a meteorite landing. At a time when Kubrick was looking for a new project, the director became reacquainted with \"Shadow on the Sun\". Kubrick purchased screen rights from Blakeney in 1988 for £1,500. Thereon, Kubrick read and annotated a script before moving onto \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\". The tone of the unrealized project, as described by Anthony Frewin in \"The Kubrick Archives\", is a cross between \"War of the Worlds\" and \"Mars Attacks!\".\n\nOn November 1, 2006, Kubrick's son-in-law Philip Hobbs announced that he would be shepherding a film treatment of \"Lunatic at Large\". Kubrick had commissioned the project for treatment from noir pulp novelist Jim Thompson in the 1950s, but it had been lost until Hobbs uncovered a manuscript following Kubrick's death. As of August 2011, this project is in development for future release, with the involvement of actors Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell, and U.K. screenwriter Stephen R. Clarke.\n\nA number of screenplays that were written by Kubrick, who was either hired on a commission basis or was writing for his own projects, remain unreleased. One such screenplay is \"The German Lieutenant\" (co-written with Richard Adams), in which a group of German soldiers embark upon a mission during the final days of World War II; During the time period when \"The German Lieutenant\" was planned as Kubrick's next production, the director explained his interest in making another war film:\n... one of the attractions of a war or crime story is that it provides an almost unique opportunity to contrast an individual of our contemporary society with a solid framework of accepted value, which the audience becomes fully aware of, and which can be used as a counterpoint to a human, individual, emotional situation. Further, war acts as a kind of hothouse for forced, quick breeding of attitudes and feelings. Attitudes crystallize and come out into the open.\n\nOther examples of unreleased Kubrick screenplays are \"I Stole 16 Million Dollars,\" a fictionalized account of early 20th century Baptist minister turned safecracker Herbert Emmerson Wilson (the film was to be produced by Kirk Douglas' company \"Bryna\", despite Douglas' belief that the script was poorly written, and Cary Grant was approached for the lead role); and a first draft of a script about the Mosby Rangers, a Confederate guerrilla force that was active during the American Civil War.\n\nKubrick was also interested in adapting to the screen \"Flowers in the Attic\" by V.C. Andrews, but it was cancelled due for the explicit incestuous relationship between the two main characters.\n\nMarlon Brando contacted Kubrick, asking him to direct a film adaptation of the Charles Neider western novel, \"The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones\", featuring Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. Brando was impressed, saying that \"Stanley is unusually perceptive, and delicately attuned to people. He has an adroit intellect, and is a creative thinker—not a repeater, not a fact-gatherer. He digests what he learns and brings to a new project an original point of view and a reserved passion\". The two worked on a script for six months, begun by a then unknown Sam Peckinpah. Many disputes broke out over the project, and in the end, Kubrick distanced himself from what would become \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961). Kubrick was then reported to have been fired and accepted a parting fee of $100,000, though a 1960 \"Entertainment Weekly\" article claims he quit as director, and that Kubrick had been quoted as saying \"Brando wanted to direct the movie\". Kubrick's biographer LoBrutto states that for contractual reasons, Kubrick was not able to cite the real reason, but issued a statement saying that he had resigned \"with deep regret because of my respect and admiration for one of the world's foremost artists\".\n\nKubrick was offered to direct both \"The Exorcist\" (1973) and \"\" (1977), but declined, despite once saying in 1966 to a friend that he had long desired to \"make the world's scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the nightmare fears of the audience\".\n\nKubrick was fascinated by the career of Nazi filmmaker Veit Harlan, his wife's uncle, and contemplated creating a film of the social circle that surrounded Joseph Goebbels. Although Kubrick worked on this project for several years, the director was unable to progress beyond a rough story outline.\n\nUmberto Eco, in response to an offer from Kubrick regarding a film adaptation of Eco's 1988 novel \"Foucault's Pendulum\", declined due to his dissatisfaction with the film adaptation of his earlier novel \"The Name of the Rose\". Additionally, Eco sought the role of screenwriter but Kubrick was unwilling to cooperate. Following Kubrick's death, Eco stated that he regretted his initial decision.\n\nPrior to the commencement of work for \"2001\", Terry Southern suggested the production of a high-budget pornographic film called \"Blue Movie\" to Kubrick; Southern proposed the film as an attempt to reinvent the genre. Kubrick decided against Southern's suggestion in the belief that he did not have the appropriate temperament for pornographic cinema; also, Kubrick did not think that he could sufficiently reinvent the genre to truly elevate it. At the same time, Southern had begun writing a novel, also entitled \"Blue Movie\" (published in 1970), in which a highly regarded art film director named \"Boris Adrian\" attempts to create such a film—the book is dedicated to Kubrick.\n\nFollowing J. R. R. Tolkien's sale of the film rights for \"The Lord of the Rings\" to United Artists in 1969, the rock band The Beatles considered a corresponding film project and approached Kubrick as a potential director; however, Kubrick turned down the offer, explaining to John Lennon that he thought the novel could not be adapted into a film due to its immensity. The eventual director of the film adaptation Peter Jackson further explained that a major hindrance to the project's progression was Tolkien's opposition to the involvement of the Beatles.\n\nKubrick also considered adapting Patrick Süskind's novel \"Perfume\", which he had enjoyed; however, the idea was never acted upon. The novel was later adapted for the screen by Tom Tykwer, as \"\".\n\nKubrick, searching for a project after \"Full Metal Jacket\", considered adapting Robert Marshall's novel \"All the King's Men\", a dramatic account of a British intelligence service operation during World War II.\n\nWhile working with Ian Watson on the story for \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", Kubrick asked Watson for a pre-print copy of his \"Warhammer 40,000\" tie-in novel \"Inquisitor\". Watson quotes Kubrick as saying, \"Who knows, Ian? Maybe this is my next movie?\"\n\nFollowing a 2010 announcement about the development of the \"Lunatic at Large\" project, plans for the prospective production of two other unrealized Kubrick projects were also announced. As of August 2012, \"Downslope\" and \"God Fearing Man\" were in development by Philip Hobbs and producer Steve Lanning, in partnership with independent company Entertainment One (eOne). A press release described \"Downslope\" as an \"epic Civil War drama\", while \"God Fearing Man\" is the \"true story of Canadian minister Herbert Emerson Wilson.\"\n\nIn a March 2013, Anthony Frewin, Kubrick's assistant for many years, wrote in an article in \"The Atlantic\": \"He [Kubrick] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and desperately wanted to make a film on the subject.\" The article included information on another Kubrick World War II film that was never realized, based on the life story of Dietrich Schulz-Koehn, a Nazi officer who used the pen name \"Dr. Jazz\" to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the Mike Zwerin book \"Swing Under the Nazis\" (the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn) after he had finished production on \"Full Metal Jacket.\" However, a screenplay was never completed and Kubrick's film adaptation plan was never initiated (the unfinished \"Aryan Papers\" was a factor in the abandonment of the project).\n\nIn between \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and \"A.I.\", Kubrick was interested in making a film, for children and young adults, based on H. Rider Haggard's viking epic novel, \"Eric Brighteyes\".\n\nIn 2016, long-time assistant of Kubrick's, Emilio D'Alessandro addressed that prior to his death, Kubrick was considering making a movie of Pinocchio. D'Alessandro said that Kubrick sent him to buy Italian books about Pinocchio. \"He wanted to make it in his own because so many \"Pinocchios\" have been made. He wanted to do something really big… He said; 'It would [be] very nice if I could make children laugh and feel happy making this Pinocchio.'\" (Kubrick eventually used the project based on Brian Aldiss short story as his \"Pinocchio film.\") D'Alessandro also stated that Kubrick's life-long fascination in World War II led to an interest in The Battle of Monte Cassino. D'Alessandro said, \"Stanley said that would be an interesting film to make. He asked me to get hold of things … like newspaper cuttings and find out the distance from the airport, train stations. He had a friend who actually bombarded Monte Cassino during the war … It is horrible to remember those days. Everything was completely destroyed.”\n\n"}
{"id": "1369770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1369770", "title": "Stereophonic sound", "text": "Stereophonic sound\n\nStereophonic sound or, more commonly, stereo, is a method of sound reproduction that creates an illusion of multi-directional audible perspective. This is usually achieved by using two or more independent audio channels through a configuration of two or more loudspeakers (or stereo headphones) in such a way as to create the impression of sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing. Thus the term \"stereophonic\" applies to so-called \"quadraphonic\" and \"surround-sound\" systems as well as the more common two-channel, two-speaker systems. It is often contrasted with monophonic, or \"mono\" sound, where audio is heard as coming from one position, often ahead in the sound field (analogous to a visual field). In the 2000s, stereo sound is common in entertainment systems such as broadcast radio, TV, recorded music, and cinema.\n\nThe word \"stereophonic\" derives from the Greek (\"stereós\", \"firm, solid\") + (\"phōnḗ\", \"sound, tone, voice\") and it was coined in 1927 by Western Electric, by analogy with the word \"stereoscopic\".\n\nStereo sound systems can be divided into two forms: the first is \"true\" or \"natural\" stereo in which a live sound is captured, with any natural reverberation or ambience present, by an array of microphones. The signal is then reproduced over multiple loudspeakers to recreate, as closely as possible, the live sound.\n\nSecondly \"artificial\" or \"pan-pot\" stereo, in which a single-channel (mono) sound is reproduced over multiple loudspeakers. By varying the relative amplitude of the signal sent to each speaker an artificial direction (relative to the listener) can be suggested. The control which is used to vary this relative amplitude of the signal is known as a \"pan-pot\" (panoramic potentiometer). By combining multiple \"pan-potted\" mono signals together, a complete, yet entirely artificial, sound field can be created.\n\nIn technical usage, true stereo means sound recording and sound reproduction that uses stereographic projection to encode the relative positions of objects and events recorded.\n\nDuring two-channel stereo recording, two microphones are placed in strategically chosen locations relative to the sound source, with both recording simultaneously. The two recorded channels will be similar, but each will have distinct time-of-arrival and sound-pressure-level information. During playback, the listener's brain uses those subtle differences in timing and sound level to triangulate the positions of the recorded objects. Stereo recordings often cannot be played on monaural systems without a significant loss of fidelity. Since each microphone records each wavefront at a slightly different time, the wavefronts are out of phase; as a result, constructive and destructive interference can occur if both tracks are played back on the same speaker. This phenomenon is known as phase cancellation.\n\nClément Ader demonstrated the first two-channel audio system in Paris in 1881, with a series of telephone transmitters connected from the stage of the Paris Opera to a suite of rooms at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, where listeners could hear a live transmission of performances through receivers for each ear. \"Scientific American\" reported:\nThis two-channel telephonic process was commercialized in France from 1890 to 1932 as the Théâtrophone, and in England from 1895 to 1925 as the Electrophone. Both were services available by coin-operated receivers at hotels and cafés, or by subscription to private homes.\n\nModern stereophonic technology was invented in the 1930s by British engineer Alan Blumlein at EMI, who patented stereo records, stereo films, and also surround sound.\n\nIn early 1931, Blumlein and his wife were at a local cinema. The sound reproduction systems of the early \"talkies\" invariably only had a single set of speakers - which could lead to the somewhat disconcerting effect of the actor being on one side of the screen whilst his voice appeared to come from the other. Blumlein declared to his wife that he had found a way to make the sound follow the actor across the screen.\n\nThe genesis of these ideas is uncertain, but he explained them to Isaac Shoenberg in the late summer of 1931. His earliest notes on the subject are dated 25 September 1931, and his patent had the title \"Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems\". The application was dated 14 December 1931, and was accepted on 14 June 1933 as UK patent number 394,325.\n\nThe patent covered many ideas in stereo, some of which are used today and some not. Some 70 claims include:\n\n\nBlumlein began binaural experiments as early as 1933, and the first stereo discs were cut later the same year, twenty-five years before that method became the standard for stereo phonograph discs. These discs used the two walls of the groove at right angles in order to carry the two channels.\n\nMuch of the development work on this system for cinematic use did not reach completion until 1935. In Blumlein's short test films (most notably, \"Trains at Hayes Station\", which lasts 5 minutes 11 seconds, and, \"The Walking & Talking Film\"), his original intent of having the sound follow the actor was fully realised.\n\nIn 1934, Blumlein recorded Mozart's \"Jupiter Symphony\" conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham at Abbey Road Studios in London using his vertical-lateral technique.\n\nIn the United States, Harvey Fletcher of Bell Laboratories was also investigating techniques for stereophonic recording and reproduction. One of the techniques investigated was the \"wall of sound\", which used an enormous array of microphones hung in a line across the front of an orchestra. Up to 80 microphones were used, and each fed a corresponding loudspeaker, placed in an identical position, in a separate listening room. Several stereophonic test recordings, using two microphones connected to two styli cutting two separate grooves on the same wax disc, were made with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra at Philadelphia's Academy of Music in March 1932. The first (made on March 12, 1932), of Scriabin's \"\", is the earliest known surviving intentional stereo recording.\n\nBell Laboratories gave a demonstration of three-channel stereophonic sound on April 27, 1933, with a live transmission of the Philadelphia Orchestra from Philadelphia to Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. over multiple Class A telephone lines. Leopold Stokowski, normally the orchestra's conductor, was present in Constitution Hall to control the sound mix. Five years later, the same system would be expanded onto multi-channel film recording and used from the concert hall in Philadelphia to the recording labs at Bell Labs in New Jersey in order to record Walt Disney's \"Fantasia\" (1940) in what Disney called Fantasound.\nLater that same year, Bell Labs also demonstrated binaural sound, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933 using a dummy with microphones instead of ears, . The two signals were sent out over separate AM station bands.\n\nUtilizing selections recorded by the Philadelphia Orchestra, under the direction of Leopold Stokowski, intended for but not used in Walt Disney's \"Fantasia\", the Carnegie Hall demonstration by Bell Laboratories on April 9 and 10, 1940, used three huge speaker systems. Synchronization was achieved by making the recordings in the form of three motion picture soundtracks recorded on a single piece of film with a fourth track being used to regulate volume expansion.\n\nThis was necessary due to the limitations of dynamic range on optical motion picture film of the period, however the volume compression and expansion were not fully automatic, but were designed to allow manual studio \"enhancement\"; i.e., the artistic adjustment of overall volume and the relative volume of each track in relation to the others. Stokowski, who was always interested in sound reproduction technology personally participated in the \"enhancement\" of the sound at the demonstration.\n\nThe speakers produced sound levels of up to 100 decibels, and the demonstration held the audience \"spellbound, and at times not a little terrified\", according to one report. Sergei Rachmaninoff, who was present at the demonstration, commented that it was \"marvellous\" but \"somehow unmusical because of the loudness.\" \"Take that \"Pictures at an Exhibition\"\", he said. \"I didn't know what it was until they got well into the piece. Too much 'enhancing', too much Stokowski.\"\n\nIn 1937, Bell Laboratories in New York City gave a demonstration of two-channel stereophonic motion pictures, developed by Bell Labs and Electrical Research Products, Inc. Once again, conductor Leopold Stokowski was on hand to try out the new technology, recording onto a special proprietary nine-track sound system at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, during the making of the movie \"One Hundred Men and a Girl\" for Universal Pictures in 1937, after which the tracks were mixed down to one for the final soundtrack. A year later, MGM started using three tracks instead of one to record the musical selections of movie soundtracks, and very quickly upgraded to four. One track was used for dialogue, two for music, and one for sound effects. The purpose for this form of multitrack recording was to make mixing down to a single optical track easier and was not intended to be a recording for stereophonic purposes. The very first two-track recording MGM made (although released in mono) was \"It Never Rains But What It Pours\" by Judy Garland, recorded on June 21, 1938, for the movie \"Love Finds Andy Hardy\".\n\nWalt Disney began experimenting with multi-channel sound in the early 1930s as noted above. The first commercial motion picture to be exhibited with stereophonic sound was Walt Disney's \"Fantasia\", released in November 1940, for which a specialized sound process (Fantasound) was developed. As in the Carnegie Hall demonstrations six months earlier, Fantasound used a separate film containing four optical sound tracks. Three of the tracks were used to carry left, center and right audio, while the fourth track carried three tones which individually controlled the volume level of the other three. The film was not a financial success, however, and after two months of road-show exhibition in selected cities, its soundtrack was remixed into mono sound for general release. It was not until its 1956 re-release that stereo sound was restored to the film. In the early 1940s, composer-conductor Alfred Newman directed the construction of a sound stage equipped for multichannel recording for 20th Century Fox studios. Several soundtracks from this era still exist in their multichannel elements, some of which have been released on DVD, including \"How Green Was My Valley\", \"Anna and the King of Siam\", \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"Sun Valley Serenade\" which, along with \"Orchestra Wives\", feature the only stereophonic recordings of the Glenn Miller Orchestra as it was during its heyday of the Swing Era.\n\nMotion picture theatres, however, are where the real introduction of stereophonic sound to the public occurred. Amid great fanfare, Stereo sound was officially proven commercially viable for the public on September 30, 1952 with the release of a Cinerama demonstration film by Lowell Thomas and Mike Todd titled \"This is Cinerama\". The format was a spectacular widescreen process featuring three separate 35mm motion picture films (plus a separate sound film) running in synchronization with one another at 26 fps, adding one picture panel each to the viewer's left and right at 45 degree angles, in addition to the usual front and center panel, creating a truly immersive panoramic visual experience, comparable in some ways to today's curved screen IMAX OMNI.\n\nSimilarly, the Cinerama audio soundtrack technology, developed by Hazard E. Reeves, a pioneer in magnetic recording, utilized seven discrete sound tracks on full-coat magnetic 35mm film, in order to envelop the theatregoer in an aural experience just as spectacular as that playing on the screen: five main channels behind the screen, two surround channels in the rear of the theater, plus a sync-track to interlock the 4 machines, which were specially outfitted with aircraft servo-motors made by Ampex.\n\nThe advent of multi-track magnetic tape and film recording made high fidelity synchronized multichannel recording more technically straightforward, though costly. By the early 1950s, all of the major studios were recording on 35mm magnetic film for mixing purposes, and many of these so-called individual angles still survive, allowing for soundtracks to be remixed into Stereo or even Surround.\n\nIn April 1953, while \"This is Cinerama\" was still playing only in New York City, most moviegoing audiences heard stereophonic sound for the first time with \"House of Wax\", an early 3-D film starring Vincent Price and produced by Warner Bros. Unlike the 4-track mag release-print stereo films of the period which featured four thin strips of magnetic material running down the length of the film, inside and outside the sprocket holes, the sound system developed for \"House of Wax\", dubbed WarnerPhonic, was a combination of a 35 mm fully coated magnetic film that contained the audio tracks for Left-Center-Right, interlocked with the two dual-strip Polaroid system projectors, one of which carried a mono optical surround track and one that carried a mono backup track, should anything go wrong.\n\nOnly two other films featured this strange hybrid WarnerPhonic sound: the 3-D production of \"The Charge at Feather River\", and \"Island in the Sky\". Unfortunately, as of 2012, the stereo magnetic tracks to both these films are considered lost forever. In addition, a large percentage of 3-D films carried variations on three-track magnetic sound: \"It Came from Outer Space\"; \"I, the Jury\"; \"The Stranger Wore a Gun\"; \"Inferno\"; \"Kiss Me, Kate\"; and many others.\n\nInspired by Cinerama, the movie industry moved quickly to create simpler and cheaper widescreen systems, the first of which, Todd-AO, was developed by Broadway promoter Michael Todd with financial backing from Rodgers and Hammerstein, to use a single 70mm film running at 30 frames per second with 6 magnetic sound tracks, for their screen presentation of \"Oklahoma!\". Major Hollywood studios immediately rushed to create their own unique formats, such as Warner Bros. Panavision, Paramount Pictures' VistaVision and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation's CinemaScope, the latter of which used up to four separate magnetic sound tracks.\n\nVistaVision took a simplified, low-cost approach to stereophonic sound; its Perspecta system featured only a monaural track, but through subaudible tones, it could change the direction of the sound to come from the left, right or both directions at once.\n\nBecause of the standard 35 mm-size film, CinemaScope and its stereophonic sound was capable of being retrofitted into existing theaters. CinemaScope 55 was created by the same company in order to use a larger form of the system (55 mm instead of 35 mm) to allow for greater image clarity onscreen, and was supposed to have had 6-track stereo instead of four. However, because the film needed a new, specially designed projector, the system proved impractical, and the two films made in the process, \"Carousel\" and \"The King and I\", were released in 35 mm CinemaScope reduction prints. To compensate, the premiere engagement of \"Carousel\" used a six-track magnetic full-coat in an interlock, and a 1961 re-release of \"The King and I\", featured the film \"printed down\" to 70 mm, used a six-track stereo soundtrack as well.\n\nEventually, 50 complete sets of combination 55/35 mm projectors and \"penthouse\" reproducers were completed and delivered by Century and Ampex, respectively, and 55 mm release print sounding equipment was delivered by Western Electric. Several samples of 55 mm sound prints can be found in the Sponable Collection at the Film and Television Archives at Columbia University. The subsequently abandoned 55/35 mm Century projector eventually became the Century JJ 70/35MM projector.\n\nAfter this disappointing experience with their proprietary \"wide gauge\" system, Fox purchased the Todd-AO system and re-engineered it into a more modern 24 fps system with brand-new 65MM self-blimped production cameras (Mitchell BFC ... \"Blimped Fox Camera\") and brand-new 65MM MOS cameras (Mitchell FC ... \"Fox Camera\") and brand-new Super Baltar lenses in a wide variety of focal lengths, first employed on South Pacific. Essentially, although Todd-AO was also available to others, the format became Fox's premier origination and presentation apparatus, replacing CinemaScope 55. Current DVDs of the two CinemaScope 55 feature titles were transferred from the original 55mm negatives, often including the separate 35MM films as extras for comparison.\n\nHowever, beginning in 1957, films recorded in stereo (except for those shown in Cinerama or Todd-AO) carried an alternate mono track for theatres not ready or willing to re-equip for stereo. From then until about 1975, when Dolby Stereo was used for the first time in films, most motion pictures—even some from which stereophonic soundtrack albums were made, such as Zeffirelli's \"Romeo and Juliet\"—were still released in monaural sound, stereo being reserved almost exclusively for expensive musicals such as \"West Side Story\", \"My Fair Lady\", or \"Camelot\"; epics such as \"Ben-Hur\" or \"Cleopatra\". Stereo was also reserved for dramas with a strong reliance on sound effects or music, such as \"The Graduate\", with its Simon and Garfunkel score.\n\nToday, virtually all films are released in stereophonic sound as the Westrex Stereo Variable-Area system developed in 1977 for \"Star Wars\", which was no more expensive to manufacture in stereo than it was for mono. The format employs the same Western Electric/Westrex/Nuoptix RA-1231 recorder, and coupled with QS quadraphonic matrixing technology licensed to Dolby Labs from Sansui, this SVA system can produce the same Left, Center, Right and Surround sound of the original CinemaScope system of 1953 by using a single standard-width optical track. This important development finally brought stereo sound to so-called Flat (Non-Wide-Screen) films presented at the most common aspect ratio of 1.85:1 although a number of 'flat' films are photographed and presented at a ratio of 1.66:1, common in Europe or 1.75:1 common in museums.\n\nProducers often took advantage of the six magnetic soundtracks available for 70mm film release prints, and productions shot in either 65MM or to save money, in 35MM and then blown up to 70MM. In these instances, the 70MM prints would be mixed for stereo, while the 35MM reduction prints would be remixed for mono.\n\nSome films shot in 35MM, such as \"Camelot\", featured four-track stereophonic sound and were then \"blown-up\" to 70MM so that they could be shown on a giant screen with six-track stereophonic sound. Unfortunately however, many of these presentations were only pseudo stereo, utilizing a somewhat artificial six-track panning method. A process known somewhat derogatorily as the \"Columbia Spread\" was often used to synthesize Left Center and Right Center from a combination of Left and Center and Right and Center, respectively, or, for effects, the effect could be \"panned\" anywhere across the five stage speakers using a one-in/five-out pan pot. Dolby, who did not approve of this practice, which results in loss of separation, instead used the Left Centre and Right Centre channels for LFE (low-frequency enhancement) utilizing the bass units of the otherwise redundant intermediate front speakers, and later the unused HF capacity of these channels to provide for stereo surround in place of the mono surround.\n\nDolby Stereo was succeeded by Dolby Digital 5.1 in the cinema, which retained the Dolby Stereo 70mm 5.1 channel layout, and more recently with the introduction of digital cinema, Dolby Surround 7.1 and Dolby Atmos in 2010 and 2012 respectively.\n\nThe progress of stereophonic sound was paced by the technical difficulties of recording and reproducing two or more channels in synchronization with one another, and by the economic and marketing issues of introducing new audio media and equipment. A stereo system cost up to twice as much as a monophonic system, since a stereo system contains two preamplifiers, two amplifiers, and two speaker systems. In addition, the user would need an FM stereo tuner, to upgrade any tape recorder to a stereo model, and to have their phonograph fitted with a stereo cartridge. In the early days it was not clear whether consumers would think the sound was so much better as to be worth twice the price.\n\nEdison had been recording in a hill-and-dale or vertically modulated format on his cylinders and discs since 1877, and Berliner had been recording in a side-to-side or lateral format since shortly thereafter. Each format developed on its own trajectory until the late 1920s when electric recording on disc, utilizing a microphone surpassed acoustic recording where the performer needed to shout or play very loudly into what basically amounted to a megaphone in reverse.\n\nAt that time, AM radio had been around for roughly a decade, and broadcasters were looking for both better materials from which to make phonograph records as well as a better format in which to record them to play over the narrow and thus inherently noisy radio channel. As radio had been playing the same shellac discs available to the public, it was found that, even though the playback system was now electric rather than acoustic, the surface noise on the disc would mask the music after just a few plays.\n\nThe development of acetate, bakelite, and vinyl, and the production of radio broadcast transcriptions helped to solve this.\nOnce these considerably more quiet compounds were developed, it was discovered that the rubber-idler-wheel driven turntables of the period had a great deal of low-frequency rumble - but only in the lateral plane. So, even though with all other factors being equal, the lateral plane of recording on disc had the higher fidelity, it was decided to record vertically to produce higher-fidelity recordings on these new 'silent-surface' materials, for two reasons, the increase in fidelity and the incompatibility with home phonographs which, with their lateral-only playback systems would only produce silence from a vertically modulated disc.\n\nAfter 33-1/3 RPM recording had been perfected for the movies in 1927, the speed of radio program transcriptions was reduced to match, once again to inhibit playback of the discs on normal home consumer equipment. Even though the stylus size remained the same as consumer records at either 3 mils or 2.7 mils, the disc size was increased from 12-inches to the same 16-inches as those used in early talking pictures in order to prevent the practice even further. Now, not only could the records not be played on home equipment due to incompatible recording format and speed, they wouldn't even fit on the player either, which suited the copyright holders.\n\nDuring the same period engineers got a bright idea. Split the signal into two parts, bass and treble, and record the treble on its own track near the edge of the disc in a lateral format so that there would be no high-frequency distortion, and then record the bass on its own track in a vertical fashion to get rid of the rumble. Unfortunately, vertical grooves take up more space than lateral grooves; so when the bass track was full, starting halfway through the disc and ending up at the center, the treble track had a large amount of unused space at the end. The alternative was to record it at a wider pitch i.e. lines-per-inch in order to match up with the bass track and keep both styli in the same place, limiting the playing time to slightly longer than a single even at 33-1/3 RPM on a 12-inch disc.\n\nAnother failed experiment in the late 1920s and early '30s involved recording the left channel on the left side of the disc (when held vertically with its edge facing the user) and recording the right channel on the right side of the disc. These were manufactured on twin film-company recording lathes which ran in perfect sync with one another with no variation, and were capable of not only outside-in as well as inside-out recordings (see Radio Programming Vinyl Sequence under Gramophone record) but also counter-clockwise as well as conventional clockwise recording by mounting the cutting head wrong-way-out with a special adapter. One master was recorded conventionally and the other was recorded counterclockwise, each master was run separately through the plating process, lined up to match, and subsequently mounted in a press. This recording method was later used to record counter-clockwise discs by Mattel for one of its answers to the GAF Talking View Master in the mid-60s.\n\nThe dual-sided stereo disc was then played vertically, first in a system that featured two tonearms on the same post facing one another, and later on in an offset system where one tonearm was placed conventionally and the other tonearm was placed opposite, i.e. not only on the other side of the mechanism, but facing the other way as well so that both tonearms could start at the edge and play to the center. But, even with playing the disc vertically in a rotating clamp, the same trouble was observed with keeping the two tonearms in their respective synchronous revolutions. The system was developed further however and adapted so that a single tonearm could play one side of a record or the other in jukeboxes of the late 1930s and early '40s.\n\nFive years later, Bell Labs was experimenting with a two-channel Lateral-Vertical system, where the left channel was recorded laterally and the right channel was recorded vertically, still utilizing a standard 3-mil 78-RPM groove, over three times larger than the modern LP stylus of the late 20th Century. The trouble with that was, once again, all the low-frequency rumble was in the left channel and all the high-frequency distortion was in the right channel. Over a quarter of a century later, it was decided to tilt the recording head 45 degrees off to the right side so that both the low frequency rumble and high frequency distortion were shared equally by both channels, producing the 45/45 system we know today.\n\nIn 1952, Emory Cook (1913–2002), who already had become famous by designing new feedback disk-cutter heads to improve sound from tape to vinyl, took the two-channel high-fidelity system described above and developed a somewhat misnamed \"binaural\" record out of it, which consisted of the same two separate channels cut into two separate groups of grooves running next to each other as described above, i.e. one running from the edge of the disc to halfway through and the other starting at the halfway point and ending up towards the label, but he used two \"lateral\" grooves with a 500 Hz crossover in the inner track to try and compensate for the lower fidelity and high frequency distortion on the inner track.\n\nEach groove needed its own monophonic needle and cartridge on its own branch of tonearm, and each needle was connected to a separate amplifier and speaker. This setup was intended to give a demonstration at a New York audio fair of Cook's cutter heads rather than to sell the record; but soon afterward, the demand for such recordings and the equipment to play it grew, and Cook Records began to produce such records commercially. Cook recorded a vast array of sounds, ranging from railroad sounds to thunderstorms. By 1953, Cook had a catalog of about 25 stereo records for sale to audiophiles.\n\nThe first stereo recordings using magnetic tape were made in Germany in the early 1940s using Magnetophon recorders. Around 300 recordings were made of various symphonies, most of which were seized by the Red Army at the end of World War II. The recordings were of relatively high fidelity, thanks to the discovery of AC bias. A 1944 recording of Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 directed by Herbert von Karajan and the Orchester der Berliner Staatsoper and a 1944 or 1945 recording of Walter Gieseking playing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (with flak fire audible in the background) are the only recordings still known to exist.\n\nIn the US, stereo magnetic tape recording was demonstrated on standard 1/4-inch tape for the first time in 1952, using two sets of recording and playback heads, upside-down and offset from one another. A year later, Remington Records began recording a number of its sessions in stereo, including performances by Thor Johnson and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.\n\nLater that same year, more experimental stereo recordings were conducted with Leopold Stokowski and a group of New York studio musicians at RCA Victor Studios in New York City. In February 1954, the label also recorded a performance of Berlioz' masterpiece The \"Damnation of Faust\" by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Charles Munch, the success of which led to the practice of regularly recording sessions in stereo.\n\nShortly afterwards, RCA Victor recorded the last two NBC Radio broadcast concerts by famed conductor Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, on stereophonic magnetic tape, however they were never officially released, though they have long been available on pirated LPs and CDs. In the UK, Decca Records began recording sessions in stereo in mid-1954, and by that time even smaller labels in the U.S. such as Concertapes, Bel Canto and Westminster along with major labels such as RCA Victor began releasing stereophonic recordings on two-track prerecorded reel-to-reel magnetic tape, priced at twice or three times the cost of monaural recordings, which retailed for around $2.95 to $3.95 apiece for a standard monaural LP. Even two-track monaural tape which had to be flipped over halfway through and carried exactly the same information as the monaural LP - but without the crackles and pops - were being sold for $6.95.\n\nThe additional cost of stereo sound must be weighed against the economy of the time. In 1954 United States, the average weekly salary was $60. Apartment rent approximated $75–$100 a month for a two-room. Therefore, many of the two-track stereo tape recordings of the period were priced at a premium, upwards of $12.95-$18.95 a piece. A full-length album, when the corresponding mono LP was only $3.95, was cost prohibitive. In addition, the price of the stereophonic recorder upon which to play the records may have been equal to, or greater than, the cost of a new car.\n\nHowever, audiophiles, with little or no regard for the cost, bought them and the players anyway, and stereophonic sound came to at least a select few living rooms of the mid-1950s. Stereo recording became widespread in the music business by the 3rd quarter of 1957.\n\nIn November 1957, the small Audio Fidelity Records label released the first mass-produced stereophonic disc. Sidney Frey, founder and president, had Westrex engineers, owners of one of the two rival stereo disk-cutting systems, cut a disk for release before any of the major record labels could do so. Side 1 featured the Dukes of Dixieland, and Side 2 featured railroad and other sound effects designed to engage and envelop the listener. This demonstration disc was introduced to the public on December 13, 1957 at the Times Auditorium in New York City. Only 500 copies of this initial demonstration record were pressed and three days later, Frey advertised in \"Billboard Magazine\" that he would send a free copy to anyone in the industry who wrote to him on company letterhead. The move generated such a great deal of publicity that early stereo phonograph dealers were forced to demonstrate on Audio Fidelity Records.\n\nAlso in December 1957, Bel Canto Records, another small label, produced its own stereophonic demonstration disc on multicolored vinyl so that stereo dealers would have more than one choice for demonstration. With the supplied special turntables featuring a clear platter lighted from underneath to show off the color as well as the sound, the stunt worked even better for Bel Canto, whose roster of jazz, easy listening and lounge music, pressed onto their trademark Caribbean-blue vinyl sold well throughout 1958 and early into 1959.\n\nWhen Audio Fidelity released its stereophonic demonstration disc, there was no affordable magnetic cartridge on the market capable of playing it. After the release of other demonstration discs and the respective libraries from which they were culled, the other spur to the popularity of stereo discs was the reduction in price of a stereo cartridge, for playing the disks, from $250 to $29.95 in June 1958. The first four mass-produced stereophonic discs available to the buying public were released in March 1958—\"Johnny Puleo and his Harmonica Gang Volume 1\" (AFSD 5830), \"Railroad – Sounds of a Vanishing Era\" (AFSD 5843), \"Lionel – Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra\" (AFSD 5849) and \"Marching Along with the Dukes of Dixieland Volume 3\" (AFSD 5851). By the end of March, the company had four more stereo LPs available, interspersed with several Bel Canto releases.\n\nAlthough both monaural as well as stereo LP records were manufactured for the first ten years of stereo on disc, the major record labels issued their last monaural \"albums\" in 1968, relegating the format to 45 RPM singles, flexidiscs and radio promotional materials which continued until 1975.\n\nIn December 1925, the BBC's experimental transmitting station, 5XX, in Daventry, Northamptonshire, made radio's first stereo broadcast—a concert from Manchester, conducted by Sir Hamilton Harty—with 5XX broadcasting the right channel nationally by long wave and local BBC stations broadcasting the left channel by medium wave. The BBC repeated the experiment in 1926, using 2LO in London and 5XX at Daventry. Following experimental FM stereo transmissions in the London area in 1958 and regular Saturday morning demonstration transmissions using TV sound and medium wave (AM) radio to provide the two channels, the first regular BBC transmissions using an FM stereo signal began on the BBC's Third Programme network on August 28, 1962.\n\nChicago AM radio station WGN (and its sister FM station, WGNB) collaborated on an hourlong stereophonic demonstration broadcast on May 22, 1952, with one audio channel broadcast by the AM station and the other audio channel by the FM station. New York City's WQXR initiated its first stereophonic broadcasts in October 1952, and by 1954, was broadcasting all of its live musical programs in stereophonic sound, using its AM and FM stations for the two audio channels. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a weekly series of live stereophonic broadcasts in November 1952 by using two campus-based AM stations, although the listening area did not extend beyond the campus.\n\nTests of six competing FM-only systems were conducted on KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during July and August 1960. The Federal Communications Commission announced stereophonic FM technical standards in April 1961, with licensed regular stereophonic FM radio broadcasting set to begin in the United States on June 1, 1961. WEFM (in the Chicago area) and WGFM (in Schenectady, New York) were reported as the first stereo stations.\n\nA December 11, 1952 closed-circuit television performance of \"Carmen\", from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City to 31 theaters across the United States, included a stereophonic sound system developed by RCA. The first several shows of the 1958–59 season of \"The Plymouth Show\" (AKA \"The Lawrence Welk Show\") on the ABC (America) network were broadcast with stereophonic sound in 75 media markets, with one audio channel broadcast via television and the other over the ABC radio network. By the same method, NBC Television and the NBC Radio Network offered stereo sound for two three-minute segments of \"The George Gobel Show\" on October 21, 1958. On January 30, 1959, ABC's \"Walt Disney Presents\" made a stereo broadcast of \"The Peter Tchaikovsky Story\"—including scenes from Disney's latest animated feature, \"Sleeping Beauty\"—by using ABC-affiliated AM and FM stations for the left and right audio channels.\n\nWith the advent of FM stereo in 1961, a small number of music-oriented TV shows were broadcast with stereo sound using a process called simulcasting, in which the audio portion of the show was carried over a local FM stereo station. In the 1960s and 1970s, these shows were usually manually synchronized with a reel-to-reel tape delivered by mail to the FM station (unless the concert or music originated locally). In the 1980s, satellite delivery of both television and radio programs made this fairly tedious process of synchronization unnecessary. One of the last of these simulcast programs was \"Friday Night Videos\" on NBC, just before MTS stereo was approved by the FCC.\n\nThe BBC made extensive use of simulcasting between 1974 and around 1990. The first such transmission was in 1974, when the BBC broadcast a recording of Van Morrison's London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2. After that it was used for many other music programmes, live and recorded, including the annual BBC Promenade concerts and the Eurovision Song Contest. The advent of NICAM stereo sound with TV rendered this unnecessary.\n\nCable TV systems delivered many stereo programs utilizing this method for many years until prices for MTS stereo modulators dropped. One of the first stereo cable stations was The Movie Channel, though the most popular cable TV station that drove up usage of stereo simulcasting was MTV.\n\nJapanese television began multiplex (stereo) sound broadcasts in 1978, and regular transmissions with stereo sound came in 1982. By 1984, about 12% of the programming, or about 14 or 15 hours per station per week, made use of the multiplex technology. West Germany's second television network, ZDF, began offering stereo programs in 1984.\n\nIn 1979, \"The New York Times\" reported, \"What has prompted the [television] industry to embark on establishing high-fidelity [sound] standards now, according to engineering executives involved in the project, is chiefly the rapid march of the new television technologies, especially those that are challenging broadcast television, such as the video disk.\"\n\nMultichannel television sound, better known as MTS (often still as BTSC, for the Broadcast Television Systems Committee that created it), is the method of encoding three additional channels of audio into an NTSC-format audio carrier. It was adopted by the FCC as the United States standard for stereo television transmission in 1984.\nSporadic network transmission of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\"—although at the time, only the network's New York City flagship station, WNBC, had stereo broadcast capability. Regular stereo transmission of programs began in 1985.\n\nThis uses two parallel omnidirectional microphones some distance apart, capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as some level (amplitude) difference information—especially if employed in close proximity to the sound source(s). At a distance of about , the time delay (time-of-arrival difference) for a signal reaching the first microphone and then the other one from the side is approximately 1.5 ms (1 to 2 ms). If you increase the distance between the microphones, you effectively decrease the pickup angle. At a distance, it is approximately equivalent to the pickup angle of the near-coincident ORTF setup.\n\nThis technique can produce phase issues when the stereo signal is mixed to mono.\n\nHere, two directional microphones are at the same place, typically pointing at an angle between 90° and 135° to each other. The stereo effect is achieved through differences in sound pressure level between two microphones. A difference in levels of 18 dB (16 to 20 dB) is needed for hearing the direction of a loudspeaker. Due to the lack of differences in time-of-arrival/phase ambiguities, the sonic characteristic of X-Y recordings has less sense of space and depth when compared to recordings employing an A-B setup. When two figure-eight microphones are used, facing ±45° with respect to the sound source, the X-Y setup is called a Blumlein Pair. The sonic image produced is realistic.\n\n This coincident technique employs a bidirectional microphone facing sideways and another microphone at an angle of 90°, facing the sound source. The second microphone is generally a variety of cardioid, although Alan Blumlein described the usage of an omnidirectional transducer in his original patent.\n\nThe left and right channels are produced through a simple matrix: Left = Mid + Side; Right = Mid − Side (the polarity-reversed side signal). This configuration produces a completely mono-compatible signal and, if the Mid and Side signals are recorded (rather than the matrixed Left and Right), the stereo width can be manipulated after the recording has taken place. This makes it especially useful for film-based projects.\n\n These techniques combine the principles of both A-B and X-Y (coincident pair) techniques. For example, the ORTF stereo technique of the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (Radio France) calls for a pair of cardioid microphones placed 17 cm apart at a total angle between microphones of 110°, which results in a stereophonic pickup angle of 96° (\"Stereo Recording Angle\", or SRA). In the NOS stereo technique of the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Dutch Broadcasting Organisation), the total angle between microphones is 90° and the distance is 30 cm, thus capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as level information. It is noteworthy that all spaced microphone arrays and all near-coincident techniques use a spacing of at least 17 cm or more. 17 cm roughly equals the human ear distance and therefore provides the same interaural time difference (ITD) or more, depending on the spacing between microphones. Although the recorded signals are generally intended for playback over stereo loudspeakers, reproduction over headphones can provide remarkably good results, depending on the microphone arrangement.\n\nIn the course of restoration or remastering of monophonic records, various techniques of \"pseudo-stereo\", \"quasi-stereo\", or \"rechanneled stereo\" have been used to create the impression that the sound was originally recorded in stereo. These techniques first involved hardware methods (see Duophonic) or, more recently, a combination of hardware and software. Multitrack Studio, from Bremmers Audio Design (The Netherlands), uses special filters to achieve a pseudo-stereo effect: the \"shelve\" filter directs low frequencies to the left channel and high frequencies to the right channel, and the \"comb\" filter adds a small delay in signal timing between the two channels, a delay barely noticeable by ear, but contributing to an effect of \"widening\" original \"fattiness\" of mono recording.\n\nThe special pseudo-stereo circuit—invented by Kishii and Noro, from Japan—was patented in the United States in 2003, with already previously issued patents for similar devices. Artificial stereo techniques have been used to improve the listening experience of monophonic recordings or to make them more \"saleable\" in today's market, where people expect stereo. Some critics have expressed concern about the use of these methods.\n\nEngineers make a technical distinction between \"binaural\" and \"stereophonic\" recording. Of these, binaural recording is analogous to stereoscopic photography. In binaural recording, a pair of microphones is put inside a model of a human head that includes external ears and ear canals; each microphone is where the eardrum would be. The recording is then played back through headphones, so that each channel is presented independently, without mixing or crosstalk. Thus, each of the listener's eardrums is driven with a replica of the auditory signal it would have experienced at the recording location. The result is an accurate duplication of the auditory spatiality that would have been experienced by the listener had he or she been in the same place as the model head. Because of the inconvenience of wearing headphones, true binaural recordings have remained laboratory and audiophile curiosities. However \"loudspeaker-binaural\" listening is possible with Ambiophonics.\n\nNumerous early two-track-stereo reel-to-reel tapes as well as several experimental stereo disc formats of the early 1950s branded themselves as binaural, however they were merely different incarnations of the above-described stereo or two-track mono recording methods (lead vocal or instrument isolated on one channel and orchestra on the other sans lead.)\n\nStereophonic sound attempts to create an illusion of location for various sound sources (voices, instruments, etc.) within the original recording. The recording engineer's goal is usually to create a stereo \"image\" with localization information. When a stereophonic recording is heard through loudspeaker systems (rather than headphones), each ear, of course, hears sound from both speakers. The audio engineer may, and often does, use more than two microphones (sometimes many more) and may mix them down to two tracks in ways that exaggerate the separation of the instruments, in order to compensate for the mixture that occurs when listening via speakers.\n\nDescriptions of stereophonic sound tend to stress the ability to localize the position of each instrument in space, but this would only be true in a carefully engineered and installed system, where speaker placement and room acoustics are taken into account. In reality, many playback systems, such as all-in-one boombox units and the like, are incapable of recreating a realistic stereo image. Originally, in the late 1950s and 1960s, stereophonic sound was marketed as seeming \"richer\" or \"fuller-sounding\" than monophonic sound, but these sorts of claims were and are highly subjective, and again, dependent on the equipment used to reproduce the sound. In fact, poorly recorded or reproduced stereophonic sound can sound far worse than well done monophonic sound. When playing back stereo recordings, the best results are obtained by using two identical speakers, in front of and equidistant from the listener, with the listener located on a center line between the two speakers. In effect, an equilateral triangle is formed, with the angle between the two speakers around 60 degrees as seen from the listener's point of view.\n\nAlthough Decca had recorded Ansermet's conducting of \"Antar\" in stereo May 1954 it took four years for the first stereo LPs to be sold. In 1958, the first group of mass-produced stereo two-channel vinyl records was issued, by Audio Fidelity in the USA and Pye in Britain, using the Westrex \"45/45\" single-groove system. Whereas the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records, the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. One could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally, as on a monophonic recording, with the right channel information recorded with a \"hill and dale\" vertical motion; such systems were proposed but not adopted, due to their incompatibility with existing phono pickup designs (see below).\n\nIn the Westrex system, each channel drives the cutting head at a 45-degree angle to the vertical. During playback, the combined signal is sensed by a left-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the inner side of the groove and a right-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the outer side of the groove. The Westrex system provided for the polarity of one channel to be inverted: this way large groove displacement would occur in the horizontal plane and not in the vertical one. The latter would require large up-and-down excursions and would encourage cartridge skipping during loud passages.\n\nThe combined stylus motion is, in terms of the vector, the sum and difference of the two stereo channels. Effectively, all horizontal stylus motion conveys the L+R sum signal, and vertical stylus motion carries the L−R difference signal. The advantages of the 45/45 system are that it has greater compatibility with monophonic recording and playback systems.\n\nEven though a monophonic cartridge will technically reproduce an equal blend of the left and right channels, instead of reproducing only one channel, this was not recommended in the early days of stereo due to the larger stylus (1.0 mil vs 0.7 mil for stereo) coupled with the lack of vertical compliance of the mono cartridges available in the first ten years of stereo. These factors would result in the stylus 'digging into' the stereo vinyl and carving up the stereo portion of the groove, destroying it for subsequent playback on stereo cartridges. This is why one often notices the banner PLAY ONLY WITH STEREO CARTRIDGE AND STYLUS on stereo vinyl issued between 1958 and 1964.\n\nConversely, and with the benefit of no damage to any type of disc even from the beginning, a stereo cartridge reproduces the lateral grooves of monophonic recording equally through both channels, rather than through one channel. Also, it gives a more balanced sound, because the two channels have equal fidelity as opposed to providing one higher-fidelity laterally recorded channel and one lower-fidelity vertically recorded channel. Overall, this approach may give higher fidelity, because the \"difference\" signal is usually of low power, and is thus less affected by the intrinsic distortion of \"hill and dale\"-style recording.\n\nAdditionally, surface noise tends to be picked up in a greater capacity in the vertical channel, therefore a mono record played on a stereo system can be in worse shape than the same record in stereo and still be enjoyable. (See Gramophone record for more on lateral and vertical recording.)\n\nThis system was conceived by Alan Blumlein of EMI in 1931 and was patented in the U.K. the same year, but was not reduced to actual practice as was a requirement for patenting in the U.S. and elsewhere at that time. (Blumlein was killed in a plane crash while testing radar equipment during WW-II, and he, therefore, never reduced the system to actual practice through \"both\" a recording \"and\" a reproducing means.) EMI cut the first stereo test discs using the system in 1933, but it was not applied commercially until a quarter of a century later, and by another company (Westrex division of Litton Industries Inc, as a successor to Western Electric Company), and dubbed StereoDisk. Stereo sound provides a more natural listening experience, since the spatial location of the source of a sound is (at least in part) reproduced.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was common practice to generate stereo versions of music from monophonic master tapes, which were normally marked \"electronically reprocessed\" or \"electronically enhanced\" stereo on track listings. These were generated by a variety of processing techniques to try to separate out various elements; this left noticeable and unsatisfactory artifacts in the sound, typically sounding \"phasey\". However, as multichannel recording became increasingly available, it has become progressively easier to master or remaster more plausible stereo recordings out of the archived multitrack master tapes.\n\nThe Red Book CD specification includes two channels by default, and so a mono recording on CD either has one empty channel, or else the same signal being relayed to both channels simultaneously. However, noncommercial CDs in other formats such as White Book or Orange Book can feature up to four hours of stereo music on one CD for the purposes of extended programming in public spaces, such as malls.\n\nThese formats slightly reduce both the sampling frequency from 44.1 kHz as well as the bit-depth frequency from 16-bit and employ other proprietary technologies in order to increase the time on the disc and, as in the 16-inch transcriptions above - render them unplayable on the vast majority of consumer equipment.\n\nIn FM broadcasting, the Zenith-GE pilot-tone stereo system is used throughout the world.\n\nBecause of the limited audio quality of the majority of AM receivers, and also because AM stereo receivers are relatively scarce, relatively few AM stations employ stereo. Various modulation schemes are used for AM stereo, of which the best-known is Motorola's C-QUAM, the official method for most countries in the world that transmit in AM stereo. More AM stations are adopting digital HD Radio, which allows the transmission of stereo sound on AM stations; HD Radio's lack of compatibility with C-QUAM along with other interference issues has hindered HD Radio's use on the AM dial. For Digital Audio Broadcasting, MP2 audio streams are used. DAB is one of the Digital Radio formats that is used to broadcast Digital Audio over terrestrial broadcast networks or satellite networks. DAB is extended to video, and the new format is called DMB.\n\nIn Sweden, Televerket invented a different stereo broadcasting system called the \"Compander System\". It had a high level of channel separation and could even be used to broadcast two mono signals - for example for language studies (with two languages at the same time). But tuners and receivers with the pilot-tone system were sold so people in southern Sweden could listen to, for example, Danish radio. At last Sweden (the Televerket) decided to start broadcasting in stereo according to the pilot-tone system in 1977. But stereo radio was delayed in Sweden because of the two competing systems.\n\nFor analog TV (PAL and NTSC), various modulation schemes are used in different parts of the world to broadcast more than one sound channel. These are sometimes used to provide two mono sound channels that are in different languages, rather than stereo. Multichannel television sound is used mainly in the Americas. NICAM is widely used in Europe, except in Germany, where Zweikanalton is used. The EIAJ FM/FM subcarrier system is used in Japan. For Digital TV, MP2 audio streams are widely used within MPEG-2 program streams. Dolby Digital is the audio standard used for Digital TV in North America, with the capability for anywhere between 1 and 6 discrete channels.\n\nIn common usage, a \"stereo\" is a two-channel sound reproduction system, and a \"stereo recording\" is a two-channel recording. This is cause for much confusion, since five (or more)-channel home theater systems are not popularly described as \"stereo\".\n\nMost two-channel recordings are stereo recordings only in this weaker sense. Pop music, in particular, is usually recorded using close miking techniques, which artificially separate signals into several tracks. The individual tracks (of which there may be hundreds) are then \"mixed down\" into a two-channel recording. The audio engineers determine where each track will be placed in the stereo \"image\", by using various techniques that may vary from very simple (such as \"left-right\" panning controls) to more sophisticated and extensively based on psychoacoustic research (such as channel equalization, compression and ). The end product using this process often bears little or no resemblance to the actual physical and spatial relationship of the musicians at the time of the original performance; indeed, it is not uncommon for different tracks of the same song to be recorded at different times (and even in different studios) and then mixed into a final two-channel recording for commercial release.\n\nClassical music recordings are a notable exception. They are more likely to be recorded without having tracks dubbed in later as in pop recordings, so that the actual physical and spatial relationship of the musicians at the time of the original performance can be preserved on the recording.\n\nBalance can mean the amount of signal from each channel reproduced in a stereo audio recording. Typically, a balance control in its center position will have 0 dB of gain for both channels and will attenuate one channel as the control is turned, leaving the other channel at 0 dB.\n\n\"See also Panning\".\n\n"}

A loose adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel of the same name, the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the power of the sun, while facing the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, the \"Man with the Golden Gun\". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.\n\n\"The Man with the Golden Gun\" was the fourth and final film in the series directed by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz. The film was set in the face of the 1973 energy crisis, a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then popular martial arts film craze, with several kung fu scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macau. Part of the film is also set in Beirut, Lebanon, but it was not shot there.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. Christopher Lee's portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was generally praised, but reviewers criticized the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and Britt Ekland. Although the film was profitable, it is the fourth lowest grossing film in the series. It was also the last film to be co-produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in Danjaq, LLC, the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.\n\nIn London, a golden bullet with James Bond's code \"007\" etched into its surface is received by MI6. It is believed that it was sent by the famed assassin Francisco Scaramanga, who uses a golden gun, to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, M relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of the solar energy scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the energy crisis with solar power. Bond sets out unofficially to locate Scaramanga.\n\nAfter retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in Beirut and tracking its manufacturer to Macau, Bond encounters Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a casino. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her Peninsula Hotel room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the Bottoms Up Club. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next hit, Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's dwarf henchman Nick Nack steals the \"Solex agitator\", a key component of a solar power station. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and Q in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.\n\nBond then travels to Bangkok to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Siamese entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured and placed in Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.\n\nAnders visits Bond, revealing that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a Muay Thai venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders dead and meets Scaramanga. Bond observes the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a homing device on Scaramanga's car, she becomes trapped in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an AMC showroom car to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing Sheriff J.W. Pepper seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's car transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.\n\nPicking up Goodnight's tracking signal, Bond flies a seaplane into Red Chinese waters and lands at Scaramanga's island. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.\n\nScaramanga then proposes a pistol duel with Bond on the beach; the two men stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in the place of a mannequin of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the temperature of the helium cooling the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese junk. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.\n\n\nAlbert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman intended to follow \"You Only Live Twice\" with \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, leading to the production being cancelled. \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" or \"Diamonds Are Forever\". The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.\n\nBroccoli and Saltzman then decided to start production on \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" after \"Live and Let Die\". This was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with Broccoli was dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions's parent company, Danjaq, LLC, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", for three years.\n\nThe novel is mostly set in Jamaica, a location which had been already used in the earlier films, \"Dr. No\" and \"Live and Let Die\"; \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" saw a change in location to put Bond in the Far East for the second time. After considering Beirut, where part of the film is set, Iran, where the location scouting was done but eventually discarded because of the Yom Kippur War, and the Hạ Long Bay in Vietnam, the production team chose Thailand as a primary location, following a suggestion of production designer Peter Murton after he saw pictures of the Phuket bay in a magazine. Saltzman was happy with the choice of the Far East for the setting as he had always wanted to go on location in Thailand and Hong Kong. During the reconnaissance of locations in Hong Kong, Broccoli saw the wreckage of the former and came up with the idea of using it as the base for MI6's Far East operations.\n\nTom Mankiewicz wrote a first draft for the script in 1973, delivering a script that was a battle of wills between Bond and Scaramanga, who he saw as Bond's alter ego, \"a super-villain of the stature of Bond himself.\" Tensions between Mankiewicz and Guy Hamilton and Mankiewicz's growing sense that he was \"feeling really tapped out on Bond\" led to the re-introduction of Richard Maibaum as the Bond screenwriter.\n\nMaibaum, who had worked on six Bond films previously, delivered his own draft based on Mankiewicz's work. Much of the plot involving Scaramanga being Bond's equal was sidelined in later drafts. For one of the two main aspects of the plot, the screenwriters used the 1973 energy crisis as a backdrop to the film, allowing the MacGuffin of the \"Solex agitator\" to be introduced; Broccoli's stepson Michael G. Wilson researched solar power to create the Solex.\n\nWhile \"Live and Let Die\" had borrowed heavily from the blaxploitation genre, \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" borrowed from the martial arts genre that was popular in the 1970s through films such as \"Fist of Fury\" (1972) and \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973). However, the use of the martial arts for a fight scene in the film \"lapses into incredibility\" when Lt Hip and his two nieces defeat an entire \"dojo\".\n\nOriginally, the role of Scaramanga was offered to Jack Palance, but he turned the opportunity down. Christopher Lee, who was eventually chosen to portray Scaramanga, was Ian Fleming's step-cousin and Fleming had suggested Lee for the role of Dr. Julius No in the 1962 series opener \"Dr. No\". Lee noted that Fleming was a forgetful man and by the time he mentioned this to Broccoli and Saltzman they had cast Joseph Wiseman in the part. Due to filming on location in Bangkok, his role in the film affected Lee's work the following year, as director Ken Russell was unable to sign Lee to play The Specialist in the 1975 film \"Tommy\", a part eventually given to Jack Nicholson.\n\nTwo Swedish models were cast as the Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams. Ekland had been interested in playing a Bond girl since she had seen \"Dr. No\", and contacted the producers about the main role of Mary Goodnight. Hamilton met Adams in New York, and cast her because \"she was elegant and beautiful that it seemed to me she was the perfect Bond girl\". When Ekland read the news that Adams had been cast for \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", she became upset, thinking Adams had been selected to play Goodnight. Broccoli then called Ekland to invite her for the main role, as after seeing her in a film, Broccoli thought Ekland's \"generous looks\" made her a good contrast to Adams. Hamilton decided to put Marc Lawrence, whom he had worked with on \"Diamonds Are Forever\", to play a gangster shot dead by Scaramanga at the start of the film, because he found it an interesting idea to \"put sort of a Chicago gangster in the middle of Thailand\".\n\nFilming commenced on 6 November 1973 at the partly submerged wreck of the RMS \"Queen Elizabeth\", which acted as a top-secret MI6 base grounded in Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong. The crew was small, and a stunt double was used for James Bond. Other Hong Kong locations included the Hong Kong Dragon Garden as the estate of Hai Fat, which portrayed a location in Bangkok. The major part of principal photography started on 18 April 1974 in Thailand. Thai locations included Bangkok, Thon Buri, Phuket and the nearby Phang Nga Province, on the islands of Ko Khao Phing Kan () and Ko Tapu (). Scaramanga's hideout is on Ko Khao Phing Kan, and Ko Tapu is often now referred to as \"James Bond Island\" both by locals and in tourist guidebooks. The scene during the boxing match used an actual Muay Thai fixture at the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium.\n\n\"[A] car chase [in Bangkok occurred] near a [canal or] khlong on Krung Kasem Road\".\n\nProduction returned in late April to Hong Kong, and also to Macau, for that island is famous for its casinos, which Hong Kong lacks. Some scenes in Thailand had to be finished, and production had to move to studio work in Pinewood Studios; this included sets such as Scaramanga's solar energy plant and island interior. Academy Award winner Oswald Morris was hired to finish the job after cinematographer Ted Moore became ill. Morris was initially reluctant, as he did not like his previous experiences taking over other cinematographers' work, but accepted after dining with Broccoli. Production wrapped in Pinewood in August 1974.\n\nOne of the main stunts in the film consisted of stunt driver \"Bumps\" Willard (as James Bond) driving an AMC Hornet leaping a broken bridge and spinning around 360 degrees in mid-air about the longitudinal axis, doing an \"aerial twist\"; Willard successfully completed the jump on the first take. The stunt was shown in slow motion, for the scene was otherwise too fast. Composer John Barry added a slide whistle sound effect over the stunt, which Broccoli kept in despite thinking that it \"undercouped the stunt\". Barry later regretted his decision, thinking the whistle \"broke the golden rule\" as the stunt was \"for what it was all worth, a truly dangerous moment, ... true James Bond style\". The sound effect was described as \"simply crass\". The writer Jim Smith suggested that the stunt \"brings into focus the lack of excitement in the rest of the film and is spoilt by the use of 'comedy' sound effects.\" Eon Productions had licensed the stunt, which had been designed by Raymond McHenry. It was initially conceived at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (CAL) in Buffalo, New York as a test for their vehicle simulation software. After development in simulation, ramps were built and the stunt was tested at CAL's proving ground. It toured as part of the All American Thrill Show as the Astro Spiral before it was picked up for the film. The television programme \"Top Gear\" attempted to repeat the stunt in June 2008, but failed. The scene where Scaramanga's Matador flies was shot at Bovington Camp, with a model inspired by an actual car plane prototype. Bond's duel with Scaramanga, which Mankewicz said was inspired by the climactic faceoff in \"Shane\", was shortened as the producers felt it was causing pacing problems. The trailers featured some of the cut scenes.\n\nHamilton adapted an idea of his involving Bond in Disneyland for Scaramanga's funhouse. The funhouse was designed to be a place where Scaramanga could get the upper hand by distracting the adversary with obstacles, and was described by Murton as a \"melting pot of ideas\" which made it \"both a funhouse and a horror house\". While an actual wax figure of Roger Moore was used, Moore's stunt double Les Crawford was the cowboy figure, and Ray Marione played the Al Capone figure. The canted sets such as the funhouse and the \"Queen Elizabeth\" had inspiration from German Expressionism films such as \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\". For Scaramanga's solar power plant, Hamilton used both the Pinewood set and a miniature projected by Derek Meddings, often cutting between each other to show there was no discernible difference. The destruction of the facility was a combination of practical effects on the set and a destruction of the miniature. Meddings based the island blowing up on footage of the Battle of Monte Cassino.\n\nThree Golden Gun props were made; a solid piece, one that could be fired with a cap and one that could be assembled and disassembled, although Christopher Lee said that the process \"was extremely difficult.\" The gun was \"one of the more memorable props in the Bond series\" and consisted of an interlocking fountain pen (the barrel), cigarette lighter (the bullet chamber), cigarette case (the handle) and cufflink (the trigger) with the bullet secured in Scaramanga's belt buckle. In the film, the gun was designed to accept a single 4.2-millimetre, 23-carat gold bullet produced by Lazar, a gunsmith in Macau who specialized in custom weapons and ammunition. The Golden Gun ranked sixth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll of the most popular film weapons, which surveyed approximately 2,000 film fans.\n\nOn 10 October 2008, it was discovered that one of the golden guns used in the film, which is estimated to be worth around £80,000, was missing (suspected stolen) from Elstree Props, a company based at Hertfordshire studios.\n\nThe theme tune to \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", released in 1974, was performed by Scottish singer Lulu and composed by John Barry. Tony Bramwell, who worked for Harry Saltzman's music publishing company Hilary Music, wanted Elton John or Cat Stevens to sing the title song. However, by this time the producers were taking turns producing the films; Albert Broccoli—whose turn it was to produce—rejected Bramwell's suggestions. The lyrics to the Lulu song were written by Don Black and have been described variously as \"ludicrous\", \"inane\" and \"one long stream of smut\", because of their sexual innuendo. Bramwell subsequently dismissed the Barry-Lulu tune as \"mundane\".\n\nAlice Cooper wrote a song titled \"Man with the Golden Gun\" to be used by the producers of the film, but they opted for Lulu's song instead. Cooper released his song in his album \"Muscle of Love\".\n\nBarry had only three weeks to score \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" and the theme tune and score are generally considered by critics to be among the weakest of Barry's contributions to the series, an opinion shared by Barry himself: \"It's the one I hate most ... it just never happened for me.\" \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" was also the first to drop the distinctive plucked guitar from the theme heard over the gun barrel opening. A sample from one of the songs, \"Hip's Trip\", was used by The Prodigy in the \"Mindfields\" track on the album \"The Fat of the Land\".\n\n\"The Man with the Golden Gun\" was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on , with general release in the United Kingdom the same day. The film was made with an estimated budget of $7 million; despite initial good returns from the box office, \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" grossed a total of $97.6 million at the worldwide box office, with $21 million earned in the USA, making it the fourth lowest-grossing Bond film in the series.\n\nThe promotion of the film had \"one of the more anaemic advertising campaigns of the series\" and there were few products available, apart from the soundtrack and paperback book, although Lone Star Toys produced a \"James Bond 007 pistol\" in gold; this differed from the weapon used by Scaramanga in the film as it was little more than a Walther P38 with a silencer fitted.\n\n\"The Man with the Golden Gun\" met with mixed reviews upon its release. Derek Malcolm in \"The Guardian\" savaged the film, saying that \"the script is the limpest of the lot and ... Roger Moore as 007 is the last man on earth to make it sound better than it is.\" There was some praise from Malcolm, although it was muted, saying that \"Christopher Lee ... makes a goodish villain and Britt Ekland a passable Mary Goodnight ... Up to scratch in production values ... the film is otherwise merely a potboiler. Maybe enough's enough.\" Tom Milne, writing in \"The Observer\", was even more caustic, writing that \"This series, which has been scraping the bottom of the barrel for some time, is now through the bottom ... with depressing borrowings from Hong Kong kung fu movies, not to mention even more depressing echoes of the 'Carry On' smut.\" He summed up the film by saying it was \"sadly lacking in wit or imagination.\"\n\nDavid Robinson, the film critic at \"The Times\", dismissed the film and Moore's performance, saying that Moore was \"substituting non-acting for Connery's throwaway\", while Britt Ekland was \"his beautiful, idiot side-kick ... the least appealing of the Bond heroines.\" Robinson was equally damning of the changes in the production crew, observing that Ken Adam, an \"attraction of the early Bond films,\" had been \"replaced by decorators of competence but little of his flair.\" The writers \"get progressively more naive in their creation of a suburban dream of epicureanism and adventure.\" Writing for \"The New York Times\", Nora Sayre considered the film to suffer from \"poverty of invention and excitement\", criticising the writing and Moore's performance and finding Villechaize and Lee as the only positive points for their \"sinister vitality that cuts through the narrative dough.\"\n\nThe \"Sunday Mirror\" critic observed that \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" \"isn't the best Bond ever\" but found it \"remarkable that Messrs. Saltzman and Broccoli can still produce such slick and inventive entertainment\". Arthur Thirkwell, writing in the \"Sunday Mirror\"s sister paper, the \"Daily Mirror\" concentrated more on lead actor Roger Moore than the film itself: \"What Sean Connery used to achieve with a touch of sardonic sadism, Roger Moore conveys with roguish schoolboy charm and the odd, dry quip.\" Thirkwell also said that Moore \"manages to make even this reduced-voltage Bond a character with plenty of sparkle.\" Judith Crist of \"New York Magazine\" gave a positive review, saying \"the scenery's grand, the lines nice and the gadgetry entertaining\", also describing the production as a film that \"capture[s] the free-wheeling, whooshing non-sense of early Fleming's fairy tale for grown-ups orientation\".\n\nJay Cocks, writing in \"Time\", focused on gadgets such as Scaramanga's flying car, as what is wrong with both \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" and the more recent films in the Bond series, calling them \"Overtricky, uninspired, these exercises show the strain of stretching fantasy well past wit.\" Cocks also criticised the actors, saying that Moore \"lacks all Connery's strengths and has several deep deficiencies\", while Lee was \"an unusually unimpressive villain\".\n\nOpinion on \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" has for the most part remained the same as it was in 1974 and as of November 2015, the film holds a 45% rating from Rotten Tomatoes (although these contain contemporary reviews), while Ian Freer of \"Empire\" found the film \"an entertaining 007 adventure, something that tonally, if not qualitatively, could happily sit within the Connery era.\" \"IGN\" chose \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" as the worst Bond film, claiming it \"has a great concept ... but the execution is sloppy and silly\", and \"Entertainment Weekly\" chose it as the fourth worst, saying that the \"plot is almost as puny as the sidekick\". On the other hand, Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the tenth best, with much praise for Christopher Lee's performance.\n\nSome critics saw the film as uninspired, tired and boring. Roger Moore was also criticised for playing Bond against type, in a style more reminiscent of Sean Connery, although Lee's performance received acclaim. Danny Peary wrote that \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" \"lacks invention ... is one of the least interesting Bond films\" and \"a very laboured movie, with Bond a stiff bore, Adams and Britt Ekland uninspired leading ladies\". Peary believes that the shootout between Bond and Scaramanga in the funhouse \"is the one good scene in the movie, and even it has an unsatisfying finish\" and also bemoaned the presence of Clifton James, \"unfortunately reprising his unfunny redneck sheriff from \"Live and Let Die.\"\"\n\nChris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" argues that Scaramanga is the best villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films, while listing Mary Goodnight among the worst Bond girls, saying that \"Ekland may have had one of the series' best bikinis, but her dopey, doltish portrayal was a turnoff as much to filmgoers as to fans of Ian Fleming's novels\". \"The Times\" put Scaramanga as the fifth best Bond villain in their list, and Ekland was the third in their list of the top 10 most fashionable Bond girls. \"Maxim\" listed Goodnight at fourth in their Top Bond Babes list, saying that \"Agent Goodnight is the clumsiest spy alive. But who cares as long as she's using her perfect bikini bottom to muck things up?\"\n\n"}

BGMs are now held at each World Scrabble Championship (taking place every odd year), and there are currently 24 member organisations.\n\nWESPA was created to represent the interests of international Scrabble competitors and national bodies worldwide. Its main functions are to promote global recognition of Scrabble as a serious competitive activity; to provide for the benefit of members in pursuing the game; to further the best interests of Scrabble and international tournament players; to represent such players in dealings with other bodies, including the trademark owners of the game; to promulgate and encourage international convergence towards common standards and norms (including international rules, word lists and ratings); to organise global competitions and events; to publish relevant material; and to maintain a website for the benefit of the game and its players.\n\nThe trademark for Scrabble is owned by Hasbro in North America and Mattel in the rest of the world.\n\nAchievements to date have included the preparation of a set of international rules, the publication of a WESPA-endorsed word list which is valid for international tournament play, and the promulgation of international Scrabble ratings.\n\nFollowing a six-month worldwide consultation process, the first version of WESPA's rules for global Scrabble was released in August 2009. The rules were based on key elements of existing rules that were in force in various national associations, which were synthesised to create global best practice. Following feedback from their use in various international tournaments, extensive reviews took place prior to the issue of version two in November 2010, which was used at the 2011 World Scrabble Championship in Warsaw, Poland, and other international events such as the Causeway Challenge. Version three was released in 2015.\n\nA number of national associations have adopted WESPA rules for domestic use, including the Association of British Scrabble Players.\n\nThe word source currently in use for international play, known as Collins Scrabble Words or CSW (formerly Official Scrabble Words or OSW) is not derived from a single dictionary, but combines three components: Collins (7th edition, 2005), Chambers (1998 edition) and TWL, the current Northern American wordlist. TWL (Tournament Word List) is a subset of CSW, but is itself drawn from a range of sources, mostly different editions of Webster's. North American tournaments generally use TWL alone for domestic play, but all tournaments under the auspices of WESPA must use CSW.\n\nThe current word list (CSW15) came into force internationally on 1 September 2015, including updates from the most recent editions of original OSW sources as well as eliminating some inconsistencies in previous editions. CSW15 contains over 275,000 words in total (up to the theoretical maximum fifteen letters in length), of which around 119,000 are up to eight letters in length. By contrast, TWL holds approximately two thirds as many words in total. CSW is therefore substantially larger than TWL and has a more international flavour, including a number of local or dialect words from around the world.\n\nInternational Scrabble ratings have been maintained since their inception by Bob Jackman in Sydney, Australia, using a variant of the Australian ratings calculation system. All tournaments played to WESPA rules are able to be rated within the system, and regular updates are posted on the WESPA website. The first rated tournament in the system was the 1993 World Scrabble Championship, which was held in New York.\n\nWESPA has established the criteria for running international Scrabble tournaments, and it is now mandatory for WESPA rules and the WESPA word list to be used. Tournament organisers are also required to pay a ratings levy on a fee per player basis, in order for the tournament to qualify for international rating.\n\nThe tournament committee oversees the calendar of international Scrabble events, and has also liaised with Mattel on a number of issues relating to the World Scrabble Championship (WSC), including the number of games to be played and the format of the finals. Furthermore, a country's allocated number of representatives may fluctuate for each WSC depending on the team performance in the previous event, and WESPA has ratified the formula for changes to team allocations. In short, after each event the participating countries are ranked according to the average individual finishing rank of their players; teams falling in the top half may be entitled to gain a player for next time, while teams in the bottom half may lose a player.\n\nFollowing the establishment of Mind Sports International, the title 'World Scrabble Championship' was claimed by that entity for official world titles (sanctioned by Mattel under licence). WESPA has undertaken to host biennial world events from 2015 onwards using the old WSC format, with teams qualifying from national organisations. The WESPA Championship 2015 was hosted in Perth, Australia, and the 2017 edition took place in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe World Youth Scrabble Championships, renamed WESPA Youth Cup for 2017 further to a naming issue with Mindsports Academy, have been organised annually since 2006 under the aegis of WESPA for players under 18 on qualification date. The Youth committee has also been active in promoting the game among young players worldwide, including training workshops held in various locations.\n\nThe WESPA committee is made up of nominees representing member nations, and the current Chair is Elie Dangoor (UK). Various subcommittees are charged with matters such as promotions and communications, ratings and tournaments, rules, dictionary and youth.\n\nThe first Chair of WESPA was Allan Simmons (UK) who led the organisation from inception through to 2008. He was succeeded by Bahrain-based Roy Kietzmann, who died in 2009 prior to the appointment of Elie Dangoor.\n\nWESPA has committee links with the two other major world Scrabble federations, FISF (Fédération Internationale de Scrabble Francophone) and FISE (Federación Internacional de Scrabble en Español).\n\nThe world-scrabble mailing list discusses international Scrabble matters and WESPA issues.\n\n"}
