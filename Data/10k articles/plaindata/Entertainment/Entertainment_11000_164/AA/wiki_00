The ultimate goal, however, is to create an arm using EAP as similar as possible to a human arm, which can beat any human in an arm wrestling competition. The competition aims to stimulate research in the field of electroactive polymers, as well as arouse interest both in the general public and among potential investors.\n\nThe first trial was held on March 7, 2005 at the International Society for Optical Engineering's (SPIE) 2005 Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices (EAPAD) conference in San Diego, California.

{"id": "164163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164163", "title": "Blueberry (comics)", "text": "Blueberry (comics)\n\nBlueberry is Western comic series created in the Franco-Belgian \"bandes dessinées\" (BD) tradition by the Belgian scriptwriter Jean-Michel Charlier and French comics artist Jean \"Mœbius\" Giraud. It chronicles the adventures of Mike Blueberry on his travels through the American Old West. Blueberry is an atypical western hero; he is not a wandering lawman who brings evil-doers to justice, nor a handsome cowboy who \"rides into town, saves the ranch, becomes the new sheriff and marries the schoolmarm.\" In any situation, he sees what he thinks needs doing, and he does it.\n\nThe series spawned out of the 1963 \"Fort Navajo\" comics series, originally intended as an ensemble narrative, but which quickly gravitated around the breakout character \"Blueberry\" as the main and central character after the first two stories, causing the series to continue under his name later on. The older stories, released under the \"Fort Navajo\" moniker, were ultimately reissued under the name \"Blueberry\" as well in later reprint runs. Two spin-offs series, La Jeunesse de Blueberry (Young Blueberry) and Marshal Blueberry, were created pursuant the main series reaching its peak in popularity in the early 1980s.\n\nIt has been remarked that during the 1960s, Blueberry \"was as much a staple in French comics as, say, \"The Avengers\" or \"The Flash\" here [in the USA].\"\n\nBorn on 30 October 1843 on Redwood Plantation near Augusta, Georgia, Michael Steven Donovan is the son of a rich Southern planter and starts out life as a decided racist. On the brink of the American Civil War, Donovan is forced to flee north after being framed for the murder of his fiancée Harriet Tucker's father, a plantation owner. On his flight toward the Kentucky border, he is saved by Long Sam, a fugitive African-American slave from his father's estate, who paid with his life for his act of altruism. Inspired when he sees a blueberry bush, Donovan chooses the surname \"Blueberry\" as an alias when rescued from his Southern pursuers by a Union cavalry patrol (during his flight war had broken out between the States). After enlisting in the Union Army, he becomes an enemy of discrimination of all kinds, fighting against the Confederates (although being a Southerner himself, first enlisting as a bugler in order to avoid having to fire upon his former countrymen), later trying to protect the rights of Native Americans. He starts his adventures in the Far West as a lieutenant in the United States Cavalry shortly after the war. On his many travels in the West, Blueberry is frequently accompanied by his trusted companions, the hard-drinking deputy Jimmy McClure, and later also by \"Red Neck\" Wooley, a rugged pioneer and army scout.\n\nIn his youth, Giraud had been a passionate fan of American Westerns and \"Blueberry\" has its roots in his earlier Western-themed works such as the \"Frank et Jeremie\" shorts, which were drawn for \"Far West\" magazine when he was only 18 – also having been his first sales as free-lancer – , the Western short stories he created for the magazines from French publisher (his first professional tenured employment as comic artist in the period 1956-1958), and his collaboration with Joseph \"Jijé\" Gillain on an episode of the latter's \"Jerry Spring\" series in 1960, which appeared in the Belgian comics magazine \"Spirou\" (\"\", issues 1192 – 1213, 1961), aside from his subsequent Western contributions to Benoit Gillian's (son of Jijé) short-lived comic magazine \"Bonux-Boy\" (1960/61). Directly before he started his apprenticeship at Jijé, Jean Giraud had already approached Jean-Michel Charlier on his own accord, asking him if he was interested in writing scripts for a new western series for publication in \"Pilote\", the just by Charlier co-launched legendary French comic magazine. Charlier refused on that occasion, claiming he never felt much empathy for the genre. Biographer though, has noted that Charlier, when he felt he was preaching to the choir, had the tendency to \"take liberties\" with actual events for dramatic effect. Charlier had in effect already written several Westerns, both comics and illustrated short prose stories, in the period 1949-1959 for various previous magazines. One such short entailed the text comic \"Cochise\" in \"Jeannot\" magazine, July 1957, dealing with the historical \"Bascom Affair\", which six years later would become the apotheosis of the first \"Blueberry\" story, \"Fort Navajo\". Furthermore, Charlier had already visited the South-West of the United States in 1960, resulting in several Native-American themed educational \"Pilote\" editorials.\n\nIn 1962, the magazine sent Charlier on a reporting assignment around the world for its editorials, and one of his last 1963 ports of call was Edwards Airforce Base in the Mojave Desert, California. He took the opportunity to (re-)discover the American West, returning to France with a strong urge to write a western. First he asked Jijé to draw the series, but Jijé, a lifelong friend and collaborator of Charlier, thought there would be a conflict of interest, since he was then a tenured artist at \"Spirou\", a competing comic magazine, which published his own Western comic \"Jerry Spring\", and in which he was very much invested. In his stead, Jijé proposed his protégé Giraud as the artist. A happy coincidence was that Giraud was also intimately familiar with the landscapes that had inspired Charlier, as he already had been on an extended stay of nine months in Mexico in 1956, where the endless blue skies and unending flat plains of Mexico's northern deserts had \"cracked open his mind\". Charlier and Giraud have also collaborated on another Western strip, \"Jim Cutlass\".\n\n\"Blueberry\" was first published in the October 31, 1963 issue of \"Pilote\" magazine – hence Charlier's corresponding October 30 birth-date for his fictional character, when the magazine was printed and ready for dissemination. Initially titled \"Fort Navajo\", the story grew into 46 pages over the following issues. In this series Blueberry – whose physical appearance was inspired by French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo – was only one of many protagonists; the series was originally intended to be an assemble narrative, but quickly gravitated towards Blueberry as the central and primary character, even though the series' (sub-)title \"Fort Navajo, une Aventure du Lieutenant Blueberry\" was maintained for a decade by original publisher Dargaud for the numerous reprint, and international, runs, before the \"Fort Navajo\" (sub-)moniker was finally dropped in 1973 with the book publication of \"L'homme qui valait 500 000 $\" (\"The Half-a-Million Dollar Man\"). Charlier came up with the name during his American trip: \"When I was traveling throughout the West, I was accompanied by a fellow journalist who was just in love with blueberry jam, so much in love, in fact, that I had nicknamed him 'Blueberry'. When I began to create the new series, and everything started to fall into place, I decided to reuse my friend's nickname, because I liked it and thought it was funny. [...] I had no idea that he would prove so popular that he would eventually take over the entire series, and later we would be stuck with that silly name!\" In an anecdote, Charlier related how caught off guard he had been, \"My memory is a somewhat like a sieve. In the first album, Blueberry was called Steve. I forgot that first name and then I named him Mike. So, in order to get things straight, I coined him Mike Steve Blueberry eventually; This kind of forgetfulness happens to me often.\"\n\nDue to the fact that Blueberry became the most popular character so early on in the \"Fort Navajo\" story-arc, Charlier was forced to do an about-face and started to write out the other main characters he had in place in order to make room for Blueberry. However, in one instance that had an unexpected side effect; when Charlier killed off the Native-American lieutenant Crowe in the fifth and last installment of the story-arc, \"La piste des Navajos\" (\"Trail of the Navajo\"), the editorial offices of \"Pilote\" received many angry letters from readers accusing Charlier of murdering a sympathetic protagonist. Taken aback, Charlier later stated, \"It was too late to do anything about it, it was done. A strange experience, Giraud in particular took it very hard.\" Still, while all characters slated for prominence were written out, Blueberry excepted, one major, recurrent secondary character was written in over the course of the story arc in \"Le cavalier perdu\" (\"Mission to Mexico\"), Blueberry's trusted friend and sidekick Jimmy McClure. Actually, and by his own admission, Charlier had originally written McClure as a temporary, minor background character, but Giraud was so taken with the character that he asked Charlier to expand his role in the series, and which stands out as the earliest known instance of Giraud exercising influence on the scripts of his senior colleague.\n\nIn post-war Europe, it has been tradition to release comics in \"pre-publication\" as serialized magazine episodes, before publication as a comic book, or rather comic album (in North-American understanding though, \"graphic novel\" is the more applicable terminology in this case, the distinction being a non-issue in native France), typically with a one to two year lag. In French, \"Blueberry\" has firstly seen pre-publication in \"Pilote\" (issue 210, 31 October 1963 – issue 720, 23 August 1973) and \"\" (issue 1, 1 July 1963 – issue 9, 19 October 1970) from publisher Dargaud, the parent and main publisher of \"Blueberry\", with Giraud frequently creating original \"Blueberry\" art for the magazine covers and illustrations for editorials, aside from creating on occasion summarizing, introduction plates, none of which reprinted in the original book editions. Nonetheless, much of this material did find its way in later reprint variations, particularly in the editorials of the 2012 (trade) main series anthology collection – invariably called \"integrals\" in their respective languages in mainland Europe – of parent publisher Dargaud, and in those of their licensees such as Egmont for their earlier German/Danish/Norwegian 2006-2011 all-series integral edition collection\n\nThe very first (French) \"Blueberry\" comic album, \"Fort Navajo\", was released in September 1965 and originally appeared as the 17th (and last) volume of the \"La Collection Pilote\" series. Actually, this collection had been an initiative of Charlier himself in his function as publishing co-editor, and the 17 titles in the collection were in effect Dargaud's first comic album releases, and an influential release at that. In order to give these releases a more \"mature\" image, the books were from the start executed as hard cover editions. Favorably received and though not being the first, the hard cover format became the norm in France definitively, where henceforth all comic albums were executed in the format – becoming indeed generally accepted as a mature part of French culture eventually – , whereas the vast majority of the other European countries continued to employ the soft cover format for decades to come, somewhat reflecting the status comic books had in their societies at the time. These included for the time being French-Belgium as well, Charlier's native country, where exactly the same collection was concurrently licensed to, and released by Le Lombard, albeit as soft cover only. Charlier's initiative was not entirely devoid of a healthy dose of self-interest, as over half the releases in the collection, were, aside from \"Blueberry\", titles from other comic series he had co-created. After \"Fort Navajo\", the collection was suspended and each comic hero hitherto featured therein, spun off in book series of their own, including \"Blueberry\" or rather \"Fort Navajo, une Aventure du Lieutenant Blueberry\" as it was then still coined.\n\nAfter Dargaud had lost publishing rights for over a decade for new \"Blueberry\" titles to firstly German publisher and subsequently to Belgian publisher , as a result from a conflict with the creators over \"Blueberry\" royalties, the series has seen, predominantly one-time only, French pre-publication in such comic magazines as \"Métal Hurlant\", \"L'Écho des savanes\" and \"\". Other European countries followed the same template with local magazines. However, the format, for decades a staple in Europe and shaping entire generations of comic readers, went out of vogue in the late 1980s/early 1990s and the vast majority of European comic magazines have since then become defunct by the mid 1990s, including those from Belgium, the country were the phenomenon was born in the late 1930s. Ironically, while \"Le bout de la piste\" (\"The End of the Trail\") and \"Arizona Love\" became main series titles to see serialized pre-publication elsewhere, neither were serialized as such in France itself, where \"La tribu fantôme\" (\"The Ghost Tribe\") had previously become the very last \"Blueberry\" title pre-published as such in \"L'Écho des savanes\". Henceforth, new \"Blueberry\" titles were directly released in album format, starting with the 1990 \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" (\"Young Blueberry\") title, \"Le raid infernal\". Any subsequent French magazine, or newspaper serialized publication occurred \"after\" the initial book release while \"Blueberry\" was housed at Novedi and its successor, Swiss publisher , and which had actually already included \"Angel Face\" in \"Nouveau Tintin\", and \"La dernière carte\" (\"The Last Card\") in \"Spirou\" previously, both having been serialized after their respective book releases.\n\nAfter Charlier had died on 10 July 1989, Giraud, aside from completing \"Arizona Love\" on his own, wrote and drew five albums, from \"Mister Blueberry\" to \"Dust\" (constituting the \"OK Corral\" story arc), until his own death in 2012. Additionally, Giraud also scripted the intermezzo series \"Marshal Blueberry\" (1991-2000), but had no creative input for the \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" prequel series, after the first three, original volumes.\n\nBy the time Giraud embarked on the \"OK Corral\" cycle, publishing rights had returned to Dargaud, and that publisher decided to revitalize the magazine serialized pre-publication format as part of their marketing effort on behalf of \"Blueberry\"s return (see \"below\"), albeit with a twist; As Dargaud no longer had a comic magazine of their own (\"Pilote\" had become defunct in 1989), it was decided to farm out pre-publication to parties who showed the most interest, resulting in that \"Blueberry\" titles in that cycle became serialized in different publications, not all necessarily comic-related by origin. The summer of 1997 saw the serialization of \"Ombres sur Tombstone\" in the French daily newspaper \"Le Monde\", followed by the pre-publication of \"Géronimo l’Apache\" in the monthly \"\" comic magazine, directly before the album release in October 1999 as part of Dargaud's substantial marketing campaign for the album. The next title, \"OK Corral\", was published in a similar manner in the summer of 2003 in the \"L'ExpressMag\" appendix of the non-comic weekly news magazine \"L'Express\".\n\nThe mere fact that serious newspapers and magazines were by then vying for the opportunity to run \"Blueberry\" in their publications first (aside from the above-mentioned publications, the newspaper \"France-Soir\" had already run the first two outings of the revitalized \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" series in 1985 and 1987 – see \"below\"), was testament to the status \"Blueberry\" and its creator(s) had by then attained in French society.\n\nWith the growing popularity of \"Blueberry\" came the increasing disenchantment over financial remunerations of the series. Already in 1974, Charlier made his displeasure known in this regard, when he had \"Angel Face\" pre-published in \"Nouveau Tintin\" of industry competitor Le Lombard, the very first time a \"Blueberry\" adventure was not serialized in \"Pilote\" – nor would it ever be again in hindsight. The magazine was forced to drop the announcement page it had prepared for the story. Unfazed, Dargaud founder and owner , unwilling to give in, countered by having the book released before \"Nouveau Tintin\" had even had the chance to run the story. Then Giraud left on his own accord. While Charlier had no influence on this whatsoever, it did serve a purpose as far as he was concerned. Giraud had left \"Blueberry\" on a cliff-hanger with \"Angel Face\", resulting in an insatiable demand for more, putting the pressure on Dargaud. Whenever Georges Dargaud asked Charlier for a next \"Blueberry\" adventure, repeatedly, Charlier was now able to respond that he was \"devoid of inspiration\".\n\nAs a matter of fact, Giraud was dying to leave \"Pilote\" and \"Blueberry\", partly because he was tired of the stifling publication pressure he was under in order to produce the series, partly because of the royalties conflict, but \"mostly\" because he wanted to further explore and develop his \"Mœbius\" alter ego. For Giraud the conflict was actually a godsend, \"At that moment Charlier and I also had a financial conflict with Dargaud which came at the exact right time, because it provided me with an alibi [to leave]\". The latter reason for him to leave, took on an urgency after Alejandro Jodorowsky, impressed by his \"Blueberry\" art, had already invited Giraud to come over to Los Angeles to work as concept designer and storyboard artist on his \"Dune\" movie project earlier that year, constituting the first Jodorowsky/Mœbius collaboration. Very eager to return to Los Angeles as Jodorowksy requested his presence again, Giraud – who had returned to France for his other work during one of the lulls in the \"Dune\" production – greatly accelerated his work on \"Angel Face\", then underway, breaking his \"absolute record speed-drawing\", as he had coined it, and sheared off weeks from its originally intended completion date. Giraud in overdrive was so fast that he even overtook Charlier's script pages (Charlier habitually fed his artists piecemeal with script pages, usually a couple at the time), forcing him to write ten pages of the story on his own, as Charlier was at that time on documentary assignment in the United States for French television. Upon his return, Charlier took one look at the pages completed in his absence, and continued where Giraud had left off without further much ado. Charlier himself had actually already left Dargaud in 1972, because he additionally felt ill at ease with the editorial modernization of \"Pilote\", which resulted from the 1968 revolt at the editorial offices staged by key artists, chief among them Giraud (see also: \"Giraud on his part in the uprising at Pilote\"). Though Charlier continued to provide his younger colleague with scripts (but not his other artists), he started working as documentary maker for French television. It was while he was working on two documentaries on the Mexican Revolution that he gained inspiration for his below-mentioned \"Les Gringos\" Western comic series, which started its run in 1979 at Koralle.\n\nIt was the first time that Giraud wrote for \"Blueberry\" by himself, and was, considering Charlier's easy acceptance of Giraud's writing, also testament to the close, and trusting working relationship both men had cultivated by that time. Incidentally, Giraud intimated that the deteriorating circumstances at \"Pilote\" had already left its mark on him before he left, \"The story was started in 1972/73 but remained shelved until 1975 [sic.]. Yet, I think one can not discern its difficult birth; there are good scenes, pages I really poured heart and soul into. It is true that [the art for] \"Le hors-la-loi\" (\"The Outlaw\") had been quite weak, but \"Angel Face\" made up for it\".\n\nFive years later, Giraud was ready to return to \"Blueberry\", at long last feeling the urge again to do so, but \"not\" into the employ of \"Pilote\"/Dargaud, as he had formally terminated his position in 1974 with no intention whatsoever to return, instead plying his \"Blueberry\" trade as a freelancer, \"Publishers were waving with those fat checks, so we started again. But it is no longer the same. I won't be taken in by \"Blueberry\" anymore!\", referring to the first half of the 1970s when he felt smothered by his co-creation. Yet, the whole business surrounding \"Blueberry\" residuals itself remained unresolved, and in order to drive home the point the pe-publication of the eagerly awaited \"Nez Cassé\" (\"Broken Nose\") story was farmed out to \"Métal Hurlant\" magazine (published by Les Humanoïdes Associés, co-founded by Giraud in 1974, and in the US released as \"Heavy Metal\" in the mid-1970s, though the story was not run in the American version), instead of \"Pilote\". That Charlier was able to repeat this ploy after \"Angel Face\" stemmed from the proviso he had built in when he signed over the publication, and copyrights of his syndication agency EdiFrance/EdiPresse – co-established in 1955 with Victor Hubinon, Albert Uderzo, and René Goscinny for the express purpose to syndicate their own and other artist's comic creations – to Dargaud in 1960. On that occasion Charlier, owning a law degree, stipulated an exemption clause for magazine (pre-)publications of his own (co-)creations. Though never intended as such, the hitherto dormant exemption clause now served him well in his conflict with Dargaud, without having to fear for any legal ramifications on Dargaud's part. Yet, Georges Dargaud refused to take the bait and the creators subsequently put forward the \"Jim Cutlass\" western comic as a last ditch effort to spell out to Dargaud that the creators had other options. Dargaud still would not budge. It was then that it became clear to Charlier, that he was left with no other option than to leave, and this he did taking all his other co-creations with him, to wit \"Redbeard\" and \"Tanguy et Laverdure\", which, while not as popular as \"Blueberry\", were steady money making properties for Dargaud nonetheless.\n\nThough they were still contractually obligated to leave their most recent \"Blueberry\" title, \"Nez Cassé\", at Dargaud for book publication, Charlier and Giraud then threw in their lot with German publisher Koralle-Verlag – incidentally the first German language \"Blueberry\" book publisher back in the early 1970s – , a subsidiary at the time of German media giant Axel Springer SE, for their next publication, \"La longue marche\" (\"The Long March\"). The choice for the German publisher was made for their very ambitious international expansion strategy they had in place at that time. Fully subscribing to the publisher's strategy, Charlier not only revitalized his \"Redbeard\" and \"Tanguy et Laverdure\" comic series – having been equally \"devoid of inspiration\" for these as well in the 1974-1979 \"Pilote\"-era because of the royalties issue – , but created the new Western comic, \"Les Gringos\" (art by Victor de la Fuente), as well. Yet, for all Charlier's business acumen, he had failed to recognize that Koralle's exuberant expansion drive had essentially been a do-or-die effort on their part. In 1978 Koralle was on the verge of bankruptcy, and a scheme was devised to stave off this fate; international expansion. In the European comics world that was a rather novel idea at the time and Koralle did expand beyond the German border into large parts of Europe with variants of their main publication \"\" magazine, with the revived \"Blueberry\" as its flagship, accompanied with comic book releases. It did not pay off however, as the holding company already pulled the plug in 1980, leaving \"Blueberry\" and the others quite unexpectedly without a publishing home.\n\nIt were not only the \"Blueberry\" creators that were left in a pickle, as Koralle had managed to convince other well known Franco-Belgian comic artists to switch sides. Aside from Giraud's old mentor Jijé (who, having abandoned his own \"Jerry Spring\" Western comic, was now penciling Charlier's revitalized \"Redbeard\" and \"Tanguy et Laverdure\"), these predominantly concerned artists from publishing house Le Lombard. The most prominent of the latter was Hermann Huppen with his new post-apocalyptic Western \"Jeremiah\" for which he had abandoned that other famed 1970s Franco-Belgian Western, \"\" (written by Greg), second only in renown after \"Blueberry\" at the time. Tapping into his substantial social Franco-Belgian comic network, Charlier found Jacques de Kezel – a highly influential behind-the-scenes figure of the Belgian comic world at those times, and who had actually gathered the stable of artists for Koralle – willing for Axel Springer to pass the torch to. As a token of goodwill, a relieved Springer, as they now could turn over the current contractual obligations without much further ado, even allowed the French-language version of \"Zack\", \"Super As\", to run for a few issues longer in order to allow as many series as possible to complete their magazine run, which included \"La longue marche\". De Kezel's new publishing house (Novedi) was established in November 1980 with its seat in Brussels, Belgium. Part of their strategy was to forego on a magazine of their own and instead release titles directly in album format, as it was noticed that the serialized comic magazine format had already started to wane in Europe as a format (and actually one of the main reasons for Axel Springer to pull the plug on Koralle), resulting in the advantage of not having to incur the expenses of maintaining magazine editorial offices. Any still existing comic magazine elsewhere, willing to publish serialized comic series after the initial book releases, was merely considered an added bonus.\n\nStill, it took some time for the new publisher to get up and running, and some sort of stop-gap resolution had to be found for the intervening 1979-1980 period in order to secure income for the stable of comic artists. On recommendation of Charlier, who has had previous dealings with the publisher, the catalog was legally, but temporarily, housed at the French publishing house of the Hachette group, who for the occasion established the equally temporary EDI-3-BD imprint, though making use of Koralle's infrastructure – allowed to continue to exist for the time being by Axel Springer – in regard to printing and distribution. As impromptu publisher, EDI-3-BD published around two dozen album titles, including \"La longue marche\", before turning the copyrights of these over to Novedi, which started publishing themselves in 1981. EDI-3-BD published their books for Belgium and the Netherlands themselves, but farmed out licenses for other countries, including France somewhat surprisingly, where Giraud's former alma mater and Hachette competitor Fleurus firstly became the album publisher for \"La longue marche\". After Novedi had become operational, the business model was adopted by them and it was decided to continue with Giraud's other alma mater Hachette for France with the subsequent titles in the \"Blueberry\" (and other) series in recognition of the help Édi-Monde had provided. Hachette incidentally, later acquired a special, one-time only license from Dargaud to reissue the entirety of the \"Blueberry\" series in 2013-2014 as the 52 volume \"La Collection Blueberry\" anthology, each volume augmented with a six-page illustrated editorial.\n\nFor a decade \"Blueberry\" resided in calm waters at Novedi. The 1980s saw three additions to the main series (completing the \"Rehabilitation\" story arc) as well as four new titles in the newly created \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" series. Nevertheless, despite the two \"Blueberry\" incarnations and \"Jeremiah\" being the top selling series for the publisher, it appeared that the financial base was too narrow for even a publisher the modest size of Novedi, as the publisher went out of business in 1990, after having published approximately 120 album titles, and despite having taken over the book publications for France themselves as well in the latter half of the decade. It again left \"Blueberry\" and the others without a publishing home.\n\nOn 10 July 1989, Jean-Michel Charlier passed away from a heart condition after a short sickbed. By all accounts Charlier had been a workaholic throughout his career, working simultaneously on as much as a dozen projects at any given time, steadily increasing his workload as he grew older. His heart condition had already troubled him in his later years and his death, while sudden, was not entirely a surprise. Charlier's penchant for hard work increasingly became a concern for Giraud when he visited his longtime co-worker six months before his death, \"He was a work bulimic! There were always seven to eight scenarios underway. His life was a true path of self-destruction. You should have seen him working at his desk! Six months before his passing, I advised him to calm down. Very artistically, he replied: \"No, I have chosen this!\"\"\n\nCharlier, having been of a previous generation, conservative in nature and wary of science fiction in general, had never understood what his younger colleague tried to achieve as \"Mœbius\". Nonetheless, he never tried to hinder Giraud in the least, as he understood that an artist of Giraud's caliber needed a \"mental shower\" from time to time. Furthermore, Charlier was very appreciative of the graphic innovations Giraud ported over from his work as \"Mœbius\" into the mainstream \"Blueberry\" series, most specifically \"Nez Cassé\", making him \"one of the all-time greatest artists in the comic medium\", as Charlier himself worded it in 1982. Artist , who was taken on by Giraud in 1980 for the inks of \"La longue marche\" (\"The Long March\") painted a slightly different picture though. Already recognizing that the two men were living in different worlds, he noted that Charlier was not pleased with Giraud taking on an assistant, afraid that it might have been a prelude to him leaving the series in order to pursue his \"experimentations\" as Mœbius further. Even Giraud was in later life led to believe that Charlier apparently \"detested\" his other work, looking upon it as something akin to \"treason\", though his personal experiences with the author was that he had kept an \"open mind\" in this regard, at least in his case. While Charlier was willing to overlook Giraud's wanderings in his case only, he was otherwise of the firm conviction that artists, especially his own, should totally and wholeheartedly devote themselves to their craft – as Charlier always had considered the comic medium – , but which was somewhat incongruous on his part as he himself was habitually engaged in several divergent projects at any given time. This has caused many of his artists problems on a frequent basis, as he was consistently and notoriously late with his piecemeal provided script pages, including Giraud at the start of his \"Blueberry\" career. However, as he recognized quit early on that \"Blueberry\" occupied a special place in his body of work, he later made sure that (only) his \"Blueberry\" artists were provided with scripts in a timely fashion. Charlier's method of working came at a cost however, as his scripts frequently contained continuity errors on the detail level, and which included those of \"Blueberry\", such as in his above cited instance of his hero's first name. Charlier has cited the \"Blueberry\" titles \"La mine de l'allemand perdu\" (\"The Lost Dutchman's Mine\") through \"L'homme qui valait 500 000 $\" (\"The Half-a-Million Dollar Man\") as his favorites for their \"potency\", both story and artwise, the latter making him the co-winner of his 1973 American comic award.\n\nThe script being one-thirds ready at the time of Charlier's passing, the completion of \"Arizona Love\" was postponed as Giraud needed time to come to terms with that fact. Due to his intimate twenty-five year familiarity with both the series and its writer, it was a foregone conclusion that Giraud would from then on take on the scripting of the main series as well, especially since it was already agreed upon in the \"contracts signed with Jean-Michel\" that \"the survivor would take over the series\". It was this circumstance that has led Philippe Charlier, son of the deceased author and now the heir and steward of his father's \"bande dessinée\" legacy, to make the unsubstantiated claim that Novedi was surreptitiously negotiating with Giraud only for the existing and future \"Blueberry\" series, intent on cutting the Charlier family out, which was incongruous as Novedi was already heading toward receivership, aside from the fact that Giraud has never even hinted at such alleged dealings and that no rumors have ever surfaced in the otherwise tight-knit Franco-Belgian comic community, save for the claim Charlier Jr. himself made on a single occasion in the comic journal \"BoDoï\" (issue 24, 1999). Furthermore, per French law, Charlier's widow Christine remained entitled to 10 percent of the revenues from the existing and subsequent post-Charlier \"Blueberry\" titles, which provided her with a \"decent\" living standard, according to son Philippe, in effect to an extent contradicting his own claim on the same occasion. As for Giraud, having to work without a safety net for the first time, came initially with bouts of self-doubt and second-guessing, as Colin Wilson (by then the new \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" artist) testified to, after a visit to Giraud in this period, \" and I visited Jean when he was working on \"Arizona Love\" – around May 1989 [sic.] I think. Some of the first pages he showed us then were radically different from the ones ultimately published in the album later on. I did not had the time to read the scripts for those pages he had shown us, but I know that Jean redid several pages entirely anew, before the album was eventually released\". The by Giraud rejected pages were published as a bonus in the 1995 deluxe limited edition of \"Mister Blueberry\", a joint publication of Dargaud and Giraud's publishing house Stardom.\n\nStunned by the sudden death of his longtime co-worker, it took Giraud nearly five years before he could bring himself to embark on \"Blueberry\" again as artist, after completing \"Arizona Love\". Giraud stated that the series had lost its \"father\", and that the \"mother needed time to mourn\".\n\nCharlier's death coincided by chance with the growing problems at Novedi, and Giraud suggested to Philippe Charlier, the heir and steward of his father's legacy, to move all his fathers co-creations to Les Humanoïdes Associés (with whom Giraud maintained close personal and creative ties after his \"Métal Hurlant\" days – which had included \"Nez Cassé\" – , among others by having them publish his acclaimed \"L'Incal\" series), to step up to the plate vacated by Novedi. Yet, Giraud undertook no further action himself, partly because he was still residing in the United States, too preoccupied with his own projects and the wrapping up of his affairs over there before his return to France (and thus too busy to be engaged in secret negotiations with Novedi), and partly because his marriage to his first wife Claudine was in the early stages of falling apart at the time. Charlier Jr. approached Fabrice Giger, who had bought the by Giraud co-founded publisher previously in early 1989, but did not choose for that publishing house eventually, but rather go with Giger's original, founding publishing house, Alpen Publishers, the latter had set up in 1988 in Switzerland – even though comic artists themselves, due to the close entanglement of Alpen and Humanoïdes, always referred to Alpen as \"Humanos\" (\"see quote boxes below\"). It turned out that Philippe was actually picking up where his father had left off. Shortly after he had established Alpen and unbeknownst to Giraud, Giger was already approached by Charlier Sr. in 1988. The veteran Charlier had already sensed the writings on the wall at Novedi and discussed plans with Giger to have \"all\" his comic creations moved over to the new publisher, and to this end had already arranged his old friend from his \"Pilote\" days to be hired as editor-in-chief at the new publisher, incidentally in the process doing exactly what his son had accused Novedi of. Giger disclosed in 2008 that it was on the occasion of his subsequent dealings with Philippe that the \"JMC Aventures\" foundation was established, intended to safeguard the commercial and artistic legacy of Charlier's body of work. \"After the death of Jean-Michel, a project was born between his son, Philippe, his mother, and us, to create a structure dedicated to the continuation of the series co-created by Charlier, JMC Aventures. We were shareholders with the Charlier family,\" stated Giger, confirming the preliminary dealings with the author in his final year.\n\nThe relatively short tenure at Alpen saw the release of \"Arizona Love\", which was actually started under the aegis of Novedi, but for which Charlier had not yet contracted with the publisher because of his hunch, thus leaving the title legally \"free\" for JMC Aventures to be signed with Alpen, according to Giger, adding that this had the full and immediate blessing of Giraud. The artist himself though, has later expressed a slightly different opinion as evidenced in the quotebox featured below, where it was implied that he was not as happy with the behind-the-scenes machinations as Giger made it out to be, especially since his late script partner had kept him out of the loop in 1988. Ironically, it was Philippe Charlier, among others, who indirectly conceded the point when he accused Giraud of wanting \"to settle scores\" with Charlier Sr. with the later \"OK Corral\"-cycle, which Philippe had issues with (see \"\"). Additional Alpen releases included the \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" title \"Trois hommes pour Atlanta\", as well as the inception of the spin-off series \"Marshal Blueberry\" with two titles, aside from additions to the \"Les Gringos\" and \"Redbeard\" series, taken over by other artists after both Jijé and Charlier Sr. had passed away. While the initial intention was to have the entire body of work of Charlier published at Alpen, the corporation with the publisher did not pan out for undisclosed reasons – though Giger had mentioned increasingly difficult copyright negotiations with other copyright holders, predominantly heirs of other artists who had worked with Charlier, the widow of Jijé in particular, who had taken Giger and Charlier Jr. to court. The relationship was ended in 1992, shortly thereafter followed by the demise of Alpen itself in 1994 with Guy Vidal moving over to Dargaud (having taken on the writing for \"Les Gringos\" after his friend's death, until his own death in 2002), though Giger himself became successful with Humanoïdes, expanding into the United States as \"Humanoids Publishing Ltd.\" in 1999, in the process reissuing much of Giraud's \"Mœbius\" science fiction work.\n\nAs Belgian publisher Dupuis had already shown interest, when they serialized \"La dernière carte\" in their \"Spirou\" magazine in 1983, Charlier Jr. now decided to try his luck at that publishing house in 1992, as Hermann had already done previously with his \"Jeremiah\" for that matter. However, while \"Jeremiah\" has remained with Dupuis ever since, for again unknown reasons the cooperation with \"Blueberry\" did not seem to pan out either. Even though Dupuis did reissue all the \"(Young) Blueberry\" titles of the EDI-3-BD/Novedi era (but none from Alpen Publishers, or indeed any of the other Charlier creations) under its own imprint in their \"Repérages\" collection, no new titles were released during the equally short 1992-1993 tenure of \"Blueberry\" at that publisher.\n\nTiring of Giraud's inaction, Philippe Charlier ultimately took matters into his own hand, and had all his father's co-creations return to parent publisher Dargaud at the end of 1993 without apparent objections from Giraud (though he had stipulated an exemption for non-comic \"Blueberry\" art, produced either on personal title and/or for his own publishing houses , Starwatcher Graphics, and Stardom – \"see below\"), and it is there where \"Blueberry\" has remained ever since. The for Dargaud joyous occasion of now having acquired the copyrights of all \"Blueberry\" comic incarnations, was reason enough to ask Giraud – now serving as the sole main series artist – to embark on a new story-arc, which eventually resulted in the \"OK Corral\" cycle, the last one of the main series as it turned out to be. How thrilled Dargaud was to have reacquired \"Blueberry\" was amply demonstrated – aside from their decision to revitalize the serialized pre-publication format for \"Blueberry\" as already mentioned – in the 2000 documentary \"Mister Gir & Mike S. Blueberry\" made on the occasion of the release of \"Geronimo l'Apache\", in which instances were shown of the considerable marketing efforts the publisher undertook in order to promote the new album – the documentary therefore itself one such instance – , among others by having many Parisian metro stations plastered with huge \"Blueberry\" posters. Aside from this, Dargaud made use of the opportunity to clean up the by then muddied release chronology, by formalizing the establishment of the three series and restarting the album numbering for each in reprint runs. Concurrently, all international licenses were renegotiated.\n\nApart from foreign language publishers and constituting a break in tradition, Dargaud also started to occasionally farm out special, one-time only, series licenses to other Francophone publishers, which besides the aforementioned 2013-2014 all-series \"La Collection Blueberry\" from Hachette, already included the French book club \"\" for its 2003 main series releases. Another Francophone publisher who was granted a special license for the main series only was the French-Belgian newspaper \"Le Soir\" who released its \"Blueberry Intégrale\" in two editions, the fifteen-volume edition of 2009, and the sixteen-volume edition of 2015. Like the \"France Loisirs\" release, each volume, save three in the end, collected two of the original albums and was only offered to newspaper readers and subscribers. The three single album volumes (No's 8, 15 and 16) were augmented with new \"Blueberry\" art, featured in a separate section and separately negotiated for with Giraud's own publisher, Mœbius Production.\n\nJean-Michel Charlier has never witnessed the return of his creations to the parent publisher, nor has he ever mended fences with George Dargaud – for whose publishing house Charlier had made signature contributions after all – , and who followed Charlier in death almost to the day one year later on July 18, 1990. To a large extent the publication wanderings of \"Blueberry\" has been mirrored in other European countries as well, particularly in Germany (where the era was referred to as \"Der 'heimatlose' Blueberry\" – \"The 'homeless' Blueberry\") and the Scandinavian countries (the Danes referring to the era as \"Blueberrys Lange March\" – \"Blueberry's Long March\"), where every publisher change was followed suit by similar changes among local publishers in those territories as well. How confusing this era had been, was exemplified by the aforementioned \"La longue marche\" title, which has been released in French by no less than six publishers in the time period 1980-2003, or even seven, if one is to include the \"Super As\" serialized magazine publication as well.\n\nThough the 2007 \"Apaches\" title became the last in the main \"Blueberry\" series, as creating comics became increasingly difficult for Giraud because his eyesight started to fail him in his last years, he did continue to create single-piece \"Blueberry\" art on larger canvases on either commission basis (such as for the aforementioned \"Le Soir\" editions) or under the aegis of Mœbius Production until his own death in 2012, much of which sold for considerable prices from 2005 onward, alongside older original \"Blueberry\" art Giraud still had in his possession, in specialized comic auctions at such auction houses like Artcurial, Hôtel Drouot and Millon & Associés.\n\nThe first known English translation of \"Blueberry\" was that of the first title \"Fort Navajo\", and appeared 18 months after its original 1963 French magazine publication and before its very first book publication in September 1965. The first outing in the series was serialized in syndication through Charlier's own EdiFrance/EdiPresse agency (albeit on behalf of his employer Dargaud and the only \"Blueberry\" title known to have been disseminated in this manner outside Francophone Europe, Spain and Portugal) under its original title in the weekly British comic magazine \"Valiant\", starting its edited and truncated black and white run in issue 15 May 1965 through issue 21 August 1965, fifteen issues in total. Together with the near-simultaneous and similar publication of the story in Dutch (in full and in color in \"Fix en Fox\" magazine, issues 26-41, 1965), both actually stand out as the very first known non-French publications of \"Blueberry\", or of any other work by Giraud (but not Charlier) for that matter. However, the growing popularity of the comic elsewhere in Europe from 1967 onward notwithstanding, the Netherlands included, \"Fort Navajo\" remained until 1977 the only \"Blueberry\" title translated in English.\n\nThe first four English book translations of Blueberry comics were published in Europe for release in the UK in the late seventies by Danish/British joint venture Egmont/Methuen, when Egmont, holding an international license at the time, was in the process of releasing the series on a wider, international scale, for Germany and the Scandinavian countries in particular. While Egmont completed the publication of the then existing series in whole for the latter two language areas, publication of the English titles already ceased after volume 4. Parent publisher Dargaud had planned to reissue these titles and more for the North-American market in 1982/83 through their short-lived international (American) branch, but of these, only one was eventually released. That then unnoticed title, \"The Man with the Silver Star\", has, despite the fact that Giraud's art style had by now fully blossomed into his distinctive own, not been included in later North American collections, resulting in the book becoming an expensive rarity.\nSince then better marketed English translations were published by other companies which included Marvel Comics (under its Epic imprint), Comcat, Mojo Press and Dark Horse Comics, resulting in all kinds of formats and quality—from b/w, American comic book sized budget collections to full color European graphic novel style albums with many extras. Actually this was the first time \"Blueberry\" was published under Giraud's pseudonym, Moebius. As Randy and Jean-Marc Lofficier, the translator couple for all these editions, related, \"This is quite ironic because Giraud first coined the 'Moebius' pseudonym precisely because he wanted to keep his two bodies of work separate. Yet, the artist recognizes the fact that he has now become better known in this country under his 'nom-de-plume,' and this is his way of making it official!\" In effect, the ploy was more than opportune, as Epic had already started out with the publication of Giraud's better known science fiction work under his pseudonym – introduced to American readership through \"Heavy Metal\" in the mid-1970s – in the graphic novel format, and it was only when these were well underway that it was decided to add \"Blueberry\" as well to the array. All Giraud/Moebius titles were released by Epic in a for the US relatively modest print run of 20.000 copies per title. To make the project as economically viable as possible, it was decided to collect two of the original \"Blueberry\" titles in one book, to justify the by Americans perceived high price of around US$13, which, excepting the first two titles of the \"Iron Horse\" story-arc, made the Epic releases in essence \"integrals\" themselves.\n\nIt was for Epic that Giraud created new \"Blueberry\" book cover art (which he had only done once previously for the first four German book releases by Koralle, nor would he ever again), and to the chagrin of parent publisher Dargaud this art – as is indeed all outside the main comics proper \"Blueberry\" art, such as magazine covers, art portfolios, posters and the like, that Giraud created in this period of time for Koralle, Les Humanoïdes Associés, as well as his own publishing houses Gentiane, Starwatcher Graphics, and the subsequent Stardom – remain outside the legal purview of Dargaud, even after they had reacquired the \"Blueberry\" copyrights in 1993. In practice this means that Dargaud can not use this art at will for their own later publications, such as the 2012 anthology releases, without coming to some sort of legal and financial arrangement with the copyright holders – \"i.e.\" Giraud himself in the vast majority of cases (as of 2012, his heirs) – , as Dargaud licensees have to do as well on individual basis, and of which the short story \"Three Black Birds\" is the most glaring one (\"see below\"). German author Martin Jürgeit (co-author of the below-listed reference book) has confirmed being confronted with this when he served as editor-in-chief for the German-language version of Egmont's earlier mentioned anthology collection. Dead set on having \"all\" available \"Blueberry\" material included in his version, he found himself frequently frustrated in this regard on more than one occasion. He stated as late as 2012, \"As things now stand, it is highly unlikely that the vast majority of this material will be included, as Dargaud does not own the copyrights. And it is only the Dargaud copyrighted material we can use for the \"Blueberry-Chroniken\", as we have experienced to our dismay on several occasions,\" referring among others, aside from \"Three Black Birds\", to the covers for Epic as well.\n\nThe Epic publications were very shortly after their initial release collected by American specialty publisher Graphitti Designs in their \"Moebius\" collection – for whom Giraud created new book plate art, also outside the legal purview of Dargaud – , a deluxe limited edition anthology collection, released in a 1500 copies per volume edition, each volume at least containing two of the Epic releases. The collection, which ran for nine volumes, also contained Giraud's science fiction body of work, that was concurrently released by Epic in a similar manner. Volume \"Moebius #9\", containing \"The Lost Dutchman's Mine\" and \"The Ghost with the Golden Bullets\", also included the non-\"Blueberry\" westerns \"King of the Buffalo\" (short), and the other Giraud/Charlier western strip, \"Jim Cutlass\": \"Mississippi River\". Excepting the 1996 Mojo Press release, no additional \"Blueberry\" comics have been published in English since 1993, and, again excepting the Mojo Press release, no English \"Blueberry\" reprints have seen the light of day either, contrary to his other work as \"Moebius\".\n\nThe Epic collection earned Giraud his below listed American 1991 comic award, augmented with an additional 1997 award nomination for the Mojo Press release, whereas \"Blueberry\" in general had already earned him two American comic awards in 1972 and 1973, long before the series had even come to the attention of North-American readership.\n\nSince its inception, the series has steadily gained a large following in Europe, and has, in part or in whole, been extensively translated in both serialized and book versions into multiple languages, to wit, Spanish (both Spain proper and the Americas), Portuguese (including Brasil), Italian, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Finnish, Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, Greek, Icelandic, Turkish, Tamil, Indonesian and, more recently, Japanese with an even more recent addition in Chinese. At least one title – \"L'homme à l'étoile d'argent\" – is known to have seen a relatively recent translation in Arabic in the Egyptian weekly \"New Wind Mag\" (بساط الريح الجديدة), issues 1-11, 2009. In Spanish and Portuguese \"Blueberry\" has seen (licensed) publications by local publishers in the Americas, as it has in the former Yugoslavia after it disintegration into its constituent parts. In the European Union, in case of trans-border language areas, it has become customary from the mid-1980s onward, to have publishing rights reside with one publisher only. Like it was in native France, most countries have seen \"Blueberry\" pre-published in magazine serials. The Portuguese 1969 \"Fort Navajo\" publication from Editorial Íbis is the earliest known instance of a \"Blueberry\" title to be released directly as album, without prior serialized magazine pre-publication, contrary to the 1965 French and 1968 Spanish album releases, the three of them – all executed in the hard cover format incidentally, save for the French-Belgian Le Lombard release – becoming the only available book versions of the story until 1974.\n\nIt should be noted that album publication of \"Fort Navajo\", due the fact that Charlier had chosen to disseminate the title outside the French, Spanish and Portuguese language areas in magazine syndication, has posed problems for publishers in other language countries, especially in Germany and north-west Europe, when \"Blueberry\" broke out in popularity in the late 1960s–early 1970s, well before the syndication term was to expire in 1974. It is not known why Charlier had chosen this format for \"Fort Navajo\", as the US derived syndication format was by that time already well on its way out for European comics, after the relative immediate post-war paper shortage was no longer an issue. Since \"Fort Navajo\" was the first part of a five book story arc, this caused continuity, or rather chronology problems as publishers were not yet able to publish the book in their countries. The respective publishers all went about the conundrum in their own way; in Germany the book was first re-serialized as a magazine publication, before continuing with the book releases of the subsequent titles; in the Netherlands and Flanders it was decided to push ahead with book publication regardless of \"Fort Navajo\", and in the Scandinavian countries it was decided to forego on the publication of the first five titles altogether for the time being, instead opting to start book publication with book six, \"L'homme à l'étoile d'argent\", leaving publication of the first five titles for a future point in time. No matter what solution was chosen, it became one of the reasons for the messed up book release chronologies for those countries (only aggravated by both the later addition of \"Young\", and \"Marshal Blueberry\" book titles as well as the aforementioned publishing wanderings), confusing readership, especially in Germany. It was Finnish publisher Sanoma that became the first publisher able to release the first other language book edition of the title in 1974, directly after the syndication term had expired, as \"Navaho: Väijytys Punaisessa laaksossa\" (, notice the Finnish adherence to the originally intended series name, by now dropped by the parent publisher), that country's very first \"Blueberry\" book publication, thereby avoiding the conundrum. Nor had the conundrum been an issue for the UK, as book publication only started in 1977.\n\nIn the United States, California based distributor Public Square Books (currently known as Zócalo Public Square) imported \"Blueberry\" books from Spanish publisher Norma Editorial, S.A. on behalf of the Spanish speaking part of the country. Having done so in the first half of the 2000s, these books were endowed with American ISBN numbers in the form of a bar code sticker, simply put over the Spanish ISBN number. For example, \"Arizona Love\" originally carried the Spanish , but once imported in the US, received the new, American . Latino-Americans therefore, have been afforded the opportunity to enjoy the then entirety of the \"Blueberry\" series (including the spin-offs), contrary to their English speaking counterparts.\n\nApart from Europe, the Americas, Japan and Indonesia, the series has been translated on the Indian subcontinent in Mizo by Mahlua of Cydit Communications, operating out of Aizawl, and in Tamil. It is in the latter language in particular, spoken in the south-eastern part of India, Tamil Nadu, and on the island state of Sri Lanka, that the \"Blueberry\" saga has amassed a large fanbase and where he is dubbed \"Captain Tiger\" (கேப்டன் டைகர்). The series has been published by Prakash Publishers under their own \"Lion Muthu Comics\" imprint. In April 2015, an exclusive collectors edition was published in Tamil, collecting \"Blueberry\" titles 13 through 22 – with \"Arizona Love\" added in first time Tamil translation – in one 540-paged book. This is considered to be a milestone release in the entire Indian comics history, as well as one of the biggest collector editions of \"Blueberry\" comics worldwide, although it had already been surpassed by the time of its release by an even more massive, entire main series – save \"Apaches\" – single book anthology of 1456 pages by parent publisher Dargaud in the original language, the year previously.\n\nA \"prequel\" series, \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" (\"Young Blueberry\"), and the \"intermezzo\" series \"Marshal Blueberry\" have been published as well, with other artists and writers, most famously William Vance for the latter. Despite dogged efforts on the part of Giraud, the intended \"Blueberry 1900\" sequel did not come to fruition for extraneous reasons.\n\nA later created prequel series, dealt with Blueberry's early years, during the American Civil War, relating how the racist son of a wealthy plantation owner turned into a Yankee bugler and all the adventures after that. The material for the first three albums, conceived by the original \"Blueberry\" creators, was originally published in the 1968–1970 mass market paperback sized \"Super Pocket Pilote\" series, as in total nine 16-page short stories, eight of them constituting one story-arc set in the war. The very first short story, \"Tonnerre sur la sierra\" (\"Thunder on the Sierra\"), was actually a post-war stand-alone adventure set before the events depicted in \"The Lost Dutchman's Mine\". With the exception of the very first and very last, \"Double jeu\" (\"Double Cross\"), all other shorts were originally published in black and white.\n\nIn 1995, Giraud slightly contradicted Charlier's birth account of \"La Jeunesse\" by divulging that he had already created the \"Tonnerre sur la sierra\" story by himself, before Charlier actually came up with the Civil War approach, \"It was I who scripted the first episode of \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\". It very much resembled a regular series episode, but much smaller. Charlier subsequently presented me with another idea: the one concerning the Civil War. I found it an excellent idea; Writing started right away.\"\n\nGiraud created his \"La Jeunesse\" art with the smaller digest size format specifically in mind, and adopted therefore a more loose, less \"convoluted\" art style which allowed him to create his pages more quickly, already applying the revised technique for \"Tonnerre sur la sierra\". Additionally, it was for these stories that he started to experiment with applying inks in pen – alongside the brush he had hitherto exclusively employed for the series – , a technique he would perfect later on as \"Mœbius\". While the resulting spontaneous art worked out fine for the smaller sized pages of \"Superpocket Pilote\", it did suffer from the enlargement for the hereafter mentioned album releases, when compared to the larger, more detailed pages for the \"Pilote\" main series on which he concurrently continued to work. Still, the experience gained on the \"La Jeunesse\" shorts served him well, when he had to create \"Jim Cutlass\" in a hurry a decade later, utilizing a similar technique.\n\nThe publication of \"La jeunesse de Blueberry\" (\"Blueberry's Secret\") in 1975, the first album to collect the first three shorts of the Civil War story-arc, came as a surprise to \"Blueberry\" fans. Having left \"Blueberry\" on a cliffhanger with \"Angel Face\", when Giraud took his extended leave of absence (see above), clamor for new \"Blueberry\" titles became such, that publisher Dargaud decided to make the move as a temporary stop-gap solution. For the book publication, the original pages were blown up and by Giraud extended in width, rearranged, (re-)colored with some panels omitted in the process to fit the then standard album format of 46 pages, when discounting the two disclaimer pages. While the removal of individual panels was regrettable from a graphic art point of view – as it, besides the missing art, also broke up the integrity of Giraud's carefully designed page lay-outs, especially in \"3000 Mustangs\" – , it entailed no consequences for the plot of the shorts, save the first one; in \"Blueberry's Secret\" the in the synopsis mentioned Long Sam had witnessed the murder Blueberry was accused of and therefore able to prove his innocence, but is gunned down before he is able to do so by the real murderer, who in turn is gunned down by Blueberry, leaving Blueberry without any recourse to prove his innocence. However, for the book publication, the two panels which showed the real murderer being killed were cut, causing a discrepancy as it left readers, unfamiliar with the original publication, wondering why Blueberry was so despondent, as, from their point of view, the real killer was still alive.\n\nThe releases of the two follow-up collection albums, \"Un Yankee nommé Blueberry\" (\"A Yankee Named Blueberry\") and \"Cavalier bleu\" (\"The Blue Coats\"), four years later (in itself an indication that Dargaud had not planned to do so initially, if only for the substantial editorial effort it took in the pre-computer era to adapt the original digest size for the standard sized comic book), turned out to be in equal measure a stop-gap initiative. Unable to resolve the royalties conflict, which had dragged on for five years, Charlier and Giraud turned their back on the parent publisher, leaving for greener pastures elsewhere and taking \"all\" of Charlier's co-creations with them. Sensing that it might potentially turn out to be a costly defection, the two \"Young Blueberry\" titles were released to make the most of the fervor that had surrounded the return of \"Blueberry\" with \"Nez Cassé\". For Dargaud it indeed turned out to be a costly affair as the three 1979/80 titles were the last new titles they were able to release for nearly fifteen years, missing out on a period of time in which \"Blueberry\" reached the pinnacle of its popularity – seeing, besides new titles in the main series, the birth of two spin-off series as well – , even though the publishing rights of the older book titles remained where they were. As the \"Thunder on the Sierra\" short numbered 14 pages instead of 16, no editorial cutting was necessary for the third book. Apart from the editorial changes to fit the book format and the creation of new covers for the two additional albums, Giraud also made use of the opportunity to recreate a small number of panels to replace those he had felt unhappy about in hindsight, spread over all three albums.\n\nDargaud considered their three, original creator's, \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" book titles as part of the main series, until they regained the \"Blueberry\" rights in late 1993, and as such have therefore seen translations in most of the aforementioned languages as well. Apart from the expedited release of the two additional \"La Jeunesse\" titles, Dargaud also undertook a subsequent action in an attempt to further profit from the upsurge in popularity of \"Blueberry\", by releasing the very first six-volume \"Blueberry\" integral edition of 1984. A co-production with French publisher , each of the six volumes collected four titles of the then existing main series. Rombaldi was brought into the fold to act as an intermediary in order to negotiate a separate license from Novedi to have the then four Novedi main series titles included as well in volumes 5 and 6, though Dargaud performed a copyright infraction by making sure Novedi was not mentioned as copyright holder in the respective colophons. The three \"La Jeunesse\" titles were collected in volume 6. In recognition for their assistance, Rombaldi was retained for similar releases of the two other Dargaud Western series, \"\" (see also \"below\") and \"\" – each, like \"Blueberry\", one of the \"big five\" 1970s Franco-Belgian realistic Western comics – , combining all of them in one overall, eleven-volume \"Les géants du l'Ouest\" collection, as promoted in contemporary advertisements.\n\nThe 1990 English language edition of these books by Catalan Communications in their \"ComCat\" line, gave track of the changes and presented the left out panels in editorials in which Giraud himself presented clarifications for the choices made. It was in effect American readership that was first afforded a clarification for the discrepancy in the first book and the editorial changes made, before European readers were, in the editorials by Lofficier of the releases. Only these first three books were published in English. The three American albums, again translated by the Lofficier couple, were also, unaltered and unedited, included in the above-mentioned anthology collection from Graphitti Designs. The Graphitti Designs \"Young Blueberry\" anthology title differed from the others in that it was not printed on high gloss paper, but on matte paper as in the original ComCat publications, indicating that by then inclusion in the Graphitti \"Moebius\" collection was already accounted for and that the original print run of the interior pages was adjusted accordingly.\n\nAfter \"Angel Face\" was completed in 1974, Giraud took an extended leave of absence from \"Blueberry\", because he wanted further explore and develop his \"Moebius\" alter ego, the work he produced as such being published in \"Métal Hurlant\" magazine, in the process revolutionizing the Franco-Belgian world of \"bandes dessinées\". Having ended \"Angel Face\" on a cliffhanger, Giraud's return to \"Blueberry\" five years later with \"Broken Nose\" became a media event of considerable proportions and demand for \"Blueberry\" reached an all-time high. It was then that the creators decided to revisit the \"Young Blueberry\" adventures as well, which had ended its run in \"Super Pocket Pilote\". However, Giraud was nowhere near able to take on yet another major series himself, as he was still working on his \"Incal\" series as Moebius, besides having embarked on \"Blueberry\" again.\n\nThere actually had been an additional, more prosaic reason as well for the decision to do so. After Giraud had finished \"La dernière carte\" he, having been very much invested throughout most of his adult life in New Age beliefs and practices (which included the use of mind-expanding substances), had already left for Tahiti to join the commune of mystic Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry, the latter had set up there. After a stay of nearly two years, Giraud moved to the United States in late 1984 and set up shop firstly in Santa Monica, and subsequently in Venice and Woodland Hills, California. It was in this era that his work was published by Marvel/Epic for the US market. Publisher Novedi feared, not entirely unjustified – as the release lag between the two books had already increased from eighteen months to three years – , that it endangered the publication regularity of the main series, and resurrecting, or more accurately, creating the \"Young Blueberry\" series, was the back-up strategy they had in mind. Novedi had solid reasons to do so, as any new \"Blueberry\" title in that particular period of time enjoyed an (all-language) European first print run of 500.000 copies – thus discounting any later reprint run – , for European standards a very respectable print run.\n\nPublisher and creators subsequently embarked on a search for a suitable artist to take on the task. It was then that fate intervened when Giraud, before his departure to Tahiti, discovered the work of the still unknown ex-pat Colin Wilson from New Zealand, who was publishing a science fiction comic series \"Dans l'Ombre du Soleil\" – for which Wilson did both the writing and the art – for the French \"Circus\" comic magazine, which featured the character \"Raël\" (also the first story title) that shared a stunning resemblance with Blueberry. Wilson was actually was a huge Giraud fan himself and had modeled his \"Raël\" character after a Western hero he had created for the New Zealand fanzine \"Strips\", and who in turn was modeled after Blueberry. Ironically in hindsight, it were the original black & white \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" shorts that introduced Wilson to \"Blueberry\" as some \"Super Pilote Pocket\" issues had somehow found their to way to New Zealand, then a country without a comic tradition to speak of, according to Wilson. His admiration for Franco-Belgian \"bande dessinée\" artists, Giraud in particular, became in 1980 the driving force for Wilson to try his luck as such in Europe, aside from the fact that his native country did not afford any opportunities to become one professionally. \"Those drawings of Giraud convinced me to leave New Zealand\", Wilson reiterated in 1986, \"If that's what European comics are like then I wanted to be a part of it\". It was comic artist François Corteggiani who brought Wilson to the attention of Giraud by sending him a few pages of the \"Raël\" comic, and who in turn brought them to the attention of his co-worker Charlier (or vice versa as sources are not in concordance with each other).\n\nUnaware that his work was already brought to the attention of his idol and \"his\" co-worker, Corteggiani arranged Wilson's first face-to-face meeting with them in September 1983 in Paris. \"To have a discussion with Giraud, what a chance!\", said a delighted, but non-French speaking Wilson, \"That's why I immediately said yes to François Corteggiani\". Much to his own surprise, Wilson was almost immediately asked if he was interested to take on the new \"Young Blueberry\" series. After having accepted, he developed a close and warm working relationship with Charlier, and the Wilson/ couple befriended both him and his wife Christine, with household visits back and forth. The Charlier couple not only helped their friends (neither of them French-speaking and staying on a tourist visa in Amsterdam at the time) to settle firstly in Brussels, Belgium, and subsequently in the Provence, France, but with practical work details as well, as Wilson later recalled, \"Janet and I were tremendously lucky, Charlier was in many respects something of a kind uncle to us. He did not make a fuss about anything. He really stuck out his neck for me by involving me, a virtually unknown young artist, in a success series. I know he could be tough as nails with publishers. We were fortunate though, that he negotiated on our behalf as well, and we profited very much from the deals he struck.\" Wilson was signed for five albums. Corteggiani himself was yet to leave his mark on the \"La Jeunesse de Blueberry\" series later on. Wilson became the second, and last Charlier artist, after Giraud, whom the author provided with script pages in a timely fashion, once even receiving a page overnighted from Kuwait where the author then was on documentary assignment, just to keep his artist working.\n\nAfter a short apprenticeship (during which he produced \"Blueberry\" study art) to fine tune his art style, already close to that of Giraud, in order to have it move even closer to that of Giraud, embarked with fervor on the project with his first outing \"Les démons du Missouri\" (\"Missouri Demons\"), which essentially became the rationale for the \"Young Blueberry\" adventures to become a spin-off series onto their own. Working seven days a week for ten to twelve hours, Wilson produced five to six pages a month, using a combination of pen and brush for he inks, just as his idol had done for his \"Jeunesse\" stories and which had become the inspiration for Wilson to abandon the Rotring technical utensils he had originally used in New-Zealand.\n\nAs it had in 1980 when Giraud was working on \"La longue marche\" with an assistant (see \"\"), rumors quickly abounded in the tight-knit \"bande dessinée\" community that Giraud intended to abandon \"Blueberry\". This time around however, and unlike 1980, the rumors found their way to the outside world, causing anxiety in the fan community. Despite the publisher's standing policy of releasing comics directly in album format, it was decided to have \"Les démons du Missouri\" pre-published in the newspaper \"France-Soir\", one of the largest newspapers in France at the time, in an effort to counteract the growing disquiet. A first for \"Blueberry\" insofar daily newspapers were concerned, black & white publication began at the start of 1985, with Wilson feeding the newspaper with half-pages as he went along. The first half-page was accompanied by an editorial from Charlier, in which he tried to allay the fears of the fans (see \"quotebox\"). The format was for good measure repeated in 1987 with Wilson's second outing, \"Terreur sur le Kansas\" (\"Terror over Kansas\"), for the same newspaper, but abandoned afterwards when Wilson had become an established \"Blueberry\" artist himself. \"France-Soir\" saw two half-pages (1b and 2a) from \"Terreur sur le Kansas\" published that were not incorporated in the album, released later that year, for print technical reasons (see also \"The Blueberry biography\" in this regard).\n\nDespite the initial trepidations of fans, Wilson's \"Blueberry\"s were favorably received, achieving print run numbers approximating those of the main series, as well as seeing translations in nearly as many languages, with English being the glaring one of the few exceptions as of 2017. Wilson has divulged that Novedi released the first album in a first French printing of 150.000 copies (Novedi had by then taken over the publication for France as well) and a Dutch first printing of 50.000 copies, a huge step up from the initial French only 12.000 copy release for the \"Raël\" album. The French edition however, sold out in a matter of weeks, and an additional 20.000 copies followed suit in a hurry. Compared to the main series, the first printing was conservative for the French edition and ample for the Dutch edition. It even had a positive side-effect on his science fiction series \"Dans l'Ombre du Soleil\", which saw German, Dutch and Danish translations after he had embarked on \"Blueberry\". Wilson though, had to abandon this series in 1989, having added two more titles, because \"Blueberry\" demanded all his attention and energy, aside from the fact that it was the more successful one by far, allowing the couple to move to the Provence. It were not only the fans who were relieved, Wilson too had his trepidations alleviated when he met the fans face-to-face for the first time at several comic convention book signings after the release of the first album, grateful for their gracious reception and acceptance of his \"Blueberry\", even though most of them concurrently \"and\" emphatically expressed their relieve that Giraud would continue to be the artist for the main series.\n\nWhile Wilson was working on \"Terreur sur le Kansas\", he was asked by Giraud, who had shortly returned to Europe, to finish up on \"Le bout de la piste\" as well, as he was pressed for time, preparing to leave for California where he just had set up shop. Wilson did part of the inking of \"Le bout de la piste\", while his girlfriend Janet Gale, who had followed him from New Zealand, took on the coloring. Giraud himself assigned her the task, being impressed by the work she had done on her fiancé's album. Gale was actually a relative novice, as she only started coloring on her fiancé's \"Dans l'Ombre du Soleil\" series, having been unable to find legitimate employment in Europe due to her visa status. She would continue to color all her future husband's \"Blueberry\" books, as well as several albums from other artists released by Novedi. Giraud himself was from the moment Wilson took over the series no longer involved creatively, aside from occasionally giving his young colleague some advise, but did receive a \"small inventor's fee\" per title, as he himself had coined it.\n\nWhile several European countries (including outliers like Iceland and Turkey) had, no post-original creators title – discounting the newspaper serialization of the first two Wilson titles – has seen serialized comic magazine pre-publication in France/French-Belgium itself, where the titles were instead directly released as books. By the time the 1990 \"Le raid infernal\" was released however, virtually every other country had followed suit due to the demise of the serialized magazine format.\n\nLike parent publisher Dargaud, publisher Novedi considered the \"Young Blueberry\" books part of the main series at first until 1990, before they were instituted as a separate spin-off series, mostly for the practical reason of wanting to avoid further pollution of release numbering and chronology. Dargaud's stance was adhered to in other European countries, among others in Spain where then regular \"Blueberry\" publisher released their 1988-1996 \"Las aventuras del teniente Blueberry\" eight-volume integral collection, encompassing all hitherto released \"Blueberry\" albums, including those of Wilson. Like Dargaud had to do for their previous \"Les géants du l'ouest\" collection, the Spanish had to separately negotiate licenses from Koralle and Novedi for their \"Blueberry\" releases, but unlike the Dargaud release, these publishers were dutifully mentioned as copyright holders in the colophons of the respective volumes. Wilson's \"Terreur sur le Kansas\" became the first album to be released as a separate \"La Jeunesse\" series title in 1987, as indicated on its back cover. It was therefore not Dargaud who took the initiative for the move, but rather Novedi, due to the fact that Dargaud had lost the publishing rights for new \"Blueberry\" titles, actually missing out on the first five, most successful, titles of the new series as explained. But Dargaud did adopt the format, once these rights had returned to them in late 1993.\n\nCatalan Communications \"had\" planned to publish \"Missouri Demons\", \"Terror over Kansas\", and beyond in English as well, as additions to their \"Young Blueberry\" series in the \"ComCat\" line from 1991 onward (alongside Hermann's \"Comanche\" Western incidentally, another favorite of Wilson), which was already indicated on the back covers of the three original ones published in 1989-1990. The former had in effect already received an ISBN number. Publication came to naught however, due to the near concurrent, but otherwise coincidental, demises of both Novedi \"and\" Catalan Communications in late 1989 and 1990 respectively.\n\nJean-Michel Charlier and Colin Wilson\n\nWhile Charlier's death in July 1989 did not cause succession problems for the main series as explained, it did not held true for the \"Jeunesse\" series as both Charlier's heir, Philippe Charlier, and the publisher considered Wilson too much of an unexperienced novice to take on the writing of a major series himself, or as he himself had later put it, \"I doubt if \"Raël\" or \"Mantell\" accounted for anything at Dargaud [sic.] in this regard\". However, the search for a replacement for Charlier, turned out to be a rather tall order, as none of the established names in the Franco-Belgian comic world were found willing to fill the shoes of the legendary Charlier, whereas non-established names were rejected for pretty much the same reasons why Wilson was not considered as replacement. It was then, in order to break the gridlock, that Wilson suggested François Corteggiani as replacement, deeming it \"logical\", as he assumed Corteggiani to be an admirer of Charlier. Corteggiani had been one of the lesser names in the Franco-Belgian comic world, having predominantly written a couple of short-lived humorous comic series and one realistic series, the heavily \"Godfather Trilogy\" inspired mafia saga \"De silence et de sang\" – which he had abandoned in 1986 after only two volumes, only to take it on again ten years later, piggybacking on his newfound notoriety as \"Blueberry\" writer. However, both critical and commercial success have always eluded Corteggiani, and by the time he was approached by Novedi and Philippe Charlier, he had suspended his own career as a \"bande dessinée\" artist, instead becoming a tenured script writer for the French Disney studios. To his credit, Corteggiani refused at first, for the same reason his more established colleagues had already done previously, but eventually conceded on the insistence of Wilson. Wilson had personal reasons to do so, as Corteggiani was a personal friend of the Wilson-couple, aside for the practical reason that he was living in the vicinity of the Wilson-couple at the time. When the non-French speaking Wilson couple first arrived in Europe, they met Corteggiani at the annual Italian Lucca Comics & Games festival. Corteggiani took a shining on the newcomers and took them under his wing. It was Corteggiani, using his vast Franco-Belgian comic world social network, who introduced Wilson to publisher Glénat, resulting in his first European comic series \"Dans l'Ombre du Soleil\", in the process negotiating on behalf of his friend. And as already related, it was Corteggiani who, while keeping tabs on the work of his friend, introduced Wilson's work to the \"Blueberry\" creators. Wilson reasoned that by suggesting Cortegianni for a major series, he could return the favor he had provided him a few years earlier, by getting his friend's \"bande dessinée\" career back on track. Actually, he and Wilson had already started their own \"Thunderhawks\" comic series before Charlier died, an aviation comic set shortly after the first world war in the American South-West, but which had to take a backseat due to the fact that the \"Blueberry\" series took precedence.\n\nCorteggiani's first order of business was to finish up on the script for \"Le raid infernal\" which was halfway completed by Charlier at the time of his death. This he did to the satisfaction of all parties involved, including Wilson, and Corteggiani was retained as the \"Jeunesse\" writer ever since.\n\nThe publication of Wilson's fourth album \"La poursuite impitoyable\" in 1992 was surprisingly still under the Novedi imprint, over a year after the publishing house had ceased to exist. This can only be explained by the fact that Wilson was originally signed for five albums by Novedi, and that the official receivers of the defunct publisher wanted the revenues for the legal and financial finalization of the bankruptcy. The album therefore became a posthumous Novedi release. All legal issues were apparently resolved by the time of the publication of the fifth Wilson album, \"Trois hommes pour Atlanta\" one year later, as it was released by Novedi's successor Alpen Publishers, becoming the only \"Jeunesse\" title they were able to release, before they themselves lost publication rights to Dargaud in late 1993.\n\nFrançois Corteggiani and Colin Wilson\n\nFrançois Corteggiani and Michel Blanc-Dumont\n\nNo post-original creators editions have seen the day of light in the English language as of 2016, but, like the source series, the \"Young Blueberry\" spin-off series did see translations in numerous languages, the three titles by the original creators and the Wilson outings specifically, but appreciatively less so for the subsequent releases. The latter is amply exemplified by the Corteggiani/Blanc-Dumont versions, which are not that favorably received – unlike the Wilson versions, whose first three outings were notably well received, in no small part due to the fact that they were still being written by co-creator Charlier – as indicated by its steadily diminishing popularity; had volume 12 still seen a first-print run of 100.000 copies in France in 2001, by 2015 that number had dwindled to 40.000 (which in France is approaching the cut-off point for a standard comic album being economically viable to become published) when volume 21 was released, aside from the fact that several publishers had foregone the publication of these book titles in their countries altogether. As of 2016, the spin-off series by Corteggiani and Blanc-Dumont remains only published in French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Danish and Italian, a far cry from the nearly two dozen languages the main series had once been published in.\n\nThis spin-off series was the second attempt, this time by Alpen Publishers, to further capitalize on the huge popularity both the main, and Wilson's \"Blueberry\" series enjoyed at the time. Written by co-creator Giraud, the series was set around the events depicted in \"The Lost Dutchman's Mine\" and dealt with scrupulous gun runners arming Apaches, thereby instigating an uprising. Chosen by the publisher for the art work was William Vance, an accomplished Belgian comic artist in his own right and renowned for his \"XIII\" comic series. Vance, with whom Giraud had virtually no dealings in person, drew the first two outings in the series, but declined afterwards to continue, partly because he was required to finish an album in only four months (in Europe, one year was the typical mean to complete a comic book of 48 pages, but not rarely exceeds this time span in recent decades) and that he was unaccustomed to Giraud's style as script writer. Additionally, even though the first book sold 100.000 copies (while respectable, relatively modest compared to the contemporary print runs of the two other series, they being printed in numbers at the very least double that), fans received the book with mixed feelings as Vance's style was a too radical departure to their tastes from that of Giraud. This actually was part of the reasons why Wilson's work for \"Young Blueberry\" was so favorably received and partly the reason why Blanc-Dumont's was not. While conceding that he found Vance's particular style \"seductive but sometimes artificial\" – having been pleased with the first album, but less so with the second – , Giraud himself was disappointed and hurt by the defection of a professional like the established Vance for reasons of aesthetics and integrity, as he wanted the series to be executed by only one artist, deeming the defection \"disastrous\" for the series. The unresolved story cycle lingered in limbo for seven years, before Giraud in person found – whose style was closer to his – willing to finish the cycle.\n\nThat Rouge's style resembled that of Giraud, was hardly a surprise, as Rouge was actually not a stranger to \"Blueberry\". Twenty years earlier, when Rouge was still a quite unknown and aspiring comic artist, Giraud took him on as an apprentice and had him ink pages 15–35 of \"La longue marche\" in 1980 – thereby doing for an aspiring artist what Jijé had done for him nearly two decades before that. At the time it gave rise to the rumor that Giraud was planning to abandon his co-creation and that Rouge was groomed to take over the series. Though a rumor, there was a nuanced morsel of truth in it, as Rouge clarified two decades later, \"No, he did not want to abandon \"Blueberry\", but rather sought support and perhaps the opportunity to create books, like the ones he is currently doing [\"Mister Blueberry\"]. At the time, he was already playing with the notion of doing parallel series.\" Though not \"Blueberry\", Rouge \"did\" take over that other famed contemporary Franco-Belgian western comic series, Hermann's \"Comanche\". Unfortunately, Rouge was not able to regain the popularity that series once enjoyed, when it was still penciled by Hermann, and the series was suspended indefinitely after Rouge had only added five titles to the series. Rouge's words notwithstanding though, and while he has never acted upon it in earnest, Giraud did later admit that there were \"temptations\" in that period of time.\n\nOriginally intended to become a full-fledged series, the three \"Marshal Blueberry\" titles have remained the only outings in the series, though they too have seen several foreign language publications. Although not in France itself, several European countries have seen serialized magazine pre-publication of the first two titles. The third 2000 title though, was invariably directly released in book format for virtually all countries. No English language editions were released. Incidentally, in 2013 Giraud returned the favor Vance had provided for his co-creation, when he took on the art work of volume 18 for his \"XIII\" series, and which \"has\" seen English translations.\n\nJean Giraud and William Vance, page layout by René Follet\nJean Giraud and Michel Rouge\n\nA third spin-off series, coined Blueberry 1900, was conceived by original creator Giraud in the early-1990s, intended as a bonafide sequel series. Set, as the series title already implied, in the era of the William McKinley presidency, it would not only have featured a 57-year old Blueberry, but his adult son as well, albeit in a minor role. The story line, intended to encompass five books, was to take place around events surrounding the assassination of President McKinley. Pegged for the artwork was French comic artist François Boucq whom Giraud had met at a comic event in honor of his lifelong friend Jean-Claude Mézières, and concurrently discussed the project with. Actually, Giraud had previously approached Michel Blanc-Dumont, whose \"lyric\" art work for \"Jonathan Cartland\" he adored, for the project around 1993, then still tentatively called \"Blueberry 20 ans après\" (\"Blueberry, 20 years later\"). Blanc-Dumont, despite being reciprocally an admirer of Giraud's art and aside from being still invested in his own Western comic, thought the project not suitable for him, deeming the script outline too \"Mœbiusienne\" for his taste, and had already suggested Boucq instead. Boucq showed interest and was enthusiastic about the project, and indeed embarked on the production of pre-publication art studies, but deemed a cycle of five books too much, managing to negotiate it down to a cycle of three books.\n\nHowever, Philippe Charlier, son of the late Jean-Michel Charlier and proprietor of \"JMC Aventures\" – the foundation and legal copyright owner, set up back in 1990 with the specific intent to safeguard the creative integrity and legacy of his father, both in a spiritual as well as a commercial sense, but which had become dormant after the failed experiment at Alpen Publishers – , was nowhere near as enthusiastic as Boucq was. He became increasingly alarmed and downright aghast when reading commentaries, Giraud made in contemporary magazine interviews, clarifying his intentions and premises for the proposed series of a Blueberry residing with the Hopi tribe, meditating under the influence of mind-expanding substances, while President McKinley was levitating in the White House due to a Hopi spell. As heir and steward of his father's co-creations and legacy, being the 50% co-owner of the \"Blueberry\" brand, he still had the unequivocal right to veto any and all proposals regarding the trademark \"Blueberry\" and did not hesitate for a moment to exercise his prerogative in this case, going as far as taking Giraud to court, resulting in that the project fell through. As per a horrified Charlier Jr. in a contemporary statement, \"The script is unbelievably horrifying. It is an effrontery, constructed out of implausible circumstances. Like in the new [\"OK Corral\"] story cycle, we find a totally passive Blueberry, only meditating, while the president, enchanted by Indians, is levitating in the White House\". As he indicated, though he had given his seal of approval in this case, Charlier Jr., also became wary and disapproving of Giraud depicting the former lieutenant as a passive loafer in the \"OK Corral\" story arc, only aggravated from his point of view by the fact that Giraud could not refrain himself from including some elements from Native-American mysticism in \"OK Corral\" and \"Dust\" – though not anywhere near as extensive as he had apparently intended for \"Blueberry 1900\".\n\nPhilippe Charlier, conservative by nature like his father, had, unlike his father, no patience whatsoever with Giraud's \"New Age\" predilections (also serving as an additional rationale for his decision to proceed with Alpen Publishers back in 1990, instead of Les Humanoïdes Associés, renowned for its catalog of more adult, \"esoteric\" comics, like those of Boucq and Alejandro Jodorowsky), particularly for his admitted fondness for mind-expanding substances. It was he (after his father's death), who testified in court, that his father had always \"detested\" Giraud's work as \"Mœbius\" and that he considered that work as \"treason\". While Philippe was unable to stop the \"OK Corral\" cycle, because of the \"longest living survivor\" main series covenant Giraud and Charlier Sr. had signed, he was able to stop Giraud in his tracks in court for \"Blueberry 1900\" because it had never been presented by Giraud as a \"main series\" effort, but rather as a brand expansion (notice the legal difference), and on this Charlier Jr. had veto rights. Reinforced by the for him favorable court ruling, Charlier Jr. was therefore subsequently able to veto Giraud's 1999 scenario outline for a \"Fort Mescalero\" movie, which was to feature Blueberry in extensive substance-induced hallucinatory scenes, besides Giraud's intention to have the \"Jim Cutlass\" series merge with the \"Blueberry\" main series, due to the fact that later volumes of that series also increasingly incorporated likewise scenes, arguing that such a merging would indeed constitute another brand extension.\n\nHow far Giraud actually already was in his thinking was exemplified by the inclusion of his art featuring Blueberry with Hopi tribesmen, endowed with the caption \"In Hopi Towns\", as the interior flyleaf illustration for the regular 1990 \"Arizona Love\" French book release, reprinted as such, without the caption, in the last 1991 Graphitti Designs release, \"Moebius #9\". Additionally, Giraud had sneaked in some \"Blueberry 1900\" elements (including floating Washington dignitaries) in the non-\"Blueberry\", Native-American themed, short story \"The Words of Chief Seattle\", which saw English publication in Epic's second \"Blueberry\" book release, \"Ballad for a Coffin\".\n\nHowever, Giraud's fascination with shamanism went even further back than that, when he was introduced by Jodorowsky – during the failed \"Dune\"-project – in 1974 to the writings of Carlos Castaneda, who had written a series of books that describe his training in shamanism, particularly with a group whose lineage descended from the Toltecs. The books, narrated in the first person, related his experiences under the tutelage of a Yaqui \"Man of Knowledge\" named Don Juan Matus. Castaneda's writings made a deep and everlasting impression on Giraud, already open to Native-Mexican folk culture due to his three previous extended trips to the country (he had visited the country a third time in 1972, also see \"Giraud on Carlos Castaneda\"), and it did influence his art as \"Mœbius\", particularly in regard to dream sequences, though he was not quite able to work in such influences in his mainstream \"Blueberry\" comic. Yet, unbeknownst to writer Charlier, he did already sneak in some Castaneda elements in \"Nez Cassé\". Castaneda's influence reasserted itself in full in Giraud's later life, having worked in elements more openly after Charlier's death in \"Geronimo l'Apache\", becoming, as indicated, a major element for \"Blueberry 1900\".\n\nBoucq was disappointed with the project falling through, disagreeing with Charlier Jr.'s assessment, \"Quite the contrary, depicting him as an old man, forced us to endow him with a special kind of dignity\". Yet, for him it turned out to be a blessing in disguise eventually, as it became an inspiration for Jodorowsky (co-creator of Giraud's acclaimed \"Incal\" series, and already a frequent Boucq collaborator), to co-create with him their own acclaimed western comic. \"\" (published by Les Humanoïdes Associés). And even the fictional \"Fort Mescalero\" has resurfaced as Blueberry's very first Far West posting in the 2007 prequel book \"Apaches\", aside from the fact that much of what he had envisioned for this project actually turned up in the 2004 \"Blueberry\" movie. As a warming-up for \"Blueberry 1900\", Boucq and Giraud had already collaborated on a Native-American themed project when they both contributed to the 1995 \"Laissé Pour Mort\", a to 500 pieces limited CD/Portfolio release from Parisian-based publisher Stardom, Giraud's own publishing house/art gallery, ran at the time by his second wife Isabelle. Later, in 2008, Giraud submitted a \"Blueberry-meets-Bouncer\" contribution to the to 250 pieces limited \"Bouncer\" portfolio from short-lived publisher Osidarta, aside from providing a foreword.\n\nDespite Charlier Jr.'s vehement resistance, Giraud himself seemed to have never abandoned the notion of doing \"Blueberry 1900\" as was evidenced in a 2008 interview, when he was asked if he would ever return to \"Blueberry\" after he had once stated in a prior magazine interview that he was done with his creation upon the conclusion of the \"OK Corral\" story arc. \"Looking back at it,\" stated Giraud, \"I realized that I really wanted to continue \"Blueberry\". This would probably not be the case if I were to re-start a cycle of 5 albums, because I do not think I have the energy left for another ten years of work. Actually, I want to take up the idea of \"Blueberry 1900\" again, which has a very realistic side, sometimes a more crazy one: the Indians were a magical people, that was part of their culture, and I want to stage the collision between our world, through the conquest of the West, and the world of Indians who resist. It is often shown how events took place in a strategic sense, but I wish to plunge into Indian sociology, like it was done in \"Dances with Wolves\", by replacing our materialistic vision of the world, and by explaining the clash of cultures that took place. Of course, there is a certain challenge in doing the story this way, because I might possibly yank the rug from under the feet of the reader. I still have to rework the script and do the page divisions, but I think it will take between 100 and 200 pages.\" Giraud's death in 2012 ended all notions of a \"Blueberry 1900\" installment, and quite possibly any further installment of the main series as well.\n\nIn 1974 Charlier had a sixteen-page background article added to \"Ballade pour un cercueil\" (), when the book was first released. The article concerned a fictitious biography of Mike Steve Donovan, alias Mike S. Blueberry, detailing his life from birth to death, and written from a historic, journalistic point of view. When asked about it a decade later, Charlier clarified that once it became clear to him that Blueberry had become the central character of the series he had conceived, he then already postulated in his mind the broad strokes of the complete life and works of his creation, including the reasons for Blueberry's broken nose and odd alias. By the time \"Ballade pour un cercueil\" was ready for its book release, Charlier deemed the moment had arrived to entrust his musings to paper. There had been a practical reason as well for this. The story already ran 16 pages over-length and as contemporary printers printed eight double-sided comic book pages on one sheet of print paper, the addition of the 16-page biography was not that much of a bother for their production process. \"Ballade pour un cercueil\" therefore became one of the first Franco-Belgium comic albums to break the mold of the hitherto standard 48-page count format.\nCurrently somewhat of a staple in European comics, at that time the inclusion of an informative background section in a comic book of that size and wealth of detail was hitherto unheard of and a complete novelty, and what Charlier had not foreseen was that many in the pre-internet era mistook the biography for real, factual history, propagating it as such in other outside media as well. Charlier, who also was an investigative journalist and a documentary maker with a solid reputation for thorough documentation, had previously already written several, shorter historical Old West background editorials for the 1969-1970 \"Super Pocket Pilote\" series (issues 4-9) as companion pieces for the \"Jeunesse de Blueberry\" shorts, which \"were\" historically accurate – and, incidentally, working much of the material contained therein, especially the photographs, into the biography for the post-war era – , and readers therefore assumed that the biography was likewise.\n\nStill, having written the biography within the historical context as postulated in the comic, fully expecting his readership to understand it as such, Charlier originally had not the intention to perform a prank at the expense of his readers, despite him later presenting it as such in the above statement, mischievously poking fun at the \"respectable\" and \"eminent\", but gullible, believers – and which was in concordance with biographer Ratier's observation of the author \"taking liberties\" with actual events for dramatic effect, aside from the fact that his \"it was meant to\" statement also implied his original intent \"and\" the incongruous circumstance that he had already left the employ of Dargaud and \"Pilote\" in 1972 as already mentioned. \"I have written a fictitious biography on Blueberry, accompanied by photographs found in American archives, and the whole world went for it!\", declared a baffled Charlier previously, having already stated on an even earlier occasion, \"To this very day, because of \"Ballade pour un cercueil\" in which we gave Blueberry with a photographs illuminated biography, I still receive letters from readers – not from kids mind you, but from grownups – asking how on Earth we have managed to track down the real Blueberry. There are people who take it for real fact.\" The photos were indeed authentic, though their captions were not. To complete the appearance of a bonafide in-universe biography, a Civil War-era style group portrait, featuring Blueberry and flanked by the by Charlier mentioned comic artists, was included, ostentatiously recently discovered and from the hand of American artist Peter Glay, but in reality created by Pierre Tabary under the pseudonym. Tabary, brother of Jean, was a French book illustrator of some renown himself, also working for \"Pilote\" as illustrator for their magazine editorials at the time. Incidentally, a salient detail was that events, as related in the biography, in Blueberry's life directly upon war's end, but before he arrived in the Far West, eventually became those of \"Jim Cutlass\", the other Giraud/Charlier western.\n\nJ.M. Lofficier has translated the biography in English, specifically for inclusion in the Graphitti Designs anthology collection (it was not featured in the Epic editions), published in the fourth volume of the collection, \"Moebius #4\". Lofficier however, took it upon himself to slightly edit Charlier's original text in order to reflect Blueberry's life as featured in the post-1974 publications (despite being reprinted numerous times, not only in French but in other languages as well, Charlier himself has never revisited his original text again), and as such it is not an entirely faithful translation as some elements were added, whereas some others were omitted, such as the aforementioned notion of Blueberry ultimately heading a unit of Apache scouts.\n\nThe series has received (world) wide recognition in the comics community, and the chief factor for Giraud receiving his first recorded international award in 1972. Listed are only those rewards, the author(s) received specifically for \"Blueberry\", as Giraud in particular received an additional multitude of awards and nominations for his work as \"Mœbius\" from 1977 onward, including awards encompassing his entire body of works.\nWhile Giraud has garnered universal praise and acclaim for his work as \"Moebius\", \"Blueberry\" has always remained his most successful and most recognized work in mainland Europe, despite its artist developing somewhat of a love/hate relationship with his co-creation in later life, which was exemplified by him regularly taking an extended leave of absence from his co-creation. That \"Blueberry\" has always remained his primary source of income, allowing him to fully indulge in his artistic endeavors as Moebius, was admitted as such by Giraud as early as 1979, \"If a album of Moebius is released, about 10.000 people are interested. A \"Blueberry\" album sells at least 100.000 copies [in France],\" and as late as 2005, \"\"Blueberry\" is in some ways the \"sponsor\" of Moebius, for years now.\"\n\nAfter Giraud had returned to France pursuant his extended stay in the United States, generic interest in his work steadily grew and resulted in an increasing number of latter-day exhibitions at museums and conventions, featuring his original art. However, due to his international renown as \"Mœbius\", virtually all of these exhibitions focused on his work as such, even if \"Blueberry\" art was included in some of them. Nonetheless, at least three such exhibitions were known to have been Western/\"Blueberry\" specific.\n\nA 2004 film adaptation, \"Blueberry\"(U.S. release title is \"Renegade\"), was directed by Jan Kounen and starred Vincent Cassel in the lead role, with Giraud himself making a walk-on cameo appearance in the movie. Many purists were appalled by this film.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "186901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186901", "title": "Dating game show", "text": "Dating game show\n\nDating game shows are television game shows that incorporate a dating system in the form of a game with clear rules. Human matchmaking is involved only in selecting the game's contestants, who are usually selected more for the amusement value than any concern for their happiness or compatibility. The audience sees only the game; an important feature of all dating game shows is that the contestants have little or no previous knowledge of each other, and are exposed to each other only through the game, which may include viewing a photograph or at least knowing the basic criteria for saw participation (typically participants are not already married).\n\nThere have been a number of dating shows aired on television over the years, using a variety of formats and rules. They are presented for the entertainment of the viewers. As the genre progressed, the format developed towards a reality-style show and more into a relationship show then simply finding a mate.\n\nThe dating game show subgenre has its origins in the United States. The original dating game shows were introduced by television producer Chuck Barris. The format of Barris's first dating show, \"The Dating Game\", which commenced in 1965, put an unmarried man behind a screen to ask questions of three women who are potential mates, or one woman who asked questions of three men. The person behind the screen could hear their answers and voices but not see them during the gameplay, although the audience could see the contestants. The various suitors were able to describe their rivals in uncomplimentary ways, which made the show work well as a general devolution of dignity. Questions were often obviously rigged to get ridiculous responses, or be obvious allusions to features of the participants' private areas.\n\n\"The Newlywed Game\", by contrast, another Barris show, had recently married couples competing to answer questions about each other's preferences. The couple who knew each other the best would win the game; sometimes others got divorced. Once, someone divorced after appearing on \"The Newlywed Game\" got a \"second chance\" on \"The Dating Game\". Gimmicks were the lifeblood of all such shows, which drew criticisms for instigating disaffection that could not have been effected.\n\nThe genre waned for a while but it was later revived by \"The New Dating Game\" and the UK version \"Blind Date\", and the original shows were popular in reruns, unusual for any game show. Cable television revived some interest in these shows during the 1980s and 1990s, and eventually new shows began to be made along the old concepts. Variations featuring LGBT contestants began to appear on a few specialty channels.\n\nOther shows focused on the conventional blind date, where two people were set up and then captured on video, sometimes with comments or subtitles that made fun of their dating behaviour. \"He Said, She Said\" focused not on setting up the date, but on comparing the couple's different impressions afterwards, and for their cooperation offering to fund a second date. These resembled the reality shows that began to emerge at about the same time in the 1990s.\n\nA completely new type of dating show merged the format with the reality game show and produced shows where the emphasis was on realistic actions and tensions, but which used less realistic scenarios than the traditional blind date:\n\nSome common threads run through these shows. When participants are removed, it is usually done one at a time to drag out the action and get audience sympathy for specific players. In shows involving couples, there is a substantial incentive to break up any of the existing relationships. In shows involving singles, there is a mismatch of numbers ensuring constant competition. This creates the action, tension and humiliation when someone is rejected. There are also reports of mercenary practice, that is, members of one sex paid to participate in the game to attain balance of sex ratio.\n\nThe first gay version of these more realistic shows to receive mainstream attention was \"Boy Meets Boy\", with a format similar to that of \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette\". The show featured an unusual plot twist: eight of the men from the show's original dating pool were actually heterosexual men pretending to be homosexual; one important part of the plot was whether the gay contestant would be able to recognize the heterosexual men.\n\nSome gay and straight romances have been sparked on the other reality game shows, suggesting that they too may really be \"dating shows\" in disguise. But any social situation has the potential to result in romance, especially work. The first dating show to regularly incorporate bisexual contestants was MTV series \"A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila\", which included both male and female contestants vying for the affections of the show's star, internet star Tila Tequila, who is bisexual.\n\nThe British series Naked Attraction has, since its inception in 2016, included gay/lesbian and bisexual contestants, with some players picking from groups of the same gender as themselves, and some bisexual participants choosing from mixed groups. From the second series, the show would occasionally include potential dates who were in the process of transitioning.\n\nBy the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new wave of dating shows began airing in U.S. syndication that were more sexually suggestive than their earlier counterparts, including shows such as \"Blind Date\", \"Elimidate\" and \"The 5th Wheel\", which often pushed boundaries of sexual content allowed on broadcast television. As the 2000s progressed, the ratings for many of these shows began to decline, a situation exacerbated by the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in 2004 as production companies out of fear of being imposed with monetary penalties by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for indecent content began self-censoring their dating shows (and many syndicated programs targeted at the 18-49 demographic, in general) to levels in which even profanities typically permissible on television were edited out of episodes.\n\nSince then, the dating game show has virtually died off from television syndication, though cable television networks such as VH1 have continued to air dating shows with content similar to that of the syndicated dating shows of the late 1990s and early 2000s and major over-the-air broadcast networks have tried, often with marginal success, to use dating shows that are less risque compared to those shows. Attempts to revive the dating show in syndication first came in 2011, when \"Excused\" and \"Who Wants to Date a Comedian?\" both debuted; this was followed in 2012 by NBCUniversal Television Distribution's sale of reruns of the Game Show Network series \"Baggage\" into syndication. All three shows were dropped in September 2013, removing the genre from broadcast syndication for a time. In July 2014, VH1 aired \"Dating Naked\", modeled on Dutch show \"Adam Zkt. Eva\", which matches up heterosexual contestants who are nude most of the time.\n\nA sobering caveat of the power of television and romance in combination came when a popular dating variant of the talk show, inviting secret admirers to meet on the stage, backfired on \"The Jenny Jones Show\". The admirer was a homosexual friend of a heterosexual man who was so outraged after the taping that he later murdered the admirer. The secret admirer variant of the talk show has remained popular, it continued be used on \"Oprah\", but with less emotionally loaded surprises, and much more careful checking of the guests' backgrounds and attitudes; occasional episodes of \"Maury\" combine this format, though not always in a direct manner, with reveals of high school classmates who were considered to be unattractive as teenagers reuniting with their former school friends or tormentors as adults, after changing their image to become more physically attractive.\n\nLike other games, the outcomes of these activities are open to rigging, leading to missed matches and possibly unhappiness among the participants. These programs have also been criticised for complicating courtship with needless public expectation. In spite of this, some programs have produced episodes that portray follow-ups of unions forged therein, possibly with offspring.\n\n\n\"Dating\" category listing at UKGameshows.com \n"}

{"id": "213741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213741", "title": "Docudrama", "text": "Docudrama\n\nA docudrama (or documentary drama) is a genre of radio and television programming, feature film, and staged theatre, which features dramatized re-enactments of actual events. On stage, it is sometimes known as documentary theatre.\n\nIn the core elements of its story a docudrama strives to adhere to known historical facts, while allowing a greater or lesser degree of dramatic license in peripheral details, and where there are gaps in the historical record. Dialogue may include the actual words of real-life persons, as recorded in historical documents. Docudrama producers sometimes choose to film their reconstructed events in the actual locations in which the historical events occurred.\n\nA docudrama, in which historical fidelity is the keynote, is generally distinguished from a film merely \"based on true events\", a term which implies a greater degree of dramatic license; and from the concept of \"historical drama\", a broader category which may also encompass largely fictionalized action taking place in historical settings or against the backdrop of historical events.\n\nAs a portmanteau, \"docudrama\" is sometimes confused with docufiction. However, unlike docufiction—which is essentially a documentary filmed in real time, incorporating some fictional elements—docudrama is filmed at a time subsequent to the events portrayed.\n\nDocudramas tend to demonstrate some or most of the following characteristics\n\nDocudramas are distinct from historical fiction, in which the historical setting is a mere backdrop for a plot involving fictional characters.\n\nThe impulse to incorporate historical material into literary texts has been an intermittent feature of literature in the west since its earliest days. Aristotle's theory of art is based on the use of putatively historical events and characters. Especially after the development of modern mass-produced literature, there have been genres that relied on history or then-current events for material. English Renaissance drama, for example, developed subgenres specifically devoted to dramatizing recent murders and notorious cases of witchcraft.\n\nHowever, docudrama as a separate category belongs to the second half of the twentieth century. After World War II, Louis de Rochemont, creator of \"The March of Time\", became a producer at 20th Century Fox. There he brought the newsreel aesthetic to films, producing a series of movies based upon real events using a realistic style that became known as semidocumentary. The films (\"The House on 92nd Street\", \"Boomerang\", \"13 Rue Madeleine\") were widely imitated, and the style soon became used even for completely-fictional stories, such as \"The Naked City\". Perhaps the most significant of the semidocumentary films was \"He Walked by Night\", based upon serial killer Erwin Walker. Jack Webb had a supporting role in the movie and struck up a friendship with the LAPD consultant, Sergeant Marty Wynn. The film and his relationship with Wynn inspired Webb to create what became one of the most famous docudramas in history: \"Dragnet\".\n\nThe influence of New Journalism tended to create a license for authors to treat with literary techniques material that might in an earlier age have been approached in a purely journalistic way. Both Truman Capote and Norman Mailer were influenced by this movement, and Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" is arguably the most famous example of the genre.\n\nSome docudrama examples for American television include \"Brian's Song\" (1971), and \"Roots\" (1977). \"Brian's Song\" is the biography of Brian Piccolo, a Chicago Bears football player who died at a young age after battling cancer. \"Roots\" depicts the life of a slave and his family.\n\nThis list is ordered by release date.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "416762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416762", "title": "Dreidel", "text": "Dreidel\n\nA dreidel ( \"dreydl\" plural: \"dreydlekh\", \"sevivon\") is a four-sided spinning top, played with during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. The dreidel is a Jewish variant on the teetotum, a gambling toy found in many European cultures.\n\nEach side of the dreidel bears a letter of the Hebrew alphabet:\nwhich together form the acronym for \"\" (Nes Gadol Hayah Sham – \"a great miracle happened there\"). These letters were originally a mnemonic for the rules of a gambling game played with a dreidel: Nun stands for the Yiddish word \"nisht\" (\"nothing\"), Hei stands for \"halb\" (\"half\"), Gimel for \"gants\" (\"all\"), and Shin for \"shtel ayn\" (\"put in\"). In Israel, the fourth side of most dreidels is inscribed with the letter (Pei) instead, rendering the acronym, , \"Nes Gadol Hayah Poh\"—\"A great miracle happened here\", referring to the miracle occurring in the Land of Israel.\n\nAccording to most scholars, the dreidel developed from an Irish or English top introduced into Germany known as a ', which was popular around Christmastime and dates back to ancient Greek and Roman times. The teetotum was inscribed with letters denoting the Latin words for “nothing,” “half,” “everything” and “put in.” In German this came to be called a ', with German letters for the same concepts. Adapted to the Hebrew alphabet when Jews adopted the game, these letters were replaced by shin (=', put in); nun (=', not, i.e., nothing); gimel (=', whole/everything); and he (=', half). The letters served as a means to recalling the rules of the game.\n\nThis theory states that when the game spread to Jewish communities unfamiliar with Yiddish, the denotations of the Hebrew letters were not understood. As a result, there arose Jewish traditions to explain their assumed meaning. However, in Judaism there are often multiple explanations developed for words. Some claimed the 4 letters cyphered Babylon, Persia, Greece and the Roman Empire, the four ancient empires that tried to destroy Israel; a gematriya reading yielded the number 358, identical to the value of the 4 letters used for Moshiach (\"Messiah\"). A third popular conjecture had it that the letters abbreviated the words \"\" (a great miracle happened there), an idea that became attached to dreidels when the game entered into Hanukkah festivities.\n\nAccording to a tradition first documented in 1890, the game was developed by Jews who illegally studied the Torah in seclusion as they hid, sometimes in caves, from the Seleucids under Antiochus IV. At the first sign of Seleucids approaching, their Torah scrolls would be concealed and be replaced by dreidels. The variant names ' (destiny) and ' (a little throw) were also current in Yiddish until the Holocaust. In the wake of Zionism, the dreidel was renamed ' in modern Hebrew, and the letters altered, with \"shin\" generally replaced by pe. This yields the reading ' (a great miracle happened \"here\".')\n\nThe Yiddish word ' comes from the word ' (\"to turn\", compare to ', meaning the same in German). The Hebrew word ' comes from the Semitic root \"SBB\" (\"to turn\") and was invented by Itamar Ben-Avi (the son of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) when he was 5 years old. Hayyim Nahman Bialik used a different word, \"kirkar\" (from the root \"KRKR\" – \"to spin\"), in his poems, but it was not adopted into spoken Hebrew.\n\nIn the lexicon of Ashkenazi Jews from Udmurtia and Tatarstan the local historian A.V. Altyntsev was fixed several other appellations of a dreidel such as \"volchok\", \"khanuke-volchok\", \"fargl\", \"varfl\", \"dzihe\" and \"zabavke\".\n\nSome rabbis ascribe symbolic significance to the markings on the dreidel. One commentary, for example, connects the four letters with the four nations to which the House of Judah was historically subject—Babylonia, Persia, Seleucid Empire and Rome. While not mandated (a mitzvah) for Hanukkah (the only traditional \"\" are lighting candles and saying the full hallel), spinning the dreidel is a traditional game played during the holiday.\n\nEach player begins with an equal number of game pieces (usually 10–15). The game pieces can be any object, such as chocolate gelt, pennies, raisins, etc.\n\nThese rules are comparable to the rules for a classic four-sided teetotum, where the letters A, D, N and T form a mnemonic for the rules of the game, ' (take), ' (put), ' (nothing), and ' (all). Similarly, the Hebrew letters on a dreidel may be taken as a mnemonic for the game rules in Yiddish. Occasionally, in the United States, the Hebrew letters on the dreidel form an English-language mnemonic about the rules: Hay or \"H\" for \"half;\" Gimel or \"G\" for \"get all;\" Nun or \"N\" for \"nothing;\" and Shin or \"S\" for \"share\".\n\nThomas Robinson and Sujith Vijay have shown that the expected number of spins in a game of dreidel is O(n), where n is the number of game pieces each player begins with. The implied constant depends on the number of players.\n\nChildhood enjoyment of dreidels has led to interest in collecting them in adulthood. Jewish institutions such as the Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership, Yeshiva University Museum and Temple Emanu-El in New York, house dreidel collections, as do museums such as the Spinning Top and Yo-Yo Museum in Burlington, Wisconsin.\n\nDreidel is now a spoof competitive sport in North America. Major League Dreidel (MLD), founded in New York City in 2007, hosts dreidel tournaments during the holiday of Hanukkah. In MLD tournaments the player with the longest time of spin (TOS) is the winner. MLD is played on a Spinagogue, the official spinning stadium of Major League Dreidel. Pamskee was the 2007 MLD Champion. Virtual Dreidel was the 2008 MLD Champion. In 2009, Major League Dreidel launched a game version of the Spinagogue.\n\nIn 2009, \"Good Morning America\" published a story on Dreidel Renaissance reporting on the rising popularity of the dreidel. Dreidel games that have come out on the market since 2007 include No Limit Texas Dreidel, a cross between traditional dreidel and Texas Hold'em poker, invented by a Judaica company called ModernTribe. Other new dreidel games include Staccabees and Maccabees.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2576761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2576761", "title": "Extra (acting)", "text": "Extra (acting)\n\nA background actor or extra is a performer in a film, television show, stage, musical, opera or ballet production, who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging (silent) capacity, usually in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene). War films and epic films often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members (hence the term \"cast of thousands\"). Likewise, grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions.\n\nOn a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as \"atmosphere\", \"background talent\", \"background performers\", \"background artists\", \"background cast members\" or simply \"background\", while the term \"extra\" is rarely used. In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as \"supernumeraries\". In opera and ballet, they are called either \"extras\" or \"supers\".\n\nCasting criteria for background actors depend on the production. It is not entirely true that background cast members require little or no acting experience, as any type of unrealistic portrayal must include some form of imagination and acting. Punctuality, reliability and the ability to take direction also figure prominently for these cast members. Background actors are often selected on short notice, after all other preparations for the shoot have been finalized.\n\nSeveral casting agencies specialize only in background work, whilst in the UK the directory \"Contacts\" published annually by Spotlight lists all accredited agencies and productions. Some agencies charge a registration fee, and some (mostly commercial background casting) will take between 10% and 15% commission from any booked work. Artists may be required to provide a basic one-page A4 sized CV/resume, that states basic personal details and dimensions, any significant skills (e.g. stage combat), and includes two 8x10 inch photographs on the rear: one head shot; one full body shot.\n\nWhen hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek those with a specific \"look\", such as \"high school students\" or \"affluent senior citizens\", consistent with the context of the film. Casting directors may also look for background actors with a special skill for the scene, such as rollerblading, or dancing. A background actor is often expected to bring his or her own wardrobe to the set, although there are also \"fittings\" for a specific scene or period. A casting director may favor the one who already has the required costume or prop, such as a police uniform, or a musical instrument. On other occasions, where a costume has already been prepared (for example, to fit another actor who is now unavailable), a background actor may be selected as a \"costume double\" simply because they are the right size to fit it. On smaller productions or student films, background actors may be hired \"en masse\" with little formality.\n\nThe length of a background actor's employment on a production largely depends on the needs of the director and the scenes being filmed. Some background actors are needed on the set only for a day or two, while others may remain with the film for an extended period. For instance, on James Cameron's film \"Titanic\", a group of 150 \"core background actors\" was hired to play the ship's passengers, and employed throughout the filming.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the distinction between an actor and an extra is defined by agreements between the actors trade unions Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU) and Equity, and the various commercial trade and production bodies. These state that once a performer says 13 or more words in any scene, they must become a contracted actor in that production. Minimum pay rates are defined by UK Government minimum wage regulations, and both BECTU and Equity have agreed rates with each body. However, even on non-union productions an extra's pay is an agreed day-rate for ten hours of production time. All performers under agreement with BECTU/Equity are paid on-going royalties. Hence on many advertisements, which are often shown multiple times and distributed internationally, whilst the extra is paid a contracted day-rate, the largest payment is nominally due from ongoing royalties. Due to the resultant complex calculations from multiple international showings, performers under a union managed agreement are often bought-out of their advertisement royalties with a one-off payment.\n\nIn the United States, most major film and television productions used to fall under the jurisdiction of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) or AFTRA. The two unions have merged into SAG-AFTRA.\n\nSAG-signatory producers are allowed to hire non-union background actors after a certain number of SAG performers have been cast; non-union background actors are usually paid the minimum wage. On productions outside of union jurisdiction, payment for background actors is at the discretion of the producers, and ranges from union-scale rates to \"copy and credit\" (i.e., no pay). Those producers who do not pay their actors may be in violation of state and federal laws about minimum wage for a job.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1992, background actors in film and television were largely represented by the Screen Extras Guild. SEG was disbanded on 1 June 1992 and transferred its jurisdiction to SAG.\n\nThe silent film \"The Extra Girl\" (1923) portrays a small-town girl who comes to Hollywood and becomes a background actor in her attempt to achieve stardom.\n\nThe British television sitcom \"Extras\" (2005–07) follows the exploits of two professional background actors, Andy and Maggie. They spend most of their time on set looking for a speaking role and a boyfriend, respectively.\n\nIn the Hindi black comedy film \"Mithya\" (2008), the protagonist is a background actor whose facial similarity to an underworld crime boss lands him in trouble.\n\nThe Filipino comedy-drama film \"Ekstra\" (\"The Bit Player\") (2013) centers around the life of a divorcee named Loida Malabanan, whose odd job as a bit player for various acting roles enabled her to send her daughter to college. The movie is a social commentary on the exploitation and mistreatment of the marginalized sector in the television production industry in the Philippines.\n\nThe Chinese-Hong Kong film \"I Am Somebody\" (2015) is about extras working at the Hengdian World Studios.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "318294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318294", "title": "Film preservation", "text": "Film preservation\n\nFilm preservation, or film restoration, describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, cinematheques, and non-profit organizations to rescue decaying film stock and preserve the images which they contain. In the widest sense, preservation nowadays assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.\n\nFor many years the term \"preservation\" was synonymous with \"duplication\" of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of quality. In more modern terms, film preservation now includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share the content with the public.\n\nFilm preservation is not to be confused with film revisionism, in which long-completed films are subjected to outtakes never previously seen being inserted, newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added, black-and-white film being colorized or converted to Dolby stereo, or minor edits and other cosmetic changes being made.\n\nBy the 1980s, it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost. Not only was the preservation of nitrate film an ongoing problem, but the discovery that safety film, used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock, was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as \"vinegar syndrome\", and color film manufactured, in particular, by Eastman Kodak, was found to be at risk of fading. At that time, the best known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium.\n\n90 percent of all American silent films made before 1929 and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 are lost films.\n\nAlthough institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s, the field received an official status only in 1980, when UNESCO recognized \"moving images\" as an integral part of the world's cultural heritage.\n\nThe great majority of films made in the silent era are now considered lost forever. Movies of the first half of the 20th century were filmed on an unstable, highly flammable cellulose nitrate film base, which required careful storage to slow its inevitable process of decomposition over time. Most films made on nitrate stock were not preserved; over the years, their negatives and prints crumbled into powder or dust. Many of them were recycled for their silver content, or destroyed in studio or vault fires. The largest cause, however, was intentional destruction. As film preservationist Robert A. Harris explains, \"Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house.\" Silent films had little or no commercial value after the advent of sound films in the 1930s, and as such, they were not kept. As a result, preserving the now rare silent films has been a high priority amongst film historians.\n\nBecause of the fragility of film stock, proper preservation of film usually involves storing the original negatives (if they have survived) and prints in climate-controlled facilities. The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.\n\nThe problem of film decay is not limited to films made on cellulose nitrate. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced Technicolor) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original film productions or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. Cellulose acetate film, which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from \"vinegar syndrome\". The ongoing preservation of color films is now presented with an issue, as low temperatures, which inhibit color fading, actually increase the effects of vinegar syndrome, while higher (normal room) temperatures cause color fading.\n\nIn 2002, filmmaker Bill Morrison produced \"Decasia\", a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film. The film was paired together with a soundtrack composed by Michael Gordon, and performed by his orchestra. The footage used was from old newsreel & archive film, and was obtained by Morrison from several sources, such as the Fox Movietone Newsfilm Archives at the University of South Carolina, and the archives of the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nThe \"preservation\" of film usually refers to physical storage of the film in a climate-controlled vault, and sometimes to the actual repair and copying of the film element. Preservation is different from \"restoration\", as restoration is the act of returning the film to a version most faithful to its initial release to the public and often involves combining various fragments of film elements.\n\nFilm is best preserved by proper protection from external forces while in storage along with being under controlled temperatures. For most film materials, the Image Permanence Institute finds that storing film media in frozen temperatures, with RH between 30% and 50%, greatly extends its useful life. These measures inhibit deterioration better than any other methods and is a cheaper solution than replicating deteriorating films.\n\nIn most cases, when a film is chosen for preservation or restoration work, new prints are created from the original camera negative or the \"composite restoration negative\" which is often made from a combination of elements for general screening.\n\nThe composite restoration negative is a compilation of duplicated sections of the best remaining material, recombined to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film's release cycle, while the original camera negative is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.\n\nIn traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a fine grain master positive.\n\nPreservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.\n\nFilm preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.\n\nWhile some in the archival community feel that conversion from film to a digital image results in a loss of quality that can make it more difficult to create a high-quality print based upon the digital image, digital imaging technology has become increasingly advanced to the point where 8K scanners can capture the full resolution of images filmed at as high as 65mm. 70mm IMAX has a resolution of 18K, which is the upper necessary limit for film capture in full resolution.\n\nOf course, having an intermediate digital stage, followed by forming a new film master by lasering the digital results onto new film stock does represent an extra generation. So would an intermediate film master that was restored frame-by-frame by hand. The choice of film vs. digital restoration will be driven by the amount, if any, of restoration required, the taste and skill set of the restorer, and the economics of film restoration vs. digital restoration.\n\nDigital scanners can capture images as large as 65mm in full resolution. That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70mm film which used a portion of the film surface for its multitrack magnetic sound stripe. A 70mm print of a two and a half hour film ran upwards of $170,000. A hard disk capable of storing such a movie is a few hundred dollars. An archival optical disk will be less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.\n\nIn the context of film preservation the term \"digital preservation\" highlights the use of digital technology for the transfer of films from 8mm to 70mm in size to digital carriers, as well as all practices for ensuring the longevity and access to digitized or digitally born film materials. On purely technical and practical terms, digital film preservation stands for a domain specific subset of digital curation practices. Extensive technical literature on the subject can be found at the online library of the Presto Centre Project.\n\nThe aesthetic and ethical implications of the use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of George Eastman House Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema. More recently, the senior curator of EYE Film Institute Netherlands Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of remediation of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies' ability to broaden restoration possibilities, improve quality, and reduce costs. According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation. It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati's arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.\n\nIn 1935, New York's Museum of Modern Art began one of the earliest institutional attempts to collect and preserve motion pictures, obtaining original negatives of the Biograph and Edison companies, and the world's largest collection of D. W. Griffith films. The following year, Henri Langlois founded the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, which would become the world's largest international film collection.\n\nFor thousands of early silent films stored in the Library of Congress, mostly between 1894 and 1912, the only existing copies were printed on rolls of paper submitted as copyright registrations. For these, an optical printer was used to copy these images onto safety film stock, a project that began in 1947 and continues today. The Library hosts the National Film Preservation Board, whose National Film Registry annually selects 25 U.S. films \"showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage.\"\nThe George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film was chartered in 1947 to collect, preserve and present the history of photography and film, and in 1996 opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center, one of only four film conservation centers in the United States. The American Film Institute was founded in 1967 to train the next generation of filmmakers and preserve the American film heritage. Its collection now includes over 27,500 titles.\n\nIn 1978, Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada, a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the permafrost. This fortunate discovery was shared and moved to the United States' Library of Congress and Library and Archives Canada for transfer to safety stock and archiving. However, to move such highly flammable material such a distance ultimately required assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces to make the delivery to Ottawa. The story of this discovery as well as excerpts of these films can be seen in the 2016 documentary film, \"\".\n\nAnother high-profile restoration by staff at the British Film Institute's National Film and Television Archive is the Mitchell and Kenyon collection, which consists almost entirely of actuality films commissioned by traveling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century. The collection was stored for many decades in two large barrels following the winding-up of the firm, and was discovered in Blackburn in the early 1990s. The restored films now offer a unique social record of early 20th-century British life.\n\nIndividual preservationists who have contributed to the cause include Robert A. Harris and James Katz (\"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"My Fair Lady\", and several Alfred Hitchcock films), Michael Thau (\"Superman\"), and Kevin Brownlow (\"Intolerance\" and \"Napoleon\"). Other organizations, such as the UCLA Film and Television Archive, have also preserved and restored films; a major part of UCLA's work includes such projects as \"Becky Sharp\" and select Paramount/Famous Studios and Warner Bros. cartoons whose credits were once altered due to rights taken over by different entities.\n\nIn 1926 Will Hays asked for film studios to preserve their films by storing them at 40 degrees at low humidity in an Eastman Kodak process, so that \"schoolboys in the year 3,000 and 4,000 A.D. may learn about us\".\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, aware that the original negatives to many of its Golden Age films had been destroyed in a fire, began a preservation program to restore and preserve all of its films by using whatever negatives survived, or, in many cases, the next best available elements (whether it be a fine-grain master positive or mint archival print). From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be \"all\" of them. In 1986, when Ted Turner acquired MGM's library (which by then had included Warner Bros.' pre-1950, MGM's pre-May 1986, and a majority of the RKO Radio Pictures catalogs), he vowed to continue the preservation work MGM had started. Time Warner, the current owner of Turner Entertainment, continues this work today.\n\nThe cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film \"Jaws,\" only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated—a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film \"Raging Bull\". His film, \"Hugo\" included a key scene in which many of film pioneer Georges Méliès' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as \"a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure.\"\n\nScorsese's concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create The Film Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation's board of directors—Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg. In 2006, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Curtis Hanson, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee, and Alexander Payne were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the Directors Guild of America.\n\nBy working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised—or censored by the Production Code in the U.S.—from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through \"The Story of Movies\", an educational program claimed to be \"used by over 100,000 educators nationwide\".\n\nIn the age of digital television, high definition television and DVD, film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats. Meanwhile, the dominance of home video and ever-present need for television broadcasting content, especially on specialty channels, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.\n\nThe group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.\n\nThe VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant to the Folkstreams project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the National Film Preservation Foundation with video demonstrations. The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the Creative Commons license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution—in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.\n\nRegardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly. Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.) all significantly raise the difficulty of the preservation process. Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.\n\nCost is another obstacle. In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at \"several hundred thousand dollars.\" The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer \"commercially\" viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.\n\nDemand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.\n\nOnce a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via telecine or a motion picture film scanner to a digital tape or disk, and the audio is synced to create a new master.\n\nThe main defects needing restoration:\nModern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:\n\nModern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:\n\nThe practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.\n\nIn the last two decades universities globally began offering graduate degrees in film preservation and film archiving, which are often taught conjointly (the latter focusing more on skills related to the description, cataloguing, indexing and broadly speaking management of film and media collections).\n\nThe recent years rapid incursion of digital technologies in the field has somewhat redefined the vocational scope of film preservation. In response, the majority of graduate programs in film preservation have begun offering courses on digital film preservation and digital film and media collection management.\nSome established graduate programs in the field are:\n\n\n\n"}

PTC is organized directly under ICTA and it consists of a Law Department, a Technical Management Department, an Information Systems Department, an Administration Department and an Internet Department.\n\nLaw No. 5651, known as the Internet Act (IA), was enacted on 4 May 2007. \nThe purpose of this law has been described by the PTC as follows: \"There are 2 reasons for the law to be brought out. The first reason; determining the liability and the responsibility of collective use providers, access providers, location providers and content providers which are the main actors of the Internet. The other reason is to determine the procedures and fundamentals related to the specific crimes committed over the Internet and fighting these through content, location and access providers.\"\n\nThe IA reorganized the duties of the PTC. These included publications that are made on the Internet environment and the law regarding fight against committed crimes by these publications. Accordingly, to implement these tasks the Internet Department has been established.\n\nInternet content regulation is implemented by the PTC (ECL Art. 6/g, 13). Content regulation is governed by the Law No. 5651.\n\nOn February 2014, the Turkish Parliament passed \"an omnibus bill including new regulations on Internet usage which gives more power to the country’s national telecommunications authority\". This bill implies modifications of the Internet Act (IA) and, of some of the provisions about Internet content regulation and the authority of the PTC.\n\nThere are secondary regulations such as ordinances enacted based on the IA as well. Secondary regulations elaborate upon the provisions, of the IA, about Internet content regulation. These are namely; ordinance on the procedures about granting business certificate for the host provider and access provider, ordinance on the procedures for regulating the content of online publications.\n\nInternet content regulation is governed by IA. According to the Act the main responsibility is placed on the content provider. As a rule content provider is not responsible for the linked content provided by another. However, if this content is obviously supported by the content provider he shall be responsible under general provisions (Act No. 5651 Art. 4).\n\nOn the other hand, the host provider is not responsible for supervising the legality of the content. Nevertheless, the host provider is responsible for taking out the content when notified according to the IA. The host provider is also required to save the traffic information for the period which will be determined by the ordinance (between 1–2 years). The host provider shall present the information demanded by PTC and take the precautions instructed by the PTC. According to the new version of the IA, the hosting service provider is sanctioned with monetary fines instead of imprisonment, as it was stated in the previous legislation (Act No. 5651 Art. 5).\n\nWith the modifications to the Internet Act, a board of access providers was established. The board was given legal personality and is headquartered in Ankara. The board consists of the operators (service providers and other operators rendering Internet access services) which are authorized as per the ECL. The Board is designed to be self-sponsored.\nThe Board is required to execute the decisions for prevention of access, excluding decisions that might have to be based on the category of crimes enumerated in Art. 8. These enumerated crimes are; inducement for committing suicide, sexual abuse of children, facilitation of drug abuse, providing detrimental drugs, obscenity, prostitution, providing place and opportunity for gambling, and crimes against Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (defined by the Law No. 5816). Information related to the crimes against Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, may be found in the External Links section of this article.\n\nAccording to Art 8, in case of sufficient suspicion a decision for prevention to access, may be rendered by the judge, during the investigation phase for these enumerated crimes. If the circumstances require an express decision, the public prosecutor would also be entitled to render a decision to prevent access with a condition to present the decision to the judge in 24 hours for approval. However, the decision would promptly be revoked by the public prosecutor unless it is approved by the judge. If the suspect is found innocent at the conclusion of the judicial hearing, the decision for prevention of access shall be deemed invalid (Act No. 5651 Art. 8/1).\n\nIf the Content Provider or the Hosting Provider of the publication is located outside Turkey and involves certain enumerated crimes mentioned above the PTC shall render the decision for prevention on its own initiative. PTC shall also be entitled to render a decision for prevention in case of sexual abuse of the children, obscenity and prostitution disregarding the location of CP or HP (Act No. 5651 Art. 8/2).\n\nProtection for intrusion upon seclusion and infringement of personal rights\n\nIndividuals or legal persons claiming infringement of personal rights are entitled to apply to CP or to HP (when access to CP is not possible). In these situations they can legally inform and warn the CP or HP about the infringement. CP or HP must reply to the application within 24 hours. The claimant is also entitled to a direct application to the court without warning the CP or HP. According to the new version of IA, the judge will render its decision only aiming the portion infringing personal rights and not the whole web site. However, if the judge deems necessary for the protection of the personal rights he can render a decision including whole content on the web site. The judge shall render his decision within 24 hours (Act No. 5651 Art. 9).\n\nIn addition to these, the Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication (PTC) will be the competent authority if the content of the publication intrudes upon an individual's private affairs (intrusion upon seclusion). In this circumstance, PTC shall take initiative upon the individual’s request. The request for prevention should include satisfactory information about how the individual's private affairs were intruded, and his credentials (Act No. 5651 Art. 9).\n\nThe individual seeking for the prevention of the content is required to submit his official demand to the Court in 24 hours. The Court shall render its decision in 48 hours stating its opinion if the content does in fact constitute intrusion upon private affairs/seclusion. Noncompliance to these time limits shall automatically conclude the invalidation of PTC’s decision for prevention. According to the IA article 9/A/8 if individual's life is in peril, the President himself is entitled to render a decision for prevention. However, in this case an objection shall be submitted to the Court (Law No. 5651 Art. 9/A/5).\n\nAs one of the arguments in support of the IA the government addressed the protection of privacy. In a declaration, the Transportation, Maritime and Communication Minister Lutfi Elvan mentioned that “we want to protect individual rights and liberties. We want to protect and guarantee the right to privacy. In that regard, the existing bill did not respond to the needs of the people”. The Minister Elvan has also mentioned that the bill by protecting privacy, protects the violation of personal rights.\n\nIn another declaration the Prime Minister himself mentions that the new Internet law does not stipulate any censorship, and it is a measure against blackmailing, immorality, and the threat against people's reputation.\nIn a memorandum the government also mentioned that\n“In the event of a breach of ‘a person’s privacy,’ such as illegal wiretapping and the sharing of personal data without consent, in order to prevent irreversible damage that could be caused by the “time lag” between the complaint of the individual and the decision of the court, the bill will make it possible to implement a temporary prevention of access. When an individual raises a complaint, the Presidency of Telecommunication and Communications will send the request to the Union of Access Providers, which will block the URL within the next four hours as a preventive measure.“The complainant should also file his request to the penal court of peace within 24 hours and the decision of the court should be given within the next 48 hours. If the decision of the court is not in favor of the complainant, the restriction on access to the URL will be removed by the Union. Unless a decision by the court is delivered to the Union within 48 hours, the restriction will be automatically removed.”\n\nIn response to criticism, Turkey's Communications minister defended Turkey's blocking of content by pointing to regulations in the UK. He specifically pointed to the Internet Watch Foundation's blacklist of websites hosting child pornography and criminal activity to defend the restrictions. \n\nIt is also declared by the government that implementation of the prevention of access decisions are facilitated by the requirement of stipulating a legal responsibility to operators for preserving traffic information up to 2 years. Government also mentions that new codification will be helpful for preventing victimization from online defamatory content in an efficient and swift way. And the final decision is to be rendered by the court. However, the initiative of the PTC is designed as a tool for an interim measure to protect the individual’s personal rights from defamation till the court renders its decision. Since a defamatory content can spread very swiftly because of the nature of the Internet in the time gap till the court renders its decision.\n\nAccording to the new version, only the infringing content will be able to be removed instead of the whole content provided on the web site\n\nAccording to the code The Board consists of the operators (service providers and other operators rendering Internet access services) which are authorized according to ECL.\n\nUnlike the previous version, the new version of the IA includes monetary fines instead of imprisonment.\n\nOpponents to the IA have criticized it heavily. They mention that government is willing to place a censorship on freedom of expression on the Internet. They blame the government for using democratic tools for implementing censorship on Internet. They allege that Internet law does not regulate wiretapping or personal data. It regulates the prevention of access to online content under certain circumstances. However, opponents mention their concern about these issues.\nOpponents also criticized the TCB’s authority for implementing a decision for prevention when the personal rights are involved in the online content. They mention that this regulation places a huge power on TCB. However government explains that TCB’s decision will be lifted automatically if the court does not approve\nThe Act also attracted international attention. US and EU communicated their concerns about IA. President Obama also talked to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan about the IA and its influence\n\nOpponents also mention that the establishment of the Board of access providers will place an economic burden since the Board is stipulated to be self-sponsored. Entrepreneurs are of the opinion that implementing the legal responsibilities arising from IA may cause small-scale companies a serious problem. They also express that after IA these firms may prefer to operate outside Turkey. They indicated their concerns about the anticompetitive environment;\n\nOther than IA another regulation that attracted public attention was Safe Internet (SI). SI is setting up an optional, free and on-demand service for families to protect their children from detrimental content. SI present options. Users have alternatives such as family and children profiles and they can opt in or opt out of the service at any time with their consent. These profiles are also created by a board of academicians from various backgrounds such as pedagogy, psychology, law, sociology.\n\nThe main objective of SI is to provide the safe, effective and right use of Internet which is spreading at a fast speed. To this end raising awareness in general of the society, individually of the children, families and educators, together with the most effective and useful methods of safe use of Internet and raise consciousness towards the dangerous aspects that the Internet contains. People in Turkey and around the world are being educated about the general trends of the Internet use and information about similar useful statistics are given\n\nAs mentioned above, in February 2014, the Turkish government passed an omnibus law that included provisions that modify the Internet Act of 2007.\n\nThis modifications have had impact, considering that they have been described, as a restriction over free speech. Following, there are some commentaries that expose the reaction to the 2014's Internet Act modifications:\n\n\n\nFor information related to Turkey and to its administrative law, please refer to:\n\n\nFor information about regulatory authorities and sectors regulated, please refer to:\n\n\nFor an unofficial translation document, related to the crimes against Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, please refer to:\n\n"}
{"id": "15613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15613", "title": "Jazz", "text": "Jazz\n\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as \"America's classical music\". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \"one of America's original art forms\".\n\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nThe 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.\n\nThe origin of the word \"jazz\" has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to \"jasm\", a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning \"pep, energy\". The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the \"Los Angeles Times\" in which a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a \"jazz ball\" \"because it wobbles and you simply can't do anything with it\".\n\nThe use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the \"Chicago Daily Tribune.\" Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916 \"Times-Picayune\" article about \"jas bands\". In an interview with NPR, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the original slang connotations of the term, saying: \"When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies.\" The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the Twentieth Century.\n\nJazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100 years, from ragtime to the rock-infused fusion. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a \"form of art music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music\" and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a \"special relationship to time defined as 'swing. Jazz involves \"a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role\" and contains a \"sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician\". In the opinion of Robert Christgau, \"most of us would say that inventing meaning while letting loose is the essence and promise of jazz\".\n\nA broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: \"it is music that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice', and being open to different musical possibilities\". Krin Gibbard argued that \"jazz is a construct\" which designates \"a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent tradition\". In contrast to commentators who have argued for excluding types of jazz, musicians are sometimes reluctant to define the music they play. Duke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said, \"It's all music.\"\n\nAlthough jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it contains many subgenres, improvisation is one of its key elements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as blues, a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. Classical music performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score, with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer. The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.\n\nIn early Dixieland, a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising countermelodies. In the swing era of the 1920s–'40s, big bands relied more on arrangements which were written or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the bebop era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the song was improvised. Modal jazz abandoned chord progressions to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a rhythm section of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the song structure and complement the soloist. In avant-garde and free jazz, the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.\n\nSince the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized. According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a \"tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form\". Traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal. An alternative view is that jazz can absorb and transform diverse musical styles. By avoiding the creation of norms, jazz allows avant-garde styles to emerge.\n\nFor some African Americans, jazz has drawn attention to African-American contributions to culture and history. For others, jazz is a reminder of \"an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions\". Amiri Baraka argues that there is a \"white jazz\" genre that expresses whiteness. White jazz musicians appeared in the midwest and in other areas throughout the U.S. Papa Jack Laine, who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, was called \"the father of white jazz\". The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, whose members were white, were the first jazz group to record, and Bix Beiderbecke was one of the most prominent jazz soloists of the 1920s. The Chicago School (or Chicago Style) was developed by white musicians such as Eddie Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tough. Others from Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of swing during the 1930s. Many bands included both black and white musicians. These musicians helped change attitudes toward race in the U.S.\n\nFemale jazz performers and composers have contributed throughout jazz history. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, Adelaide Hall, Billie Holiday, Abbey Lincoln, Anita O'Day, Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters were recognized for their vocal talent, women received less recognition for their accomplishments as bandleaders, composers, and instrumentalists. This group includes pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong and songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields. Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early 1920s, drawing particular recognition on piano.\n\nWhen male jazz musicians were drafted during World War II, many all-female bands replaced them. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, which was founded in 1937, was a popular band that became the first all-female integrated band in the U.S. and the first to travel with the USO, touring Europe in 1945. Women were members of the big bands of Woody Herman and Gerald Wilson. From the 1950s onwards many women jazz instrumentalists became prominent, some sustaining lengthy careers. Over the decades, some of the most distinctive improvisers, composers and bandleaders in jazz have been women.\n\nJazz originated in the late 19th to early 20th century as interpretations of American and European classical music entwined with African and slave folk songs and the influences of West African culture. Its composition and style have changed many times throughout the years with each performer's personal interpretation and improvisation, which is also one of the greatest appeals of the genre.\n\n By the 18th century, slaves gathered socially at a special market, in an area which later became known as Congo Square, famous for its African dances.\n\nBy 1866, the Atlantic slave trade had brought nearly 400,000 Africans to North America. The slaves came largely from West Africa and the greater Congo River basin and brought strong musical traditions with them. The African traditions primarily use a single-line melody and call-and-response pattern, and the rhythms have a counter-metric structure and reflect African speech patterns.\n\nAn 1885 account says that they were making strange music (Creole) on an equally strange variety of 'instruments'—washboards, washtubs, jugs, boxes beaten with sticks or bones and a drum made by stretching skin over a flour-barrel.\n\nLavish festivals featuring African-based dances to drums were organized on Sundays at \"Place Congo\", or Congo Square, in New Orleans until 1843. There are historical accounts of other music and dance gatherings elsewhere in the southern United States. Robert Palmer said of percussive slave music:\n\nUsually such music was associated with annual festivals, when the year's crop was harvested and several days were set aside for celebration. As late as 1861, a traveler in North Carolina saw dancers dressed in costumes that included horned headdresses and cow tails and heard music provided by a sheepskin-covered \"gumbo box\", apparently a frame drum; triangles and jawbones furnished the auxiliary percussion. There are quite a few [accounts] from the southeastern states and Louisiana dating from the period 1820–1850. Some of the earliest [Mississippi] Delta settlers came from the vicinity of New Orleans, where drumming was never actively discouraged for very long and homemade drums were used to accompany public dancing until the outbreak of the Civil War.\n\nAnother influence came from the harmonic style of hymns of the church, which black slaves had learned and incorporated into their own music as spirituals. The origins of the blues are undocumented, though they can be seen as the secular counterpart of the spirituals. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, whereas the spirituals are homophonic, rural blues and early jazz \"was largely based on concepts of heterophony.\"\nDuring the early 19th century an increasing number of black musicians learned to play European instruments, particularly the violin, which they used to parody European dance music in their own cakewalk dances. In turn, European-American minstrel show performers in blackface popularized the music internationally, combining syncopation with European harmonic accompaniment. In the mid-1800s the white New Orleans composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk adapted slave rhythms and melodies from Cuba and other Caribbean islands into piano salon music. New Orleans was the main nexus between the Afro-Caribbean and African-American cultures.\n\nThe \"Black Codes\" outlawed drumming by slaves, which meant that African drumming traditions were not preserved in North America, unlike in Cuba, Haiti, and elsewhere in the Caribbean. African-based rhythmic patterns were retained in the United States in large part through \"body rhythms\" such as stomping, clapping, and patting juba dancing.\n\nIn the opinion of jazz historian Ernest Borneman, what preceded New Orleans jazz before 1890 was \"Afro-Latin music\", similar to what was played in the Caribbean at the time. A three-stroke pattern known in Cuban music as \"tresillo\" is a fundamental rhythmic figure heard in many different slave musics of the Caribbean, as well as the Afro-Caribbean folk dances performed in New Orleans Congo Square and Gottschalk's compositions (for example \"Souvenirs From Havana\" (1859)). Tresillo (shown below) is the most basic and most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music traditions and the music of the African Diaspora.\n\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n</score>\n\nTresillo is heard prominently in New Orleans second line music and in other forms of popular music from that city from the turn of the 20th century to present. \"By and large the simpler African rhythmic patterns survived in jazz ... because they could be adapted more readily to European rhythmic conceptions,\" jazz historian Gunther Schuller observed. \"Some survived, others were discarded as the Europeanization progressed.\"\n\nIn the post-Civil War period (after 1865), African Americans were able to obtain surplus military bass drums, snare drums and fifes, and an original African-American drum and fife music emerged, featuring tresillo and related syncopated rhythmic figures. This was a drumming tradition that was distinct from its Caribbean counterparts, expressing a uniquely African-American sensibility. \"The snare and bass drummers played syncopated cross-rhythms,\" observed the writer Robert Palmer, speculating that \"this tradition must have dated back to the latter half of the nineteenth century, and it could have not have developed in the first place if there hadn't been a reservoir of polyrhythmic sophistication in the culture it nurtured.\"\n\nAfrican-American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 19th century when the habanera (Cuban contradanza) gained international popularity. Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform, and the habanera quickly took root in the musically fertile Crescent City. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera \"reached the U.S. twenty years before the first rag was published.\" For the more than quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music.\n\nHabaneras were widely available as sheet music and were the first written music which was rhythmically based on an African motif (1803). From the perspective of African-American music, the \"habanera rhythm\" (also known as \"congo\", \"tango-congo\", or \"tango\".) can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat (shown below). The habanera was the first of many Cuban music genres which enjoyed periods of popularity in the United States and reinforced and inspired the use of tresillo-based rhythms in African-American music.\n\n</score>\n\nNew Orleans native Louis Moreau Gottschalk's piano piece \"Ojos Criollos (Danse Cubaine)\" (1860) was influenced by the composer's studies in Cuba: the habanera rhythm is clearly heard in the left hand. In Gottschalk's symphonic work \"A Night in the Tropics\" (1859), the tresillo variant cinquillo (shown below) appears extensively. The figure was later used by Scott Joplin and other ragtime composers.\n\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n</score>\n\nComparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the New Orleans \"clave\", a Spanish word meaning 'code' or 'key', as in the key to a puzzle, or mystery. Although technically the pattern is only half a clave, Marsalis makes the point that the single-celled figure is the guide-pattern of New Orleans music. Jelly Roll Morton called the rhythmic figure the \"Spanish tinge\" and considered it an essential ingredient of jazz.\n\nThe abolition of slavery in 1865 led to new opportunities for the education of freed African Americans. Although strict segregation limited employment opportunities for most blacks, many were able to find work in entertainment. Black musicians were able to provide entertainment in dances, minstrel shows, and in vaudeville, during which time many marching bands were formed. Black pianists played in bars, clubs, and brothels, as ragtime developed.\n\nRagtime appeared as sheet music, popularized by African-American musicians such as the entertainer Ernest Hogan, whose hit songs appeared in 1895. Two years later, Vess Ossman recorded a medley of these songs as a banjo solo known as \"Rag Time Medley\". Also in 1897, the white composer William H. Krell published his \"Mississippi Rag\" as the first written piano instrumental ragtime piece, and Tom Turpin published his \"Harlem Rag\", the first rag published by an African-American.\n\nThe classically trained pianist Scott Joplin produced his \"Original Rags\" in 1898 and, in 1899, had an international hit with \"Maple Leaf Rag\", a multi-strain ragtime march with four parts that feature recurring themes and a bass line with copious seventh chords. Its structure was the basis for many other rags, and the syncopations in the right hand, especially in the transition between the first and second strain, were novel at the time. The last four measures of Scott Joplin's \"Maple Leaf Rag\" (1899) are shown below.\n\n</score>\n\nAfrican-based rhythmic patterns such as tresillo and its variants, the habanera rhythm and cinquillo, are heard in the ragtime compositions of Joplin, Turpin, and others. Joplin's \"Solace\" (1909) is generally considered to be within the habanera genre: both of the pianist's hands play in a syncopated fashion, completely abandoning any sense of a march rhythm. Ned Sublette postulates that the tresillo/habanera rhythm \"found its way into ragtime and the cakewalk,\" whilst Roberts suggests that \"the habanera influence may have been part of what freed black music from ragtime's European bass.\"\n\nBlues is the name given to both a musical form and a music genre, which originated in African-American communities of primarily the \"Deep South\" of the United States at the end of the 19th century from their spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants and rhymed simple narrative ballads.\n\nThe African use of pentatonic scales contributed to the development of blue notes in blues and jazz. As Kubik explains:\n\nMany of the rural blues of the Deep South are \"stylistically\" an extension and merger of basically two broad accompanied song-style traditions in the west central Sudanic belt:\n\nW. C. Handy became intrigued by the folk blues of the Deep South whilst traveling through the Mississippi Delta. In this folk blues form, the singer would improvise freely within a limited melodic range, sounding like a field holler, and the guitar accompaniment was slapped rather than strummed, like a small drum which responded in syncopated accents, functioning as another \"voice\". Handy and his band members were formally trained African-American musicians who had not grown up with the blues, yet he was able to adapt the blues to a larger band instrument format and arrange them in a popular music form.\n\nHandy wrote about his adopting of the blues:\n\nThe primitive southern Negro, as he sang, was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect ... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major ... , and I carried this device into my melody as well.\n\nThe publication of his \"Memphis Blues\" sheet music in 1912 introduced the 12-bar blues to the world (although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues, but \"more like a cakewalk\"). This composition, as well as his later \"St. Louis Blues\" and others, included the habanera rhythm, and would become jazz standards. Handy's music career began in the pre-jazz era and contributed to the codification of jazz through the publication of some of the first jazz sheet music.\n\nThe blues form which is ubiquitous in jazz is characterized by specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues progression is the most common. Basic blues progressionions are based on the I, IV and V chords (often called the \"one\", \"four\" and \"five\" chords). An important part of the sound are the microtonal blue notes which, for expressive purposes, are sung or played flattened (thus \"between\" the notes on a piano), or gradually \"bent\" (minor third to major third) in relation to the pitch of the major scale. The blue notes opened up an entirely new approach to Western harmony, ultimately leading to a high level of harmonic complexity in jazz.\n\nThe music of New Orleans had a profound effect on the creation of early jazz. In New Orleans, slaves could practice practice elements of their culture such as voodoo and playing drums. Many early jazz musicians played in the bars and brothels of the red-light district around Basin Street called Storyville. In addition to dance bands, there were marching bands which played at lavish funerals (later called jazz funerals). The instruments used by marching bands and dance bands became the instruments of jazz: brass, drums, and reeds tuned in the European 12-tone scale. Small bands contained a combination of self-taught and formally educated musicians, many from the funeral procession tradition. These bands traveled in black communities in the deep south. Beginning in 1914, Creole and African-American musicians played in vaudeville shows which carried jazz to cities in the northern and western parts of the U.S.\n\nIn New Orleans, a white bandleader named Papa Jack Laine integrated blacks and whites in his marching band. He was known as \"the father of white jazz\" because of the many top players he employed, such as including George Brunies, Sharkey Bonano, and future members of the Original Dixieland Jass Band. During the early 1900s, jazz was mostly done in African-American and mulatto communities due to segregation laws. Storyville brought jazz to a wider audience through tourists who visited the port city of New Orleans. Many jazz musicians from African-American communities were hired to perform in bars and brothels. These included Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton in addition to those from other communities, such as Lorenzo Tio and Alcide Nunez. Louis Armstrong started his career in Storyville and found success in Chicago Storyville was shut down by the U.S. government in 1917.\n\nCornetist Buddy Bolden played in New Orleans from 1895 to 1906. No recordings by him exist. His band is credited with creating the big four: the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm.\n\n</score>\n\nAfro-Creole pianist Jelly Roll Morton began his career in Storyville. Beginning in 1904, he toured with vaudeville shows to southern cities, Chicago, and New York City. In 1905, he composed \"Jelly Roll Blues\", which became the first jazz arrangement in print when it was published in 1915. In introduced more musicians to the New Orleans style.\n\nMorton considered the tresillo/habanera, which he called the Spanish tinge, an essential ingredient of jazz. \"Now in one of my earliest tunes, \"New Orleans Blues,\" you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can't manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz.\"\n\nAn excerpt of \"New Orleans Blues\" is shown below. In the excerpt, the left hand plays the tresillo rhythm, while the right hand plays variations on cinquillo.\n\n</score>\n\nMorton was a crucial innovator in the evolution from the early jazz form known as ragtime to jazz piano, and could perform pieces in either style; in 1938, Morton made a series of recordings for the Library of Congress in which he demonstrated the difference between the two styles. Morton's solos, however, were still close to ragtime, and were not merely improvisations over chord changes as in later jazz, but his use of the blues was of equal importance.\n\nMorton loosened ragtime's rigid rhythmic feeling, decreasing its embellishments and employing a swing feeling. Swing is the most important and enduring African-based rhythmic technique used in jazz. An oft quoted definition of swing by Louis Armstrong is: \"if you don't feel it, you'll never know it.\" \"The New Harvard Dictionary of Music\" states that swing is: \"An intangible rhythmic momentum in jazz...Swing defies analysis; claims to its presence may inspire arguments.\" The dictionary does nonetheless provide the useful description of triple subdivisions of the beat contrasted with duple subdivisions: swing superimposes six subdivisions of the beat over a basic pulse structure or four subdivisions. This aspect of swing is far more prevalent in African-American music than in Afro-Caribbean music. One aspect of swing, which is heard in more rhythmically complex Diaspora musics, places strokes in-between the triple and duple-pulse \"grids\".\n\nNew Orleans brass bands are a lasting influence, contributing horn players to the world of professional jazz with the distinct sound of the city whilst helping black children escape poverty. The leader of New Orleans' Camelia Brass Band, D'Jalma Ganier, taught Louis Armstrong to play trumpet; Armstrong would then popularize the New Orleans style of trumpet playing, and then expand it. Like Jelly Roll Morton, Armstrong is also credited with the abandonment of ragtime's stiffness in favor of swung notes. Armstrong, perhaps more than any other musician, codified the rhythmic technique of swing in jazz and broadened the jazz solo vocabulary.\n\nThe Original Dixieland Jass Band made the music's first recordings early in 1917, and their \"Livery Stable Blues\" became the earliest released jazz record. That year, numerous other bands made recordings featuring \"jazz\" in the title or band name, but most were ragtime or novelty records rather than jazz. In February 1918 during World War I, James Reese Europe's \"Hellfighters\" infantry band took ragtime to Europe, then on their return recorded Dixieland standards including \"Darktown Strutters' Ball\".\n\nIn the northeastern United States, a \"hot\" style of playing ragtime had developed, notably James Reese Europe's symphonic Clef Club orchestra in New York City, which played a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in 1912. The Baltimore rag style of Eubie Blake influenced James P. Johnson's development of stride piano playing, in which the right hand plays the melody, while the left hand provides the rhythm and bassline.\n\nIn Ohio and elsewhere in the midwest the major influence was ragtime, until about 1919. Around 1912, when the four-string banjo and saxophone came in, musicians began to improvise the melody line, but the harmony and rhythm remained unchanged. A contemporary account states that blues could only be heard in jazz in the gut-bucket cabarets, which were generally looked down upon by the Black middle-class.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1933, Prohibition in the United States banned the sale of alcoholic drinks, resulting in illicit speakeasies which became lively venues of the \"Jazz Age\", hosting popular music, dance songs, novelty songs, and show tunes. Jazz began to get a reputation as immoral, and many members of the older generations saw it as a threat to the old cultural values by promoting the decadent values of the Roaring 20s. Henry van Dyke of Princeton University wrote, \"... it is not music at all. It's merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that Siberian villagers used jazz to scare away bears, but the villagers had used pots and pans; another story claimed that the fatal heart attack of a celebrated conductor was caused by jazz.\n\nIn 1919, Kid Ory's Original Creole Jazz Band of musicians from New Orleans began playing in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where in 1922 they became the first black jazz band of New Orleans origin to make recordings. During the same year, Bessie Smith made her first recordings. Chicago was developing \"Hot Jazz\", and King Oliver joined Bill Johnson. Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.\n\nDespite its Southern black origins, there was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra became a hit in San Francisco. He signed a contract with Victor and became the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving hot jazz a white component, hiring white musicians such as Bix Beiderbecke, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Frankie Trumbauer, and Joe Venuti. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", which was premiered by his orchestra. Jazz began to be recognized as a notable musical form. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert in \"The New York Times\", wrote, \"This composition shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a form of which he is far from being master. ... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the whole, highly original form. ... His first theme ... is no mere dance-tune ... it is an idea, or several ideas, correlated and combined in varying and contrasting rhythms that immediately intrigue the listener.\"\n\nAfter Whiteman's band successfully toured Europe, huge hot jazz orchestras in theater pits caught on with other whites, including Fred Waring, Jean Goldkette, and Nathaniel Shilkret. According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman's success was based on a \"rhetoric of domestication\" according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read \"white\") a previously inchoate (read \"black\") kind of music.\n\nWhiteman's success caused blacks to follow suit, including Earl Hines (who opened in The Grand Terrace Cafe in Chicago in 1928), Duke Ellington (who opened at the Cotton Club in Harlem in 1927), Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson, Claude Hopkins, and Don Redman, with Henderson and Redman developing the \"talking to one another\" formula for \"hot\" Swing music.\n\nIn 1924, Louis Armstrong joined the Fletcher Henderson dance band for a year, as featured soloist. The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young Coleman Hawkins), sounded \"stiff, stodgy,\" with \"jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality.\" The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of \"Mandy, Make Up Your Mind\" by George W. Meyer and Arthur Johnston (top), compared with Armstrong's solo improvisations (below) (recorded 1924). Armstrong's solos were a significant factor in making jazz a true 20th-century language. After leaving Henderson's group, Armstrong formed his Hot Five band, where he popularized scat singing.\n\nThe 1930s belonged to popular swing big bands, in which some virtuoso soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in developing the \"big\" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Harry James, Jimmie Lunceford, Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to \"solo\" and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex \"important\" music.\n\nOver time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist Teddy Wilson, vibraphonist Lionel Hampton and guitarist Charlie Christian to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on boogie-woogie from the 1930s.\n\nWhile swing was reaching the height of its popularity, Duke Ellington spent the late 1920s and 1930s developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and musical form with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences; some of his tunes became hits, and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe.\n\nEllington called his music \"American Music\" rather than jazz and liked to describe those who impressed him as \"beyond category.\" These included many musicians from his orchestra, some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the most popular jazz orchestras in the history of jazz. He often composed for the style and skills of these individuals, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for Johnny Hodges, \"Concerto for Cootie\" for Cootie Williams (which later became \"Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me\" with Bob Russell's lyrics), and \"The Mooche\" for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol's \"Caravan\" and \"Perdido\", which brought the \"Spanish Tinge\" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.\n\nAs only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and Lonnie Johnson, who visited Europe during and after World War I. It was their live performances which inspired European audiences' interest in jazz, as well as the interest in all things American (and therefore exotic) which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during this time. The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to emerge in this interwar period.\n\nBritish jazz began with a tour by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. In 1926, Fred Elizalde and His Cambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC. Thereafter jazz became an important element in many leading dance orchestras, and jazz instrumentalists became numerous.\n\nThis style entered full swing in France with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, which began in 1934. Much of this French jazz was a combination of African-American jazz and the symphonic styles in which French musicians were well-trained; in this, it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman since his style was also a fusion of the two. Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt popularized gypsy jazz, a mix of 1930s American swing, French dance hall \"musette\", and Eastern European folk with a languid, seductive feel; the main instruments were steel stringed guitar, violin, and double bass. Solos pass from one player to another as guitar and bass form the rhythm section. Some researchers believe Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti pioneered the guitar-violin partnership characteristic of the genre, which was brought to France after they had been heard live or on Okeh Records in the late 1920s.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II marked a turning point for jazz. The swing-era jazz of the previous decade had challenged other popular music as being representative of the nation's culture, with big bands reaching the height of the style's success by the early 1940s; swing acts and big bands traveled with U.S. military overseas to Europe, where it also became popular. Stateside, however, the war presented difficulties for the big-band format: conscription shortened the number of musicians available; the military's need for shellac (commonly used for pressing gramophone records) limited record production; a shortage of rubber (also due to the war effort) discouraged bands from touring via road travel; and a demand by the musicians' union for a commercial recording ban limited music distribution between 1942 and 1944.\n\nMany of the big bands who were deprived of experienced musicians because of the war effort began to enlist young players who were below the age for conscription, as was the case with saxophonist Stan Getz's entry in a band as a teenager. This coincided with a nationwide resurgence in the Dixieland style of pre-swing jazz; performers such as clarinetist George Lewis, cornetist Bill Davison, and trombonist Turk Murphy were hailed by conservative jazz critics as more authentic than the big bands. Elsewhere, with the limitations on recording, small groups of young musicians developed a more uptempo, improvisational style of jazz, collaborating and experimenting with new ideas for melodic development, rhythmic language, and harmonic substitution, during informal, late-night jam sessions hosted in small clubs and apartments. Key figures in this development were largely based in New York and included pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, drummers Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, saxophonist Charlie Parker, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. This musical development became known as bebop.\n\nBebop and subsequent post-war jazz developments featured a wider set of notes, played in more complex patterns and at faster tempos than previous jazz. According to Clive James, bebop was \"the post-war musical development which tried to ensure that jazz would no longer be the spontaneous sound of joy ... Students of race relations in America are generally agreed that the exponents of post-war jazz were determined, with good reason, to present themselves as challenging artists rather than tame entertainers.\" The end of the war marked \"a revival of the spirit of experimentation and musical pluralism under which it had been conceived\", along with \"the beginning of a decline in the popularity of jazz music in America\", according to American academic Michael H. Burchett.\n\nWith the rise of bebop and the end of the swing era after the war, jazz lost its cachet as pop music. Vocalists of the famous big bands moved on to being marketed and performing as solo pop singers; these included Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Dick Haymes, and Doris Day. Older musicians who still performed their pre-war jazz, such as Armstrong and Ellington, were gradually viewed in the mainstream as passé. Other younger performers, such as singer Big Joe Turner and saxophonist Louis Jordan, who were discouraged by bebop's increasing complexity pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues, jump blues, and eventually rock and roll. Some, including Gillespie, composed intricate yet danceable songs for bebop musicians in an effort to make them more accessible, but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences' purview. \"The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim, but it steadily declined in popularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream audiences\", Burchett said. \"The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences, while retaining its artistic integrity, is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz.\" During its swing period, jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene; according to Paul Trynka, this changed in the post-war years:\n\nIn the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music.\" The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal.\n\nComposer Gunther Schuller wrote, \"In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.\n\nDizzy Gillespie wrote. \"People talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here...naturally each age has got its own shit.\n\nSince bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.\n\nBebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation. Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note; bebop also uses \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. New forms of chromaticism and dissonance were introduced into jazz, and the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing-era songs and reused with a new and more complex melody and/or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions, a practice which was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but often infused with ii-V motion) and 'rhythm changes' (I-VI-ii-V) – the chords to the 1930s pop standard \"I Got Rhythm.\" Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes.\n\nThe harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing \"Cherokee\" at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, New York, in early 1942. \"I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used...and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it...I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.\" Gerhard Kubik postulates that harmonic development in bebop sprang from blues and African-related tonal sensibilities rather than 20th-century Western classical music. \"Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.\"\n\nSamuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about a new harmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety, a developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device; and reestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle. Kubik wrote,\n\nWhile for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western \"serious\" music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing. And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to African-American music several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions\n\nThese divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and musicians, especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". But despite the friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.\n\nThe general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was \"Tanga\" (1943), composed by Cuban-born Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. \"Tanga\" began as a spontaneous descarga (Cuban jam session), with jazz solos superimposed on top.\n\nThis was the birth of Afro-Cuban jazz. The use of clave brought the African \"timeline\", or \"key pattern\", into jazz. Music organized around key patterns convey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African cross-rhythm. Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the primary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave, and the harmonic \"one\" is always understood to be \"one\". If the progression begins on the \"three-side\" of clave, it is said to be in \"3-2 clave\" (shown below). If the progression begins on the \"two-side\", its in \"2-3 clave\".\n\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n</score>\n\nMario Bauzá introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer Chano Pozo. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. \"Manteca\" (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: \"If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.\" The bridge gave \"Manteca\" a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal \"Tanga\" of a few years earlier.\n\nGillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms into bebop. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, \"cu-bop\" also drew from African rhythm. Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of \"Manteca\", \"A Night in Tunisia\", \"Tin Tin Deo\", and \"On Green Dolphin Street\".\n\nCuban percussionist Mongo Santamaria first recorded his composition \"Afro Blue\" in 1959.\n\"Afro Blue\" was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) cross-rhythm, or hemiola. The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of , or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2).\n\nThe following example shows the original ostinato \"Afro Blue\" bass line. The cross noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes).\n\n</score>\n\nWhen John Coltrane covered \"Afro Blue\" in 1963, he inverted the metric hierarchy, interpreting the tune as a jazz waltz with duple cross-beats superimposed (2:3). Originally a B pentatonic blues, Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of \"Afro Blue.\"\n\nPerhaps the most respected Afro-cuban jazz combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist Cal Tjader's band. Tjader had Mongo Santamaria, Armando Peraza, and Willie Bobo on his early recording dates.\n\nIn the late 1940s, there was a revival of Dixieland, harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing what they had been playing all along), such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians, such as those in the Lu Watters band, Conrad Janis, and Ward Kimball and his Firehouse Five Plus Two Jazz Band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.\n\nIn 1944, jazz impresario Norman Granz organized the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concert in Los Angeles, which helped make a star of Nat \"King\" Cole and Les Paul. In 1946, he founded Clef, discovering Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson in 1949 and merging Clef with his new label Verve in 1956, which advanced the career of Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nBy the end of the 1940s, the nervous energy and tension of bebop was replaced with a tendency toward calm and smoothness with the sounds of cool jazz, which favored long, linear melodic lines. It emerged in New York City and dominated jazz in the first half of the 1950s. The starting point an album of 1949 and 1950 singles released as the \"Birth of the Cool\" (1957) by a nonet led by Miles Davis. Cool jazz recordings by musicians such as Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, Gil Evans, Stan Getz, the Modern Jazz Quartet, and Gerry Mulligan usually had a lighter sound that avoided the aggressive tempos and harmonic abstraction of bebop.\n\nCool jazz became strongly identified with West Coast jazz as exemplified by Chet Baker, Mel Tormé, and Anita O'Day. But it also resonated in Europe, especially Scandinavia, where baritone saxophonist Lars Gullin and pianist Bengt Hallberg emerged. The theoretical underpinnings of cool jazz were laid out by the Chicago pianist Lennie Tristano, and its influence stretches into the development of bossa nova, modal jazz, and free jazz.\n\nHard bop is an extension of bebop (or \"bop\") music which incorporates influences from blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel, especially in saxophone and piano playing. Hard bop was developed in the mid-1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues. Miles Davis' 1954 performance of \"Walkin'\" at the first Newport Jazz Festival announced the style to the jazz world. The quintet Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, led by Blakey and featuring pianist Horace Silver and trumpeter Clifford Brown, were leaders in the hard bop movement with Davis.\n\nModal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given chord progression, but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody: \"Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the scale),\" explained pianist Mark Levine.\n\nThe modal theory stems from a work by George Russell. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with \"Kind of Blue\" (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis' earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation, \"Kind of Blue\" was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.\n\n\"I didn't write out the music for \"Kind of Blue\", but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,\" recalled Davis. The track \"So What\" has only two chords: D-7 and E-7.\n\nOther innovators in this style include Jackie McLean, and two of the musicians who had also played on \"Kind of Blue\": John Coltrane and Bill Evans.\n\nBy the 1950s, Afro-Cuban jazz had been using modes for at least a decade, as much of it borrowed from Cuban popular dance forms which are structured around multiple ostinatos with only a few chords. A case in point is Mario Bauza's \"Tanga\" (1943), the first Afro-Cuban jazz piece. Machito's Afro-Cubans recorded modal tunes in the 1940s, featuring jazz soloists such as Howard McGhee, Brew Moore, Charlie Parker, and Flip Phillips. However, there is no evidence that Davis or other mainstream jazz musicians were influenced by the use of modes in Afro-Cuban jazz, or other branches of Latin jazz.\n\nFree jazz, and the related form of avant-garde jazz, broke through into an open space of \"free tonality\" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of world music from India, Africa, and Arabia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing. While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed. The bassist Charles Mingus is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres.\n\nThe first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of Ornette Coleman (whose 1960 album \"\" coined the term) and Cecil Taylor. In the 1960s, exponents included Albert Ayler, Gato Barbieri, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Larry Coryell, John Coltrane, Bill Dixon, Jimmy Giuffre, Steve Lacy, Michael Mantler, Sun Ra, Roswell Rudd, Pharoah Sanders, and John Tchicai. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, a rhythm section honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the classic \"Chasin' the 'Trane\", which \"Down Beat\" magazine panned as \"anti-jazz\". On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new Impulse! Records in 1960 and turning it into \"the house that Trane built\", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably Archie Shepp, who often played with trumpeter Bill Dixon, who organized the 4-day \"October Revolution in Jazz\" in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.\n\nA series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, utilization of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings \"The John Coltrane Quartet Plays\", \"Living Space\" and \"Transition\" (both June 1965), \"New Thing at Newport\" (July 1965), \"Sun Ship\" (August 1965), and \"First Meditations\" (September 1965).\n\nIn June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded \"Ascension\", a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avante-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. Dave Liebman later called it \"the torch that lit the free jazz thing.\". After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.\n\nFree jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, Steve Lacy, and Eric Dolphy spent extended periods of time there, and European musicians such as Michael Mantler and John Tchicai traveled to the U.S. to experience American music firsthand. European contemporary jazz was shaped by Peter Broetzmann, John Surman, Krzysztof Komeda, Zbigniew Namysłowski, Tomasz Stanko, Lars Gullin, Joe Harriott, Albert Mangelsdorff, Kenny Wheeler, Graham Collier, Michael Garrick and Mike Westbrook. They were eager to develop approaches to music that reflected their heritage.\n\nSince the 1960s, creative centers of jazz in Europe have developed, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam. Following the work of drummer Han Bennink and pianist Misha Mengelberg, musicians started to explore by improvising collectively until a form (melody, rhythm, a famous song) is found Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book \"New Dutch Swing\". Since the 1990s Keith Jarrett has defended free jazz from criticism. British writer Stuart Nicholson has argued European contemporary jazz has an identity different from American jazz and follows a different trajectory.\n\nLatin jazz is the term used to describe jazz which employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be Afro-Latin jazz, as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are Afro-Cuban jazz and Brazilian jazz.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music, and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as \"Latin tunes\", with no distinction between a Cuban son montuno and a Brazilian bossa nova. Even as late as 2000, in Mark Gridley's \"Jazz Styles: History and Analysis\", a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a \"Latin bass figure.\" It was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban tumbao while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as \"Manteca\", \"On Green Dolphin Street\" and \"Song for My Father\" have a \"Latin\" A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would only play an even-eighth \"Latin\" feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin jazz specialists like Cal Tjader tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of \"A Night in Tunisia\", pianist Vince Guaraldi soloed through the entire form over an authentic mambo.\n\nAfro-Cuban jazz often uses Afro-Cuban instruments such as congas, timbales, güiro, and claves, combined with piano, double bass, etc. Afro-Cuban jazz began with Machito's Afro-Cubans in the early 1940s, but took off and entered the mainstream in the late 1940s when bebop musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Billy Taylor began experimenting with Cuban rhythms. Mongo Santamaria and Cal Tjader further refined the genre in the late 1950s.\n\nAlthough a great deal of Cuban-based Latin jazz is modal, Latin jazz is not always modal: it can be as harmonically expansive as post-bop jazz. For example, Tito Puente recorded an arrangement of \"Giant Steps\" done to an Afro-Cuban guaguancó. A Latin jazz piece may momentarily contract harmonically, as in the case of a percussion solo over a one or two-chord piano guajeo.\n\nGuajeo is the name for the typical Afro-Cuban ostinato melodies which are commonly used motifs in Latin jazz compositions. They originated in the genre known as son. Guajeos provide a rhythmic and melodic framework that may be varied within certain parameters, whilst still maintaining a repetitive – and thus \"danceable\" – structure. Most guajeos are rhythmically based on clave (rhythm).\n\nGuajeos are one of the most important elements of the vocabulary of Afro-Cuban descarga (jazz-inspired instrumental jams), providing a means of tension and resolution and a sense of forward momentum, within a relatively simple harmonic structure. The use of multiple, contrapuntal guajeos in Latin jazz facilitates simultaneous collective improvisation based on theme variation. In a way, this polyphonic texture is reminiscent of the original New Orleans style of jazz.\n\nFor most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both salsa dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass). During 1974–1976, they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri's most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.\n\nThis occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba The first Cuban band of this new wave was Irakere. Their \"Chékere-son\" (1976) introduced a style of \"Cubanized\" bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time. It was based on Charlie Parker's composition \"Billie's Bounce\", jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines. In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric / jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz: their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as timba.\n\nBrazilian jazz such as bossa nova is derived from samba, with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese or English, whilst the related term jazz-samba describes an adaptation of street samba into jazz.\n\nThe bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim and was made popular by Elizete Cardoso's recording of \"Chega de Saudade\" on the \"Canção do Amor Demais\" LP. Gilberto's initial releases, and the 1959 film \"Black Orpheus\", achieved significant popularity in Latin America; this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova's popularity and led to a worldwide boom, with 1963's \"Getz/Gilberto\", numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra, and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music.\n\nBrazilian percussionists such as Airto Moreira and Naná Vasconcelos also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles, thus attracting a greater audience to them.\n\nPost-bop jazz is a form of small-combo jazz derived from earlier bop styles. The genre's origins lie in seminal work by John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Bill Evans, Charles Mingus, Wayne Shorter, and Herbie Hancock. Generally, the term post-bop is taken to mean jazz from the mid-sixties onwards that assimilates influences from hard bop, modal jazz, the avant-garde and free jazz, without necessarily being immediately identifiable as any of the above.\n\nMuch post-bop was recorded for Blue Note Records. Key albums include \"Speak No Evil\" by Shorter; \"The Real McCoy\" by McCoy Tyner; \"Maiden Voyage\" by Hancock; \"Miles Smiles\" by Davis; and \"Search for the New Land\" by Lee Morgan (an artist who is not typically associated with the post-bop genre). Most post-bop artists worked in other genres as well, with a particularly strong overlap with the earlier hard bop.\n\nSoul jazz was a development of hard bop which incorporated strong influences from blues, gospel and rhythm and blues to create music for small groups, often the organ trio of Hammond organ, drummer and tenor saxophonist. Unlike hard bop, soul jazz generally emphasized repetitive grooves and melodic hooks, and improvisations were often less complex than in other jazz styles. It often had a steadier \"funk\" style groove, which was different from the swing rhythms typical of much hard bop.\n\nHorace Silver had a large influence on the soul jazz style, with songs that used funky and often gospel-based piano vamps. Important soul jazz organists included Jimmy McGriff, Jimmy Smith and Johnny Hammond Smith, and influential tenor saxophone players included Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis and Stanley Turrentine.\n\nThere was a resurgence of interest in jazz and other forms of African-American cultural expression during the Black Arts Movement and Black nationalist period of the 1960s and 1970s. African themes became popular, and many new jazz compositions were given African-related titles: \"Black Nile\" (Wayne Shorter), \"Blue Nile\" (Alice Coltrane), \"Obirin African\" (Art Blakey), \"Zambia\" (Lee Morgan), \"Appointment in Ghana\" (Jackie McLean), \"Marabi\" (Cannonball Adderley), \"Yoruba\" (Hubert Laws), and many more. Pianist Randy Weston's music incorporated African elements, such as in the large-scale suite \"Uhuru Africa\" (with the participation of poet Langston Hughes) and \"Highlife: Music From the New African Nations.\" Both Weston and saxophonist Stanley Turrentine covered the Nigerian Bobby Benson's piece \"Niger Mambo\", which features Afro-Caribbean and jazz elements within a West African Highlife style. Some musicians, including Pharoah Sanders, Hubert Laws, and Wayne Shorter, began using African instruments such as kalimbas, bells, beaded gourds and other instruments which were not traditional to jazz.\n\nDuring this period, there was an increased use of the typical African 12/8 cross-rhythmic structure in jazz. Herbie Hancock's \"Succotash\" on \"Inventions and Dimensions\" (1963) is an open-ended modal improvised jam, in which Hancock's pattern of attack-points, rather than the pattern of pitches, is the primary focus of his improvisations, accompanied by Paul Chambers on bass, percussionist Osvaldo Martinez playing a traditional Afro-Cuban chekeré part and Willie Bobo playing an Abakuá bell pattern on a snare drum with brushes.\n\nThe first jazz standard composed by a non-Latino to use an overt African cross-rhythm was Wayne Shorter's \"Footprints\" (1967). On the version recorded on \"Miles Smiles\" by Miles Davis, the bass switches to a tresillo figure at 2:20. \"Footprints\" is not, however, a Latin jazz tune: African rhythmic structures are accessed directly by Ron Carter (bass) and Tony Williams (drums) via the rhythmic sensibilities of swing. Throughout the piece, the four beats, whether sounded or not, are maintained as the temporal referent. The following example shows the and forms of the bass line. The slashed noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes), where one ordinarily taps their foot to \"keep time.\"\n\n</score>\n\nThe use of pentatonic scales was another trend associated with Africa. The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years.\n\nMcCoy Tyner perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos, and also used parallel fifths and fourths, which are common harmonies in West Africa.\n\nThe minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation, and like a blues scale, a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues. The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by Joe Henderson on Horace Silver's \"African Queen\" (1965).\n\nJazz pianist, theorist, and educator Mark Levine refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the \"V pentatonic scale\".\n\nLevine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II-V-I jazz progression. This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis' \"Tune Up.\" The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II-V-I progression.\n\nAccordingly, John Coltrane's \"Giant Steps\" (1960), with its 26 chords per 16 bars, can be played using only three pentatonic scales. Coltrane studied Nicolas Slonimsky's \"Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns\", which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of \"Giant Steps\". The harmonic complexity of \"Giant Steps\" is on the level of the most advanced 20th-century art music. Superimposing the pentatonic scale over \"Giant Steps\" is not merely a matter of harmonic simplification, but also a sort of \"Africanizing\" of the piece, which provides an alternate approach for soloing. Mark Levine observes that when mixed in with more conventional \"playing the changes\", pentatonic scales provide \"structure and a feeling of increased space.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock fusion was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.\n\nAccording to AllMusic:\n\n... until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate. [However, ...] as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with hard bop and did not want to play strictly avant-garde music, the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces.\n\nIn 1969, Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with \"In a Silent Way\", which can be considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer Teo Macero, this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the development of ambient music.\n\nAs Davis recalls:\n\nThe music I was really listening to in 1968 was James Brown, the great guitar player Jimi Hendrix, and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, \"Dance to the Music\", Sly and the Family Stone ... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded \"In a Silent Way\" I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.\n\nTwo contributors to \"In a Silent Way\" also joined organist Larry Young to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums: \"Emergency!\" by The Tony Williams Lifetime.\n\nPianist Herbie Hancock (a Davis alumnus) released four albums in the short-lived (1970–1973) psychedelic-jazz subgenre: \"Mwandishi\" (1972), \"Crossings\" (1973), and \"Sextant\" (1973). The rhythmic background was a mix of rock, funk, and African-type textures.\n\nMusicians who had previously worked with Davis formed the four most influential fusion groups: Weather Report and Mahavishnu Orchestra emerged in 1971 and were soon followed by Return to Forever and The Headhunters.\n\nWeather Report's self-titled electronic and psychedelic \"Weather Report\" debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in 1971, thanks to the pedigree of the group's members (including percussionist Airto Moreira), and their unorthodox approach to music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing soprano saxophone, and with no synthesizers involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde experiments which Joe Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on \"Bitches Brew\", including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favour of continuous rhythm and movement – but took the music further. To emphasise the group's rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the inscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece \"Milky Way\", which featured by Shorter's extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul's piano strings while the latter pedalled the instrument. \"Down Beat\" described the album as \"music beyond category\", and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine's polls that year.\n\nWeather Report's subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.\n\nAlthough some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful amplification, \"fuzz\" pedals, wah-wah pedals and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands. Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, Eddie Harris, keyboardists Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist Gary Burton, drummer Tony Williams (drummer), violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, guitarists Larry Coryell, Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, and Frank Zappa, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where the band Casiopea released over thirty fusion albums.\n\nAccording to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, \"just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same\" with albums such as Williams' \"Emergency!\" (1970) and Davis' \"Agharta\" (1975), which Nicholson said \"suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before.\" This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre \"mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio\" at the end of the 1970s.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and, often, the presence of electronic analog synthesizers. Jazz-funk also draws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican reggae, notably Kingston bandleader Sonny Bradshaw. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.\n\nEarly examples are Herbie Hancock's Headhunters band and Miles Davis' \"On the Corner\" album, which, in 1972, began Davis' foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. The album was a culmination of sorts of the \"musique concrète\" approach that Davis and producer Teo Macero had begun to explore in the late 1960s.\n\nThe 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, as well as the hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.\n\nFor example, several musicians who had been prominent in the fusion genre during the 1970s began to record acoustic jazz once more, including Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock. Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for example, Bill Evans, Joe Henderson, and Stan Getz. Even the 1980s music of Miles Davis, although certainly still fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognisably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.\n\nThe emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older, established musicians' groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community. In the 1970s, the groups of Betty Carter and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as hard bop and bebop. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey's band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as Valery Ponomarev and Bobby Watson, Dennis Irwin and James Williams.\nIn the 1980s, in addition to Wynton and Branford Marsalis, the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as Donald Brown, Mulgrew Miller, and later, Benny Green, bassists such as Charles Fambrough, Lonnie Plaxico (and later, Peter Washington and Essiet Essiet) horn players such as Bill Pierce, Donald Harrison and later Javon Jackson and Terence Blanchard emerged as talented jazz musicians, all of whom made significant contributions in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nThe young Jazz Messengers' contemporaries, including Roy Hargrove, Marcus Roberts, Wallace Roney and Mark Whitfield were also influenced by Wynton Marsalis's emphasis toward jazz tradition. These younger rising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk and early recordings of the first Miles Davis quintet. This group of \"Young Lions\" sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.\n\nIn addition, Betty Carter's rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York's preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers. Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni Benny Green, Branford Marsalis and Ralph Peterson Jr., as well as Kenny Washington, Lewis Nash, Curtis Lundy, Cyrus Chestnut, Mark Shim, Craig Handy, Greg Hutchinson and Marc Cary, Taurus Mateen and Geri Allen.\n\nO.T.B. ensemble included a rotation of young jazz musicians such as Kenny Garrett, Steve Wilson, Kenny Davis, Renee Rosnes, Ralph Peterson Jr., Billy Drummond, and Robert Hurst.\n\nA similar reaction took place against free jazz. According to Ted Gioia:\n\nthe very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz. Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. Cecil Taylor played duets in concert with Mary Lou Williams, and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or Don Pullen may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.\n\nPianist Keith Jarrett—whose bands of the 1970s had played only original compositions with prominent free jazz elements—established his so-called 'Standards Trio' in 1983, which, although also occasionally exploring collective improvisation, has primarily performed and recorded jazz standards. Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.\n\nIn 1987, the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative John Conyers Jr. to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating \"jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention, support and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated.\" It passed in the House on September 23, 1987 and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called \"pop fusion\" or \"smooth jazz\" became successful, garnering significant radio airplay in \"quiet storm\" time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U.S. This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including Al Jarreau, Anita Baker, Chaka Khan, and Sade, as well as saxophonists including Grover Washington Jr., Kenny G, Kirk Whalum, Boney James, and David Sanborn. In general, smooth jazz is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are of 90–105 beats per minute), and has a lead melody-playing instrument (saxophone, especially soprano and tenor, and legato electric guitar are popular).\n\nIn his \"Newsweek\" article \"The Problem With Jazz Criticism\", Stanley Crouch considers Miles Davis' playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz. Critic Aaron J. West has countered the often negative perceptions of smooth jazz, stating:\n\nI challenge the prevalent marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz in the standard jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.\n\nAcid jazz developed in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by jazz-funk and electronic dance music. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including Sampling (music) or a live DJ cutting and scratching), but it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. Richard S. Ginell of AllMusic considers Roy Ayers \"one of the prophets of acid jazz.\"\n\nNu jazz is influenced by jazz harmony and melodies, and there are usually no improvisational aspects. It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz house (as exemplified by St Germain, Jazzanova, and Fila Brazillia) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, The Cinematic Orchestra, Kobol and the Norwegian \"future jazz\" style pioneered by Bugge Wesseltoft, Jaga Jazzist, and Nils Petter Molvær).\n\nJazz rap developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into hip hop. In 1988, Gang Starr released the debut single \"Words I Manifest\", which sampled Dizzy Gillespie's 1962 \"Night in Tunisia\", and Stetsasonic released \"Talkin' All That Jazz\", which sampled Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr's debut LP \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" (1989) and their 1990 track \"Jazz Thing\" sampled Charlie Parker and Ramsey Lewis. The groups which made up the Native Tongues Posse tended toward jazzy releases: these include the Jungle Brothers' debut \"Straight Out the Jungle\" (1988), and A Tribe Called Quest's \"People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm\" (1990) and \"The Low End Theory\" (1991). Rap duo Pete Rock & CL Smooth incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut \"Mecca and the Soul Brother\". Rapper Guru's Jazzmatazz series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.\n\nAlthough jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis' final album \"Doo-Bop\" (released posthumously in 1992) was based on hip hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee. Davis' ex-bandmate Herbie Hancock also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album \"Dis Is Da Drum\" in 1994.\n\nThe relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with post-punk in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz. In London, the Pop Group began to mix free jazz and dub reggae into their brand of punk rock. In New York, No Wave took direct inspiration from both free jazz and punk. Examples of this style include Lydia Lunch's \"Queen of Siam\", Gray, the work of James Chance and the Contortions (who mixed Soul with free jazz and punk) and the Lounge Lizards (the first group to call themselves \"punk jazz\").\n\nJohn Zorn took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock, and incorporated this into free jazz with the release of the \"Spy vs. Spy\" album in 1986, a collection of Ornette Coleman tunes done in the contemporary thrashcore style. In the same year, Sonny Sharrock, Peter Brötzmann, Bill Laswell, and Ronald Shannon Jackson recorded the first album under the name Last Exit, a similarly aggressive blend of thrash and free jazz. These developments are the origins of \"jazzcore\", the fusion of free jazz with hardcore punk.\n\nThe M-Base movement started in the 1980s, when a loose collective of young African-American musicians in New York which included Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, and Gary Thomas developed a complex but grooving sound.\n\nIn the 1990s, most M-Base participants turned to more conventional music, but Coleman, the most active participant, continued developing his music in accordance with the M-Base concept.\n\nColeman's audience decreased, but his music and concepts influenced many musicians, according to pianist Vijay Iver and critic Ben Ratlifff of \"The New York Times\".\n\nM-Base changed from a movement of a loose collective of young musicians to a kind of informal Coleman \"school\", with a much advanced but already originally implied concept. Steve Coleman's music and M-Base concept gained recognition as \"next logical step\" after Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman.\n\nSince the 1990s, jazz has been characterized by a pluralism in which no one style dominates, but rather a wide range of styles and genres are popular. Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist Brad Mehldau and The Bad Plus have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists Greg Osby and Charles Gayle, while others, such as James Carter, have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.\n\nHarry Connick Jr. began his career playing stride piano and the dixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was ten years old. Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist Ellis Marsalis. Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie \"When Harry Met Sally\", which sold over two million copies. Crossover success has also been achieved by Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Cassandra Wilson, Kurt Elling, and Jamie Cullum.\n\nA number of players who usually perform in largely straight-ahead settings have emerged since the 1990s, including pianists Jason Moran and Vijay Iyer, guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, vibraphonist Stefon Harris, trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Terence Blanchard, saxophonists Chris Potter and Joshua Redman, clarinetist Ken Peplowski and bassist Christian McBride.\n\nAlthough jazz-rock fusion reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments and rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach include Pat Metheny, John Abercrombie, John Scofield and the Swedish group e.s.t. Since the beginning of the 90s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that didn't necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz). Artists like Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Flying Lotus and sub genres like IDM, Drum n' Bass, Jungle and Techno ended up incorporating a lot of these elements. Squarepusher being cited as one big influence for jazz performers drummer Mark Guiliana and pianist Brad Mehldau, showing the correlations between jazz and electronic music are a two way street.\n\nIn 2001, Ken Burns's documentary \"Jazz\" was premiered on PBS, featuring Wynton Marsalis and other experts reviewing the entire history of American jazz to that time. It received some criticism, however, for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non-American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed, and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the 20th century.\n\nThe mid-2010s have seen an increasing influence of R&B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, Kendrick Lamar released his third studio album, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\". The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as Thundercat and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist Kamasi Washington released his nearly three-hour long debut, \"The Epic\". Its hip-hop inspired beats and R&B vocal interludes was not only acclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant, but also sparked a small resurgence in jazz on the internet.\n\nAnother internet-aided trend of 2010's jazz is that of extreme reharmonization, inspired by both virtuosic players known for their speed and rhythm such as Art Tatum, as well as players known for their ambitious voicings and chords such as Bill Evans. Supergroup Snarky Puppy has adopted this trend and has allowed for players like Cory Henry to shape the grooves and harmonies of modern jazz soloing. YouTube phenomenon Jacob Collier also gained recognition for his ability to play an incredibly large number of instruments and his ability to use microtones, advanced polyrhythms, and blend a spectrum of genres in his largely homemade production process.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26307957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26307957", "title": "Johann Dieter Wassmann", "text": "Johann Dieter Wassmann\n\nJohann Dieter Wassmann (1841–1898) is a fictitious artist and sewerage engineer, purportedly from Leipzig, Saxony, in east-central Germany. He is the creation of the American-born artist and writer Jeff Wassmann. As a result of the widespread dissemination of his work, Johann Dieter Wassmann is sometimes mistakenly cited as a lesser-known figure among late-19th-century European artists; he is most often identified as an early purveyor of the Dada and Surrealist movements and has become closely associated with several notable artists of the first half of the 20th century, including Kurt Schwitters, Marcel Duchamp, Eugène Atget and Joseph Cornell.\n\nAccording to his fictitious biography, Johann Dieter Wassmann was born in Leipzig, where he witnessed the industrial revolution rapidly alter the once agrarian, guild-based and perhaps idealized Electorate of Saxony. In portraying his character as fearful of a less humanitarian world—ill at ease with the changing roles of science, medicine, religion, education, cosmology and time—the artist challenges the viewer to share in the conflicts and anxieties of this ubiquitous thinker. A pivotal event in the author's narrative is Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig (1813), recalled first-hand by the character's father. The artist uses Napoleon's rise metaphorically to represent the onslaught of the modern era and his defeat at Leipzig as hope all was not lost of the Romantic era.\n\nThe construction of Johann Dieter Wassmann trades heavily on the aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge's notion of suspension of disbelief to justify the use of certain fantastic or non-realistic elements. Coleridge asserts that if the author can bring a \"human interest and a semblance of truth\" into a fantastic tale, the reader/viewer will withhold judgement on any improbability that might normally render the story doubtful, a contention the artist is reliant on for his audience to fully engage.\n\nAs a sewerage engineer, we see Johann Dieter Wassmann participate in the development of a more modern and scientific approach to the control of infectious disease in cities including Hanover, Göteborg, Dresden, Mexico City and Sydney. As a lecturer at the University of Leipzig, we experience him prompting students to fully explore the creative process, concerned as he is at the decline of liberal education. But Wassmann's lasting legacy is found in his private devotion to his art. (See #Gallery section below.)\n\nJohann Dieter Wassmann is born into a long line of carpenters on April 2, 1841, the son of August and Maria Wassmann. The youngest of five children to survive into adulthood, he is brought up in the Lutheran creed. After the March Revolutions of 1848, the family flees from Leipzig to Weimar. A bout with rheumatic fever forces Johann to delay the start of his schooling until the age of eight. As a cabinetmaker in Weimar, his father's clients soon include Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt, among others, in what becomes a Grand Tour through 19th-century Germany's music, art, literary and academic elites.\n\nJohann goes on to attend the University of Leipzig before joining an engineering practice, specializing in the emerging field of sewerage management. At 34 he is offered a teaching post in Leipzig. In 1881, six years into his post, Johann sets out to challenge his engineering students through construction of boxed assemblage works enigmatically addressing medical and scientific themes that he feels go unresolved through traditional lecture practices. After an extended display at a Dresden clinic, they become known as the \"Dresden Boxes.\" These works build on the tradition of German wunderkammern and 17th-century Dutch perspective boxes, but display a stripped down aesthetic, precise, but refined.\n\nThrough his extensive travels in his private practice, Johann is exposed to the best and worst 19th-century urban development has to offer. His growing angst at what he sees as the encroachment of modernity causes him to begin a second, more personal series of boxes, escaping into a romanticized view of a pre-modern Saxony, much of it set in the ancient wood of Goethe and amidst the hopeful spectre of the American Transcendentalist authors Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. By this point Johann is comfortably married with three children, so the intent of this second stage of boxes is largely private: they are mostly shared with family.\n\nIn September 1889, an academic conference in Potsdam brings Johann together with the physicist Max Planck in what results in a seismic shift in Johann's thinking. From here onwards he outright rejects his boxed works of recent years, brandishing them reactionary and \"Biedermeier,\" before moving on to a third and final phase of work, the start of his \"early Modern\" period.\n\nJohann comes to realize his angst is born not in the modernity of the 19th century, but in the earlier reaches of the Enlightenment he was so recently praising. As the Newtonian perception of a clockwork universe merges with the force of social Darwinism he recognizes that the rising mantra of \"progress\" has now split the world into two distinct entities: time and space. If he is to return to a unified field of time and space he knows his only choice is not to look back, but to move forward into the modern—into the unknown.\n\nPlanck is presenting a paper at the conference on the second law of thermodynamics, the subject of his recent doctoral thesis. The first to call himself a \"theoretical\" physicist, Planck opens his lecture in Potsdam with the revelation that, \"My original decision to devote myself to science was a direct result of the discovery... that the laws of human reasoning coincide with the laws governing the sequences of the impressions we receive from the world around us; that, therefore, pure reasoning can enable man to gain an insight into the mechanism of the world.\" He concludes by expressing a belief that physical laws allow him to presuppose that the \"... outside world is something independent from man, something absolute, and the quest for the laws which apply to this absolute appeared... as the most sublime pursuit in life.\"\n\nIn Planck, Johann discovers a friend and colleague dedicated to the pursuit of a non-Newtonian world-view in which the linear nature of absolute time and space will dissolve into one of a multidimensional universe free of the strictures of past, present and future. Johann's remaining years will be spent expressing these early modern notions through his beloved boxes and an emerging interest in photography.\n\nPlanck soon introduces Johann to the writings of Ernst Mach, particularly \"Analysis of Sensations\" (1886). Here Johann finds Mach arguing that all knowledge is derived from sensation. Mach credits his philosophical awakening to reading, at age fifteen, his father's copy of Immanuel Kant's \"Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics\": \"The book made at the time a powerful and ineffaceable impression upon me, the like of which I never afterwards experienced in any of my philosophical reading. Some two or three years later the superfluity of the role played by “the thing in itself” abruptly dawned upon me. On a bright summer day in the open air, the world with my ego suddenly appeared to me as one coherent mass of sensations, only more strongly coherent in the ego. Although the actual working out of this thought did not occur until a later period, yet this moment was decisive for my whole view.\"\n\nAll scientific investigation is a result of the experience, or \"sensation,\" of the observer, Mach argues—later a determining factor in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. But in the more immediate term, Mach has laid the groundwork for Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, published in 1905.\n\nMuch like Woody Allen's fictional 1920s character Leonard Zelig, Johann Dieter Wassmann finds himself caught up in this cacophony of ideas, theories and movements, allowing him to take an active part in one of the great revolutions of the modern era.\n\nAmongst the cacophony is the advent of photography. Throughout the 1890s, Johann continues to expand the visual vocabulary of his assemblage works, but he also begins to experiment with the latent image, using both a bulky glass-plate view camera, as well as several of the newly developed hand-held roll-film cameras. Over an eight-year period he documents the landscapes, streetscapes, architecture and interiors of eastern Germany, in a style that extends beyond the topographic traditions of the day. These photographic works provide the missing link between the meticulous, but still largely prescriptive street imagery of mid-19th-century photographer Charles Marville, and the lyrical melancholy of Eugène Atget in the early 20th century. As a predecessor to his fellow countrymen Heinrich Zille and August Sander, Johann discreetly anticipates what vast potential the photographic arts holds for the coming age.\n\nUntil the modern era catches up with him, that is. On January 6, 1898, Johann slips on ice while boarding a tram in Leipzig; his right leg is crushed, requiring amputation. He dies of a streptococcal infection on March 18, 1898, two weeks shy of his 57th birthday.\n\nThe vast trove of artworks Johann has amassed travels to Washington, D.C. with family members in 1910, but remains in storage through two wars with Germany. Only in 1969 is the Wassmann Foundation established, with the works slowly coming to prominence in the years since.\n\nThis elaborate fiction allows Johann Dieter Wassmann to escape the conceptual and physical boundaries of the art of his time, making him a pioneer of German modernism, his work emerging as a long lost precursor to the modern art methods and movements we now know as assemblage, collage, installation, Constructivism, Dada and Surrealism.\n\nJohann Dieter Wassmann is part of a long history of artistic pseudonyms and hoaxes. Rrose Sélavy was just one of the pseudonyms used by the artist Marcel Duchamp. In Jeff Wassmann's adopted home of Australia, Ern Malley was the creation of writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart. The 1944 Ern Malley affair, as it is known, remains Australia's most celebrated literary hoax. In the late 1990s, the artist Walid Raad began constructing elaborate fictions chronicling the contemporary history of his native Lebanon, signing his work The Atlas Group and presenting it as a body of collective scholarship. More recently, a New York-based art collective known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation has seen considerable critical and commercial success. In November 2013, a silkscreen by these anonymous artists, \"Hooverville,\" depicting the New York skyline with hobos, was auctioned for $425,000 at Sotheby's New York.\n\nIn an artistic intervention known as culture jamming, Wassmann has also intertwined his work with contemporary literary conceits. In 2006, Rohan Kriwaczek created a sensation with his publication of \"An Incomplete History of the Art of the Funerary Violin\" (Overlook Press), which purported to trace the lost history of the funerary violin. Shortly before publication, the book was exposed to the \"New York Times\" as a hoax by a book buyer at Prairie Lights Books in Iowa City, Iowa. Wassmann stepped in to confuse matters further by using an additional character, a German curator, to defend Kriwaczek in online literary blogs and discussion pages, claiming that as a child in Leipzig, August Wassmann (the character's father) had known one of the funerary violinists Kriwaczek cites, further proof of the funerary violin. Wassmann had been sent an advance copy of the book by the owner of Prairie Lights Books, Jim Harris, allowing him to comment with apparent authority on the book's contents prior to publication.\n\nThe character of Johann Dieter Wassmann was launched under the supposed auspices of the fictitious Wassmann Foundation, Washington, D.C. in the solo exhibition \"Bleeding Napoleon\" at the Melbourne International Arts Festival 2003. Since that time, the artist has created a rival institution vying to have the works of Johann Dieter Wassmann repatriated to Germany: MuseumZeitraum Leipzig.\n\nIn the United States, Johann Dieter Wassmann is best known through a long-running Google Adwords campaign in the \"New York Times\". The ads, with politically charged entendres such as \"The Wassmann Foundation - art & philanthropy - forging a better tomorrow\", have received over nineteen million page-views in the newspaper's online Arts section. \"Art in America's\" Washington, D.C. correspondent, James Mahoney, has written, \n\nAs the Wassmann Foundation and related characters have evolved, the project has come to function on three distinct levels. Firstly, the artist endeavours to scrutinise the ever-increasing presence of artist, curator and art institution alike, as brands. In establishing his own artist, curators and institutions as wholly fictitious, the contemporary artist is free to explore these roles as pure brand, existent for no other purpose than critical assessment.\n\nSecondly, the artist argues that the unresolved angst of our current age is the culmination of the mistakes of modernity. We catch a glimpse of this angst, as expressed by the sewerage engineer protagonist, before losing clarity to the mounting failures of the 20th and now 21st-centuries, distorting our anxieties beyond recognition.\n\nLastly, on a third level, the project points up a certain paradox created by the proliferation of the worldwide-web: in a mass society, the individual grows in importance, rather than diminishes.\n\nFor artists and individuals in what were formerly the planet's outer reaches, Wassmann has seen the web democratize access to the structures and machinations of power to an extent previously unimagined. He contends that little more than 25 years after the art world discovered there was an outside and a periphery, they suddenly find it is gone. In a postcolonial/internet age, there is only the center to be fought over and for the artist, the ensuing chaos to decipher. Where once the internet merely informed the political process, Wassmann has argued that the internet would, and now has developed the immense capability of wholly transforming political process. While projects such as Wassmann's function on a relatively benign level, he believes the realigned power structures they allude to allow individuals outside the arts to masterfully, and often frighteningly, alter the real world irretrievably.\n\n"}

Kevin started ventriloquism when he was 9 years old, after his parents gave him a pull-string dummy for Christmas. Having no formal training, he taught himself the art of ventriloquism over a 4-year period. He developed his technique from parrots. It intrigued him that parrots could speak so clearly without the use of lips. Kevin later re-learned how to speak all together with the use of his tongue and his throat. Kevin was introduced to the stage by his grandfather Harley Noles, who performed magic shows throughout Colorado. He told Kevin, “If you get good enough, you can open for my show.” At the age of 13, he performed in his grandfather's show with a 5 minute act with a wooden puppet (Raymond), that his grandfather made for him.\n\nDuring his college days, Johnson taught and entertained youth at a local church where he found a receptive audience for his humor. Upon graduation from college in El Cajon, California, Johnson started performing at the San Diego Zoo in 1994. He then auditioned at Legoland California to pursue his art full-time, and in February 1999, Johnson got the spot and was performing three to four 20-minute shows each day at the Legoland Playtown Theater. Legoland California nominated him for the Big E Awards through IAAPA and won the honor of “Best Male Performer” in 2004 and 2006. Kevin is the only known performer to be recognized twice. IAAPA is the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, and includes attractions from over 90 countries.\nKevin is mostly recognized from his 2006 appearance on NBC’s primetime show \"America's Got Talent\". He performed his signature \"Godzilla Theater\" performance, during which his voice and the voices of his puppets are out of synchronization with their mouth movements. He had developed a different version of his performance specifically for the semi-finals, in which he also exchanges voices with his puppets and simulates echos, but didn't get enough audience votes to advance to the finals.\n\nIn February 2007, Kevin appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman for the show's second \"Ventriloquist Week\". Starting in 2008, Johnson has started doing shows on board the Disney Cruise Line ship, \"The Disney Magic.\" These shows last about 45 minutes and feature Clyde and Matilda, along with another puppet that is much more human like, whose name is Harley.\nHe has recently finished a nine-year run at San Diego’s Legoland California Theme Park where he performed 8,824 shows. He is currently performing during the Summer Nights at Busch Gardens Tampa.Kevin also performs every Tuesday at the Lawrence Welk Resort in Escondido, California, performing a 40 minute show alongside magician Anthony the Magic in a show entitled \"The Comedy and Magic Show\".\nClyde and Matilda are his signature puppets. In 1983, Johnson was introduced to Clyde the Buzzard in his native state of Colorado, and performed his first \"real\" show with his grandfather. Nearly 10 years later, in 1991, Kevin was introduced to Matilda the Cockatoo. After adding Matilda to Clyde he performed as a trio.\n\nJohnson is married and lives in nearby Temecula with his wife Cherie and their five children. Including the fabulous Cameron Johnson.\n\n"}

The bands involved limited their releases to very small numbers (often just enough to get to the other circle members), and distributed them among friends and close workers.\n\nPossibly the circle was formed in the late 1980s, early 1990s, in response to the supposed Norwegian \"Black Metal Inner Circle\". According to a 2005 series in \"Terrorizer\" magazine on the history of black metal, \"A bunch of corpsepainted characters, rumoured to be drawn from such acts as Mütiilation, Torgeist and Vlad Tepes named themselves the 'Black Legions' as a tribute to the so-called 'Black Mafia' Norwegian BM heroes Darkthrone and Burzum, who were supposedly ready to terrorize Christians a couple of years before.\" The first recordings of LLN members came about in the early 1990s, and their influence was acknowledged in the same issue of \"Terrorizer\": \"One should never count out France, primarily as the home of the inscrutably influential Black Legions of ridiculous rawness during the mid-90s.\"\n\nRegarding their influences, Wlad Drakksteim of Vlad Tepes referred, in an interview with \"Petrified\" magazine, to Hellhammer and especially Bathory: \"Every True Black Metal Horde should play in old Bathory style.\" When asked about the \"Norwegian Black Metal Mafia\", he said, \"Norwegian mafia did lots of 'bad' things to this world. With Euronymous death MAYHEM is definitely dead and it's better like that as it will help Black Metal to return to darkness. [Euronymous] must be in peace now so I don't complain [lament?] him. And about Varg Vikernes (BURZUM) I don't have any opinion. WE have OUR opinions and he certainly knows them so...\"\n\nThe best-known bands of the LLN are Mütiilation (the one-man band formed by William Roussel, also known as Meyhna'ch), Belketre, Torgeist, and Vlad Tepes.\n\nVlad Tepes have been outspoken in the goals of their black metal: \"We are Black Legions of Satan, we are the immortal warriors of Black imperial blood. We are here to pervert christian worms and they shall face the Black holocaust. It's near!\"\n\nWhile none of the bands involved in Les Légions Noires released any new material from 1998 to 2014, Belketre released a new EP entitled \"Ryan Èvn-A\" in 2015. It is unclear if the bands were inactive during that time or simply preferred not to release their material to the public.\n\n\n"}

The western-most geographical extreme of Australia is Steep Point, whereas the eastern-most extreme is Cape Byron. Similarly, the northern-most geographical extreme is Cape York Peninsula, and the southern-most is the South East Cape. The distance between the east and west as the crow flies is , or from north to south*. The western-most capital city in Australia is Perth, and the eastern-most capital city is Brisbane. The northern-most city is Darwin, and the southern to the southern-most city is Hobart.\n\nWalkers who choose to circumambulate Australia can follow the National Highway for large sections of their journey. Of the people who have successfully circumambulated the continent, it took a range of 365–601 days to complete. Distances involved are in the vicinity of to 17,000 km depending on the route taken.\n\nOnly six people are known to have completed solo unaccompanied circumnavigations, passing through all mainland states and territories, without a support vehicle. These include Aidan de Brune, Nobby Young, Colin Ricketts, Andrew 'Cad' Cadigan, Scott Loxely, Mike Pauly and Terra Roam.\n\nThe names of the individuals who have walked across Australia have been listed below in chronological order. Sources for data contained within this table have been listed within the body of the article, or where not readily available, directly from the individual concerned.\n\nRobert O'Hara Burke was an Irish soldier and police officer, who achieved fame as an Australian explorer. He was the leader of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition, which was the first expedition to cross Australia from south to north. The expedition left Melbourne on 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels and 23 horses. Burke, along with William Wills, John King and Charley Gray, reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. Upon returning, the expedition was weakened by starvation and exposure, and was hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season. Burke died at a place now called Burke's Waterhole on Cooper Creek in South Australia. The exact date of Burke's death is uncertain, but has generally been accepted to be 28 June 1861.\n\nWilliam Wills was a member of the famous Victorian Exploring Expedition. He was originally appointed as third-in-command, surveyor, astronomical and meteorological observer of the expedition in July 1860 on a salary of £300 a year. The expedition left Melbourne on 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels and 23 horses. They reached Menindee on 16 October 1860 where Landells resigned following an argument with Burke, where Wills was promoted to second-in-command. Burke, along with William Wills, John King and Charley Gray, reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. Upon returning, the expedition was weakened by starvation and exposure, and was hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season. Wills died alone at a place called Breerily Waterhole on Cooper Creek in South Australia while waiting for rescue. Burke died soon after. The exact date of their deaths is unknown, but has generally been accepted to be 28 June 1861.\n\nJohn King was an Irish soldier who achieved fame as an Australian explorer. He was responsible for the welfare of the camels used during the Burke and Wills expedition who reached the Gulf of Carpentaria. King was the sole survivor of the four men of the expedition, and survived with the help of Aborigines until he was found on 15 September by Edwin Welch - the surveyor in Alfred William Howitt's Victorian Contingent Party. King returned to Melbourne and was hailed as a hero. King never fully recovered from the expedition, and died prematurely of pulmonary tuberculosis on 15 January 1872 aged 33.\n\nAidan De Brune was a pseudonym of Herbert Charles Cull, who was born in London in 1874. He married in 1907, but in 1910 he left his wife and infant son Lionel, arriving in Fremantle, Western Australia, in October 1910. He travelled across to Sydney and worked for the Sydney Daily Mail.\n\nAn ebook of Record Diary of a Walk Around Australia is available at Project Gutenberg Australia\n\nThis walk was undertaken to raise funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and partly followed in the steps of the Burke & Wills \"Victorian Exploring Expedition\", camping at some of the Burke & Wills expedition's dig trees. It is the first documented crossing of the Australian continent entirely by foot and first by a woman. A feature-length movie \"Feet Across Australia\" was shown on national television and attracted paying audiences at many venues in Australia. 1973 was a very wet season and mud was a major problem on the Birdsville Track. Food was buried along the route in advance, otherwise all equipment was carried by the 5 team members with a small handcart. A camel from Arkaroola Sanctuary was briefly part of the expedition. There was no support team accompanying the walkers.\n\nDave Kunst is the first person verified to have walked around the Earth. Kunst's trek began 20 June 1970 and ended 5 October 1974 (the dates in the table reflect his arrival and departure from Australia). During their travels, the brothers collected donations to UNICEF. Unfortunately, John (Dave's brother who was also walking with him) was killed when bandits shot him in the mountains of Afghanistan in October 1972. Dave was also shot in the chest during the same attack, but survived by playing dead. After spending 4 months recovering from his injuries, Dave resumed his journey along with his brother Pete, from the spot where John was killed. As they continued their travels, Dave and Pete were denied access to the USSR, so they flew from India to Australia. Pete returned home during the Australia-leg of the trek, where Dave continued on alone, by this time on his 3rd mule. Unfortunately, the mule died and Dave was left hauling his wagon of supplies himself. He was on the verge of abandoning his supplies, when he fortuitously met Jenni Samuel, a schoolteacher from Perth. She helped pull his wagon with her car, while he walked alongside. Dave returned to Australia for a year after completing his journey. Jenni and Dave later married and are still together as of 2008.\n\nDenis Bartell became the first person to walk across the Simpson Desert unassisted in 1984, whilst walking across Australia from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Gulf St Vincent. He followed the 'French Line' - a route taken by the CGG surveyor Roy Elkins 21 years prior who also completed the walk but with the assistance of a support crew. In recognition of his achievement, he was named the Australian Geographic's Adventurer of the Year in 1995.\n\nListed in the Guinness Book of Records as the first person to walk around the world solo, Steve Newman crossed 20 countries and walked some 15,000 miles during his four-year journey. For the Australian leg, Steven flew from Bali and commenced his walk in Darwin on 1 July 1985. He travelled south along \"The Track\" through Alice Springs, Coober Pedy, Adelaide, and on to Melbourne. He concluded in Melbourne on 20 June 1986, before proceeding onto Vancouver for his American leg of the journey.\n\nSteven later published a book documenting his journey in 1989 called 'Worldwalk'. The handmade cart he used to cross the deserts was named 'Roo' and is currently on display at a museum in the USA. His backpack 'Clinger' and the tattered boots he wore across Australia were temporarily displayed in the Smithsonian after his record-setting solo walk around the world was completed. The 1989 Guinness Book of World Records has a large photo of Steve wearing his 'Clinger' and pulling the 'Roo' and in the Australian outback.\n\nRoger Scott departed from Darwin for Dover on 6 August 1988, raising funds for the Top End Life Education Centre and the NT Spastics Association. He walked via Kununurra and Halls Creek, arriving at the Eyre Bird Observatory on the southern coast of South Australia on 22 September 1988 where he encountered Ffyona Campbell on her walk across Australia. He then proceeded on to Adelaide, before catching a flight to Devonport and walking to Dover. He completed the walk in 109 days, and traversed the Great Sandy Desert, Gibson Desert, Great Victoria Desert, and Nullarbor Plain on his journey.\n\nStarting from John O'Groats on the northernmost coast of Scotland in 1983, then 16-year-old Ffyona Campbell set out to walk around the world. She departed from Sydney on 11 September 1988, and arrived in Fremantle on 14 December 1988 - a journey lasting 95 days.

The beliefs of the movement were later codified as the Mundane Manifesto. \n\nRyman has contrasted mundane science fiction with most science fiction through the desire of teenagers to leave their parents' homes. Ryman sees too much of regular science fiction being based on an \"adolescent desire to run away from our world\". However, Ryman notes that humans are not truly considered grown-up until they \"create a new home of their own\", which is what mundane science fiction aims to do.\n\nMundane science fiction focuses on stories set on or near the Earth, with a believable use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written. It rarely involves interstellar travel or communication with alien civilization. The genre's writers believe that warp drives, the use of worm holes, and other forms of faster-than-light travel are scientific fantasies rather than serious speculation about a possible future. According to them, unfounded speculation about interstellar travel can lead to an illusion of a universe abundant with planets as hospitable to life as Earth, which encourages wasteful attitude to the abundance on Earth.\n\nScientists have not uncovered any evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Although absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence, Mundane science fiction writers believe it's unlikely that alien intelligence will overcome the physical constraints on interstellar travel any better than we can. As such, Mundane science fiction writers imagine a future on Earth and within the solar system and believe it's highly unlikely that intelligent life survives elsewhere in this solar system.\n\nAlternative universes, parallel worlds, magic and the supernatural, time travel and teleportation are similarly avoided in mundane science fiction.\n\nIn 2007 the magazine \"Interzone\" devoted an issue to the subgenre.\n\nThe 2009 short story collection \"When It Changed: Science Into Fiction\", edited by Ryman, is a collection of mundane science fiction stories, each written by a science fiction author with advice from a scientist, and with an endnote by that scientist explaining the plausibility of the story.\n\nA review of the 1992 novel \"China Mountain Zhang\" noted that the story's world, while different, felt ordinary and believable.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2387895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2387895", "title": "Music publisher (popular music)", "text": "Music publisher (popular music)\n\nIn the music industry, a music publisher (or publishing company) is responsible for ensuring the songwriters and composers receive payment when their compositions are used commercially. Through an agreement called a publishing contract, a songwriter or composer \"assigns\" the copyright of their composition to a publishing company. In return, the company licenses compositions, helps monitor where compositions are used, collects royalties and distributes them to the composers. They also secure commissions for music and promote existing compositions to recording artists, film and television.\n\nThe copyrights owned and administered by publishing companies are one of the most important forms of intellectual property in the music industry. (The other is the copyright on a master recording which is typically owned by a record company) Publishing companies play a central role in managing this vital asset.\n\nSuccessful songwriters and composers have a relationship with a publishing company defined by a publishing contract. Publishers also sometimes provide substantial advances against future income. In return, the publishing company receives a percentage, which can be as high as 50% and varies for different kinds of royalty.\n\nThere are several types of royalty: mechanical royalties derive from the sale of recorded music, such as CDs or digital downloads. These royalties are paid to publishers by record companies (through the Harry Fox Agency as well as through American Mechanical Rights Agency in the U.S.). Performance royalties are collected by performance rights organizations such as SESAC, BMI, ASCAP or PRS and are paid by radio stations and others who broadcast recorded music; and are paid by venues, event organizers for live performances of the compositions. Synchronization royalties are required when a composition is used in a film or television soundtrack. These royalties typically pass through the hands of a music publisher before they reach the composer.\n\nPublishers also work to link up new songs by songwriters with suitable recording artists to record them and to place writers' songs in other media such as movie soundtracks and commercials. They will typically also handle copyright registration and \"ownership\" matters for the composer. Music print publishers also supervise the issue of songbooks and sheet music by their artists.\n\nTraditionally, music publishing royalties are split seventy/thirty, with thirty percent going to the publisher (as payment for their services) and the rest going to the songwriter – or songwriters, as the case may be. Other arrangements have been made in the past, and continue to be; some better for the writers, some better for the publishers. Occasionally a recording artist will ask for a co-writer's credit on a song (thus sharing in both the artist and publishing royalties) in exchange for selecting it to perform, particularly if the writer is not well known. Sometimes an artist's manager or producer will expect a co-credit or share of the publishing (as with Norman Petty and Phil Spector), and occasionally a publisher will insist on writer's credit (as Morris Levy did with several of his acts); these practices are listed in ascending order of scrupulousness, as regarded by the music industry.\n\nThe most unscrupulous type of music publisher is the songshark, who does little if any real \"legwork\" or promotion on behalf of songwriters. Songsharks make their profit not on royalties from sales, but by charging inexperienced writers for \"services\" (some real, such as demo recording or musical arranging, some fictional, such as \"audition\" or \"review\" fees) a legitimate publisher would provide without cost to the writer, as part of their job. (By comparison, a bona fide publisher who charges admission to a workshop for writers, where songs may be auditioned or reviewed, isn't wrong to do so.)\n\nRock-n-roll pioneer Buddy Holly split with longtime manager Norman Petty over publishing matters in late 1958, as did the Buckinghams with producer James William Guercio almost a decade later. John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival was sued by his former publisher Saul Zaentz (who'd also served as his manager) over a later Fogerty song that sounded slightly like a CCR song Zaentz published. (Fogerty won in court.)\n\nSeveral bands and artists own (or later purchase) their own publishing, and start their own companies, with or without help from an outside agent. The sale or loss of publishing ownership can be devastating to a given artist or writer, financially and emotionally. R&B legend Little Richard was largely cheated on his music publishing and copyrights, as were many performers. Brian Wilson and Mike Love of The Beach Boys were crushed to learn that Murry Wilson (father to three of the Beach Boys, Love's uncle, and the band's music publisher) had sold their company Sea of Tunes to A&M Records during 1969 for a fraction of what it was worth – or earned in the following years.\n\nA large factor in the Beatles' breakup was when their publisher Dick James sold his share of Northern Songs, the company they'd formed with him in 1963 (then taken public in 1967, with shares trading on the London Stock Exchange), to Britain's Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1969. Neither the Beatles nor managers Lee Eastman and Allen Klein were able to prevent ATV from becoming majority stockholders in Northern Songs, whose assets included virtually all the group's song copyrights. Losing control of the company, John Lennon and Paul McCartney elected to sell their share of Northern Songs (and thus their own copyrights), while retaining their writer's royalties. (George Harrison and Ringo Starr retained minority holdings in the company.)\n\n\n"}

He may be a Guru in a Gurukul. \n\nIn Sanskrit, states Monier Williams, Pandit generally refers to any \"wise, educated or learned man\" with specialized knowledge. The term is derived from \"paṇḍ\" (पण्ड्) which means \"to collect, heap, pile up\", and this root is used in the sense of knowledge. The term is found in Vedic and post-Vedic texts, but without any sociological context. In the literature of the colonial era, the term generally refers to Brahmins specialized in Hindu law.\n\nThe related term Purohit refers to a house priest.Pandit mostly taught the kings(Rajput).\n"}
{"id": "28697874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28697874", "title": "Perry Index", "text": "Perry Index\n\nThe Perry Index is a widely used index of \"Aesop's Fables\" or \"Aesopica\", the fables credited to Aesop, the storyteller who lived in ancient Greece between 620 and 560 BC. Modern scholarship takes the view that Aesop probably did not compose all of the fables attributed to him; indeed, a few are known to have first been used before Aesop lived, while the first record we have of many others is from well over a millennium after his time. Traditionally, Aesop's fables were arranged alphabetically, which is not helpful to the reader. B. E. Perry listed them by language (Greek then Latin), chronologically, by source, and then alphabetically; the Spanish scholar Francisco Rodríguez Adrados created a similar system. This system also does not help the casual reader, but is the best for scholarly purposes.\n\nBen Edwin Perry (1892–1968) was a professor of classics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1924 to 1960. He was author of \"Studies in the Text History of the Life and Fables of Aesop\" and many other books. His \"Aesopica\" (\"A Series of Texts Relating to Aesop Or Ascribed to Him Or Closely Connected with the Literal Tradition that Bears His Name\") has become the definitive edition of all fables reputed to be by Aesop, with fables arranged by earliest known source. His index of fables has been used as a reference system by later authors.\n\nPerry 1. Eagle and Fox\n\nPerry 2. Eagle, Jackdaw and Shepherd\n\nPerry 3. Eagle and Beetle\n\nPerry 4.

It is notable for its denunciation of the extermination of people on the basis of race, and followed the commencement of the Nazi \"Final Solution\" program to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The significance of the denunciation is a matter of scholarly debate.\n\nThe 1942 Christmas Address by Pope Pius XII was made shortly after the war had turned decisively against Nazi Germany. Hitler had broken his alliance with Stalin and advanced into the Soviet Union, although his army in Stalingrad had been surrounded, decimated, starved and was about to surrender, precipitating disaster on the Eastern Front. Following decisive victories in North Africa, the Pacific and the air war in Northern Europe, the war had turned in favour of the Allies. From May 1942, the Nazis had commenced their industrialized slaughter of the Jews of Europe - the \"Final Solution\". The brutalization of the Catholic Church in Poland had been underway for three years.\n\nThe Catholic Church had been offering condemnations of Nazi racism since the earliest days of the Nazi movement. The 1942 Christmas address is significant for the light it throws on the ongoing scholarly debate around the war time policies of Pius XII in response to what would later be termed The Holocaust (the systematic murder of Europe's Jews by the Nazis). Pius' cautious approach has been a subject of controversy. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, his \"strongest statement against genocide was regarded as inadequate by the Allies, though in Germany he was regarded as an Allied sympathizer who had violated his own policy of neutrality\". According to concentration camp prisoner, Father Jean Bernard of Luxembourg, treatment of clergy imprisoned in the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp worsened when Pope Pius or the German bishops were critical of Hitler or the Nazis.\n\nTwo Popes served through the Nazi period: Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) and Pope Pius XII (1939-1958). In 1933, Pius signed a Concordat with Germany - hoping to protect the rights of Catholics under the Nazi government. The terms of the Treaty were not kept by Hitler. According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\": \"From 1933 to 1936 [Pius XI] wrote several protests against the Third Reich, and his attitude toward fascist Italy changed dramatically after Nazi racial policies were introduced into Italy in 1938.\" Pius XI delivered three papal encyclicals challenging the new totalitarian creeds from a Catholic perspective: against Italian Fascism Non abbiamo bisogno (1931; \"We Do Not Need to Acquaint You\"); against Nazism Mit brennender Sorge (1937; \"With Deep Anxiety\") and against atheistic Communism Divini redemptoris (1937; \"Divine Redeemer\"). He also challenged the extremist nationalism of the Action Francaise movement and anti-Semitism in the United States.\n\nPius XI's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli (future Pius XII), made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its \"ideology of race\". As Cardinal Pacelli, Pope Pius XII had assisted Pius XI, draft the \"Mit Brennender Sorge\" encyclical, a powerful critique of Nazi ideology. Pius XI also commissioned an encyclical demonstrating the incompatibility of Catholicism and racism: Humani generis unitas (\"The Unity of the Human Race\"). Following his death however, the less confrontational Pius XII did not issue the encyclical, fearing it would antagonize Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany at a time where he hoped to act as an impartial peace broker.\n\nWith Europe on the brink of war, Pius XI died on 10 February 1939 and Cardinal Pacelli was elected to succeed him as Pope Pius XII. As Vatican Secretary of State, Pacelli had been a critic of Nazism and the Nazi Government was the only government not to send a representative to his coronation. Pius, a cautious diplomat, pursued the course of diplomacy to attempt to convince European leaders to avoid war.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of war, Pius followed Vatican precedent and pursued a policy of \"impartiality\". Despite this official policy, Pius passed intelligence to the Allies and made a series of general condemnations of racism and genocide through the course of the war. and chose diplomacy to assist the persecuted during the war For this he was scorned by Hitler as a \"Jew lover\" and a blackmailer on his back, whom he believed constricted his ally Mussolini and leaked confidential German correspondence to the world\n\nLargely posthumously (and controversially), Pius has been criticized for not \"doing enough\" to prevent the Holocaust - and by others of being \"silent\" in the face of it. According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", depictions of the Pope as anti-Semitic or indifferent to the Nazi Holocaust lack \"credible substantiation\". Upon the death of Pius XII in 1958, he was praised by world leaders for his wartime leadership, with the Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir saying: \"When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict. We mourn a great servant of peace.\"\n\nOne scholarly critic of the legacy of Pius XII has been Michael Phayer (author of \"The Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965\" (2000)). He has written that the Catholic Church possessed a specific knowledge of the Holocaust that rivaled that of the Allied governments. The Vatican possessed information on the systematic nature of deportations and atrocities, compiled from its own diplomatic corps in Eastern Europe, from Catholic bishops in Germany, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe, from ordinary Catholics, priests, and laity, from the Polish government-in-exile, the foreign diplomats to the Holy See, and various Jews and Jewish organizations. A variety of historians have comprehensively examined the data received by the Vatican, which \"covered not just the activity of mobile killing squads but every aspect of the Nazis' murdering process\".\n\nHowever, according to Phayer, until 1942, Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione had repeatedly and publicly stated that the Vatican was \"unable to confirm atrocity reports\". Phayer wrote: \"regarding Maglione's oft-repeated rejoinder to the effect that something could not be confirmed, it must be noted that he never took steps to confirm the many reports of atrocities that flowed to his office. Had Pope Pius wished to do so, he could have assembled a comprehensive picture of the genocidal crimes of the Nazis\". Messages to the effect that the pope was losing his \"moral authority\" due to the failure to condemn Nazi atrocities poured in from diplomats accredited to the Vatican from the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, Belgium, and Poland. Moreover, the Allies condemned the genocide of the Jews on 17 December 1942 in the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which—according to Phayer—\"must have sent the Holy See scurrying to play catch-up\". Pius XII refused to endorse the Joint Declaration, as urged by Harold Tittmann, his US ambassador, and indeed, his own speech would be \"not as bluntly stated as the United Nations' declaration earlier that month\".\n\nA defender of Pius, the eminent historian of the Holocaust, Martin Gilbert portrays Vatican policy in the lead up to the 1942 Christmas message with a very different emphasis: \"In his first encyclical as Pope, Pius XII specifically rejected Nazism and expressly mentioned the Jews, noting that in the Catholic Church there is \"neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision.\" The head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Mueller, commented that the encyclical was \"directed exclusively against Germany.\" So outspoken was it that the Royal Air Force and the French air force dropped 88,000 copies of it over Germany. One strong piece of evidence that Dalin produces against the concept of \"Hitler's Pope\" is the audience granted by Pius XII in March 1940 to the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, the only senior Nazi official to visit the Vatican during his papacy. After Ribbentrop rebuked the Pope for \"siding\" with the Allies, the Pope responded by reading from a long list of German atrocities and religious persecution against Christians and Jews, in Germany, and in Poland, which Germany had occupied six months earlier. The New York Times, under the headline \"JEWS' RIGHTS DEFENDED,\" wrote on March 14, 1940: \"The Pontiff, in the burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution, also came to the defense of the Jews in Germany and Poland.\n\nThe 1942 Christmas address was 26 pages and over 5000 words long and took more than 45 minutes to deliver. The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society. According to Rittner and Roth, \"always one to choose words carefully, Pius wrote several drafts before he had crafted exactly what he wanted to say on that particular Christmas Eve\". Phayer wrote that the speech was \"crafted to fit the circumstances as he saw them—that is to say, he addressed principles and omitted particulars\". Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius' death in 2008, the German Pope Benedict XVI recalled that the Pope's voice had been \"broken by emotion\" as he \"deplored the situation\" with a \"clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews.\"\n\nThe Pope addressed the issues of racial persecutions in the following terms:\n\nHumanity owes this vow to those hundreds of thousands who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline [also translated: \"marked down for death or gradual extinction\"]\n\nRittner and Roth described these as the \"pivotal words that remain one of the key flashpoints in the Holocaust-related controversy that continues to swirl around him\" came near the end of the speech. Phayer, Rittner and Roth see it as significant that Pius XII, did not address the perpetrators or victims by name. Nor did he mention Jews or antisemitism.\n\nThe immediate reaction to the speech was generally positive, with the exception of the Nazis and Jewish victims in Poland. Diplomatic criticism of the Vatican's \"moral authority\" essentially ceased for an entire year, until the deportations of the Italian Jews began in 1943. A \"New York Times\" editorial called Pius XII a \"lonely voice crying out of the silence of a continent\". Phayer's survey of global news sources notes that every paper that covered the speech did so in a positive light, although none of them considered it front page news. Tittmann pressured Pius XII in their diplomatic meetings to go further in his public statements, but privately wired the State Department that \"taken as a whole, the message may be regarded as an arraignment of totalitarianism. Furthermore, the reference to the persecution of the Jews and mass deportations is unmistakeable\".\n\nThe speech elicited the strongest reaction in the Dutch Catholic Church. Archbishop of Utrecht, Johannes de Jong saw the address as a signal for Catholics to publicly confront Nazism. A later pastoral letter from the Dutch bishops claimed to be \"following a path indicated by our Holy Father, the Pope\" and quoted the address: \"The Church would be untrue to herself, ceasing to be a mother, if she turned a deaf ear to children's anguished cries\". However, unlike the Christmas address, the Dutch letter went farther and \"named names\".\n\nOthers were more guarded in their reactions. Bishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin agreed that the address referred to Jews, but considered it not specific enough. Catholic Poles believed that the address referred to them alone and wished that the pope had identified the Germans as the perpetrators. The Polish government-in-exile in London remained dissatisfied with the address, wishing for a \"more trenchant papal condemnation\" that named the perpetrators.\n\nThe German government expressed displeasure at the Christmas address and boycotted the pope's Christmas eve liturgy. According to Pinchas Lapide's \"Three Popes and the Jews\", on 27 December 1942 the department Prague of the RSHA reported the following about the Christmas broadcast that \"The Pope has repudiated the National-Socialist New European Order... He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.\" However, Phayer claims he attempted to assuage the German ambassador, Diego von Bergen, by pulling him aside and assuring him that his remarks were intended for the Soviets and Stalin rather than the Germans.\n\nPhayer argues that contemporaries and scholars have viewed the speech differently because \"we know that the pope would not take up the matter again, but contemporaries did not know that this would be the case. In fact, to assert that Pope Pius himself intended this to be his one and only statement is incorrect\".\n\nAccording to Rittner and Roth, the speech remains a \"lightning rod in debates about Pius XII and the Holocaust\", and its interpretation remains \"unsettled and unsettling\".\n\nTo the eminent Holocaust historian, Sir Martin Gilbert, the Reich Security Main Office calling Pius a \"mouthpiece\" of the Jews in response to his Christmas address, is clear evidence that Pius was one who raised his voice for the victims of Nazi terror. This is a view shared by scholars such as David Dalin (author of \"The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews From the Nazis\").\n\nPhayer agrees that the 1942 speech did denounce genocide, but argues that \"it is still not clear \"whose\" genocide or \"which\" genocide he was referring to, and we can do no more than speculate as to \"why\" he spoke out\". Phayer states that \"although the word genocide would not be coined until 1944, Pius XII denounced what we now commonly understand as genocide\". In 2000, Phayer wrote that \"Pope Pius's radio talk contained twenty-seven words about the Holocaust out of twenty-six pages of text\". While Phayer's views of the speech changed between 2000 and 2008 (\"Pius did speak out\"), his dismal assessment of the \"Vatican's essential passivity in collecting and disseminating genocide information\" did not. Phayer states that his change of views came after he was invited by Michael Marrus to participate in a University of Toronto conference about the Holocaust and the Netherlands. Phayer cites the address as evidence of the \"adaptability rather than uniform rigidity at the Vatican in the middle of the Holocaust years. The Holy See was in search of a new path for papal policy\". He argues that historians (himself included) have been \"too dismissive of the 1942 address\" although he agrees that \"Pius never spoke out again\".\n\n\n\n"}

Related activities such as soliciting and brothels are illegal.\n\nThere were an estimated 150,000 prostitutes in Malaysia in 2014 and that the country's sex trade generated US$963 million.\n\nFor 200 years, except in wartime, prostitution was only apparent in small areas of George Town, Ipoh, Johor Bahru, Kuantan and Kuala Lumpur, serving loggers, tin miners and sailors.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Malaya in the Second World War, the Japanese set up a number of brothels for their troops to \"prevent the rape of local women by Japanese soldiers, to limit anti-Japanese resistance in the occupied area, to protect the soldiers from venereal disease and to avoid international disgrace\". Many local women between 17 and 28 were forced to work in the brothels, employed as what were euphemistically termed \"comfort women\".\n\nStarting at the end of the 20th century, prostitution has spread over the rest of Malaysia, particularly in the form of massage parlours.\n\nOriginally the prostitutes were locals, but there has been an influx of foreign sex workers over the last 10 years. Prostitutes from China, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia now outnumber locals.\n\nIn 2012, the Anti-Vice, Gambling and Secret Societies divisions of the police arrested 12,234 prostitutes throughout the country, of which 9,830 were foreign nationals, including 5,165 Chinese, 2,009 Thais and 1,418 Indonesians.\n\nThere are no federal laws against prostitution but there are laws against related activities. Section 372 of the Penal Code criminalises soliciting in any place and living on the earnings of a prostitute. The latter is applied against those who run brothels.\n\nThe Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 adds an offence of exposing another person to the risk of HIV infection.\n\nLocal health regulations prevent health and beauty establishments (which includes massage parlours) from employing sex-workers.\n\nVarious other laws such as those against vagrancy are also used against sex-workers.\n\nThe Sharia Criminal Offences Act, which brings Sharia law into force, is in effect in Kelantan. Sharia law allows fines and public whipping or caning for \"any woman who prostitutes herself\". Buying of sex is also forbidden.

More downmarket is the RLD at Lorong Haji Taib where Indian, Chinese, and local prostitutes operate. Close by is the Chow Kit area where transgender prostitutes ply at night.\n\nJalan Alor, Jalan Hicks, and Jalan Thamibipilly in the Brickfields area are red-light districts. Street walkers operate around Jalan Petaling.\n\nIn the Klang Valley, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thais, and Cambodians work as Guest Relations Officers (GROs) in the karaoke and Japanese bars. After being brought a few drinks they will negotiate a price for sex. Indonesians work as dancers/prostitutes in the Dangdut Pubs. African prostitutes try to pick up customers outside nightclubs in Bukit Bintang, Jalan Sultan Ismail, and Jalan Imbi. There are also a number of escort agencies.\n\nDemand for prostitution has created a problem of people trafficking for the purpose of forced prostitution from China and Vietnam, even as far as Uganda. A 2009 study by a church estimated that there were 30-32,000 victims of trafficking in the Sabah area alone. Victims are detained without access to legal, medical or social services in 'protective shelters'. After 90 days they are usually deported.\n\nChild prostitution and trafficking is also a problem.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Malaysia as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.\n"}

This 19th-century children's group game (requiring 10+ players) is thought to have originated in the United Kingdom and then spread to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\nThe game is played between two lines of players (usually called the \"East\" or \"West\" team, although this does not relate to the actual relative location of the teams), usually positioned approximately thirty feet apart with hands or arms linked together. The game starts when the first team, in this example the \"East\" team, calls a player out, by saying or singing a line like \"Red rover, red rover, send [player on opposite team] right over\", or \"Red rover, red rover, let [player on opposite team] come over\", or even \"Red rover, red rover, I call [player on opposite team] over\".\n\nThe immediate goal for the person called is to run to the other line and break the \"East\" team's chain (formed by the linking of hands). If the player called fails to break the chain, they join the \"East\" team. However, if the player successfully breaks the chain, they may select either of the two \"links\" broken by the successful run, and take them to join the \"West\" team. The \"West\" team then calls out \"Red rover\" for a player on the \"East\" team, and play continues. The game needs five people to play at least, although this would be a very short game.\n\nWhen only one player is left on a team, they also must try and break through a link. If they do not succeed, then the opposing team wins. Otherwise, they are able to get a player back for their team.\n\nIn Russia and other former USSR countries, this game has been known as \"\", in Hungary as \"Adj, király, katonát!\" (Give, King, soldier!) and in Serbia as \"Јелечкиње, барјачкиње\" (\"jelečkinje, barjačkinje\", i.e., city crier and flag bearer). \n\nIn New Zealand and Australia a variation of this game is called \"Bullrush\" which starts with two chasers that tag players running from one end to another adding more players to their team by catching the runners.\nred\nIn Romania, the game is known as \"Țara, țara vrem ostași\" (Country, country we want soldiers).\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the game is known as \"Král vysílá své vojsko\" (The king sends out his army), with the difference that each team chooses which of its members will attempt to break the other team's line, rather than sending the member called by the other team.\n\n"}
{"id": "49222774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49222774", "title": "Sports Phone", "text": "Sports Phone\n\nSports Phone was a telephone service in the United States that allowed users to hear sports scores and information. The service was launched in 1972, and after initially failing it was relaunched three years later. The service gained a following, and by 1981 had hit a peak of 50 million calls in a year. Sports Phone began in New York City, but expanded to offer programming in numerous other locations, including Chicago and Detroit. The rise of sports radio stations and score tickers on television broadcasts helped reduce the popularity of Sports Phone, before an increase in Internet usage led to its demise in 2000.\n\nCallers to Sports Phone heard messages of one minute or less, with up to 30 scores provided in a given update. In addition to scores, the service's programming included news and interviews, along with a sports trivia game. Some information was recorded specifically for certain markets. The announcers for Sports Phone included future broadcasters of several franchises in the major U.S. sports leagues.\n\nSports Phone was first introduced on November 1, 1972, after a month of service testing. The original owner was New York Telephone employee Jack Goodfellow. Customers were charged 10 cents per one-minute phone call, with New York Telephone the recipient of all charges and a fee from Sports Phone for each call. Goodfellow's intention was for the service to make money from advertisements included with the service's updates, but the business model proved unsuccessful. In 1973, Air Time Inc., a media entity, purchased rights to the service. New York Telephone later allowed for information service operators to retain part of the call fees, and Sports Phone was relaunched in 1975.\n\nThe service used multiple telephone numbers, including at least one alternate number, but the most well-known was 976-1313. Future broadcaster John Giannone claimed that, among New York City sports enthusiasts, \"Everyone 45 and over can recite\" the number. By 1976, Sports Phone was receiving an average of 65,000 calls daily. It appealed strongly to sports bettors, as it allowed users to access updates on games from the West Coast of the U.S., which frequently ended after broadcasts of television news programs. The service experienced a record period of activity in 1977, as the New York Mets were completing a trade with the Cincinnati Reds in which Tom Seaver was sent to the Reds. Sports Phone had 600,000 callers over a three-day span.\n\nThe growth in Sports Phone's usage continued in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Daily call figures moved up to around 100,000 in 1979, with peaks of three times that figure on some weekend days when college or pro football games were being held. By 1981, New York Telephone was making $3 million from Sports Phone over a year; 50 million calls were made to Sports Phone that year; the only Dial-it service that received more activity was the one for off-track betting. The service expanded to markets outside New York City as well. In 1977, Sports Phone introduced a line with updates that focused on Chicago; two years later, Detroit received its own line. New Jersey and Buffalo were later added as markets with their own numbers. Daily call numbers in Chicago had hit around 65,000 by 1984, although they reportedly peaked at 175,000.\n\nSports Phone had competition in the field by 1983, as a three-year-old national rival service, Dial-It, was receiving approximately 350,000 calls weekly. By 1985, Sports Phone's business model had changed, as its parent company, Phone Programs, was earning 2 cents per call from New York Telephone and making more than $1 million in revenue; this replaced a previous model in which Sports Phone received payments from AT&T before the breakup of the Bell System. Atlanta, Miami, and New Orleans had updates that were aimed at those markets by 1986.\n\nCalls to Sports Phone numbers cost 50 cents by 1986. The service was facing increasing competition nationally from providers such as JD's National Score Phone, Dial Sports, and a line from \"USA Today\". Sports Phone indicated that it planned to increase call lengths to 90 seconds following the beginning of the football schedule; this matched the time of Dial Sports' calls, which cost customers 10 cents less. A radio station dedicated to sports programming, WFAN, debuted in New York City in 1987. The initial concept for the station included score updates every 15 minutes, which were inspired by Sports Phone. WFAN positioned itself to compete against Sports Phone for the attention of the service's callers. One of the station's first promotional advertisements contained the line \"We just made Sports Phone old news.\" Sports Phone employee Cory Eisner said, \"We knew right away (WFAN) was going to come after us.\" At the same time that sports radio was reducing the service's business, it was affected by an increase in the use of pagers by sports bettors and a rise in number blocks by businesses in the New York City region. Television stations also moved to provide scores to viewers, as both CBS and NBC added periodic score updates to their pro football telecasts.\n\nA Boston-area number was introduced in 1988, to coincide with the Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks heavyweight championship fight. Services were also provided to the Cleveland and Phoenix markets, but proved unsuccessful. By 1990, Sports Phone had received nearly one billion calls over the service's life. By this time, though, cable television sports stations were providing score updates. In future years, the Internet would offer scores and news in real time. Caller activity at Sports Phone fell to 1,000 or less daily. The service's last general manager, radio broadcaster Don La Greca, said of Sports Phone's decline, \"Technology that helped us update then became available to the general public, and so there was no reason to have us.\" The service was shut down in 2000.\n\nIn the earliest incarnation of Sports Phone, each one-minute call allowed the caller to hear 46 seconds of sports scores. The remaining 14 seconds of the call were taken up by two commercials, each of which lasted seven seconds. When the service was reintroduced in 1975, the length of a call fell to between 57 and 58 seconds. The reduction in time allowed customers to hang up within 60 seconds, the length of a message unit as defined by the Federal Communications Commission. Recordings were not extended in cases when the announcers had not finished reciting scores; as many as 30 game scores could be fit into the required time frame. Updated score readings were usually done approximately once every 10 to 15 minutes through the conclusion of a night's sports events. For Sundays in which pro football was being played, the rate was much quicker, with just two minutes between updates. Sports Phone announcers initially received scores through ticker tape, but later placed employees in press boxes at events for quicker reporting times. Reporters who cooperated with Sports Phone by providing updates were paid at a rate of $20 per night; alternatively, staffers at Sports Phone would place calls into press boxes seeking updates. Employees also sought to record interviews with players, which were incorporated in Sports Phone's updates. Some interviews were recorded on-site, while others were done by announcers at the service's headquarters; the latter approach was used in 1976 by Howie Rose, who interviewed hockey player Darryl Sittler after he had posted a 10-point game. \n\nSports Phone had various kinds of filler programming that it aired during days, when there were generally fewer sporting events to report on than nights. In the beginning, updates in the daytime were recorded less frequently than during the night, at 30-minute intervals. Along with updates on baseball games that were in progress, announcers incorporated news and editorial content, in addition to interviews. During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, when Sports Phone was suffering from a lack of content, the service reported the results of a fictional best-of-seven series between the 1961 New York Yankees and 1969 New York Mets, which was simulated with the Strat-O-Matic tabletop game. According to announcer Mike Walczewski, the series led to a 400 percent spike in Sports Phone's call volume. By 1982, daytime updates had been sped up to occur about every 15 minutes. Other information that the service provided included statistics, harness racing results, and listings of pitchers in upcoming baseball games. One other type of programming that gained a following was a sports trivia game known as the \"Quickie Quiz\". An announcer asked a trivia question during an update, and callers contacted a different phone number to answer. Winners were given 15 seconds of air time on a Sports Phone update to discuss a topic of their choice.\n\nSome content was added in certain locations' updates to appeal to the local markets. Different sports were mentioned in updates, along with reports on teams of local interest. This included listings of golf course and tennis court wait times as well. The New York City operations center handled updates for multiple cities in the southern part of the U.S.\n\nAs the popularity of Sports Phone started to decline, a new feature was launched that provided more detailed play-by-play information on games. Customers were charged 99 cents per minute for the calls, which did not have the regular service's time limit. La Greca once provided three consecutive hours of baseball play-by-play to one caller; the announcer stated that the target market for the play-by-play line was \"the degenerate gambler.\" In the final years of Sports Phone's existence, announcers often obtained score information on the Internet before recording updates.\n\nWriter Joe DeLessio described Sports Phone as \"a launching pad for young voices looking to break into broadcasting.\" The employees who announced updates for the service included future television broadcasters of the Mets and New York Yankees baseball clubs, and the New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders of the National Hockey League. La Greca, after beginning his career at Sports Phone, became a radio broadcaster for the New York Rangers and an ESPN Radio host in New York City. Mets announcer Howie Rose, who began working for Sports Phone in 1975, likened his position to \"anchoring the \"CBS Evening News\"\".\n\nA steady stream of announcers at the service's New York City operations came from Fordham University. Future Yankees television announcer Michael Kay and New York Giants radio voice Bob Papa were among the Fordham attendees who later announced for Sports Phone. Some Sports Phone announcers who provided updates to southern locations, including Papa, applied pseudonyms in an effort \"to sound less ethnic.\"\n"}

Their initial function was to dance and entertain the live crowds during commercial breaks.\n\nThe Nitro Girls were formed in 1997 by Kimberly Page at Eric Bischoff's request and made their debut on July 14 in Orlando, Florida. Their main focus was to entertain the live fans during the commercials of \"Monday Nitro\". They also regularly performed in short segments on the show.\n\nDuring the Nitro Girls’ opening dance routine on the October 6, 1997 edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" from the Target Center in Minneapolis, one of Chae’s nipples accidentally popped out of her top. Cameras cut to a wide shot of the dancers.\n\nThe Nitro Girls filmed their own pay-per-view, dubbed \"The Nitro Girls Swimsuit Calendar Special\" which aired on August 3, 1999 and was later released on home video. The pay-per-view is currently one of the few pay-per-view events not made available for streaming on the WWE Network service.\n\nIn late 1999, the group held a competition to find a new member. In November, Stacy Keibler defeated 300 other girls for a spot on the dance troupe and $10,000. Her winning routine was watched by 4.4 million viewers.\n\nThe Nitro Girls also made appearances at WCW promotional events and were featured in the WCW produced film \"Ready to Rumble\". As the group became more and more involved in storylines, it slowly dissolved, but never officially broke up until 2001 when WCW was sold to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation.\n\nIn October, 1999 Kimberly Page began to appear with husband and wrestler Diamond Dallas Page. At Halloween Havoc, 1999 she claimed Ric Flair spanked her 14 times after she was going to drug his son David Flair in a hotel room. Diamond Dallas Page wrestled Ric Flair in a strap match. On the November 1, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro Kimberly quit the group as a result of her husband being injured by David Flair, she then ran him over with her car. \n\nAfter Kimberly left, the Nitro Girls began to feud with each other, Spice feuded with A.C. Jazz over the new leadership position and won. After Jazz left the group, Tygress attempted to gain control. \n\nBy early 2000 the Nitro Girls broke up and began to go their own way within WCW. Kimberly Page joined The New Blood. Sharmell Sullivan became Paisley, a valet for The Artist, and later went to the WWE. Stacy Keibler, the final member to join the group, began appearing as Miss Hancock the manager for the tag team Standards and Practices before going to the WWE.\n\nSeveral former Nitro Girls formed a pop music group called Diversity 5: Teri Byrne (Fyre), Melissa Bellin (Spice), Sharmell Sullivan (Storm), Chae An (Chae) and Vanessa Sanchez (Tygress). When Sharmell went to the WWF for the first time, Chiquita Anderson (Chiquita) replaced her. The D5 group released one cd single (I Promise/Shake Me Up) in 2001, but by the following year the group bottomed out when they appeared on the FOX reality show \"30 Seconds to Fame\" on October 31, 2002 and were promptly voted off.\n\n\n"}

Written by Lee Erwin, and featuring a guest cast that included Dennis Hopper, Don Marshall, Woody Strode and the acting debut of Nichelle Nichols. The series followed the lives of the United States Marine Corps stationed at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. In this episode, after a racially driven altercation between Cpl. Peter Devlin (Dennis Hopper) and Pvt. Ernest Cameron (Don Marshall), Lt. William Rice (Gary Lockwood) attempts to settle their issues by first arranging a boxing match, and then forcing them to work together on a march. Following protests by the Pentagon, who had previously aided the production of the series, the network refused to air the episode.\n\n\"The Lieutenant\" was developed in conjunction with the Pentagon; but following a series of plot points featuring in the series that concerned officials there, relations were strained. They were concerned with the plot of \"To Set It Right\", and warned the producers that the airing of the episode that this could result in the production no longer being able to use the equipment and extras provided by the marines for free. In response, Roddenberry informed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who attempted to pressure the network to air the episode. The assistance of the Pentagon was withdrawn, and the series was officially cancelled a week later.\n\nDonald Bogle wrote of the episode in his 2001 book \"Primetime Blues: African Americans on Network Television\", saying that the episode \"lost its nerve and ultimately undermined the feelings - the very strong, modern Black perspective - of its character Cameron\". This resulted in the character appearing to be \"one more angry young negro with unjustified racial hostility\". However, Bogle praised the interactions between Rice and Norma and said that this was a better articulation of the problems faced by Cameron than those explained by the actual character. Bogle felt that although \"To Set It Right\" sought to address racial issues, it wanted to avoid upsetting its main viewers.\n\nA videotape of the episode is in the collection of the Paley Center for Media in New York, contributed to the center by Gene Roddenberry.\n"}

Assigned to the case are Detectives Lisa Ryder and Harry Shine, who are under pressure to apprehend the culprit as soon as possible in order to appease the ruthless Mayor Angela Harris. As the duo's investigation progresses, they uncover a number of different suspects, including a misogynist fellow officer named Willy Scalia, a cross-dressing mayor's aide named Devon McClain, a charitable preacher named Reverend Dimsdale, and a professional photographer named Michael Walker.\n\nLisa begins dating Michael in secret, which leads to her suspension from the force when mounting circumstantial evidence points towards him being \"Zipperface\". After a warrant is put out for Michael's arrest, he and Lisa go to confront Reverend Dimsdale, having realized that he is in some way connected to all of Zipperface's victims, possibly acting as a pimp for the sex workers who he was supposed to be helping find God. The two discover the reverend dead from a slit throat, and question one of his prostitutes, who informs them that Dimsdale had earlier called her, begging her not to go to her appointment with a new \"John\".\n\nLisa and Michael follow the directions that the prostitute had been given to an abandoned warehouse that contains Zipperface's sex dungeon, unaware that they are being tailed by Detective Shine. Zipperface wounds Michael and attempts to strangle Lisa, but she is saved when Michael recovers and stabs Zipperface with his own machete, incapacitating him long enough for Shine to arrive with both backup and Mayor Harris. Zipperface is unmasked to reveal that he is the mayor's husband, Brewster. After her husband rants about how feelings of emasculation drove him to dominate and eventually murder prostitutes, the distraught Mayor Harris, realizing that her political career is now over, pulls out a gun and shoots Brewster.\n\n\n\"Zipperface\" was heavily criticized by \"TV Guide\", which condemned it as a cross between \"female exploitation and feminist-bashing\" that was \"low-grade in all departments, not just gender politics\". The film was similarly derided by Todd Martin of Horror News, who wrote, \"Not only is it unoriginal and poorly-written, it also has some of the worst acting I have seen in a very long time and is just a mighty bad movie in general in every conceivable way.\"\n"}
