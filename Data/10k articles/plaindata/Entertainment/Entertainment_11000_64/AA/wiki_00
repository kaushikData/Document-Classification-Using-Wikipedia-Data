{"id": "10195130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10195130", "title": "Archaic (comics)", "text": "Archaic (comics)\n\nArchaic is an American comic book series created by writer James S. Abrams and artist Brett Marting. The series is published through Fenickx Productions LLC and saw its debut at the 2005 Comic-Con International in San Diego. The comic itself is an epic fantasy adventure containing many references (both in mythology and language) to Slovakian lore. Many of the characters names as well as certain phrases are taken from Slavic languages as well.\nSince its creation Archaic has gained a rather large amount of attention in the American comics community. The series has earned several award nominations, such as Golden Chazzie nominations for \"Best Ongoing Series\" and \"Best Artist\" for 2006. \"Wizard Comics Magazine\" rated it number 4 in its 2007 top 40 indie comics.\n\nPremiering at Comic-Con International 2005, Archaic immediately released with 5 issues in an early small press production run that saw different covers from the later Diamond releases. Archaic began distribution through Diamond in January 2006. It originally released 6 issues in a bi-monthly format that have since been collected in 2 separate Trade paperbacks, \"Rule of the Deviant\" and \"Winter Children\". After a several month hiatus however, the series has continued forward starting in July 2006. Now Archaic has begun a monthly release schedule from issue 7 onward.\n\nArchaic is an ongoing fictional story dealing with a fantasy realm and several of its both heroic and villainous inhabitants. The Antagonist, Král Groznyj rules over a vast region of land, fearing no one but those foretold in an ancient prophecy to be his own downfall. The prophecy claims that children of his own nephews would one day rise up and destroy him. From there the story covers several generations of people living in Tzenebraum, otherwise known as \"The Thrice-Nine Lands\".\n\nThe story begins with the šarkan general, Petr Drakanov besieged in his family's castle. Nestled safely behind the walls of the Drakánc Hrad, Petr sees his time coming to an end. Petr's uncle, the šarkan king Král Groznyj has sent forces to capture and kill him and his family. Well Petr holds out for sometime, eventually the betrayal of his own soldiers draws him into battle. A young and ambitious knight by the name of Valen makes a deal with Groznyj. The aid of Valens allows Groznyj to convince Sir Marcus, Petr's head knight, that Petr is a murderer. Shocked and disgusted by this false information, Sir Marcus leads an attack on Petr's castle. Petr is slain on the bridge of his fortress, his last words asking the very knight who killed him to protect his new born son. \nWhen King Groznyj eventually arrives for Petr family, Sir Marcus is the one to drag Petr's wife, Cassandra, and son, Košice, across the bridge of Drakánc Hrad. However, Sir Marcus soon realizes his mistake and is killed by Valen. Valen is able to take Cassandra to Groznyj, but Košice is spirited away by the magic of the last loyal knights under Petr's command.\nMeanwhile, Groznyj's armies lay waste to the cities of Faeries in a mass genocide. The Lunatai, a werewolf like species of faerie, lead the attacks on their biological cousins. During these attacks, the Lunatai are made an offer, all the northern lands in trade for hunting down two children, the descendents of the Drakanovy. The Teardrop Knights, also looking for the descendents of the Drakanovy, dispatch several groups to track down Košice and return him to safety. An older knight by the name of Velshin is the one to finally retrieve Košice, however he loses the rest of his team. Velshin then chooses to take the Drakanov child north, into hiding, until aid from the Order of Teardrop can be sent. Through all of this we also find out that Mikal Drakanov, Petr's brother, is currently imprisoned in the dungeons of Král Groznyj.\n\nYears have passed since the death of Petr Drakanov and his son, Košice, now hides in the north under the watchful eye of Velshin. Velshin has told the now teenaged boy very little of his past and renamed him Kalias to hide his identity. However, with years having passed and Košice have disappeared without a trace, Groznyj fears for his future. In response Groznyj sends one of his best men, Genosik the Kinslayer, to track down and kill Košice. Genosik, along with his group of assassins, track down Košice to the village široke. At the same time, Grimm, an ex-teardrop knight under the command of Sir Marcus, leads a group of mercenaries to široke. Grimm was mortally wounded on the bridge of Drakánc Hrad the day Košice disappeared. He had since vowed to undo his misdeeds against his lord by finding and protecting the young Košice.\nAll parties arrive at a bar in široke within minutes of each other, leading to a large confrontation. The end result leaves many dead, Košice blinded and confused, and Genosik fleeing back to Groznyj. Lying dead in the snow, the aged knight, Velshin tells Grimm to bring Košice to Teardrop. \nDuring this time we are also introduced to Solare, an elf faerie, and his group of Lunatai hunting friends. Solare and his men are on a quest of vengeance to kill all the Lunatai for their horrid acts on faerie kind.\nKošice, Grimm, and the only survivor of Grimm's mercenary group eventually reach the floating city of teardrop. As they question how to gain access to the city, the workings of war stir in Groznyj's kingdom. Groznyj has asked the Lord Sialenec ze Tak Tak to lead an army against the knights of Teardrop. As Tak Tak raises his men, a female assassin he is quite fond of returns to his life. The assassin, Allysyn, is tasked with capture the other Drakonov child, Mikal's daughter, Erzebet\n\nThe Hollow tells the tale of Solare's group of warriors as well as that of Allysyn and her lover, Lane. Lane, an ex-teardrop knight, is introduced fighting a group of sickmen, zombie like undead creatures. We come to realize that Lane and Allysyn's mission is to track down Erzebet Drakanov, daughter of Mikal Drakanov. Erzebet was long ago kidnapped and held captive by pack of lunatai. As fate would have it, Solare comes across the same pack of lunatai that hold the Drakanov girl. Fearing Erzebet is soon to be lunatai food, one of Solare's group dashes into combat to save the girl. Solare reluctantly follows, slaughtering many lunatai. Unfortunately Lane soon enters the fray, choosing to also kill Solare and his ally, Jun. Lane leaves Solare for dead, having found Erzebet. \nLater that evening Jeeves, another victim of Lane's sword and butler to Erzebet Drakanov, comes across the badly damaged Solare. Solare rises from his seemingly dead state, healing with the speed expected of a faerie. Solare vows revenge on Lane for killing Jun. With the aid of Jeeves, Solare begins a hunt for Lane and Allysyn. During this journey, we learn of the language of the spiders and that Erzebet and Jeeves are both familiar with it. Erzebet leaves a trail of information through spider webs across the country side, allowing Jeeves to track her. Eventually the two warriors have their final clash outside a Brillianti church. Solare manages to kill both Allysyn and Lane, once more with the aid of Jeeves. Solare takes leave to continue his quest well Jeeves once more returns to the service of Miss Erzebet. After Solare has left, Erzebet uses a dark and hidden power of hers, reviving Allysyn and Lane as some form of undead servants.\nIn Groznyj's dungeon we find the king talking with his imprisoned nephew, Mikal. There he tells Mikal of Erzebet's secret power, a power which Mikal cannot believe.\nAs this story arc progresses, we are also introduced to The Brillianti's task force, The Chorus. The Chorus is to help Lord Tak Tak as an additional force in the war against the knights of Teardrop.\n\nAfter a few calm months living in teardrop, the council has gathered to discuss the fate of young Košice. At the same time, Lord Tak Tak's forces invade the floating city of teardrop, allied with The Chorus.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5287708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5287708", "title": "Backstage (magazine)", "text": "Backstage (magazine)\n\nBackstage (aka Back Stage) is an entertainment-industry brand aimed at people working in film and the performing arts, with a special focus on casting, job opportunities, and career advice.\n\n\"Backstage\" publishes a print-edition magazine in the U.S. (\"Backstage, \"also available as a digital-edition PDF publication) and a periodic digest-sized resource directory (\"Call Sheet\") that cover the entertainment industry from the perspective of performers (singers, dancers, comedians, models, etc.), the performance unions (SAG-AFTRA, Actors' Equity Association, AGVA, AGMA, the American Federation of Musicians, etc.), casting directors, agents, writers, filmmakers, and, in particular, actors.\n\n\"Backstage\" also publishes related newsletters, along with running multiple websites, including Backstage.com, The Backstage Message Boards, and Audition Update.\n\nBackstage (the company) was founded by Allen Zwerdling and Ira Eaker in New York City in December 1960 as a weekly tabloid-sized newspaper called \"Back Stage\" (later renamed \"Backstage\"). Zwerdling and Eaker had worked together for years as editor and advertising director, respectively, of the \"Show Business\" casting newspaper, which was founded by Leo Shull as \"Actor's Cues\" in 1941. After Zwerdling and Eaker left \"Show Business\" they looked into creating a casting section within \"The Village Voice\" newspaper; but, having been turned down, they decided to launch \"Backstage\" on their own.\n\nAt the time of its founding, \"Backstage\" (the newsmagazine) was primarily a casting paper for New York actors intended to compete with \"Show Business Weekly\". It gradually broadened its scope to include coverage of New York's television commercial production industry and a variety of performing arts, the former of which proved to be so lucrative advertising-wise that the commercial-production beat came to dominate the publication. Additionally, \"Backstage's \"reach began to slowly spread across the U.S., although the largest portion of its readership remained on the East Coast.\n\nOwing to the disparity between its main areas of coverage—a focus on casting and entertainment-industry job opportunities, general coverage of the performing arts (acting, legitimate theatre, cabaret, etc.), and its expanding coverage of the commercial production market—\"Backstage\" eventually incorporated the film and video production elements of its coverage into a weekly pull-out section called \"Backstage Shoot,\" a sort of mini-publication with a special focus on the commercials industry.\n\nThen, in 1975, \"Backstage\" opened a Los Angeles bureau and began to more actively extend its casting and editorial coverage across the U.S., with correspondents based in Boston, Florida, Chicago, London, and other key entertainment-industry-centric areas added to the Backstage roster over the years.\n\nAround 1977, co-founder Ira Eaker's daughter, Sherry Eaker, joined \"Backstage\" as an editor and worked to further expand \"Backstage\"s editorial coverage, especially in the areas of theater criticism, cabaret, dance, union news, and advice columns for performers. Sherry Eaker also fostered a relationship between \"Backstage\" and its historical antecedent, the British-based newspaper \"The Stage\", which shared a similar look, printing schedule, and market-focus.\n\nIn 1986, \"Backstage\" was bought by Billboard Publications Inc. (BPI), owner of such publications as \"Billboard (magazine)\". In 1988, BPI bought \"The Hollywood Reporter\". Backstage and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" along with a few other related brands, were grouped together within BPI, becoming its film and performing arts division, a group designed to compete with \"Variety (magazine)\" and other entertainment-industry trade publications. Backstage would become involved in a number of other acquisitions, mergers, spin-offs, and sales over the next few decades.\n\nOn July 6, 1990, the \"Backstage Shoot \"pull-out section of \"Backstage \"magazine\" \"was spun off into a full, standalone publication, \"SHOOT\". The concept was to have \"Backstage\" concentrate on actors, performing artists, and theatre, while \"SHOOT\" would continue to \"serve the news and information needs of creative and production decision-makers at ad agencies, and executives & artisans in the production industry\" (according to their official press materials found on ShootOnline.com). To emphasize the change, the official \"Backstage\" tagline \"The complete service weekly for the communications and entertainment industry\" was switched to \"The Performing Arts Weekly\".\n\nAround this time, \"Backstage\" acquired the New York-based \"Ross Reports\" publication, a monthly digest founded in 1949 by Wallace A. Ross. \"The Ross Reports\" compiled information on casting directors, agents, managers, production companies, and upcoming film and television productions.\n\nIn early 1994, Netherlands-based company VNU bought \"Backstage\" owner BPI. VNU eventually came to own a variety of trade publications — including all of the BPI magazines as well as \"Mediaweek,\" \"Adweek, Film Journal International\", \"The Hollywood Creative Directory\", and many others — along with measurement company Nielsen Media Research, and events such as ShoWest and the Clio Awards.\n\nAlso in early 1994, \"Backstage\" Publisher Steve Elish hired a West Coast editor-in-chief, Rob Kendt, to help create a new publication, \"Back Stage West\", a weekly trade paper similar to the New York-based \"Backstage\" but with a special focus on the West Coast acting community and casting opportunities based in California. At the time, despite past efforts, \"Backstage\" was still popular primarily in the Northeast U.S.\n\nThen, in 1997, Backstage.com was founded, which combined content from \"Backstage,\" \"Back Stage West\", and \"Ross Reports\" with selected news articles from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and \"Billboard\" and original online-only content intended to reach a larger, international audience.\n\nAnd in May 1998, \"Backstage\" under Publisher Steve Elish bought its chief LA competitor, \"Drama-Logue\".\n\nThe Drama-Logue company was founded by Bill Bordy in 1969 as a casting hotline, and in 1972 it became a weekly trade publication entitled \"The Hollywood Drama-Logue Casting Sheet\", commonly known simply as \"Drama-Logue\". Before the end of 1998, Drama-Logue's holdings were fully integrated into Backstage.com and \"Back Stage West\"\",\" which for a time became known as \"Back Stage West/Drama-Logue.\" However, the Drama-Logue brand name was slowly phased out.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, a number of casting (performing arts) information and entertainment job websites began cropping up, offering specialized online tools for actors, performers, and models, including online casting submission systems and video-enhanced resumes. Backstage.com, introduced by Publisher Steve Elish, was a leader in taking the casting industry online. Its early products included a paid member's area, which charged $9.95 per month for unlimited access to articles and casting calls across New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Florida, Las Vegas, and other key entertainment-industry hubs. The monthly fee also entitled subscribers to inclusion in the website's first iteration of a headshot and resume database.\n\nStarting in 2000, writer-editor-filmmaker and web-developer Luke Crowe joined the company, and began working on the development of online casting tools for Backstage. He later edited this page to include his own name. Over the next few years, Backstage.com introduced options for casting directors to self-post breakdowns, a searchable acting-jobs database of casting notices, interactive audition lists, casting coverage in every state in the U.S., and an advanced headshot and resume talent database, among other new options, some of the first online tools ever developed for actors and casting directors. The number of new casting notices listed on Backstage.com each week expanded from the hundreds to the thousands over the next few years, while monthly site traffic increased from the hundreds-of-thousands to the millions.\n\nIn addition to encompassing all of the content from Backstages print publications, the website's scope continued to expand to include more online-exclusive casting notices and original online-only news stories, feature articles, entertainment-industry listings, and reviews. During this time period, several competitors challenged the brand, but it remained the industry leader. However, the competition eventually sparked major changes in Backstages development, and in October 2005 Backstage relaunched its print and online publications in order to regain its edge.\n\nDuring this 2005 relaunch process, all Backstage publications were redesigned (including \"Backstage West\"); various staffing changes took place; the East Coast/New York edition of \"Backstage\" was renamed \"Backstage East\"; Backstage.com began publishing more articles on a daily basis and introduced more exclusive editorial content, blogs, feeds, and tools; and Casting. Backstage.com was founded, giving Backstage.com users access to even more advanced casting/job search, sort, alert, and application tools, along with a more robust talent database featuring resumes, pictures, video reels, and audio reels of thousands of working and aspiring actors and performers.\n\nAround this same time, the primary \"Backstage\" tagline changed from \"The Performing Arts Weekly\" to \"The Actor's Resource.\" A secondary branding slogan, \"Casting You Can Trust — Since 1960\" was also added and given prominent placement both on Backstage.com and on the front covers of the weekly East Coast and West Coast newspaper/magazine versions of Backstage. And sister publication \"SHOOT\" (and ShootOnline.com) was sold to another publishing company.\n\nIn 2006, a company called Valcon Acquisition B.V., run by a private equity group consortium, bought VNU, making Valcon the new owner of Backstage and all other VNU holdings. Then, on January 18, 2007, VNU rebranded itself The Nielsen Company, with its trade-publication division being renamed Nielsen Business Media.\n\nIn early 2007, VP/Group Publisher Steve Elish retired from \"Backstage\" after 34 years. However, co-founder Ira Eaker's daughter, former longtime Backstage editor-in-chief Sherry Eaker, carried on her father's work as Backstage's editor at large, along with editor-at-large David Sheward, who left his executive editor position at Backstage after working for the brand for over 28 years. Former publishers include Steve Elish, Jeff Black, and Charlie Weiss. Former lead editors include Sherry Eaker, Rob Kendt, Jamie Painter Young, Daniel Holloway, Dany Margolies, Tom Penketh, Erik Haagensen, Roger Armbrust, Leonard Jacobs, David Fairhurst, Andrew Salomon, Dan Lehman, dance editor Jennie Schulman (who wrote for Backstage for over 40 continuous years, starting with its first issue on Dec. 2, 1960), film and television editor Jenelle Riley, contributing editor Jackie Apodaca, and actor-columnist Michael Kostroff (known for his work in \"The Wire\"), among others.\n\nIn October 2008, \"Backstage East\" and \"Backstage West\" were permanently combined into a single weekly publication with an expanded national focus. This new \"national edition\" was given the same name as the original 1960 edition: \"Back Stage\".\n\n\"Backstage\" also launched a number of blogs around this time, including Blog Stage, Espresso, Backstage Unscripted, and The Backstage 411 Casting FAQ, all of which were discontinued in early 2012.\n\nIn early 2009, \"Ross Reports\" was renamed \"Call Sheet by Backstage\", working with \"The Hollywood Creative Directory\" to expand its listings to include a wider variety of entertainment-industry contacts.\n\nIn late 2009, \"Backstage\" and other Nielsen Business Media brands were sold to e5 Global Media, which was later renamed Prometheus Global Media, and then renamed Guggenheim Digital Media.\n\nThe \"Backstage\" brand remained closely tied to its primary sister publications, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and \"Billboard\", as well as the other e5 Global Media publications, such as \"Adweek\", \"Film Journal International\", and \"The Hollywood Creative Directory\". However, \"Backstage\" also carved out its own industry niche by focusing on the needs of actors, models, performers, and casting directors; publishing directories (such as \"Call Sheet\", a bimonthly listing of talent agents, casting directors, and film productions), books (actor handbooks and biographies published under the Watson-Guptill imprint Backstage Books), casting-director mailing labels, and special \"insert\" magazines (such as award-season nomination guides, theatre-school guides, and the \"ACTION\" magazine for actors interested in making their own movies); producing live events; and continuing the development of Internet casting technology.\n\n\"Backstage\" continued to be a resource for audition information, casting calls/casting notices, training opportunities, and entertainment-industry jobs, news, and interviews. Film and theatre were the main topics reviewed and reported upon, but the television, radio, dance, music, cabaret, voice-over, modeling, commercial advertising, and stand-up comedy industries were also included in \"Backstage\"s coverage.\n\nIn October 2011, media entrepreneur John Amato led Backstage through a spin-off from Prometheus Global Media as part of a new strategic partnership, with the new company being called Backstage, LLC. Prometheus shareholder Guggenheim Partners backed the sale.\n\nIn August 2012, \"Backstage\" was relaunched again, changing its name from \"Back Stage\" (two words) to \"Backstage\" (one word), updating its logo and branding, completely rebuilding its website, and changing its print edition from a weekly tabloid-sized newspaper to a weekly full-color glossy magazine. In January 2013, Backstage LLC acquired Sonicbids, a service designed to help musicians find gigs, for $15 million\n\nIn April 2013, Prometheus Global Media, now fully owned by Guggenheim, bought the remainder of Backstage LLC. John Amato was made president of the Billboard Group, a new unit that would oversee \"Backstage\", \"Billboard\", and Sonicbids.\n\nIn December 2013, Backstage and Sonicbids were acquired by RZ Capital.\n\nIn December 2016, Backstage expanded its online casting tools and editorial coverage to include a wider international scope, with an initial focus on casting in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn October 2017, Backstage launched its first fully integrated mobile casting app.\n\nAs of 2017, principals at \"Backstage\" included vice president and national casting editor Luke Crowe. Current \"Backstage\" writers and editors include managing casting editor Melinda Loewenstein and supervising casting editor Veronika Daddona, among many others.\n\nBackstage’s casting department reviews and publishes more than 30,000 casting notices on Backstage.com every year, for projects that range from major studio and network productions and Broadway shows to indie and student films. By monitoring the notices, Backstage is able to quickly work to protect actors from scams, while facilitating the distribution of hundreds of thousands of performance opportunities via a suite of online casting tools.\n\n\"Backstage Magazine\" features a different actor on its cover every week with original photography, along with entertainment-industry news and advice columns. Previous cover subjects have included Academy Award winners Kevin Spacey, Benicio Del Toro, Jennifer Lawrence, Lupita Nyong’o, and Eddie Redmayne. Backstage.com also features a series of advice columns written by industry insiders called Backstage Experts, offering aspiring and working actors the know-how to find work and improve their craft. There are also features on different acting schools, coaches, and theater companies around the country.\n\nFrom 1992-2012, \"Backstage\" produced annual Actorfest trade shows, entertainment-industry networking events held in various cities. Past Actorfest events took place in New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Detroit. Other \"Backstage\" events in the past included the annual Backstage Garland Awards (previously known as the Drama-Logue Award) honoring the California theatre scene; the annual Bistro Awards honoring the cabaret industry, especially NYC-based cabaret; and the bi-coastal \"An Evening With ...\" series that combined film screenings with Q&A sessions featuring key actors and directors from each film being shown.\n\nAdditionally, \"Backstage\" hosted classes, workshops, and networking events through its Backstage University brand, and sponsors numerous events and panels for talent working in the fields of film, television, commercials, radio/voice-overs, theatre, dance, modeling, and club talent (comedians, singers, etc.). Its \"Successful Actor\" panel series was done in partnership with the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n\n"}
{"id": "914313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=914313", "title": "Bleacher", "text": "Bleacher\n\nBleachers, or stands, are raised, tiered rows of benches found at sports fields and other spectator events. Stairways provide access to the horizontal rows of seats, often with every other step gaining access to a row of benches.\n\nBenches range from simple planks to elaborate ones with backrests. Many bleachers are open to the ground below so that there are only the planks to sit and walk on. Some bleachers have vertical panels beneath the benches, either partially or completely blocking the way to the ground.\n\nThe open seating area in baseball was called the \"bleaching boards\" as early as 1877. The term \"bleachers\" used in the sense of benches for spectators can be traced back to at least 1889; named as such because the generally uncovered wooden boards were \"bleached by the sun\".\n\n\"The Dickson Baseball Dictionary\" lists as a \"secondary\" definition the fans sitting in them. By the early 1900s, the term \"bleachers\" was being used for both the seating area and its occupants.\n\nIn modern usage, the term \"bleachers\" almost always refers only to the seating area, and those sitting there may be called \"bleacher fans,\" or \"bleacherites.\" Terms such as Chicago's \"bleacher bums,\" or Yankee Stadium's Bleacher Creatures are also used.\n\nBleacher structures vary depending on the location, but most outdoor modern bleachers have either an aluminium tube or steel angle understructure (known as frame-type bleachers) or steel I-beams (known as an I-beam bleacher). Most smaller bleachers are frame-type bleachers and most larger bleachers are I-Beam bleachers. Bleachers range in size from small, modular, aluminum stands that can be moved around soccer or hockey fields to large permanent structures that flank each side of an American football field. Some bleachers have locker rooms underneath them. In indoor gyms, bleachers can be built in so that they slide on a track or on wheels and fold in an accordion-like, stacking manner. These type of bleachers are known as telescoping bleachers.\n\nIn baseball stadiums, the bleachers are usually located beyond the outfield fences. However, center-field bleachers are located in the line of sight of the batter, and the presence of fans makes it difficult for the batter to pick out the ball. As a result, most stadiums have vacant areas or black backgrounds where the seats would be. This is known as either the \"Backdrop\" or the Batter's eye. The old Yankee Stadium featured black-painted vacant bleachers, nicknamed \"the black\" by baseball fans.\n\nThough many stadiums offer only bleacher seating, in those that offer both seats and bleachers, the bleachers are typically in less desirable locations and/or have lower ticket prices, giving the term \"bleachers\" a connotation of lower-class seating.\n\nThe popularity of American football has made seating on outdoor and indoor football fields a necessity. Professional football, colleges, high schools, and even middle schools have bleacher systems set up to accommodate their fans. They vary in size from 10 feet wide that seat 25 all the way to full stadiums that seat thousands and wrap around the entire field. It is not uncommon to see football bleachers that rise hundreds of feet into the air. American Football bleachers are commonly made from concrete or aluminum with concrete footings or superstructure underneath.\n\n"}

Following on from Brooker's \"Screenwipe\" and \"Newswipe\", \"Gameswipe\" featured reviews of various video games and consoles as well as an insight into the video game industry.\n\nThe one-off special was very similar to its predecessors, in that Brooker, along with a camera and various games consoles, reviewed and previewed video games in the same style as \"Screenwipe\". Brooker claimed that it would attempt to prove that video games can be just as engaging as television and just as dumb. He said to \"Expect pixels, joypads, some of the world's weirdest games, celebrity cameos and the occasional sound effect.”\n\nIn the show, Brooker reviews \"Wolfenstein\", \"\" and \"\". The show also contains contributions from Dara Ó Briain, Robert Florence, Ryan Macleod, Larry Bundy Jr, Rebecca Mayes and Graham Linehan.\n\nThe debut airing of Gameswipe drew 361,000 viewers, outdoing the typical performances of both Screenwipe and Newswipe. UK video games trade magazine MCV said of the show: \"It’s fair to say that the reaction from the industry to last night’s TV debut of Charlie Brooker’s Gameswipe was mixed. But if its intention was to offer an informed, reasoned and mature take on the games industry of both past and present, then it’s hard to regard the show as anything other than an overwhelming success.\"\n\nIn October 2009, Brooker told MCV Magazine that he would consider working on either a further episode of \"Gameswipe\" or, potentially, a brand new series, though he added that he himself may choose not to present the show.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "179375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179375", "title": "Comedian", "text": "Comedian\n\nA comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh. This might take many forms including jokes, satirical observations, amusing situations, acting foolish (as in slapstick) or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian. Other practises include the sitcom, sketch comedy and improv.\n\nA popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to Ed Wynn, is, \"A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny\", which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.\n\nA lot of creative and original comedy is based on surrealism and absurdity. Early pioneers in these comedic forms include Spike Milligan and Monty Python. Current examples include Vic and Bob, Noel Fielding and Sam Simmons. Elements of surreal and absurd comedy include the non-sequitur (where language or events do not follow a logical process/sequence), irony (where a message is conveyed in a way contrary to its content) and deadpan performance (in the face of surreal and absurd situations, furthering the absurdity).\n\nSince the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called alternative comedy, has grown in popularity with more offbeat and experimental style. Alternative comedy was initially inspired by punk culture and rejected old comedy forms, the establishment and bigoted humour. Ben Elton, Rik Mayall, Malcolm Hardee and Alexi Sayle were among the most well-known 1980's alternative comedians. Alternative comedy experienced a revival since around 2010, with Stewart Lee promoting the liberal, progressive values of the movement and many younger comedians in the UK banding together in groups dedicated to alternative comedy including The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society and the Weirdos Collective.\n\nMany comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, the Edinburgh Fringe, and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais. However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.\n\nComedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when Aristophanes, a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of satyr plays.\n\nThe English poet and playwright William Shakespeare wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and Stan Laurel were protégés of Fred Karno, the English theatre impresario of British music hall, and in his biography Laurel stated, \"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\". Chaplin wrote comedic silent films such as \"Modern Times\" and \"The Kid\". His films still have a major impact on comedy in films today.\n\nOne of the most popular forms of modern-day comedy is stand-up comedy. Stand-up comedy is a comic monologue performed by one or more people standing on a stage. Bob Hope was the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, and also starred in numerous comedy films over a five-decade span. Other noted stand-up comedians include Billy Connolly, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Jerry Seinfeld, Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, Louis CK and Chris Rock.\n\nRadio has been a proving-ground for many comedians. Ricky Gervais career began at a London radio station called XFM and Chris Morris (satirist) began his career at Radio Cambridgeshire. The League of Gentlemen, Mitchell and Webb and The Mighty Boosh all transferred to television after broadcasting on BBC Radio 4. Between 2002 and 2011 BBC Radio 6 Music used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including Phil Jupitus, Stephen Merchant and Adam & Joe. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 4 Extra. Before television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy, The Goon Show and Hancock's Half Hour being among the most popular early shows.\n\nOn television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, Graham Norton, Daniel Tosh, Chris Hardwick, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, and Chelsea Handler. There are sketch comedies, such as [[Kids In The Hall and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show \"[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]\" (a [[BBC]] show that influenced \"[[Saturday Night Live]]\"), then there are sitcoms, for example [[Friends]], [[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]] and [[Father Ted]], as well as popular panel shows like [[QI]], [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]] and [[8 out of 10 Cats]].\n\nComedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Scott Aukerman]]. Comedians streaming video of their standup include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicise their work and build an audience through social media, especially [[Twitter]].\n\nThere are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. [[The Two Ronnies]] often used puns and double-entendre. [[Bec Hill]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US). [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique. Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation (eg. [[Peter Kay]]), whimsy (eg. [[Bill Bailey]]), self-deprecation (eg. [[Daniel Kitson]]) and parody (eg. [[Jennifer Saunders]]).\n\nIn a January 2014 study, conducted in the \"[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]\", scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored \"significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs.\" Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, \"the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis—both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\" However, labeling comedians' personality traits as \"psychotic\" does not mean that individual is a psychopath, since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.\n\n[[File:Kevin_Hart_2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Hart]]]]\n[[File:Jerry Seinfeld knocks on the Oval Office window.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerry Seinfeld]] (left)]]\n\"[[Forbes]]\" publishes an annual list of the most financially successful comedians in the world, similarly to their [[Forbes Celebrity 100|Celebrity 100 list]]. Their data sources include [[Nielsen Media Research]], [[Pollstar]], [[Box Office Mojo]] and [[IMDb]]. The list was topped by [[Jerry Seinfeld]] from 2006 until 2015, who lost the title to [[Kevin Hart]] in 2016. In that year, the eight highest paid comedians were from the United States, including [[Amy Schumer]], who became the first woman to be listed in the top ten. The top ten of 2016 are as follows:\n\n[[Category:Comedy]]\n[[Category:Comedians| ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment occupations]]"}

Both names are of the same company and same production.\n\n\"El Sonido de mi Tierra\" was founded in 1996 with the \"peña folklóica artística\", organized by Luis Pereyra in \"La Galería de Tango\". He promoted an event in Buenos Aires, with the idea to bring together artists of both cultures of Argentina, which has been separated always: those of Argentine Folklore and those of Tango Argentino, and in this way he created a unification of one complete culture of Argentina, which represents all provinces of Argentina, which are 23, bringing them to a culture and art unification.\n\nThe creator of the company is Luis Pereyra. In 2001 Nicole Nau entered the company. 2003 she becomes first dancer of the company and also gets in the general and executive production. Nicole Nau and Luis Pereyra are members of CID Unesco.\n\n1998 the company \"El Sonido de mi Tierra\" performs in theatre, the Teatro Avenida, Buenos Aires and presents \"Tango La Danza de fuego\", a production which tells the story of \"Orillas Maldonadas\", written by Luis Pereyra, based on \"El hombre de la ezquina rosada\" of Jorge Luis Borges. In 2003 the company travels to Europe, later to Japan and Centeramerica.\n\nIn 2012 appears for the first time the name \"The Great Dance of Argentina\". This name the company since then is using for international workm keeping the original name \"El Sonido de mi Tierra\" as always besides.\n\nCondition and habilities to get artist of this company is foundet knowledge of popular dances and music of Argentina, Tango Argentino, percussion, tap dance, vocal and playing instruments.\n\nLuis Pereyra and this company work with Tango and Folklore on a same level, as one only culture which belongs together. He follows strictly his principles to understand Tango Argentino as part of the whole Argentine Culture and Folklore. Being from Buenos Aires, the ango Argentino is the urban folklore. Roots of Folklore, Black Music, natives, migration inside the country and from abroad are showing up, in the relationship between Tango and Folklore. The instruments Luis Pereyra is using are the authentic ones of his country and those introduced by immigrants.

EGBA promotes the implementation of a regulated and competitive market for online gambling operators throughout Europe in line with EU law. The association was created in 2007 and represents 7 member companies and three trade associations. Its headquarters are located in Brussels.\n\nEGBA was created in February 2007 and was formerly known as the European Betting Association. Maarten Haijer serves as the association’s Secretary-General since April 2013.\n\nEGBA is composed of seven leading online betting companies: \nThree national associations are affiliate members of EGBA:\n\nEGBA promotes the creation of a safe and reliable European digital environment for online gambling players. A well-functioning digital environment requires regulation that provides a high level of consumer protection and takes into account the reality of the digital economy and consumer demand. It must also ensure that the regulated offer can be attractive enough to appeal to the maximum number of players so as to channel them away from unregulated offers.\n\nEach year, EGBA organises a high level conference “Responsible Gaming Day”. The latest edition took place in the Solvay Library in Brussels. The conferences have become an annual meeting on European gambling policy gathering representatives from European institutions, national regulators and other stakeholders of the gambling sector. The event, which has been running since 2008, provides an opportunity for a fact-based discussion of best practices for responsible gaming and betting in the EU.\n\nAll EGBA members are also members of the European Sports Security Association (ESSA) whose objective is to promote sport integrity and combat match-fixing. Thanks to an early warning system, ESSA members are able to identify unusual betting patterns in sport competitions and to immediately inform the competent sports authorities.\n\nIn 2010, EGBA entered into a partnership with the European Elite Athletes Association (EU Athletes) to fund a campaign to educate players on match fixing: the Protect Integrity project. The co-funded European Commission project, which is supported by the European Elite Athletes Association, EGBA and the European Sports Security Association (ESSA) began in 2010 and has been prolonged following considerable success. In October 2015, the Protect Integrity project received €488,305 in funding from the European Commission, ensuring that it continues for another 2 years, kicking off in January 2016 until the end of 2017. The project teaches 15.000 professional athletes about sports betting integrity.\n\nPrior to the Winter Olympics in 2014, EGBA, ESSA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed on a new information reporting arrangement regarding suspicious betting activities. The agreement, which runs until the summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, aims to safeguard major sport competitions from manipulation linked to betting.\n\nAll EGBA operators adhere to the Workshop Agreement on “Responsible Remote Gambling Measures” published by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). In absence of pan-European regulations on gambling, the workshop agreement provides for evidence based self-regulatory control measures which aim to create a safe and secure environment for customers throughout the EU.\n\nEGBA publishes a quarterly newsletter discussing current issues of the gambling sector at EU level. The issue of April 2014 featured a contribution from European Commissioner Michel Barnier in which he outlines the achievements and opportunities of and related to the online gambling sector.\n\nOnline gambling is a rapidly growing sector within the European Union. Revenues in Europe are expected to reach €13 billion in 2015, up from €9,3 billion in 2009. The online gambling segment is projected to represent 15% of the total European gambling market in 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "4220231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4220231", "title": "Evolutionary musicology", "text": "Evolutionary musicology\n\nEvolutionary musicology is a subfield of biomusicology that grounds the psychological mechanisms of music perception and production in evolutionary theory. It covers vocal communication in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing.\n\nThe origins of the field can be traced back to Charles Darwin who wrote in his Descent of Man:\n\nThis theory of a musical protolanguage has been revived and re-discovered repeatedly, often without attribution to Darwin.\n\nTwo major topics for any subfield of evolutionary psychology are the adaptive function (if any) and phylogenetic history of the mechanism or behavior of interest including when music arose in human ancestry and from what ancestral traits it developed. Current debate addresses each of these.\n\nOne part of the adaptive function question is whether music constitutes an evolutionary adaptation or exaptation (i.e. by-product of evolution). Steven Pinker, in his book \"How the Mind Works\", for example, argues that music is merely \"auditory cheesecake\"—it was evolutionarily adaptive to have a preference for fat and sugar but cheesecake did not play a role in that selection process. This view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers.\n\nAdaptation, on the other hand, is highlighted in hypotheses such as the one by Edward Hagen and Gregory Bryant which posits that human music evolved from animal territorial signals, eventually becoming a method of signaling a group's social cohesion to other groups for the purposes of making beneficial multi-group alliances.\n\nThe evolutionary switch to bipedalism may have influenced the origins of music. The background is that noise of locomotion and ventilation may mask critical auditory information. Human locomotion is likely to produce more predictable sounds than those of non-human primates. Predictable locomotion sounds may have improved our capacity of entrainment to external rhythms and to feel the beat in music. A sense of rhythm could aid the brain in distinguishing among sounds arising from discrete sources and also help individuals to synchronize their movements with one another. Synchronization of group movement may improve perception by providing periods of relative silence and by facilitating auditory processing. The adaptive value of such skills to early human ancestors may have been keener detection of prey or stalkers and enhanced communication. Thus, bipedal walking may have influenced the development of entrainment in humans and thereby the evolution of rhythmic abilities. Primitive hominids lived and moved around in small groups. The noise generated by the locomotion of two or more individuals can result in a complicated mix of footsteps, breathing, movements against vegetation, echoes, etc. The ability to perceive differences in pitch, rhythm, and harmonies, i.e. “musicality,” could help the brain to distinguish among sounds arising from discrete sources, and also help the individual to synchronize movements with the group. Endurance and an interest in listening might, for the same reasons, have been associated with survival advantages eventually resulting in adaptive selection for rhythmic and musical abilities and reinforcement of such abilities. Listening to music seems to stimulate release of dopamine. Rhythmic group locomotion combined with attentive listening in nature may have resulted in reinforcement through dopamine release. A primarily survival-based behavior may eventually have attained similarities to dance and music, due to such reinforcement mechanisms . Since music may facilitate social cohesion, improve group effort, reduce conflict, facilitate perceptual and motor skill development, and improve trans-generational communication, music-like behavior may at some stage have become incorporated into human culture.\n\nAnother proposed adaptive function is creating intra-group bonding. In this aspect it has been seen as complementary to language by creating strong positive emotions while not having a specific message people may disagree on. Music's ability to cause entrainment (synchronization of behavior of different organisms by a regular beat) has also been pointed out. A different explanation is that signaling fitness and creativity by the producer or performer in order to attract mates. Still another is that music may have developed from human mother-infant auditory interactions (motherese) since humans have a very long period of infant and child development, infants can perceive musical features, and some infant-mother auditory interaction have resemblances to music.\n\nPart of the problem in the debate is that music, like any complex cognitive function, is not a holistic entity but rather modular—perception and production of rhythm, melodies, harmony and other musical parameters may thus involve multiple cognitive functions with possibly quite distinct evolutionary histories.\n\n\"Musilanguage\" is a term coined by Steven Brown to describe his hypothesis of the ancestral human traits that evolved into language and musical abilities. It is both a model of musical and linguistic evolution and a term coined to describe a certain stage in that evolution. Brown argues that both music and human language have origins in a \"musilanguage\" stage of evolution and that the structural features shared by music and language are not the results of mere chance parallelism, nor are they a function of one system emerging from the other. This model argues that \"music emphasizes sound as emotive meaning and language emphasizes sound as referential meaning.\" The musilanguage model is a structural model of music evolution, meaning that it views music's acoustic properties as effects of homologous precursor functions. This can be contrasted with functional models of music evolution, which view music's innate physical properties to be determined by its adaptive roles.\n\nThe musilanguage evolutionary stage is argued to exhibit three properties found in both music and language: lexical tone, combinatorial phrase formation, and expressive phrasing mechanisms. Many of these ideas have their roots in existing phonological theory in linguistics, but Brown argues that phonological theory has largely neglected the strong mechanistic parallels between melody, phrasing, and rhythm in speech and music. \n\nJoseph Jordania has suggested that music (as well as several other universal elements of contemporary human culture, including dance and body painting) was part of a predator control system used by early hominids. He suggested that rhythmic loud singing and drumming, together with the threatening rhythmic body movements and body painting, was the core element of the ancient \"Audio-Visual Intimidating Display\" (AVID). AVID was also a key factor in putting the hominid group into a specific altered state of consciousness which he calls \"battle trance\" where they would not feel fear and pain, and would be religiously dedicated to group interests. Jordania suggested that listening and dancing to the sounds of loud rhythmic rock music, used in many contemporary combat units before the combat missions is directly related to this. Apart from the defense from predators, Jordania suggested that this system was the core strategy to obtain food via confrontational, or aggressive scavenging.\n\nApart from loud rhythmic singing-stomping-dancing, Jordania also suggested that soft humming could have played an important role in the early human (hominid) evolution as contact calls. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard and indistinctive sounds (like chicken cluck) when they are going about their everyday business (foraging, feeding). These sounds have two functions: (1) to let group members know that they are among kin and there is no danger, and (2) in case of the appearance of any signs of danger (suspicious sounds, movements in a forest), the animal that notices danger first, stops moving, stops producing sounds, remains silent and looks in the direction of the danger sign. Other animals quickly follow suit and very soon all the group is silent and is scanning the environment for the possible danger. Charles Darwin was the first to notice this phenomenon on the example of the wild horses and the cattle. Jordania suggested that for humans, as for many social animals, silence can be a sign of danger, and that's why gentle humming and musical sounds relax humans (see the use of gentle music in music therapy, lullabies)\n\n"}

It consists of a website, a syndicated radio show, and a weekly TV show that offers exposure to songs and artists with the vision of providing \"context, perspective, recommendation and discovery of music that’s new (or new to you).\" ExploreMusic achieves this through artist interviews, exclusive performances, music news, album reviews, and lists of recommended songs that are presented on a daily and weekly basis. \n\nThe program was first broadcast on 6 October 2008, and is heard on radio stations across Canada. It has a weekly audience of approximately one million. The program is also syndicated in the United States. A television adaptation of the program currently airs on Aux.\n\nPrior to the launch of ExploreMusic, there had been a number of discussions within Corus about the need to update the concept of the radio DJ as the trusted filter for new music. With online being the first choice of more and more people looking for new music, the decision was made to create a service where \"real people, real passionate music fans, could recommend music to other real passionate music fans, without any sort of mechanical or electronic filters.\" The concept was inspired by the success of Pandora and Last.fm. However, while Pandora and Last.fm work on complex algorithms, ExploreMusic was designed as a place where music fans could turn to discover new music and information about the artists involved, as well as be encouraged to make recommendations themselves with the goal of creating conversation and community. On 1 July 2008, Alan Cross, the host of \"The Ongoing History of New Music\" and former Program Director of Toronto radio station 102.1 The Edge, took the position of senior program director at Corus Interactive and Integrated Solutions (then known as Splice). Planning and development continued through the summer. \n\nThe program was first broadcast on 6 October 2008 on 102.1 The Edge in Toronto, Y108 in Hamilton, FM96 in London, Power 97 in Winnipeg, and The Fox in Vancouver. The show has since been included on Live 88.5 in Ottawa, Rock 101.9 in Cornwall, X92.9 in Calgary, SONiC 102.9 in Edmonton, and The Wolf 101.5 in Peterborough, Ontario, with plans to branch out to more affiliates in the future. The program began syndication in the United States after ExploreMusic partnered with Friday Morning Quarterback. It currently airs on two US radio stations, 103.3 The Edge in Buffalo, and X103 in Indianapolis. An estimated one million people listen to the program each week in Canada.\n\nFive thirty-minute radio shows are produced and distributed each week. Meetings to determine the program content are held once a week. Each person attending the meeting brings a list of five songs, two that have been newly released and three that are a year or more older. They discuss the tracks and decide which ones to use on the broadcast, and which to add to the website. Cross noted that \"we're appreciative of everybody's diverse tastes. The whole idea is to introduce people to music that is new and new to them.\" The programs are written and hosted by Alan Cross, and are recorded in Toronto, Ontario. The four pillars driving the show are context, perspective, recommendation, and discovery. Every song and story featured on ExploreMusic is created in accordance with those four pillars.\n\nThe typical show content includes the \"Big new song of the day\", \"The Music News Countdown\", which contains the program’s top five music stories of the day, the music recommendation \"The Five Songs You Gotta Hear Today\", and an abbreviated interview with a musical artist, which frequently includes an exclusive performance of a song.\n\nIn January 2009, ExploreMusic TV debuted on BiteTV, a Canadian digital tier channel aimed at males 18-34. Hosted by Cross, the programme is a weekly roundtable discussion on music issues with guests from various parts of the music industry. It currently airs on Aux, produced in cooperation with Corus Entertainment Inc. and GlassBOX Television Inc. The show is currently in its second season on the channel.\n\nThe topics and categories on the ExploreMusic radio show are also included on the website, often enhanced by links, images, additional text, audio, and video. The site is presented in blog format, with posts tagged as \"News\", \"Reviews\", \"New Releases\", \"WTF\", and other categories. ExploreMusic TV is seen through the website, as are audio and video podcasts of the previous shows. Every song featured on the website is linked to a sample of the track. The radio program is condensed into a daily podcast; music from the program is not included due to copyright restrictions, but the full interview with the musical artist is included. Web content is available on the BlackBerry and Windows Mobile through an application developed by Viigo Inc. This application allows users to access the ExploreMusic website and Alan Cross's Twitter posts.

{"id": "616886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=616886", "title": "Flicker (screen)", "text": "Flicker (screen)\n\nFlicker is a visible change in brightness between cycles displayed on video displays. It applies especially to the refresh interval on Cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer monitors, as well as Plasma based computer screens and televisions. \n\nFlicker occurs on CRTs when they are driven at a low refresh rate, allowing the brightness to drop for time intervals sufficiently long to be noticed by a human eye – see persistence of vision and flicker fusion threshold. For most devices, the screen's phosphors quickly lose their excitation between sweeps of the electron gun, and the afterglow is unable to fill such gaps – see phosphor persistence. A refresh rate of 60 Hz on most screens will produce a visible \"flickering\" effect. Most people find that refresh rates of 70–90 Hz and above enable flicker-free viewing on CRTs. Use of refresh rates above 120 Hz is uncommon, as they provide little noticeable flicker reduction and limit available resolution.\n\nFlatscreen Plasma displays have a similar effect. The plasma pixels fade in brightness between refreshes.\n\nIn LCD screens, the LCD itself does not flicker, it preserves its opacity unchanged until updated for the next frame. However, in order to prevent accumulated damage LCD displays quickly alternate the voltage between positive and negative for each pixel, which is called 'polarity inversion'. Ideally, this wouldn't be noticeable because every pixel has the same brightness whether a positive or a negative voltage is applied. In practice, there is a small difference, which means that every pixel flickers at about 30 Hz. Screens that use opposite polarity per-line or per-pixel can reduce this effect compared to when the entire screen is at the same polarity, sometimes the type of screen is detectable by using patterns designed to maximize the effect.\n\nMuch more of a concern is the LCD backlight. Earlier screens used fluorescent lamps which flickered at 100 or 120 Hz; most modern screens use an electronic ballast that flickers at 25–60 kHz which is far outside the human perceptible range. LED backlights should not flicker at all, though some designs may \"dim\" themselves by switching on and off rapidly and noticeably.\n\nFlicker is necessary for a movie projector to block the light as the film is moved from one frame to the next. The standard framerate of 24 fps produces very obvious flicker, so even very early movie projectors added additional vanes to the rotating shutter to block light even when the film was not moving. Most common is 3 vanes raising the rate to 72 Hz. Home movie projectors (and early theater projectors) often have four vanes, to raise the 18 fps used by silent film to 72 Hz. Digital projectors typically use DLP mirrors which do not have flicker. Some 3D projection rapidly alternates between the picture for each eye (alternating the polarization at the same rate) at 144 Hz. Movie projectors typically use an incandescent lamp or arc lamp which does not itself flicker.\n\nTelevisions use interlaced video so the screen flickers at twice the rate (50 or 60 Hz) that the image changes (25 or 30 Hz). This was considered necessary even in the very first televisions which used very slow phosphors.\n\nThe exact refresh rate necessary to prevent the perception of flicker varies greatly based on the viewing environment. In a completely dark room, a sufficiently dim display can run as low as 30 Hz without visible flicker. At normal room and TV brightness this same display rate would produce flicker so severe as to be unwatchable.\n\nThe human eye is most sensitive to flicker at the edges of the human field of view (peripheral vision) and least sensitive at the center of gaze (the area being focused on). As a result, the greater the portion of our field of view that is occupied by a display, the greater is the need for high refresh rates. This is why computer monitor CRTs usually run at 70 to 90 Hz, while TVs, which are viewed from further away, are seen as acceptable at 60 or 50 Hz (see Analog television Standards).\n\nChewing something crunchy such as tortilla chips or granola can induce flicker perception due to the vibrations from chewing synchronizing with the flicker rate of the display.\n\nSoftware can cause flicker effects by directly displaying an unintended intermediate image for a short time. For example drawing a page of text by blanking the area to white first in the frame buffer, then drawing 'on top' of it, makes it possible for the blank region to appear momentarily onscreen. Usually this is much faster and easier to program than to directly set each pixel to its final value.\n\nWhen it is not feasible to set each pixel only once, double buffering can be used. This creates an off-screen drawing surface, drawing to it (with as much flicker as you want), and then copying it all at once to the screen. The result is the visible pixels only change once. While this technique cuts down on software flicker, it can also be very inefficient.\n\nFlicker is used intentionally by developers on low-end systems to create the illusion of more objects or colors/shades than are actually possible on the system, or as a speedy way of simulating transparency. While typically thought of as a mark of older systems like 16-bit game consoles, the flicker technique continues to be used on new systems, such as the temporal dithering used to fake true color on most new LCD monitors.\n\nVideo hardware outside the monitor can also cause flicker through many different timing and resolution-related artifacts such as screen tearing, z-fighting and aliasing.\n\nFlicker of a CRT monitor can cause various symptoms in those sensitive to it such as headaches in migraine sufferers and seizures in epileptics.\n\nAs the flicker is most clearly seen at the edge of our vision there is no obvious risk in using a CRT, but prolonged use can cause a sort of retinal shock where the flickering is seen even when looking away from the monitor. This can create a sort of motion sickness, a discrepancy between the movement detected by the fluid in the inner ear and the motion we can see. Symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, headaches and (sometimes extreme) nausea. The symptoms usually disappear in less than a week without CRT use, and usually only last a few hours unless the exposure has been over a long period.\n\n"}

{"id": "1123339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123339", "title": "Freestyle wrestling", "text": "Freestyle wrestling\n\nFreestyle wrestling is a style of amateur wrestling that is practiced throughout the world. Along with Greco-Roman, it is one of the two styles of wrestling contested in the Olympic games. American high school and college wrestling is conducted under different rules and is termed scholastic and collegiate wrestling.\nFreestyle wrestling, like collegiate wrestling, has its greatest origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling and, in both styles, the ultimate goal is to throw and pin the opponent to the mat, which results in an immediate win. Freestyle and collegiate wrestling, unlike Greco-Roman, allow the use of the wrestler's or his opponent's legs in offense and defense. Freestyle wrestling brings together traditional wrestling, judo, and sambo techniques.\n\nAccording to wrestling's world governing body, United World Wrestling (UWW), freestyle wrestling is one of the four main forms of amateur competitive wrestling that are practiced internationally today. The other main forms of wrestling are Greco-Roman and grappling (also called submission wrestling). The Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended dropping wrestling as a sport from the 2020 Olympic Games, but the decision was later reversed by the IOC.\n\nModern freestyle wrestling, according to UWW (formerly FILA), is said to have originated in Great Britain and the United States by the name of \"catch-as-catch-can\" wrestling. \"Catch-as-catch-can\" wrestling had a particular following in Great Britain and the variant developed in Lancashire had a particular effect on freestyle wrestling. \"Catch-as-catch-can\" wrestling gained great popularity in fairs and festivals during the 19th century. In catch-as-catch-can wrestling, both contestants started out standing and then a wrestler sought to hold his opponent's shoulder to the ground (known as a fall). If no fall was scored, both wrestlers continued grappling on the ground, and almost all holds and techniques were allowable. A Scottish variant of Lancashire wrestling also became popular which began with both wrestlers standing chest to chest, grasping each other with locked arms around the body and, if no fall was made, with the match continuing on the ground. In addition, there was the Irish collar-and-elbow style, where wrestlers started out on their feet with both wrestlers grasping each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. If neither wrestler then achieved a fall, the contestants would continue both standing and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish immigrants later brought this style of wrestling to the United States, where it soon became widespread, especially because of the success of the wrestling champion of the Army of the Potomac, George William Flagg from Vermont. Catch-as-catch can was the style performed by at least a half dozen U.S. presidents, including George Washington, Zachary Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nBecause of the widespread interest in and esteem of professional Greco-Roman wrestling and its popularity in many international meets in nineteenth century Europe, freestyle wrestling (and wrestling as an amateur sport in general) had a tough time gaining ground on the continent. The 1896 Olympic Games had only one wrestling bout, a heavyweight Greco-Roman match. Freestyle wrestling first emerged as an Olympic sport in the Saint Louis Olympics of 1904. All 40 wrestlers who participated in the 1904 Olympics were American. The 1904 Olympics sanctioned the rules commonly used for catch-as-catch can, but imposed some restrictions on dangerous holds. Wrestling by seven weight classes—47.6 kg (104.9 lb), 52.2 kg (115.1 lb), 56.7 kg (125.0 lb), 61.2 kg (134.9 lb), 65.3 kg (143.9 lb), 71.7 kg (156.7 lb), and greater than —was an important innovation in the Summer Olympics.\n\nSince 1921, the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA), which has its headquarters near Lausanne, Switzerland, has set the \"Rules of the Game\", with regulations for scoring and procedures that govern tournaments such as the World Games and the competition at the Summer Olympics. These were later adopted by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) for its freestyle matches. Freestyle wrestling gained great popularity in the United States after the Civil War. By the 1880s, tournaments drew hundreds of wrestlers. The rise of cities, increased industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the affable environment for amateur wrestling, along with boxing, to increase in esteem and popularity. Amateur wrestling teams soon emerged, such as the wrestling team of the New York Athletic Club, which had its first tournament in 1878. Professional wrestling also developed, and by the 1870s, professional championship matches offered allowances of up to $1,000.\n\nNineteenth century wrestling matches were particularly long, and especially Greco-Roman bouts (where holds below the waist and the use of the legs are not allowed) could last as many as eight to nine hours, and even then, it was only decided by a draw. In the 20th century, time limits were set for matches. For more than forty years into the twentieth century, freestyle and its American counterpart, collegiate wrestling, not have a scoring system that decided matches in the absence of a fall. The introduction of a point system by Oklahoma State University wrestling coach Art Griffith that gained acceptance in 1941 influenced the international styles as well. By the 1960s international wrestling matches in Greco-Roman and freestyle were scored by a panel of three judges in secret, who made the final decision by raising colored paddles at the match's end. Dr. Albert de Ferrari from San Francisco who became vice president of FILA, lobbied for a visible scoring system and a rule for \"controlled fall\", which would recognize a fall only when the offensive wrestler had done something to cause it. These were soon adopted internationally in Greco-Roman and freestyle. By 1996, before a major overhaul of FILA rules, an international freestyle match consisted of two three-minute periods, with a one-minute rest between periods. Today, wrestlers from Post-Soviet states, Iran, U.S., Bulgaria, Cuba, Turkey, and Japan, have had the strongest showings. Alexander Medved of Belarus won 10 world championships and three Olympic gold medals, in the period of 1964-1972. Many collegiate wrestlers have moved on to freestyle competition, particularly internationally with great success.\n\nIn the spring of 2013, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted wrestling out of the core sports for the summer Olympics beginning in 2020 As a result of this news the wrestling community started a massive campaign in order to reinstate the sport. A largely online group called 2020 vision lead the movement. They had several campaigns as well as Facebook and Twitter pages that spread awareness and gathered support for the cause of wrestling's return to the Olympics. They had a mission of gaining 2,000,020 signatures (online and offline) in support of wrestling's return to the Olympic Games. In September 2013 the IOC voted to allow wrestling back into the Olympics for 2020 and 2024 as a probationary sport. In order to achieve this FILA, the international governing body of wrestling made several changes to the rules as well as changes to the weight classes. There are also discussions about uniform changes as well as changes to the competition mat.\n\nCurrently, international men's freestyle wrestling is divided into six main age categories: schoolboys, cadets, novice, juvenile, juniors, and seniors. Schoolboys (young men ages 14–15; or age 13 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Cadets (young men ages 16–17; or age 15 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Juniors (young men ages 18 to 20; or age 17 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in eight weight classes ranging from . Seniors (men ages 20 and up) wrestle in seven weight classes ranging from . For men, there is also a special category for some freestyle competitions, \"Veterans\", for men ages 35 and older, presumably featuring the same weight classes as seniors. Also, all of the men's age categories and weight classes can be applied to Greco-Roman wrestling.\n\nWomen currently compete in freestyle wrestling in one of four age categories on an international level: schoolgirls, cadets, juniors, and seniors. Schoolgirls (young women ages 14–15; or age 13 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Cadets (young women ages 16–17; or age 15 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Juniors (young women ages 18 to 20; or age 17 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in eight weight classes ranging from . Seniors (women ages 20 and up) wrestle in seven weight classes ranging from . Wrestlers after weigh-in may only wrestle in their own weight class. Wrestlers in the senior age category may wrestle up a weight class except for the heavyweight division (which starts at a weight more than for the men and more than for the women). Different nations may have different weight classes and different age categories for their levels of freestyle competition.\n\nA typical international wrestling tournament takes place by direct elimination with an ideal number of wrestlers (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.) in each weight class and age category competing for placement. The competition in each weight class takes place in one day. The day before the wrestling in a scheduled weight class and age category takes place, all the applicable wrestlers are examined by a physician and weighed-in. Each wrestler after being weighed on the scale then draws a token randomly that gives a certain number.\n\nIf an ideal number is not reached to begin elimination rounds, a qualification round will take place to eliminate the excess number of wrestlers. For example, 22 wrestlers may weigh-in over the ideal number of 16 wrestlers. The six wrestlers who drew the highest numbers after 16 and the six wrestlers who drew the six numbers immediately before 17 would then wrestle in six matches in the qualification round. The winners of those matches would then go on to the elimination round.\n\nIn the elimination round or \"blood round\", the ideal number of wrestlers then pair off and compete in matches until two victors emerge who will compete in the finals for first and second place. All of the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists then have the chance to wrestle in a repechage round. The repechage round begins with the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists at the lowest level of competition in the elimination round. The matches are paired off by the wrestlers who lost to one finalist and the wrestlers who lost to the other. The two wrestlers who win after every level of competition are the victors of the repechage round.\n\nIn the finals, the two victors of the elimination round compete for first and second place.\n\nIn all rounds of the tournament, the wrestlers compete in matches paired off in the order of the numbers they drew after the weigh-in.\n\nAfter the finals match, the awards ceremony will take place. The first place and second place wrestlers will receive a gold and silver medal, respectively. (At the FILA World Championships, the first place wrestler will receive the World Championship Belt.) The two repechage round winners will each be awarded third place with a bronze medal. The two wrestlers who lost in the finals for the third place are awarded fifth place. From seventh place down, the wrestlers are ranked according to the classification points earned for their victories or losses. If there is a tie among wrestlers for classification points, the ranking is determined in this order from the highest to the lowest:\nWrestlers who remained tied after that will be awarded placements \"ex aequo.\" Wrestlers classified from the fifth to the 10th place will receive a special diploma. The wrestling tournaments in the Olympic Games and the Senior and Junior World Championships are designed to take place over three days on three mats.\n\nThe match takes place on a thick rubber mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a border of the same thickness known as the protection area. Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter (3 ft 3 in) in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the red zone. The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the passivity zone. Inside the red zone is the central wrestling area which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the central surface of wrestling is the central circle, which is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters (4 in) wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters (3  in) in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers' colors, red and blue.\n\nFor competition in the Olympic Games, the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters (6 ft 6 in), the sides of the podium are covered with 45° (degree) inclined panels. In all cases, the color of the protection area is different from the color of the mat.\n\n\nA match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. In freestyle wrestling, a jury (or team) of three officials (referees) is used. The referee controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The judge sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The mat chairman sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman).\n\nIn Greco-Roman and freestyle, the format is two three-minute sessions. Before each match, each wrestler's name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls both of them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the session.\n\nA wrestler wins the match when he has outscored his opponent at the end of the two three-minute sessions. For example, if one competitor were to score four points in the first session and his opponent two, and then two in the second session, his opponent zero, the competitor would win. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in session termination.\n\nIn freestyle, if no wrestler scores in two minutes, the referee of the match will then identify the more passive wrestler, and that wrestler will be given a thirty-second window of opportunity to score, and if he doesn't, then his opponent will be awarded a point.\n\nWhen the session (or match) has concluded, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials' table. Both wrestlers then approach each other, shake hands, and stand on either side of the referee to await the decision. The referee then proclaims the winner by raising the winner's hand. At the end of the match, each wrestler then shakes hands with the referee and returns to shake hands with his opponent's coach.\n\nIn freestyle wrestling, as well as in Greco-Roman wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of explosive action and risk. For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:\n\n\nClassification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained. For example, a victory by fall would give the winner five classification points and the loser no points, while a match won by technical superiority with the loser scoring technical points would award three points to the winner and one point to loser.\n\nThe full determinations for scoring are found https://unitedworldwrestling.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/wrestling_rules.pdf in the \"UWW International Wrestling Rules\"].\n\nA match can be won in the following ways:\n\nIn an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60 kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team's score is tallied, and the team with the most points wins the team competition.\n\nA team competition or dual meet is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the \"home\" competition and one winning the \"away\" competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the fewest technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament.\n\nAt the collegiate, world, and Olympic levels, women wrestle freestyle. During competition the wrestlers will either wear a red singlet or blue singlet depending on where they are placed in the bracket. All female competitors are required to wear a women’s cut singlet with proper fitting to minimize any distracting incidents.\n\nThe United States is still behind Canada with regard to the acceptance of Women’s Wrestling. The U.S. struggles with implementing high school teams for girls. As a result, many high school girls participate on the boys' team where they wrestle American Freestyle. However, the U.S. has made strides amongst universities boasting 14 schools registered on the Women’s Collegiate Wrestling Association website offering opportunities to continue wrestling while getting an education. Gator Wrestling Club, Titan Mercury Wrestling Club, New York Athletic Club, Army World Class Athlete Program, Sunkist Kids, and the Pennsylvania Wrestling Club are domestic sponsors that support many of the nations top girls.\n\nIn addition to colleges and universities, there are programs like the Beat the Streets-Girls Wrestling Program. This organization is highly successful at targeting inner city kids and introducing them to the world of wrestling at no cost. Other notable organizations include Chick Wrestler, which was created in January 2012 to market and promote women’s wrestling at the Olympic Level.\n\nWomen’s wrestling made its Olympic Debut in Athens 2004. Typically the females have 7 weight classes (48 kg, 51 kg, 55 kg, 59 kg, 63 kg, 67 kg, 72 kg) that compete in a World Championships. Though, during the Olympic year, the weights are reduced to only 4 (48 kg, 55 kg, 63 kg, and 72 kg). Only one representative from each weight class is permitted to enter Olympic Competition.\n\n\n\n"}

His popularity soon earned him the position of being an announcer and host of numerous events. In 1969, Correa was hired to host \"De Fiesta Con Venevision\" a variety show which lasted through 1983. His voice was also heard on several of Venevision's commercial bumpers and promos. Correa has also hosted the Miss Venezuela pageant at various times since 1971. In 1985, Correa hosted and produced the news magazine show \"Close Up\".\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Correa often filled in for Amador Bendayan on the variety show \"Sábado Sensacional\". By 1988, Bendayan's health was deteriorating and was forced to retire from the show. Bendayan died shortly after Correa took over as host. On Saturday of that week, a special edition of \"Sábado Sensacional\" aired in which Correa read Bendayan's last will. In 1990, the show was renamed \"Súper Sábado Sensacional\" and focused more on multitudinary events, generating higher ratings. In 1996, future host Daniel Sarcos hosted a new game show segment called \"Mega Match Sensacional\". Correa stepped down as the main host of \"Súper Sábado Sensacional\" in favor of Sarcos, who would host the show for the next twelve years. Correa eventually left the network that same year.\n\nCorrea reappeared on \"Súper Sábado Sensacional\" numerous times (the first being in 2007, celebrating the late Ricardo Pena's 30 years of producing the show). Correa returned again in 2009 to participate in a tribute to Amador Bendayan presented by Daniel Sarcos. In March 2011, Correa returned once again to \"Súper Sábado Sensacional\" to co-host the episode celebrating Venevision's 50th anniversary alongside current host Leonardo Villalobos.

{"id": "17893852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17893852", "title": "Humor research", "text": "Humor research\n\nHumor research (also humor studies) is a multifaceted field which enters the domains of linguistics, history, and literature. Research in humor has been done to understand the psychological and physiological effects, both positive and negative, on a person or groups of people. Research in humor has revealed many different theories of humor and many different kinds of humor including their functions and effects personally, in relationships, and in society.\n\nHumor research deals with a wide variety of issues, which can be categorized according to several theories of humor. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, humor research has many areas of study which aim to explain the phenomenon of humor.\n\nCognitive neuroscience has provided insight into how humor is neurologically realized. Brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and PET scans have been implemented in this subfield of humor research.\nThere are a few main regions of the human brain associated with humor and laughter. The production of laughter involves two primary brain pathways, one for involuntary and one for voluntary laughter (i.e., Duchenne and non-Duchenne laughter). Involuntary laughter is usually emotionally driven and includes key emotional brain areas such as the amygdala, thalamic areas, and the brainstem. Voluntary laughter, however, begins in the premotor opercular area in the temporal lobe and moves to the motor cortex and pyramidal tract before moving to the brainstem. Wild et al. (2003) propose that the generation of laughter is mostly influenced by neural pathways that go from the premotor and motor cortex to the ventral side of the brainstem through the cerebral peduncles. It is also suggested that real laughter is not produced from the motor cortex, but that the normal inhibition of cortical frontal areas stops during laughter.\n\nWhen the electrical activity of the brain is measured during and after hearing a joke, a prominent response can be seen approximately 300ms after the punchline, followed by a depolarization about 100ms later. The fact that humor response occurs in two separate waves of activity supports the idea that humor processing occurs in two stages.\n\nFunctional MRI and PET studies further illuminate which parts of the brain are participating in the experience of humor. A study by Ozawa et al. (2000) found that, when participants heard sentences that they rated as humorous, the Broca's area and the middle frontal gyrus were activated. Additionally, Wernicke's area and the transverse temporal gyri were activated, but these areas also were also found to be active in control (non-humorous) conditions.\n\nAnother study using fMRI showed that the linguistic basis of jokes participants found to be humorous impacted which parts of the brain were activated. In response to puns, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus were activated. When listening to semantic jokes, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus was again activated, as were the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, the right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum. Brain activity in the medial ventral prefrontal cortex was associated with ratings of funniness that the participants gave after the brain scan and initial humor response. This response may stem from the mood or emotional change that occurs after hearing humor.\n\nInduction of laughter through direct brain stimulation has been reported in a number of studies, and includes areas such as ACC, globus pallidus, floor of the third ventricle, and most recently left superior frontal gyrus – though these results are hard to draw inferences from (may be inhibitory, may be artefacts, etc.) Because the nature of laughter is so complex—involving facial muscles, respiratory actions, etc.--a control center has been hypothesized in the upper pons.\n\nStudies within play research have provided correlates to the study of humor, as play often takes on a humorous demeanor. A child's social play often invokes the use of jokes, non-serious social incongruity, physical slapstick humor. Studies on how play \"promot[es] social cohesion, cooperation, and even altruism,\" have been used to describe humor's function. Laughter is often a byproduct of playful social interactions, and can therefore be viewed as serving a similar function as play. It can be said that the perception and appreciation of humor decreases aggression and stress while promoting cooperation and fairness. Play research can provide a functional look at humor in its relation to social interactions.\n\nEvolutionary theorists have attempted to study and explain the phenomena of laughter and humor in terms of survival benefit. Laughter-like behavior is not unique to humans, but humans do display a much more consistent and complex use of humor and laughter than other animals The evolution and functions of laughter and humor have been explored in an attempt to understand how and why humor and laughter have become part of human existence.\n\nDuchenne laughter refers to laughter that is stimulus-driven and linked to some positive experience. This is usually the result of a perceived social incongruity. Non-Duchenne laughter refers to laughter that is unconnected to any emotional experience, but rather laughter that is originated voluntarily. Duchenne laughter evolved before non-Duchenne laughter with the function of making play and playful emotions contagious. In these situations, laughter serves as an in-group designator. Early evolutionary laughter is also theorized to serve the function of dissolving social tension. During moments of displays of social superiority, laughter could be used to dissolve tensions that otherwise could lead to fighting or exclusion from a group, by designating those situations as play rather than as a real challenge. Duchenne laughter, which should be thought of as emotionally-valenced rather than simply spontaneous, can increase positive affect and mood of an individual as well as a group. So, early laughter most likely provided survival benefits through effects of emotional contagion that served to strengthen within-group ties. Non-duchenne laughter developed later than Duchenne laughter. Non-duchenne laughter was co-opted for a variety of other social situations as laughter and humor already existed. Voluntarily accessing the laughter system that was already in place would serve to strengthen in-group fitness just as genuine, emotional laughter did before it, but now it could be done at will. Thus, non-Duchenne laughter developed to express things like aggression, nervousness, hierarchy positions, and to do things such as manipulate, appease, and make fun of others. Even when non-Duchenne laughter is unconscious, that does not mean it is necessarily emotional or using the same brain pathways as genuine Duchenne laughter. As social situations became more complex in later hominid stages of evolution, so did the functions and usefulness of laughter. As linguistics developed, proto-laughter and proto-humor were both co-opted for assistance in the production of and response to effective communication.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that intentional humor evolved as indicator of intelligence. Humor is often rated as important in mate selection, and it may be that partners are selecting for genetic fitness. General intelligence predicted higher ratings on humor tasks, even after controlling for Big Five personality factors.\n\nGreengross & Miller propose that humor plays into sexual selection. Rather than being sexually attractive for its own sake, humor is attractive because it is an indicator of other things which humor is correlated with, such as intelligence, [creativity], and other desirable traits. Intelligence has been shown to be a mental fitness indicator and is highly sexually desirable for both traits Intelligence and humor ability are positively correlated and the ability to produce humor on the spot predicts mating success. In line with theories regarding sex differences of mating strategies, humor ability was rated higher by a blind panel of judges when produced from males than females.\n\nA large proportion of humor is produced during informal conversation and involves the derision of a specific person (either oneself or another). The adaptiveness of deprecating humor in social interactions is a point of interest among researchers. Drawing attention to one's own faults seems counter-intuitive when considering humor's function of strengthening within-group fitness and sexual desirability. Other-deprecating humor has functions which are implicated in establishing same-sex rivalries. This sort of humor usually targets fitness indicators of rivals, which can be risky if an opponent perceives the humor as a threat worthy of retaliation. Self-deprecating humor is proposed to fit within cost signaling theory. Greengross and Miller found that self-deprecating humor had predictive value for long-term sexual attractiveness. However, this occurred as an interaction effect, and only was predictive for high-status individuals. Self-deprecating humor may only work for high-status individuals because it ironically points out the desirable traits by way of discrepancy. In low-status individuals, this approach is unproductive, as the humor is pointing to actual weak fitness traits rather than a discrepancy as with high-status individuals.\n\nThere are two adaptive styles of humor and two maladaptive styles of humor. Affiliative and self-enhancing humor are the two adaptive styles. The defining feature of affiliative humor is humor that is used to strengthen interpersonal relationships or ease tensions within those relationships. Self-enhancing humor involves the use of a humorous outlook on situations in life as a coping tool. In this instance, humor is used to mitigate stress without targeting others or the self in a hurtful way. The two maladaptive humor styles are aggressive humor, which uses sarcasm and other humor styles to target or put down others and self-defeating humor, which uses self-deprecating tactics for the enjoyment of others. Martin et al. (2003) found that higher levels of adaptive humor are related to psychological well-being in terms of lower levels of depression and higher self-esteem. Self-defeating humor contrasts with the adaptive types, and is associated with poorer psychological health. Kuiper and McHale (2009) found support for humor styles being mediators between self-evaluation and psychological well-being. Simply put, rather than humor styles directly affecting psychological well-being, they are involved with how people self-evaluate, which results in different amounts of psychological well-being.\n\nIn a study examining humor as an intervention, random assignment to a humor group, a social group, and a non-intervention control group was used. A standardized manual and booklet were used in the intervention group, and results showed that the humor group demonstrated significant increases in emotional well-being. Importantly, self-efficacy, positive affect, optimism, and perceptions of control were found to go up while other negative measures decreased. Crawford & Caltabiano (2011) found support for humor as an intervention which may increase positive aspects of emotional well-being. Humor skills of the intervention group were targeted through the use of a manual. Humor increased several measures of well-being including self-efficacy, positive affect, optimism, and perception of control, even more than a “social group” control or a non-intervention control group. The exposure to humor and humor skills training was also found to decrease certain negative aspects of emotional well-being, including perceived stress, certain depressive symptoms, and anxiety.\n\nAdaptive components of humor show facilitative effects on psychological well-being. Maladaptive styles that were self-focused showed detrimental effects, while maladaptive styles that did not focus on self were unrelated to personal well beings. Self-deprecating humor is the specific component of maladaptive humor that results in decreased psychological well-being, while both of the adaptive styles of humor (affiliative and self-enhancing) are associated with positive psychological outcomes, such as greater self-esteem, lower depression and anxiety levels, and greater endorsement of self-efficacy. It is important to note that the relevant psychological states may have preceded the humor style rather than vice versa.\n\nHumor research includes investigations into the positive benefits of humor, sense of humor, and laughter on physical health. In recent decades, humor research has seen a surge in publications in part because of Norman Cousins and his claims that he became cured from ankylosing spondilitis due to a daily regimen which included humor and laughter.\n\nPositive affect is theorized to influence physical health by means of the immune system. The immune system could be influenced positively by humor in a number of ways. The possibilities include simple immunoenhancement, stress moderation, or both. The pleasant experience of humor is thought to positively influence affect so that stress is moderated. The antibody secretory immunoglobin A (S-IgA) is associated with both positive and negative affect states, with negative states decreasing effectiveness and positive states increasing effects of the antibody. Levels of immune response can be predicted by the number of desirable events (and presumably mood) which occur in preceding days to the immune assessment. However, there is also evidence that significant mood changes in either direction can induce an increase in immune response. Laughter as an overt behavior is also associated with immune response, specifically NK cell activity, which are part of the body’s immune response. Glucocorticoids are lower in subjects who laughed while watching a humorous video, and glucocorticoids decrease NK cell activity, so humor theory posits this pathway as a possible mechanism for humor as a benefit to immune responses. However, it is unclear whether these effects on this specific immune response measurement have long-term effects with clinical significance. Using humor as a coping style is a way which these long-term effects on the immune system may be enacted. In one study, levels of S-IgA and the use of humor as a coping style were positively correlated, although the saliva sampling procedure of this study was subsequently called into question.\n\nHumor is thought to play a role in the levels of stress that people experience, both in the short-term and long-term. Watching a humorous video for 20 minutes can significantly lower stress levels, on a level comparable to 20 minutes of exercise. Since watching a video is more widely feasible than exercising for 20 minutes for large portions of the population, humor researchers hope that the acute anxiety-alleviating effects of humor can be used in a therapeutic setting. Although acute benefits of humor may be obtained, this does not guarantee any long term benefits.\n\nHumor's effect on pain tolerance is another point of interest within humor research. Hypotheses for this research include the idea that the positive feelings of humor will increase the threshold of pain that a person can endure. These ideas are implicit in some folk wisdom as well as in anecdotes such as Norman Cousins' recovery story. Though not all studies have showed support for the pain-reducing effect of humor, humor and comedy stimuli do have effects on pain tolerance and perception, particularly when pain is assessed after the humor stimuli is completed. Based on the measures of most studies examining pain, it is difficult to tell if simply consuming humorous material is sufficient for pain reduction, or if actual laughter is a necessary component. Further, some studies that used negative affect control groups found that pain thresholds also increased for people experiencing unsettling stimuli, such as a clip from a horror movie. So, humor does have an effect on pain, but it is unclear what exact behavioral requirements are necessary as well as if humor has an effect greater than other emotionally salient experiences.\n\nEven though the positive benefits of humor have been lauded by popular media and have found support among scientific research, the field of humor research also has received criticism. The scientific support for the physical benefits of humor are somewhat sparse, and the findings from the existing research have been called into question in some cases. Humor is assessed differently based on the theories which underpin the research, such as whether humor is a stable personality trait or not. Because of the non-standard measurements of humor in research, it is difficult to tell whether researchers are measuring the same thing across studies. Sense of humor, internal humor response, and laughter can all be targeted to measure humor, but are not necessarily interchangeable. Martin (2001) critiques several studies for not measuring laughter along with their self-report humor measures.\n\nAside from theoretical issues, the methods of some key humor research was also called into question by Martin. For example, the immune response sampling techniques of some humor research may have not been reliable because of how baseline immune levels were set. According to Martin (2001), within the nine studies assessing S-IgA levels in response to humor, three did not have control groups, five had control groups which involved a documentary viewing where interest was not assessed, and only one study had a negative affect control. Proper use of control groups is among the major issues within humor research. Some experimental findings are encouraging, but no firm conclusions involving humor and physical health where controls were not used correctly can be drawn. Thus, there is only partial support of immune effects of humor.\n\nIn 2002, a study was conducted on the functions of humor in close relationships. The study examined three types of humor:\n\n\nPositive humor is expected to be related to intimacy and marital satisfaction. This relation was true for the wives, but not for the husbands. This suggests that whether or not husbands use positive humor, it has nothing to do with how closely they feel to their partner or their marital satisfaction. Research suggests that instrumental humor is negatively related to marital satisfaction and is an indicator of potential future marital deterioration. Results showed that husbands acknowledged using instrumental humor in their relationship in relation to demand-withdrawal, in which the wife demands and the husband withdraws. Wives, on the other hand, did not acknowledge the use of instrumental humor in this communication pattern. This seems to indicate that men more often withdraw than women, in this case, with the use of humor. Negative humor was not related to any of the other humor measure in the study. This makes sense considering that put-downs or hurtful humor does not tend to lead to laughter or humor appreciation. Negative humor items in the questionnaire given to the participants described expressing negative emotion. Negative humor somewhat correlated with demand-withdrawal for husbands and wives. This humor can be a form of passive aggressiveness where the one using the humor is not taking responsibility for the put-down or hurtful joke, and in doing so, avoiding, or withdrawing from, conflict.\n\nWhen someone finds something funny, there are different ways of expressing it. Common responses of humor include laughing and smiling. In 2008, a study was conducted using 155 undergraduate students at North London University in order to measure responses to humor using a British comedy. The participants were divided into one of three categories: watched a video of the comedy, listened to an audiotape of the comedy, or read a script of the comedy. Approximately half of the participants were observed by an overt video camera and half were observed by a covert video camera. Results showed that participants laughed and smiled much more frequently when watching a video of the comedy and listening to the audiotape of the comedy than when reading a script. The difference in the frequency of smiling and laughing between the video and the audiotape was not significant. Participants laughed and smiled more frequently when observed by a covert video camera than an overt video camera. Aspects of the video and audiotape such as visualization of the acting, auditory representation, and also the presence of audience laughter significantly increase the frequency of laughter and smiling.\n\n\n"}

Daniel Wilks was the then editor of Hyper since 2007 and the 200th issue was his last.

The small troupe usually comprised a comedian, dancer/singer and musician. They traveled in a jeep with their musical instruments and other equipment carried in a quarter ton trailer that would be converted into a stage. They broadcast their show through a public address system using the jeep's battery. Each show lasted an average of 45 minutes and troupes could be combined into nine or 18 man shows for larger shows. The jeep show troops carried easily transportable musical instruments such as guitars, saxophones, banjos, accordions and drums. The troupe presented songs, skit, jokes, dancing, and pantomime \n\nRooney recalled his first show being between two Sherman tanks three miles from the front in Belgium for 60 soldiers.

Although the promotion continues to offer taped matches on DVD and digital download, it has not promoted a live event since 2008.\n\nCRUSH was founded in 2002 by former Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling host Johnny Cafarella. Cafarella developed an idea for a new television series that was loosely based on the original concept for GLOW and later used for Women of Wrestling (WOW). With Steve Blance, Jimmy Hart, and the Flying Farley Brothers (brothers of late comedian Chris Farley), he filmed matches for the pilot episode of a proposed all-women's wrestling/sketch comedy television series called \"CRUSH\" in February 2003.\n\nAlthough Hart stated in radio interviews that the series would debut on the Comedy Central network in fall 2003 and that Tom Arnold would be involved in the series, the pilot was not sold to any networks or distributors. In 2008, Cafarella and Hart partnered with Jonathan Vargas, who won a Powerball jackpot of $35.3 million the same year.

She is the current champion at the time of this writing, but faces stiff competition from the likes of Remy Rush, Scarlett Squeeze, and other ladies who are quickly rising on the roster.\n\n"}
{"id": "505674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505674", "title": "Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music", "text": "Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music\n\nMachina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music is the sixth studio album by the American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. It was released for free on the Internet on September 5, 2000. Plans for a standard physical release, bundled with the first part \"Machina/The Machines of God\", were revealed to happen sometime in 2013, but has since been postponed indefinitely.\n\nThe album itself, a double LP, was packaged with three EPs full of B-sides and alternate versions. Both \"Machina\" albums are loose concept albums telling the story of \"a rock star gone mad\". \"Machina II\" was the last Smashing Pumpkins studio album until the band reformed in 2006, and also their final studio album to feature the guitarist James Iha, until his comeback in 2018's \"\".\n\nNear the conclusion of the \"Machina\" sessions, it was Billy Corgan's wish to release a double album of material, but Virgin Records was unwilling to do that following the disappointing sales of \"Adore\". After the release and poor sales of the single-disc \"Machina/The Machines of God\", Corgan then wanted to release the second \"Machina\" album separately, but Virgin declined to do this as well. The band nonetheless returned to the Chicago Recording Company in July 2000 to finish what would become \"Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music\", which was subsequently released on Corgan's own label Constantinople Records. Only twenty-five copies were made, and were given mostly to friends of the band in addition to radio station Q101. A few of the 25 copies were purposely shipped to prominent fans in the online community, with instructions to immediately redistribute it on the Internet free of charge.\n\nThe Pumpkins performed a track from the album (\"Cash Car Star\") on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", which also ended up being the band's final television appearance until their 2007 revival. A previous live performance of the song, in an earlier and slightly different-than-final-version form, had been broadcast as a portion of Kiss' 1998 \"Psycho Circus\" Halloween special, where The Smashing Pumpkins served as the opening act.\n\n\"Machina II\" reflects \"Corgan's obsession with dream-pop, Cure- and Depeche Mode-styled synth-goth, and glam-tinged heavy metal.\" The album picks up the thematic elements of \"Glass and The Machines of God\" started in Machina/The Machines of God. Songs like \"Glass' Theme\", \"Cash Car Star\", \"Home\", and the B-side \"Speed Kills\" are related to Corgan's story. The first three songs (\"Glass' Theme\", \"Cash Car Star\", and \"Dross\"), considerably more intense than much of the Pumpkins' other releases, are a hearkening to the earlier, famous Smashing Pumpkins sound, blending dream pop with arena rock, while \"Let Me Give the World to You\" has a melodic, radio-friendly sound. \"Real Love\", which would later appear on the band's \"Rotten Apples\", has a sound reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine. \"Home\" has been called \"simply gorgeous\" and compared to U2. The album's closing track, \"Here's to the Atom Bomb\", has been compared favorably to the Pumpkins' biggest hit, \"1979.\"\n\nBecause it was not released conventionally, few professional reviews of the album were published, but those that surfaced were generally positive. \"The A.V. Club\" called it an \"artistic high\" for the band. Pitchfork Media opined that the band sounded \"energized and at a creative peak.\" AllMusic stated that \"As a high-class artifact and a gift to a loyal fan base, Machina II is a winner. \" The \"Michigan Daily\" also published a review calling the music \"some of the best Pumpkins material to date.\" However, a more mixed review came from Pitchfork, who noted that \"There isn't really any new ground broken here, but the band revisits nearly every style they've adopted over the years\", ultimately concluding that listeners should \"take this as a proper farewell to the Smashing Pumpkins\" and that \"it's a nice album to remember them by\".\n\nIn April 2010, Billy Corgan commented on the album's reception, stating that: \"I think the fan response at the time was very positive, as the fans who were around at the time seemed to like \"Machina II\" better than \"Machina I\". That said, \"Machina I\" is proving now to be the more influential part of the work for many of the younger bands that I've talked to. [...] At the time I saw [releasing the album for free] as a one-time thing. I never thought we would see a near collapse of the music business and its dominant control on how music reaches people.\"\n\nThe two-LP set is the album itself. Corgan has said that the three EPs are \"technically the B-sides.\" CR-01, CR-02, etc. all refer to their released on Constantinople Records (Constantinople Records-Released 1, etc.). The only other Constantinople release, CR-05, was \"Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88\", a gift given to fans exiting their farewell concert at the Cabaret Metro. The songs \"Let Me Give the World to You,\" \"Saturnine,\" and \"Cash Car Star\" were originally written and recorded for \"Adore\". The original \"Let Me Give the World to You\" was produced by Rick Rubin, and was later released on the deluxe edition of the 2014 reissue of \"Adore\", alongside demos and remixes of \"Saturnine\" and a remixed version of Cash Car Star.\n\n\nA number of a release sources exist for \"Machina II\". All of them are sourced from vinyl (except for the noted commercial releases of select tracks).\n\nVirgin promos\nThis source is from in-house promo CDs made for internal use at Virgin Records (sourced from the vinyl records), made before \"Machina II\" was released to the public over the Internet. Two versions of the promos exist, a UK (type I) and U.S. (type II) version, both with four CDs corresponding to the vinyl copies. As it was done in-house at a record company, it is generally assumed to be a high-quality transfer, though some of the faint voices which can be heard in the background before some of the EP songs are cut off, and in general, it is missing a considerable amount of audio between song transitions.\n\nQ101 transfer\nAs mentioned above, the radio station Q101 received one of the 25 vinyl copies. It was subsequently transferred to two CDs by the station (one CD containing the EP tracks and one containing the LP tracks). The transfer was done by a high-profile radio station (presumably with high-end equipment and professional oversight) and spectral analysis shows the transfer to be of good quality. Copies were given away as prizes from the station.\n\nSPIFC transfer\nThe SPIFC transfer was produced from a vinyl copy by a member of the SPIFC. A transfer was eventually performed onto two CDs with \"high-end\" equipment. The SPIFC offers MP3 downloads of the transfer to members and held a contest giving away CD-R copies. The SPIFC transfer shows a 21 kHz tone which casts some doubt on the quality of the transfer.\n\nMP3 web releases\nFollowing the vinyl release a number of MP3 versions quickly surfaced on the web. A select number of people involved in the Smashing Pumpkins online fan community received one of the 25 releases. Using audio equipment they had immediate access to, these tracks were recorded, encoded to MP3, and quickly released for the masses. Later MP3 releases may be from one of the CD sources listed above or newer lesser known transfers. The Smashing Pumpkins' official site also had the full 25 tracks for download in both mp3 format (at 320kbit/s) and in RealAudio format. In 2007, the album was once again posted for download on the newly reopened SmashingPumpkins.com.\n\nCommercial releases\nFour tracks from \"Machina II\" have been released commercially. These are of specific note, because these versions were sourced from the master tapes rather than amateur vinyl transfers. \"Real Love\" was featured on \"Rotten Apples\". \"Lucky 13\" and \"Slow Dawn\" appeared on \"Judas O\", which was included with early copies of \"Rotten Apples\". The \"Machina II\" version of \"Try, Try, Try\" was one of the B-sides to the \"Untitled\" single, titled \"Try (Alternate Version).\" The studio banter that precedes \"Try, Try, Try\" on \"Machina II\" has been removed from this version\n\n\n The turntable Eric Agnew used to transfer was 3% faster than normal, so the speed and pitch of the music on this version is increased compared to the others.\n"}

Other features include tire wear, damage and mechanical failures.\n\nPer official entries, Paul Bird Motorsport retired from the championship, but Suzuki and Aprilia made an official return. One new feature is the ability for the player to create their own racing team, with choice of logo and livery. Starting off with a Mahindra MGP3O bike, the player must advance through the classes, and recruit sponsors. The game also has a mode which focuses on recreating events from the 2014 season, and in particular the rivalry between Jorge Lorenzo, Valentino Rossi and Marc Márquez, and the comebacks from riders such as Andrea Iannone. The PlayStation 4 version features an online league mode, where players battle for the best lap times.\nThe game includes a total of over 100 riders, each in their respective teams, making up the three current classes (e.g. the Ducati Desmosedici and Honda NSF250R), and one historic class (covering 1992-2001, e.g. the Cagiva GP500), with a total of around 25 bikes.

The developer issued a warning that the Xbox One version contained a number of bugs. On the PlayStation 4, the consensus was that it looked ok, but did not improve significantly on the previous game. The Official PlayStation Magazine praised the bike handling, adding that \"AI riders put up a great fight, outbraking you into hairpins and slipstreaming past you down the straights. ... overall, the racing is solid and challenging, and securing a podium finish without resorting to the rewind function is a significant achievement.\" Analog Addiction praised the customisable race options and the stable and enjoyable multiplayer component.\n\n\"MotoGP 15\" reached number 11 in the UK PS3 sales charts, as of April 19, 2016 still not available in North America and number 16 in the PS4 charts.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20160506092133/http://www.sharjeelworld.tk/2016/05/download-motogp-15-game-for-pc-full.html\n"}

Many university students have to turn to prostitution for economic reasons.\n\nSex trafficking and child prostitution are a major problems in Tanzania.\n\nThe country is a destination for sex tourism, including female and child sex tourism, especially in the coastal resorts and Zanzibar.\n\nTanzania is a popular destination for sex tourism, particularly in Arusha Bagamoyo and the islands of Zanzibar, Mafia and Pemba. Many of the tourists are Italian.\n\nZanzibar is also a destination for female sex tourism. Many of the \"beach boys\" are not from Zanzibar. There are some agents offering holidays to the island, including an exclusive \"guide\". Most of the women are from Europe or North America.\n\nChild sex tourism is a problem, especially on the coastal resorts and the Kenyan border. Whilst some of the children are trafficked, some turn to prostitution through poverty.\n\nTanzania faces a mature, generalized HIV epidemic. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million Tanzanians were living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 1 out of 20 residents in the capital Dar es Salaam and 1 in 3 sex workers are infected with the HIV virus. Nationally, 28% of sex workers and 4.7% of all adults are infected.\n\nReports show that an increase in the number of cases of HIV and AIDS are growing at an alarming rate in Zanzibar. This is thought to have been added to by large numbers of tourists entering Zanzibar and fueling demand for prostitutes.\n\nTanzania is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and characteristically facilitated by victims’ family members, friends, or intermediaries offering assistance with education or securing employment in urban areas. Impoverished children from the rural interior remain most vulnerable to trafficking. Girls are exploited in sex trafficking, particularly in tourist hubs and along the border with Kenya. Previous media reports indicate girls are subjected to sex trafficking in China. Tanzanian nationals are sometimes subjected sex trafficking in other African countries, the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Trafficking victims from other countries, particularly children from Burundi, Rwanda, and Kenya, as well as adults from India, Nepal, and Yemen are subjected to sex trafficking. Citizens of neighbouring countries may transit Tanzania before being subjected to sex trafficking in South Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Tanzania as a \"Tier 2\" country.\n"}

Prostitution occurs mainly in the capital, Honiara, and around logging camps in Makira, Malaita and Isabel islands. Many of the women involved have turned to prostitution due to poverty, some starting at the age of 13. The laws are rarely enforced.\n\nChild prostitution is a problem in the Solomon Islands, sometimes with the complicity of family members. Sex trafficking is also a problem.\n\nThe Penal Code of the Solomon Islands criminalises the following prostitution related activities:\n\nIn 2009, there were active student surveys of the sex trade involving market women and young girls from the \"Central Market\". In 2014, fishermen, who were paid to transport girls to foreign fishing vessels outside the harbour of Honiara, described the \"Central Market\" as one of \"the most evident or well-known pickup spots\" for prostitution.\n\nIn 2006, the Solomon Islands' Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare, filed a police complaint against the Australian led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). He alleged the peacekeeping force were smuggling local women into their base at the former Guadalcanal Beach Resort and using them as prostitutes. The claims were denied by the RAMSI.\n\nThe Solomon Islands is a source, transit, and destination country for local and Southeast Asian women subjected to forced prostitution, and local children subjected to sex trafficking. Women from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines are recruited for legitimate work, some paying large sums of money in recruitment fees, and upon arrival are forced into prostitution.\n\nSolomon Island children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, sometimes in exchange for money or goods, particularly near foreign logging camps, on foreign and local commercial fishing vessels, and at hotels and entertainment establishments. Girls and young women are recruited to travel to logging camps for domestic work and some are subsequently exploited in prostitution. Some parents receive payments for sending young women and girls into forced marriages with foreign workers at logging and mining companies; many of them are exploited in prostitution.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks the Solomon Islands as a \"Tier 2\" country.\n"}

{"id": "3561404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3561404", "title": "Rock en español", "text": "Rock en español\n\nRock en español () is a term used widely in the English-speaking world to refer any kind of rock music featuring Spanish vocals. Unlike English-speaking bands, very few acts reached worldwide success and often not even between different Spanish-speaking countries due to a lack of promotion. Despite \"rock en español\" 's origins in the late 1950s, many rock acts achieved at best nationwide fame until the Internet consolidated the listeners. However, some \"rock en español\" artists did become internationally popular with the help of a promotional campaign from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s called \"Rock en tu idioma\" (Rock in your language). Some specific rock-based styles influenced by folkloric rhythms have also developed in these regions. Some of the more prominent styles are \"Latin rock\", a fusion of rock music with Latin American and Caribbean folkloric sounds developed in Latino communities; \"Latin alternative\", an alternative rock scene which blended a Latin sound with other genres like Caribbean ska, reggae, and soca; or \"Andalusian rock\", a flamenco-influenced style that emerged in Spain.\n\nSpanish-speaking rock music began in the late-1950s, through listening to performers like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Bill Haley, who popularized rockabilly in the United States. The song \"El relojito\" by Gloria Ríos released in 1956 is often considered the blueprint of \"rock en español\". In 1958, Ritchie Valens covered the Mexican folk song \"La Bamba\", popularizing Spanish-language rock music throughout Latin America. That year, Daniel Flores performed his hit song \"Tequila\", which reached nº1 in Billboard charts. \n\nThe new sound immediately caught the attention of the middle and upper class.\n\nThe first rock bands in Latin America were created in the late 1950s with Los Llopis and Los Teen Tops achieving some success covering American rock classics during the early 1960s. The Spanish scene received some influences of non-English-speaking countries with the Yé-yé style as could be seen with Raphael. In the early 1960s, those styles of commercial rock music were nicknamed \"Nueva ola\" (New wave) in some South American countries to refer the bands that adopted the American and European styles.\n\nAfter the popularization of The Beatles and the world success of the British Invasion, the Hispanophone world adapted new styles like Beat music, rhythm and blues, psychedelia, soul, folk-rock and pop music.\n\nThe influences of beat music and psychedelic pop were noticeable in some acts such as Los Brincos, El Kinto, Los Gatos or The Speakers, while other successful bands featured mostly English and few Spanish vocals like Los Bravos or Los Shakers. Success outside of the native and Spanish-speaking scene proved difficult to attain though, and the few hits these bands achieved worldwide were sung in English, as Miguel Ríos and Los Bravos did for example. Los Saicos were one of the very oldest proto-punk bands in the world.\n\nBy mid-decade the Mexican (later US citizen) Carlos Santana moved north to California and soon joined the burgeoning San Francisco rock scene. Forming the band Santana towards the end of the sixties, he would gather a shifting group of musicians from mixed Anglo-Saxon and Hispanic backgrounds; the band would become one of the more popular acts of the 1970s in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe and brought together elements of rock 'n' roll and jazz with Latin percussion and harmonics (as evidenced, for example, on \"Abraxas\" (1970) and \"Moonflower\" (1977)). The band would consistently alternate lyrics in Spanish and English; they were arguably the most successful crossover Latin/Anglo rock band to date, and were important in spreading interest in Latin percussion and drumming around the world.\nAlthough he is not a rock en español musician, Carlos Santana's background is that of a traditional Latin musician who has fused rock guitar (and jazz and salsa rhythms) with classic Latin American songs and a sizeable body of compositions by himself and his band. Their hit song \"Oye Como Va\" is an example of Santana's fusion, being originally composed by famous Latin jazz and mambo musician Tito Puente. From the late 1960s on, concurrently with the success of Santana, there was a growing interest in Latin-American folk music and dancing as well as a worldwide cultural boom for Latin-American literature and its colourful, sometimes surrealist and magic realist storytelling, which sustained an interest in Latin music in general, though not always in Latin rock music as such. There was a noticeable Latin influence in 1970s jazz (e.g. Herbie Hancock, Flora Purim, Return to Forever) and some acts like Malo were performing Latin Rock during the same decade.\n\nHowever, styles like blues, acid rock, hard rock, and prog rock would be very influential around the next decade. Almendra, led by Luis Alberto Spinetta, was one of the most important prog bands of the late 1960s and later, Spinetta would become one of the most important artists of the 1970s rock en español scene,\n\nInfluenced by the new trends of the 60's, psychedelic acts like Los Dug Dug's, Pescado Rabioso (heavy psych)— or La Revolución de Emiliano Zapata (although rarely they featured Spanish vocals during these years); blues acts like Manal and progressive rock bands like Invisible, Sui Generis (folk prog), Témpano, Los Jaivas (Andean rock), Vox Dei (which style would turn harder sounding) o Triana (heavily influenced by flamenco) appeared. Triana were pioneers of the Andalusian rock scene, a new style emeged in Spain that melt prog rock with flamenco.\n\nAs the hard rock merged in the UK in the late 1960s, the first hard rock acts appeared in the early 1970s with bands like Pappo's Blues. Also, a new hard rock movement influenced by prog, blues and punk called Spanish Rock urbano lead the harder scene of the late 1970s with bands like Leño.\n\nBut in these days appeared some repression of rock music in Mexico. The government forced artists, labels and radio stations to go \"underground\" as they associated the music with the breakdown of societal standards. The main pushing edge that created tension with the government was due to the Avándaro Rock Festival in 1971. Also the dictatorship established in Argentina in 1976 make some Argentine artist leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain. They joined the Spanish rock scene and sometimes Hispano-Argentine bands Tequila get formed and achieved success. Tequila joined an rock and roll, glam and rhythm & blues scene along with other Spanish acts Burning or La Orquesta Mondragón.\n\nWhile the declining of punk rock in the Anglophone scene, the more prominent punk bands appeared along the 1980s with La Polla Records, Siniestro Total or Los Violadores. Subgenres derived from punk like New Wave and Post punk were also important during the 1980s. La Movida Madrileña was an important movement of these styles among others.\nIn the mid-1980s, a promotional campaign called \"Rock en tu idioma\" (Rock in your language) started helping to internationalize some bands. Soda Stereo is largely credited as the first Spanish-language rock band to gain widespread popularity across Latin America. However, there was equal transnational success in the late 1980s from Virus, Radio Futura, Enanitos Verdes, Caifanes, Hombres G, or Los Prisioneros among others during the same time period.\n\nThough mainly a teen-pop band, Puerto Rican band Menudo at times also dabbled into Rock en Espanol during this decade; examples of their rock music work include their albums \"Quiero Ser\" (alternatively named \"Rock Chiquillo\" in some markets), \"A Todo Rock\" and \"Hijos del Rock\" as well as songs such as \"Quiero Rock\", \"Rock en la TV\", \"Mi Banda Toca Rock\", \"Sube a mi Motora\" and \"Jovenes\". Similarly, Los Chicos de Puerto Rico a band that was similar to Menudo, had a song named \"Rock Solido\" which was released during 1983.\n\nThe final amalgamation into a coherent international scene was helped by the introduction of MTV Latin America in 1993, where the first video shown, \"We are sudamerican rockers\" by Chilean band Los Prisioneros, reflected its aims to create a Latin American scene. In the late 1990s, MTV created the Latino Award in the MTV Video Music Awards and Premios MTV Latinoamérica in 2002, awards that recognize the talented bands and achievements of the genre. However, MTV Latin America was criticized for focusing primarily on rock bands from Argentina and Mexico, with the occasional band from Chile or Colombia. For example, bands on MTV Latino that received very regular airplay were Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Mano Negra, Café Tacuba, Aterciopelados, Maldita Vecindad, Babasónicos, Los Rodríguez and Héroes del Silencio. On the other hand, some hard rock bands like La Renga, Cuca or Extremoduro achieved success.\n\nDuring the success of Alternative rock in the 1990s, many bands performed alt rock and Latin Alternative (style that combined alt rock with ska, reggae and Latin folkloric elements) like Robi Draco Rosa, Caifanes, Café Tacuba, and La Ley initiated a new stage of Latin rock by broadening its international appeal. Since then, successful bands and musicians include Juanes, Libido, Maná (Mexico), Jaguares, Aterciopelados, Bersuit Vergarabat, Jorge Drexler and Los Tres among others. The new bands were able to be successful through the development of the music video in the 1990s.\n\nRock en español borrows heavily from rock and roll music and traditional and popular music of Spanish-speaking countries such as cumbia, ranchera, rumba, and tango. In its 50-year history, it has evolved from having a cult-like following to being a more well established music genre.\n\nIn Los Angeles, an underground scene has developed and continues to flourish that supports the local rock en español acts. Top bands from the LA REE scene include Motita, Pastilla, Maria Fatal, Rascuache, Voz de Mano, Cabula, Las 15 letras, Verdadera FE, and Los Olvidados.\n\nRecord labels that have supported US based REE include Aztlan records, El Mero Mero Records, and Mofo Records. Many of them have been associated to the Chicano rock scene.\n\n\n"}

Steven Spielberg served as one of the executive producers. The series was broadcast in the US by NBC and produced by DreamWorks Television and Universal Television. The series revolves around a fictional New York City theater community and specifically the creation of a new Broadway musical. It features a large ensemble cast, led by Debra Messing, Jack Davenport, Katharine McPhee, Christian Borle, Megan Hilty, and Anjelica Huston.\n\nThe show debuted on February 6, 2012, and its first season ended on May 14, 2012. Its second season premiered on February 5, 2013, and ended on May 26, 2013. NBC announced a change in their lineup in March 2013 and moved the show to Saturdays starting April 6, 2013. The series was cancelled on May 10, 2013. Second-season executive producer-show runner Josh Safran said the final episode of season two worked as a series finale.\n\nThe series, especially the pilot episode, enjoyed critical success. The first season received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography among four nominations. The series was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media (\"Let Me Be Your Star\").\n\nThe show revolves around a group of characters creating new Broadway musicals, where everyone must balance their often chaotic personal life with the all-consuming demands of life in the theater. The series features original music by composers Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman.\n\nJulia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle), a Broadway writing team, came up with the idea of a new musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe titled \"Bombshell\". Producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), in the midst of divorce proceedings from her philandering husband, jumps on board and brings with her Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), a difficult but brilliant director. Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) is initially cast as Marilyn, but is forced to deal with competition from the talented, yet naive ensemble member Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee). Julia's former lover Michael Swift (Will Chase) is initially cast in the role of Joe DiMaggio. However, when Julia and Michael's reunion causes serious trouble in her marriage to Frank (Brian d'Arcy James), the decision is made to fire Michael. The role of Marilyn is recast with film star Rebecca Duvall (Uma Thurman), leaving Ivy devastated. After a somewhat disastrous out-of-town opening in Boston, Rebecca has fallen sick due to a peanut allergy and the actor playing Joe departs the production for a better gig. Derek subsequently casts Karen in the role of Marilyn and Michael is reinstated as Joe. Karen discovers Ivy has slept with her fiancé Dev (Raza Jaffrey), while Eileen finds out that her assistant Ellis (Jaime Cepero) was the one who poisoned Rebecca and fires him. Karen gets through her debut and the season ends with the closing number being applauded by the audience.\n\nAs \"Bombshell\" works to open on Broadway in New York City, the show runs into legal and creative troubles which threaten its future. Meanwhile, the cast and crew (featured in Season 1) attempt to find work. Karen meets two aspiring friends and partners (Kyle, a stage writer played by Andy Mientus, and Jimmy, a composer played by Jeremy Jordan) and tries to get their work noticed, especially by Derek. Derek works with Broadway star Veronica Moore (Jennifer Hudson), who becomes friends with Karen. Ivy gets the lead in \"Liaisons\", a show based on the play \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\". \"Bombshell\" needs work in order to open on Broadway. First, Peter Gillman (Daniel Sunjata), a dramaturg with whom Julia had a rocky relationship is hired in order to help re-write the show. Second, Jerry (Michael Cristofer) replaces Eileen as the show's producer after she had to step down when the federal authorities found out (through Jerry's orchestration) that she had financed \"Bombshell\" with illegal money. Jimmy and Kyle's show, called \"Hit List\", eventually goes to the New York Fringe Festival and then they meet a producer for an off-broadway theater called Manhattan Theatre Workshop. Karen quits \"Bombshell\" to be in \"Hit List\" because she has to choose one of them. Ivy takes Karen's role as Marilyn Monroe in \"Bombshell\". \"Hit List\" starts rehearsals. Karen and Jimmy's relationship starts to develop but may cause some disturbance in the work place with Derek's secret feelings for Karen. \"Hit List\" goes to Broadway produced by Jerry and \"Bombshell\" and \"Hit List\" go face to face at the Tony Awards. \"Hit List\" wins 7 Tonys, which is more than \"Bombshell\", however \"Bombshell\" wins Best Musical and Best Actress (Ivy Lynn) in a Leading Role.\n\n\nDevelopment began in 2009 at Showtime by then-Showtime entertainment president Robert Greenblatt and Steven Spielberg, from an idea by Spielberg, who had been working on the concept for years; Greenblatt, described as a \"devoted theater geek\", had also produced a short-lived musical adaptation of the film \"9 to 5\" in 2009. The original concept was that each season would follow the production of a new musical; if any of them were \"stage-worthy\", Spielberg would make them into actual Broadway musicals. The series was inspired by \"The West Wing\" and \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" as role models for successful TV dramas. Garson Kanin's novel \"Smash\" (New York: Viking, 1980) provided the title and setting, although the plots have little in common.\n\nGreenblatt then brought the project with him to NBC when he was made NBC Entertainment president in January 2011. Theresa Rebeck wrote the pilot script and is series creator. Executive producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron suggested Rebeck for the series to Spielberg and Greenblatt. NBC ordered production of a pilot in January 2011 for the 2011–12 television season.\n\nMichael Mayer directed the pilot episode, with Spielberg serving as an executive producer. It has been reported that the pilot cost $7.5 million to produce. On May 11, 2011, NBC picked the project up to series. When the network announced its 2011–12 schedule on May 15, 2011, the series was slated to premiere in mid-season. NBC opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair it up with the hit reality show \"The Voice\" on Monday nights. On August 1, 2011, it was announced by the press that show's series premiere date would be February 6, 2012, the night after Super Bowl XLVI, with heavy promotion through early winter on many of the network's properties before the premiere. At the NBC Press Tour, Greenblatt announced that \"Smash\" would have 15 episodes produced for the first season to coincide with \"The Voice\".\n\nThe series is a production of Universal Television in association with DreamWorks. Theresa Rebeck is the creator of the series as well as the writer of the pilot episode and five episodes of the first season, including the season finale. The series has a large number of executive producers including Steven Spielberg, Craig Zadan, Neil Meron, David Marshall Grant, Rebeck, Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey. Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman serve as the composers and executive producers. In March 2012, Rebeck stepped down as showrunner of the musical drama. On April 24, 2012, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that \"Gossip Girl\" executive producer Joshua Safran would take the lead for the second season while Rebeck would remain a writer and an executive producer. However, on May 2, 2012, Rebeck stated in an interview that she would not be returning to the show in any capacity.\n\nMany of those behind \"Smash\" began the series with high hopes. Rebeck was a large part of that. As one early hire later described her to \"BuzzFeed\": \"She was this kick-ass woman showrunner who wasn't taking shit from the network. Someone who had a very clear vision who was going to stand up to the network. They were all good things in the beginning.\"\n\nDespite her experience writing and producing in television, Rebeck had never been a showrunner, responsible for the day-to-day operations of a series, before. David Marshall Grant, a playwright and actor who had served in that capacity during \"Brothers & Sisters\"' final seasons, was hired as executive producer to help her with it. Rebeck was reportedly resentful, and worried that she was being set up to fail and Grant positioned to replace her. Very quickly she began shutting him out of key decisions.\n\nRebeck also decided she would not run a \"writers' room,\" i.e., a regular meeting with the entire writing staff to discuss and perfect episodes and plotlines. \"[They] really are not my thing, because I can only stand being in a room with people so many hours a day,\" she told \"New York\". \"And I feel like early drafts should be speedy because everyone changes their mind, so why spend a lot of time up front parsing sentences?\" Instead she would follow the example of showrunners like Matthew Weiner and Aaron Sorkin and have writers submit a first draft, which she then revised.\n\nVery quickly, the writers recalled, the show became a \"dictatorship.\" Rebeck's opinion was the only one that mattered. She insisted on writing the second and third episodes herself, and writers said that the drop in quality was evident during pre-air screenings. During this time Rebeck was often fighting with Spielberg, who wanted Hilty, Greenblatt, or Grant replaced. As a result of these distractions, plotlines like Julia's adoption dilemma (mirroring Rebeck's real life) began to assume unusual prominence, and along with them secondary characters like Leo and Ellis became almost main characters—the latter because Spielberg reportedly liked him.\n\nSince the writers never met as a group, they found that finished episodes often repeated the same character moments instead of advancing those characters, and that strange out-of-context moments, usually musical numbers set away from the stage, had been inserted. They were particularly frustrated in trying to write for Julia, whom Rebeck had based on herself and consequently would not allow to have any difficulties. Later in the season, they were hoping that Greenblatt would win some of their fights. \"You know it's bad when \"our last hope was the network\",\" one told \"BuzzFeed\". However, many of them said the show's own problems were not entirely Rebeck's fault, since Greenblatt also intervened in things like costume design and Spielberg was not informed of the conflicts until near the end.\n\nAfter she left the show, Rebeck, who, citing confidentiality requirements, did not respond to the \"BuzzFeed\" story at first other than to say she \"was treated quite badly\", spoke at some length to \"The New York Observer\" about \"Smash\":\nFollowing the show's cancellation, Kate Aurthur, the writer of the \"BuzzFeed\" story, reposted an email exchange she had with Rebeck. Pointing to the show's decline in ratings during its second season, Rebeck asked, \"If in fact [I] was the problem with [the show], wouldn't things have gotten better—rather than dramatically worse—once [I] left?\" She accused Aurthur of relying on a single unnamed source and asked that the story, which she called \"wildly untrue\", be taken down.\n\nNBC announced on June 9, 2011, that they had signed a deal with Columbia Records for a soundtrack of the series. The deal gives Columbia worldwide digital and physical rights to the first season, with options to subsequent seasons. The deal includes both original songs written for the series and any covers of songs featured on the show.\n\nThe series soundtrack for Season 1, \"The Music of Smash\", was released on May 1, 2012. The album debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at #9 with 40,000 copies sold in its first week.\n\nA \"Bombshell\" cast recording, featuring original songs from the first and second season of the show, was released on February 12, 2013, selling 16,000 copies in its first week. It contains all 22 songs written for the fictional \"Bombshell\" musical and features lead vocals by Katharine McPhee (Karen Cartwright) and Megan Hilty (Ivy Lynn) as Marilyn Monroe.\n\nIn addition to songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, the show's second season featured songs by up-and-coming composers Drew Gasparini, Joe Iconis, and writing duo Benj Pasek & Justin Paul.\n\nSeveral songs were written and performed for the series' season two fictional musical, \"Hit List\". On October 15, 2013, it was announced that \"Hit List\" would be staged in concert format at 54 Below on December 9. \"Smash\" stars Jeremy Jordan, Andy Mientus and Krysta Rodriguez were scheduled to perform. Because of demand for tickets, an additional performance was scheduled for December 8.\n\nDuring production of the show, executive producer Craig Zadan said: \"We stand on the set, watch the \"Bombshell\" numbers and say, \"Wouldn't this be great on Broadway? And so far that's where we've left it. Our priority now is producing a great TV show\".\n\nIn June 2015 following the sold-out performance at the Minskoff Theatre, it was announced that \"Bombshell\" would head to the Broadway stage. The executive producers of \"Smash\" and the \"Bombshell\" concert Neil Meron and Craig Zadan are set to executive produce the Broadway production. No timeline for the show has been announced.\n\nThe pilot of \"Smash\" received positive reviews from television critics, but the critical response was less positive as the season progressed.\n\nReview aggregator \"Metacritic\", which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 of reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 79 based on 32 reviews. Maureen Ryan of \"The Huffington Post\" called it one of the strongest new shows of the season. \"The Huffington Post\" writer Karen Ocamb praised the writing and the creativity of the series. Mary McNamara of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the show a \"triumph\" and also went on to say that the creator Theresa Rebeck as well as her team, \"have managed to capture the grand and sweeping gesture that is musical theater and inject it with the immediate intimacy of television.\" David Wiegand of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the program a rave review: \"[It's so] good you can't help wondering why no one thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation of what it takes to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night.\" Tim Goodman from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the pilot episode \"Excellent, a bar-raiser for broadcast networks\", and superior to \"Glee\". He also praised writing and acting for the series, comparing it to the quality of a cable television series. Matt Mitovich of TVLine called the cast \"pretty damn perfect\" and complimented the musical numbers. Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" gave the show three and a half out of four stars and wrote, \"Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems.\" Tanner Stransky of \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the pilot episode as the 8th best television episode of 2012 saying, \"After we watched the subsequent 14 episodes of \"Smash\" with a mixture of fascination and dismay (seriously, did Debra Messing's Julia wear a men's pajama top to meet her lover?), it was difficult to recall that the pilot was positively magical. But it was. In fact, that episode-ending performance of 'Let Me Be Your Star' (featuring dueling divas Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee) was among TV's most watchable and gleeful three minutes of the year. Rare is the series whose high-water mark is its pilot, and Smash is a shining example.\"\n\nChris Harnick of \"The Huffington Post\" wrote, \"How has the rest of Season 1 been so far? Not so phenomenal. That's not to say it has been downright terrible—there have been some highly entertaining moments—but it certainly hasn't been goosebumps-inducing, like the final moments of Episode 1, set to 'Let Me Be Your Star.'\" Kevin Fallon summed up the response in \"The Atlantic\", writing that \"there's been an almost visceral reaction to how rapidly and sharply the show's quality has dipped, and just how much promise \"Smash\" has thwarted...In other words: It's \"bad.\"\" Fallon cites other critics in demonstrating the general acceptance of this opinion.\n\n\"Smash\" received a number of awards and nominations. In 2012, it was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards, winning one for Choreography.\n\nIn June 2011, \"Smash\" was one of eight honorees in the \"Most Exciting New Series\" category at the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards, voted by journalists who had seen the pilots.\nDue to the already positive buzz surrounding the show, NBC offered early viewings of the pilot on different platforms. From January 15 through January 30, 2012, it was screened on selected flights of American Airlines. From January 16 through February 6, 2012, the full pilot was offered for free on iTunes, Amazon Video, Xbox, and Zune.\n\nThe ratings for the Season 1 premiere were strong but ratings steadily dropped as the series progressed. The pilot episode was watched by 11.44 million viewers and had an 18–49 rating of 3.8/10. It was also the third-highest rated new drama debut of the 2011–2012 television season (behind \"Once Upon a Time\" and \"Touch\") and delivered the biggest 10 p.m. rating of any drama in this television season. The program also had the highest 18–49 rating and viewership for an NBC series in the time slot since November 2008, but ratings declined in subsequent episodes. The fourth episode, aired on February 27, was seen by 6.6 million viewers and received a 2.3/6 rating in the 18–49 age group. However, the show's fifth episode, aired on March 5, saw a 17% increase in ratings. It had an 18–49 rating of 2.7/7 and was seen by 7.76 million viewers. But ratings for the show decreased in later episodes, with the eighth episode dropping to an 18–49 rating of 2.1/5 and viewership going down to 6.4 million viewers. Nonetheless, it has become NBC's #1 drama in adults 18–49 and total viewers. The series was also up 160 percent in adults 18–49 versus NBC's season average in the time period prior to \"Smash\" (with a 2.6 rating vs. a 1.0, \"live plus same day\") and in total viewers, \"Smash\" has improved the time period by 100 percent (7.7 million vs. 3.9 million).\n\nFor Season 2, Smash was scheduled for Tuesdays at 10 at mid-season starting February 5, behind the low-rated The New Normal and several weeks before the new season of \"The Voice\" premiered, and the ratings cratered, with the February 5, 2013 2-hour 2-episode season premiere getting a 1.2 rating in the 18-49 demo. The ratings slid further to 0.9 for the 3rd episode and stayed around that number through the sixth episode, when NBC announced it was moving Smash to Saturdays as of April 6, 2013 and changing up its Tuesday lineup to put its dating reality show \"Ready for Love\" behind \"The Voice\".\n\nOvation has picked up off-network rights to \"Smash\". The first season debuted on July 19, 2013. Season two episodes, scheduled to begin airing in November 2013, were pushed back to January 2014.\n\nThe first season of \"Smash\" was released under the title \"Smash: Season One\" as a widescreen four-disc DVD box set on October 29, 2012 formatted for Region 2.

{"id": "36733028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36733028", "title": "The Lizzie Bennet Diaries", "text": "The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\n\nThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries is an American web series adapted from Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice.\" The story is conveyed in the form of vlogs. It was created by Hank Green and Bernie Su, produced by Jenni Powell and stars Ashley Clements, Mary Kate Wiles, Laura Spencer, Julia Cho and Daniel Vincent Gordh. It premiered on a dedicated YouTube channel on April 9, 2012, and subsequently concluded when the 100th episode was posted on March 28, 2013.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" became the first web series to win an Emmy, for Outstanding Creative Achievement In Interactive Media – Original Interactive Program.\n\nThe story is told in vlog-style by the eponymous character; each episode is between two and eight minutes long. As the show primarily takes place in Lizzie's bedroom, many major events happen offscreen and are retold by Lizzie, with her friend Charlotte and sisters Lydia and Jane adding different perspectives. Occasionally they perform reenactments, using a recurring costume to denote who's who (such as a cap and bowtie for Darcy, a blue plaid shirt for Lizzie, etc.). From Episode 25 onwards, the show begins to visit other sets, allowing them to introduce outside characters, such as Bing Lee, Caroline, and Mr. Collins.\n\nThere are also semi-frequent Q&A videos, once per every ten episodes, in which Lizzie answers questions asked by real viewers, sometimes with the help of another character. In addition to the videos, all the characters also have various social media accounts, through which they interact and reveal portions of the story and perspectives that are not necessarily represented in Lizzie's vlogs.\n\nElizabeth \"Lizzie\" Bennet is a mass communications graduate student still living at home with her parents and two sisters, the sweet, timid Jane and rebellious, party-loving Lydia. With the help of her friend Charlotte Lu, she starts a vlog series for her thesis, discussing the trials and tribulations of her daily life. Wealthy medical student Bing Lee moves into the Netherfield mansion nearby, bringing with him his even richer friend William Darcy. Mrs Bennet quickly begins conspiring to match Bing up with one of the girls, believing \"it's a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\" When the Bennets finally meet the new neighbors at a wedding, Jane and Bing instantly have chemistry, but Darcy's rude and snobbish behaviour causes Lizzie to dislike him.\n\nAt VidCon, Charlotte and Lizzie run into childhood friend Ricky Collins, who now runs online media company \"Collins and Collins,\" with the help of his wealthy patron Ms Catherine de Bourgh. He proposes Lizzie join him as a business partner, but she declines. Charlotte accepts the offer in her place. During this time Lydia starts her own vlog series.\n\nWhile at a bar with Lydia, Lizzie meets swim coach George Wickham and begins seeing him. He reveals Darcy was a family friend who supposedly refused to give him a college fund he was promised, furthering Lizzie's poor opinion of the man. Lizzie quickly moves on when it becomes apparent George isn't that into her. Though their relationship had been going well, Bing suddenly leaves for L.A. without telling Jane. Lizzie assumes Darcy must have poisoned Bing's opinion of her sister.\n\nLizzie decides to spend her last semester shadowing at companies, starting with C&C. There she runs into Darcy, who's been asked to monitor the company by his aunt, Catherine. He confronts Lizzie and reveals he's in love with her. She furiously tells him she could never love him back, because of his rudeness and how he's hurt George and Jane, accidentally revealing the existence of the vlogs in the process.\n\nAfter watching them all, he gives her a letter explaining his side of things. He steered Bing away from Jane because he thought she was only being nice. George was given enough money to pay his full college tuition, but spent it all in one year and then became angry when Darcy refused to give him more.\n\nLydia misinterprets one of Lizzie's 21st birthday presents and storms off to Las Vegas for New Years, and eventually begins dating George Wickham.\n\nLizzie discovers the final company she's to visit, Pemberley Digital, belongs to Darcy. They begin spending time together, now on better terms, but their growing friendship is cut short when Lizzie has to rush home, having been informed there's a website counting down to the release of a sex tape involving George and Lydia. Lizzie and Lydia haven't spoken since Christmas. When Lizzie confronts Lydia, it transpires Lydia didn't know about the website.\n\nJane urges Lizzie to watch all of Lydia's videos, after which Lizzie realizes her younger sister isn't as shallow as she thought and that she doesn't really know Lydia all that well. Lydia herself realizes she's been selfish and breaks down crying in Lizzie's arms and the two sisters reconcile. The day the sex-tape is meant to go live, the website disappears.\n\nDuring her healing journey, Lydia discovers that Darcy has bought the company that owns the website and all rights to the video. Lizzie realizes she loves him, but thinks it's come too late. Bing returns to apologize; he discovered Lizzie's vlogs and saw how much Jane cared about him in them, and the two get back together. Darcy confesses to Lizzie that he still loves her, and the two finally get together. Lizzie decides what to do in her professional life and decides to stop vlogging so she can focus on actually living her life.\n\n\nIn addition to Lizzie's vlogging, other characters also released videos which provided access to alternate perspectives and story elements.\n\nLydia decides to start her own vlog series while Lizzie is away. As its main purpose is to show Lydia's story arc when she can't appear on the main webshow, it's only ever maintained when she and Lizzie are apart, such as when Lizzie is staying at Netherfield or visiting companies. It allows the audience to witness things like Lydia becoming friends with her cousin Mary, running away to LA to see her sister Jane, meeting George Wickham in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, and having a relationship with him. Unlike the main webshow, Lydia's vlogs are not stationary, are all one single continuous take (presumably as Lydia would consider learning how to edit a nerdy thing to do), and rarely ever set in the same place twice.\n\nAfter beginning her job at Collins and Collins, Charlotte gets her younger sister Maria Lu a summer internship, who documents the experience in a series of video diaries.\n\nMr. Collins's company produces instructional videos called \"Better Living with Collins and Collins.\" Currently, there are eight episodes.\n\nHosted by Darcy's younger sister Gigi, Pemberley Digital posts demo videos to unveil and promote their new prototype: \"Domino,\" an application that can automatically edit and upload videos recorded on it. This premise allows the audience to see Darcy and Gigi's efforts to track down George Wickham and get his website taken down, before he releases a sex tape he filmed involving Lydia.\n\nTaking place after the events of \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\", \"Welcome to Sanditon\" follows Gigi Darcy as she spends her summer in Sanditon, CA to run a beta demo of the Pemberley Digital Domino application. The residents of Sanditon have all been invited to join in the test, and discover how this “life-revealing” app performs.\n\nThe mini-series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's unfinished novel, \"Sanditon\". One notable difference from the source material is Gigi replaces the unfinished novel's original heroine, Charlotte Heywood (as \"Sanditon\" is actually not connected to \"Pride and Prejudice\" in any way).\n\nTaking place after the events of \"Welcome to Sanditon\", \"Emma Approved\" focuses on Emma Woodhouse, a confident and proud female entrepreneur who believes she is an excellent matchmaker.\n\nThe series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, \"Emma\". One notable difference from the source material is Caroline Lee replaces Augusta Hawkins as Philip Elton's wife (as \"Emma\" is actually not connected to \"Pride and Prejudice\" in any way).\n\n\"The Epic Adventures of Lydia Bennet\" is a book by Kate Rorick and Rachel Kiley, and audiobook with Mary Kate Wiles performing all the voices, telling Lydia's story from a few months after TLBD for about a year.\n\n\"The Guardian\" called \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" \"the best Austen adaptation around\" at the 200th anniversary of \"Pride and Prejudice\". In 2013 it was announced that \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" will be awarded an award for Original Interactive Program at the Creative Arts Emmys, becoming the first digital series to win an Emmy Award.\n\nIn 2014, \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" YouTube Channel was listed on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at #40.\n\nA DVD set containing every episode of the series and its spinoffs was launched on Kickstarter on March 22, 2013; the initial pledge goal of $60,000 was met within six hours.\n\n"}

It was published by Meteorite Press in 2002. Its subtitle is A Course Catalog for Students of Life.\n\nThe book dryly satirizes the 21st century college experience and the foibles of modern life through hundreds of \"classes\" in 15 \"departments\" of study, including Glamour, Suburban Science, Life Science, and Love. In addition, the book describes fictional scholarships, grants, university buildings, and meaingless complex policies. There are also numerous campus clubs, fraternities and sororities, including Gamma Lambda Ding Dong and Eradicate Ugliness Worldwide. The book's sometimes cynical humor has been described as similar to \"The Onion.\"\n\nThe University's name comes from a psychological condition, psychogenic fugue, in which a person is unable to remember his or her past. The term psychogenic fugue was recategorized as dissociative fugue so now (according to the authors) it is a state of mind that doesn't exist. This attitude reflects many of the mock course offerings you're not likely to encounter in traditional higher education, including:\n\n\nThe book received a number of humor and culture awards.

{"id": "3434780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3434780", "title": "Wild West World", "text": "Wild West World\n\nWild West World was a Wild West theme park in Park City, Kansas that opened on May 5, 2007 and closed on July 9, 2007. It was located on along Interstate 135 near Phil Ruffin's Wichita Greyhound Park, which closed the same year.\n\nThe park was owned, developed, and operated by Thomas and Cheryl Etheredge doing business as Wild West World, LLC and Restoration Farms, Inc. They also owned the Prairie Rose Chuck Wagon entertainment venue in Butler County.\n\nThe announcement for the park appeared in the \"Wichita Eagle\" on December 19, 2004. Groundbreaking began on August 15, 2005. It was billed as the only all-western theme park in the world, and the first major one in Kansas. The claim to being the only all-western one is a mere technicality because Frontier City in Oklahoma City, has one non-western-themed ride (Mindbender) in an otherwise western-themed park. According to the \"Hutchinson News\" the rides were off-the-shelf carnival attractions dressed up in a western facade. \n\nOn July 9, 2007, barely two months after the park opened, the owners filed for bankruptcy and closed it down. They cited lagging attendance and bad weather as the main factors for the decision, but experts also point to an inadequate business plan and a poor theming choice. The Etheredges were also forced to close and sell the Prairie Rose Chuck Wagon. The park was for sale, and the owners publicly stated that they hoped to reopen it in the future. However, no sale materialized. The fixtures, equipment, and materials were auctioned by Bud Palmer Auctions. A few empty buildings are all that remain, but all remaining structures and landscaping were auctioned off November 6, 2010 so that the site could be bulldozed and prepared for future development.\n\nOn April 19, 2009, Thomas Etheredge was arrested on 10 counts of securities fraud related to investments in the park totaling $800,000, much of which was raised from the members of Wichita's Summit Church. The Summit Church split from Immanuel Baptist Church, where Etheredge had also been a member, when pastor Terry Fox resigned, and the new church congregated in the Johnny Western Theater on the park grounds during construction. After the park filed bankruptcy, it was learned that Etheredge had previously served three years in prison for securities fraud in another investment scheme. Etheredge was convicted on February 10, 2010 on 7 counts of securities fraud. He was sentenced on April 2 to five years in prison, and paroled on July 29, 2013.\n\n\n"}
