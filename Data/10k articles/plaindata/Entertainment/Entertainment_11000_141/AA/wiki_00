{"id": "3390263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3390263", "title": "15 Minutes", "text": "15 Minutes\n\n15 Minutes is a 2001 German-American crime action thriller film directed by John Herzfeld and starring Robert De Niro and Edward Burns. Its story revolves around a homicide detective (De Niro) and a fire marshal (Burns) who join forces to apprehend a pair of Eastern European murderers (Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov) videotaping their crimes in order to become rich and famous. The title is a reference to the Andy Warhol quotation, \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\"\n\nEx-convicts Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arrive in the United States to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or in the Czech Republic). Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. At the rundown apartment of their old partner, they are denied their share, so Emil fatally stabs him and his wife as Oleg tapes it with the camera. Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga) witnesses the murders from the bathroom, then escapes before they can kill her as well. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment.\n\nJordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator assigned to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a flamboyant New York City detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity that he is followed around by a reporter from a tabloid TV show, \"Top Story\", hosted by the arrogant Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer). Everywhere he goes, citizens cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw agree to work the case together. While checking out the crowd, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention, but she disappears.\n\nEmil calls an escort service and asks for a \"Czech girl.\" One calling herself Honey (Noelle Evans) arrives, whom he kills but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. He continually films everything, claiming he wants to be the next Frank Capra.\n\nFlemming and Warsaw investigate her murder, visiting the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron), who runs it, tells them that the girl Warsaw described doesn't work for her but rather a hairdresser. She mentions a couple of other guys having just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw arrive at the hair salon just after Emil and Oleg have warned Daphne to keep quiet. Flemming notices someone filming them from across the street. A foot chase begins, Flemming's regular partner Leon Jackson (Avery Brooks) being hit with a glass bottle and his wallet stolen. Emil finds a card with Flemming's name and address. He is jealous of Flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can get away with anything.\n\nOn the night Flemming is to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas (Melina Kanakaredes), Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and bind Flemming to a chair. While Oleg is recording, Emil explains his plan to Flemming: He will kill him and sell the tape to \"Top Story\". After being committed to an insane asylum, he will declare that he is actually sane. Since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting royalties from his books and movies. Fleming attacks them with his chair (while still taped to it), but Emil gets the upper-hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. Emil then suffocates and kills Flemming with a pillow.\n\nThe entire city is in mourning. Emil calls Hawkins to offer a tape of the killing that he is willing to sell to \"Top Story\". Hawkins pays him $1 million for it. Warsaw and the entire police force are furious, unable to believe that the TV show would air it, especially since Hawkins's main reporter is Nicolette.\n\nEmil and Oleg sit in a Planet Hollywood to watch the show in public. Halfway through the broadcast, customers realize that Emil and Oleg are right there with them and panic. Police arrive and arrest Emil, while Oleg escapes. Instead of delivering his suspect to the police station, Warsaw takes Emil to an abandoned warehouse to kill him. Other police arrive just in time and take Emil into custody. Everything goes as planned for Emil, now a celebrity who is pleading insanity. His lawyer agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story. Meanwhile, in hiding, Oleg becomes jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving.\n\nWhile the lawyer is leading Emil away, surrounded by the media, Warsaw provokes an argument, with the \"Top Story\" crew recording the whole thing. Oleg quietly approaches Hawkins and hands him the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time. Hawkins shouts out to Emil about the evidence in his possession. Emil grabs a policeman's gun, shoots Oleg and grabs Nicolette, who is covering the story, threatening to shoot her. Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest to avenge Flemming's murder.\n\nAn officer observes that Oleg is still alive. Hawkins rushes to his side, where Oleg says a final few words about the movie that is still being taped, just before he dies. Hawkins attempts to get a comment from Warsaw, who punches him and walks away as the police all smile with approval.\n\n\nThe film was shot on location in New York City and Los Angeles from May to July 1999. It was originally slated to be released by New Line Cinema in the spring of 2000, with theatrical trailers appearing in late 1999. For reasons unknown, the film was pulled from the spring 2000 schedule and then delayed until the following year, on March 9, 2001.\n\nThe film grossed $24,403,552 domestically in the United States and Canada. It made a further $31,956,428 internationally, for a worldwide total of $56,359,980 against a production budget of $42 million.\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 123 critics, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's consensus reads, \"As critical as it is about sensationalism in the media, \"15 Minutes\" itself indulges in lurid violence, and its satire is too heavy-handed to be effective.\" It currently holds a 34 out of 100 rating on Metacritic, based on 32 critical reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert of \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave it three out of four stars, calling it \"a cynical, savage satire about violence, the media and depravity.\" Ebert felt \"It doesn't have the polish of \"Natural Born Killers\" or the wit of \"Wag the Dog,\" but it's a real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage factory.\"\n\nOn the negative side, Stephen Hunter of the \"Washington Post\" wrote:\n\nOwen Gleibermanof \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated: \"At the movies, we’re now bamboozled into expecting not drama but sensation, and so it’s no surprise that the plot of a movie like \"15 Minutes\" is less an end in itself than an excuse, a jumping-off point for showy, contrived, borderline-exploitation sequences that fail to tie together because they’re not really there to do anything but sell themselves as money-shot thrills. ... \"15 Minutes\" is a glum and sadistic mess.\"\n\n"}

The ad left a lot of people asking for the full song and the name of the artist who had composed the song. Mikey chose to include this track on \"TV Dinners\" since it was a tune people would find familiar, but didn't have any lyrics specifically connecting the song with the original brand.\n\nThe song \"Chase Every Dream\" is about believing in yourself and making your dreams happen regardless of how difficult or crazy they are.

Brown ran the first installment of the Gospel of Mark in \"Yummy Fur\" #4 in 1987, and left \"Matthew\" unfinished after cancelling \"Underwater\" in 1997. Brown had planned to do all four of the canonical gospels, but in 2011 stated that it is unlikely he will finish even Matthew.\n\nBrown was brought up in a strictly Christian Baptist household. Over his career, he has gone back and forth between belief and non-belief in Christianity.\n\nBrown took on his retelling of the Gospels to try to figure out what he really believed.\nBegun in issue #4 of \"Yummy Fur\" in 1987, \"Mark\" started as a more-or-less straight, abridged illustration of the Gospel of Mark. The adaptation became more idiosyncratic as it developed, however. On pages 55 and 56 Brown wove into the story a passage from the Secret Gospel of Mark, a highly contentious and disputed document said to have been written by Clement of Alexandria that Professor Morton Smith claimed to have discovered in 1958.\n\nWhen asked, Brown wrote in \"Yummy Fur\" #15 that he had a large number of sources for his adaptation of \"Mark\". The most books he referred to most frequently were:\nThe Gospel of Matthew started in issue #15 of \"Yummy Fur\" in 1989 and continued through to the premature end of \"Underwater\" in 1997. As of 2011, it has yet to be finished.\n\nBrown's gospels gained a reputation for being \"ingeniously blasphemous\" mainly from his \"Matthew\" retellings. In contrast to \"Mark\"'s Jesus, who is \"serene and always in control,\" in \"Matthew\" he is a scowling, balding figure, and \"there is a more radicalized disbelief and a greater focus on the fleshy and earthly aspects of the story.\" Brown's depiction of the Matthew's version of the Saviour is \"a Jesus that shouts. He's a Jesus that screams\", his face \"haggard and worn, his dark hair matted and stringy\".\n\nThe disciples are depicted as awkward, fearful and full of doubt, who are \"barely able to reconcile the greatness of God with the miseries of their existence\".\n\nAs Brown has pointed out, starting with the full-issue installment of \"Matthew\" in \"Yummy Fur\" #32, he deliberately changed Jesus' third-person references to himself to first-person references in the dialogue.\n\nAmongst the books Brown cited for his \"Matthew\" adaptation are:\n\nMatthew has been on hiatus since 1997, with the story left with Jesus about to enter Jerusalem. Brown had long said he planned on coming back to the story, but in an interview at \"The Comics Journal\" in 2011, he said he would not likely finish it, as his heart was no longer in it.\n\nThe Gospel adaptations have generally been well-accepted by fans and critics. John Bell calls them Brown's most important uncollected work.\n\nTo Francis Hwang of City Pages, \"the paradox of faith is brilliantly, heartbreakingly depicted\" in the \"Gospel of Matthew\".\n\nReligious and biblical elements have found their way into almost all of Brown's work:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2267308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267308", "title": "Coconut shy", "text": "Coconut shy\n\nA coconut shy (or coconut shie) is a traditional game frequently found as a sidestall at funfairs and fêtes. The game consists of throwing wooden balls at a row of coconuts balanced on posts. Typically a player buys three balls and wins each coconut successfully dislodged. In some cases other prizes may be won instead of the coconuts.\n\nThe word \"\" in this context means to toss or throw.\n\nThe origins of the game are unclear, but early references to it appear in the late 1800s. It probably derives from the game of Aunt Sally, with coconuts being seen as an exotic prize in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The National Fairground Archive holds a photograph of a coconut shy dating from 1890. The game is mentioned by H. G. Wells in his book \"The Invisible Man\" in 1897, by E. Nesbit in \"The Story of the Treasure Seekers\" in 1899. and by P.G. Wodehouse in his short story, \"The Purity of the Turf\". The term is first listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 1903.\n\nOne theory suggests the coconut shy may have originated at the annual Pleasure Fair in Kingston upon Thames in 1867. That event took place on the town's Fairfield, not far from a coconut fibre mill on the Hogsmill river. The Surrey Comet reported how \"for the small sum of one penny, you could have three throws with sticks with the prospect of getting a cocoa nut...\". The coconuts could have come from nearby Middle Mill that advertised in the Surrey Comet as \"The Patent Cocoa Fibre Co Ltd the only cocoa nut fibre manufactory in Surrey. All descriptions of mats in cocoa nut fibre made to order wholesale\". Today the only reminder of Kingston's association with coconuts is a pub in Mill Street, which was the principal route between Fairfield and Middle Mill for several centuries. Called \"The Cocoanut\", it is not only spelled the old way but is furthermore the only pub in Britain with that name.\n\nHowever, there is a similar game shown in etchings by Thomas Rowlandson. 1804 \"Sketch on York Race Ground\" shows a carnival game where sticks are thrown at various shaped objects atop posts; the drawing was etched and printed in 1805 titled \"Gaffers at a Country Fair\", and a revised version was printed in 1808 titled \"Doncaster Fair the Industrious Yorkshirebites\" (source: British Museum). An image in the lower left corner of \"A Prospect of Greenwich Fair\", from Manners and Cvstoms of ye Englyshe in 1849, no 13, Getty Images, shows the same game with taller poles and the coconuts shown atop them.\n\nIn the first episode of the second season of \"Midsomer Murders\", a murder takes place at a church charity fair while Detective Sgt. Troy is shown repeatedly attempting (and failing) to win at coconut shy. At one point he finally asks the children running the game, \"Are these things nailed on!?\"\n\nThe game is celebrated in the 1944 music hall song \"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\", best known from recordings and performances by Merv Griffin in the 1950s. More recently the song was used by Disney in the film \"The Lion King\".\n\nIn Rumer Godden's short story \"Candy Floss,\" the titular Candy Floss is a doll who \"assists\" in running a coconut shy along with her owner. The story describes the set-up and management of an early 20th century coconut shy and life on the road as the group follows the fair in a van.\n\nOn \"The Mighty Boosh\", Howard Moon makes a joke to Vince's coconut friend, Precious, about being \"coconut shy\", in the episode entitled \"The Nightmare of Milky Joe\".\n\nIn the song he wrote as part of the \"Submarine\" OST, \"Hiding Tonight\", Alex Turner talks about playing the coconut shy, winning a prize even if it's rigged, and not knowing when to stop\n\nIn an episode of the first series of \"Downton Abbey\", Lady Mary Crawley and Matthew Crawley meet at a coconut shy at the village fair. In the eighth episode of the final season, while discussing whether the unconscious Thomas would mind if his wet clothes were removed, Mrs Hughes remarks, \"He's past minding if we put him in a shy and threw coconuts.\"\n\nThe 1981 Squeeze song \"Vanity Fair\" contains the lyrics \"Coconut shy but vanity fair\".\n\nIn the episode \"Coconut Shy\" of \"Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,\" Mr. Bean plays a coconut shy at a funfair, but, after failing to win, he sneaks inside and finds it is a cheat.\n\nIn German-speaking countries the game of \"Dosenwerfen\" is popular for school parties as well as in professional stalls at fairgrounds. It involves throwing balls at stacks of empty tin cans. In France, a similar game known as \"Chamboule-Tout\" is frequently found at fun fairs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15542466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15542466", "title": "Display contrast", "text": "Display contrast\n\nContrast in visual perception is the difference in appearance of two or more parts of a field seen simultaneously or successively (hence: brightness contrast, lightness contrast, color contrast, simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, etc.). \n\nContrast in physics is a quantity intended to correlate with the perceived brightness contrast, usually defined by one of a number of formulae (see below) which involve e.g. the luminances of the stimuli considered, for example: ΔL/L near the luminance threshold (known as Weber contrast), or L/L for much higher luminances.\n\nA contrast can also be due to differences of chromaticity specified by colorimetric characteristics (e.g. the color difference ΔE CIE 1976 UCS).\n\nVisual information is always contained in some kind of visual contrast, thus contrast is an essential performance feature of electronic visual displays.\n\nThe contrast of electronic visual displays depends on the electrical driving (analog or digital input signal), on the ambient illumination and on the direction of observation (i.e. viewing direction). \n\nThe \"luminance contrast\" is the ratio between the higher luminance, L, and the lower luminance, L, that define the feature to be detected. This ratio, often called contrast ratio, CR, (actually being a luminance ratio), is often used for high luminances and for specification of the contrast of electronic visual display devices. The luminance contrast (ratio), CR, is a dimensionless number, often indicated by adding \":1\" to the value of the quotient (e.g. CR = 900:1).\n\nformula_1 with 1 ≤ CR ≤ formula_2\n\nA \"contrast ratio\" of CR = 1 means no contrast.\n\nThe contrast can also be specified by the contrast modulation (or Michelson contrast), C, defined as:\n\nformula_3 with 0 ≤ C ≤ 1.\n\nC = 0 means no contrast.\n\nAnother contrast definition sometimes found in the electronic displays field, K, is:\n\nformula_4 with 0 ≤ K ≤ 1.\n\nK = 0 means no contrast, the maximum possible contrast, K equals one.\n\nTwo parts of a visual field can be of equal luminance, but their color (chromaticity) is different. Such a \"color contrast\" can be described by a distance in a suitable chromaticity system (e.g. CIE 1976 UCS, CIELAB, CIELUV). \n\nA metric for \"color contrast\" often used in the electronic displays field is the color difference ΔE*uv or ΔE*ab.\n\nDuring measurement of the luminance values used for evaluation of the contrast, the active area of the display screen is often completely set to one of the optical states for which the contrast is to be determined, e.g. completely white (R=G=B=100%) and completely black (R=G=B=0%) and the luminance is measured one after the other (time sequential).\n\nThis way of proceeding is suitable only when the display device does not exhibit \"loading effects\", which means that the luminance of the test pattern is varying with the size of the test pattern. Such loading effects can be found in CRT-displays and in PDPs. A small test pattern (e.g. 4% window pattern) displayed on these devices can have significantly higher luminance than the corresponding full-screen pattern because the supply current may be limited by special electronic circuits.\n\nAny two test patterns that are not completely identical can be used to evaluate a contrast between them. When one test pattern comprises the completely bright state (full-white, R=G=B=100%) and the other one the completely dark state (full-black, R=G=B=0%) the resulting contrast is called \"full-swing contrast\". This contrast is the highest (maximum) contrast the display can achieve. If no test pattern is specified in a data sheet together with a contrast statement, it will most probably refer to the \"full-swing contrast\".\n\nThe standard procedure for contrast evaluation is as follows:\n\n1 apply the first test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,\n\n2 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the first test pattern and record the result,\n\n3 apply the second test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,\n\n4 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the second test pattern and record the result,\n\n5 calculate the resulting \"static contrast\" for the two test patterns using one of the metrics listed above (CR,C or K).\n\nWhen luminance and/or chromaticity are measured before the optical response has settled to a stable steady state, some kind of \"transient contrast\" has been measured instead of the \"static contrast\".\n\nWhen the image content is changing rapidly, e.g. during the display of video or movie content, the optical state of the display may not reach the intended stable steady state because of slow response and thus the apparent contrast is reduced if compared to the static contrast.\n\nThis is a technique for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens.\nLCD-screens comprise a backlight unit which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel in front of it which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased. Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some digital signal processing required for implementation of the \"dynamic contrast control technique\" in a way that is pleasing to the human visual system (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced). \n\nThe contrast within individual frames (\"simultaneous contrast\") can be increased when the backlight can be locally dimmed. This can be achieved with backlight units that are realized with arrays of LEDs. High-dynamic-range (HDR) LCDs are using that technique in order to realize (static) contrast values in the range of CR > 100.000.\n\nIn order to measure the highest contrast possible, the dark state of the display under test must not be corrupted by light from the surroundings, since even small increments ΔL in the denominator of the ratio (L + ΔL) / (L + ΔL) effect a considerable reduction of that quotient. This is the reason why most contrast ratios used for advertising purposes are measured under dark-room conditions (illuminance E ≤ 1 lx).\n\nAll emissive electronic displays (e.g. CRTs, PDPs) theoretically do not emit light in the black state (R=G=B=0%) and thus, under darkroom conditions with no ambient light reflected from the display surface into the light measuring device, the luminance of the black state is zero and thus the contrast becomes infinity.\n\nWhen these display-screens are used outside a completely dark room, e.g. in the living room (illuminance approx. 100 lx) or in an office situation (illuminance 300 lx minimum), ambient light is reflected from the display surface, adding to the luminance of the dark state and thus reducing the contrast considerably.\n\nA quite novel TV-screen realized with OLED technology is specified with a \"dark-room contrast\" ratio CR = 1.000.000 (one million). In a realistic application situation with 100 lx illuminance the contrast ratio goes down to ~350, with 300 lx it is reduced to ~120.\n\nThe contrast that can be experienced or measured in the presence of ambient illumination is shortly called \"ambient contrast\". A special kind of \"ambient contrast\" is the contrast under outdoor illumination conditions when the illuminance can be very intense (up to 100.000 lx). The contrast apparent under such conditions is called \"daylight contrast\".\n\nSince always the dark areas of a display are corrupted by reflected light, reasonable \"ambient contrast\" values can only be maintained when the display is provided with efficient measures to reduce reflections by anti reflection and/or anti-glare coatings.\n\nWhen a test pattern is displayed that contains areas with different luminance and/or chromaticity (e.g. a checkerboard pattern), and an observer sees the different areas simultaneously, the apparent contrast is called \"concurrent contrast\" (the term \"simultaneous contrast\" is already taken for a different effect). Contrast values obtained from two subsequently displayed full-screen patterns may be different from the values evaluated from a checkerboard pattern with the same optical states. That discrepancy may be due to non-ideal properties of the display-screen (e.g. crosstalk, halation, etc.) and/or due to straylight problems in the light measuring device.\n\nWhen a contrast is established between two optical states that are perceived or measured one after the other, this contrast is called \"successive contrast\". The contrast between two full-screen patterns (full-screen contrast) always is a \"successive contrast\".\n\n\nDepending on the nature of the display under test (direct-view or projection) the contrast is evaluated as a quotient of luminance values (direct-view) or as a quotient of illuminance values (projection displays) if the properties of the projection screen is separated from that of the projector. In the latter case, a checkerboard pattern with full-white and full-black rectangles is projected and the illuminance is measured at the center of the rectangles. The standard ANSI IT7.215-1992 defines test-patterns and measurement locations, and a way to obtain the luminous flux from illuminance measurements, it does not define however a quantity named \"ANSI lumen\".\n\nIf the reflective properties of the projection screen (usually depending on direction) are included in the measurement, the luminance reflected from the centers of the rectangles has to be measured for a (set of) specific directions of observation.\n\nLuminance, contrast and chromaticity of LCD-screens is usually varying with the direction of observation (i.e. viewing direction). The variation of electro-optical characteristics with viewing direction can be measured sequentially by mechanical scanning of the viewing cone (\"gonioscopic\" approach) or by simultaneous measurements based on conoscopy.\n\n\n"}

The rules do not allow elbow strikes to the head. Each of the three rounds (there are no extra rounds) last five minutes, and intermissions between each round are one minute long.\n\nThe president of the promotion Orsat Zovko stated that the FFC was considering additional innovations in terms of rules to bring the promotion closer to the standards required by public TV networks that broadcast the event live during primetime hours. Specifically, he said that in the future the FFC could exclude techniques that may be considered excessively violent by the mainstream audience, such as soccer kicks and stomps.\n\nThe FFC is currently using six weight classes for its MMA fights and five weight classes for its kickboxing fights. Non-title fights have a one-pound leniency.\n\n<nowiki>:</nowiki>00"}

In 1578, Mark Scaliot produced a lock and chain that were attached to a flea. The first recorded flea circus dates back to the early 1820s, when an Italian impresario called Louis Bertolotto advertised an “extraordinary exhibition of industrious fleas” on Regent Street, London. Some flea circuses persisted in very small venues in the United States as late as the 1960s. The flea circus at Belle Vue Zoological Gardens, Manchester, England, was still operating in 1970. At least one genuine flea circus still performs (at the annual Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany) and Svensons in the UK occasionally use real fleas, but most flea circuses are a sideline of magicians and clowns, and use electrical or mechanical effects instead of real fleas.\n\nFleas typically live only for a few months and are not trained. Fleas are observed to see if they have a predisposition for jumping or walking. Once sorted, they are harnessed by carefully wrapping a thin gold wire around their neck. Once in the harness, the fleas usually stay in it for life. The harnesses are attached to the props and the strong legs of the flea allow them to move objects significantly larger than themselves. Jumping fleas are used for kicking small lightweight balls. They are carefully given a ball; when they try to jump away (which is not possible because of the harness), they shoot the ball instead. Running fleas can pull small carts and vehicles or rotate a Ferris wheel.\n\nThere are historical reports of fleas glued to the base of the flea circus enclosure. Miniature musical instruments were then glued to the flea performers and the enclosure was heated. The fleas fought to escape, giving the impression of playing instruments.\n\nSome flea circuses may appear to use real fleas, but in fact do not. A variety of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical devices have been used to augment exhibits. In some cases, these mechanisms are responsible for all of the \"acts\", with loose fleas in the exhibit maintaining the illusion. These circuses are known as \"Humbug\" flea circuses. Michael Bentine gave a mechanical flea circus a regular slot on his television show, \"It's a Square World\" in the 1960s. In much the same way that viewers know that a woman will not actually be cut in half, the magician's showmanship allows viewers to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the show.\n\nCurrent flea circuses:\n\nIn the 1990s, María Fernanda Cardoso toured the world with her installation art flea circus.\n\nProfessor Heckler's flea circus (in residence at Hubert's Dime Museum in Times Square, New York until 1957) can be seen in the background of the films \"The Thief\" and \"Easy Rider\". L. Bertolotto ran a famous flea circus in Regent Street, London.\n\nFlea circuses have featured in cartoons, films, television shows, music, and novels.\n\n\n"}

David Kubiak, Mander summarizes his book:\n\nWell, one of the points of the book is that you really can't summarize complex information. And that television is a medium of summary or reductionism – it reduces everything to slogans. And that's one criticism of it, that it requires everything to be packaged and reduced and announced in a slogan-type form.\n\nBut let me say this: the book is not really four arguments, it's really hundreds of arguments broken down into four categories. And the categories have to do with a variety of effects that are not normally discussed. Most criticisms of television have to do with the television program content. People say if there is less violence on television or less sexism on television, or less this or less that, television would be better. If there were more programs about this or more programs about that, then we'd have \"good television\".\n\nMy own feeling is that that is true – that it's very important to improve the program content – but that television has effects, very important effects, aside from the content, and they may be more important. They organize society in a certain way. They give power to a very small number of people to speak into the brains of everyone else in the system night after night after night with images that make people turn out in a certain kind of way. It affects the psychology of people who watch. It increases the passivity of people who watch. It changes family relationships. It changes understandings of nature. It flattens perception so that information, which you need a fair amount of complexity to understand it as you would get from reading, this information is flattened down to a very reduced form on television. And the medium has inherent qualities which cause it to be that way.\n\nAnd the book is really about television considered from a holistic point of view, from a biological point of view – perceptual, environmental, political, social, experiential, as well as the concrete problems of whether a program is silly or not. But other people deal with that very well. My job was to talk about television from many of these other dimensions which are not usually discussed.\n\n\n"}

A few of them can also be found in the Güímar Valley (that is in Arafo, Candelaria and Güímar municipalities).\n\nThe word “bochinche”, mainly used in Gran Canaria, and its variant “guachinche”, more typical of Tenerife, is used in the Canarian dialect of Spanish to refer to a popular establishment where local wine and typical foods are served. According to the historical-etymological dictionary of Canarian dialect, by Marcial Morera, it derived from the Latin American Spanish word “bochinche” (derived from “buche” – “sip, gulp”), which means 'a poor tavern'. The other version claims that the word \"guachinche\" comes from the English expression \"I'm watching you!\", apparently used by the British buyers to indicate that they were ready to try the local products and the Canarian farmers understood the phrase as \"Is there a guachinche?\", that is if there was a party nearby (or a stand or shop) set up to taste the wine before finally making the purchase.\n\nLong before the Canarian wines received their first Appellation of Origin (this was the region of Tacoronte-Acentejo), the guachinches were mounted in a room or a garage in the family house, where the wife of the winemaker offered some tapas made in the family kitchen to accompany the home-made wine.\n\nThe guachinche's clients don’t look for an exquisite service or commodities, they value above all the unique local wines and a familiar and traditional cuisine: rich homemade stews, such as chickpeas with smoked meats (garbanzas), rabbit in spicy salmorejo sause, pork ribs with potatoes and corn on the cob, stuffed aubergines (bubangos), potatoes with mojo sause, carne fiesta (fried marinated pork and potatoes), carne de cabra (goat’s meat), churros de pescado (local battered fish), etc. For dessert you can taste the baked milk flan or a typical local dessert called bienmesabe, or you can also enjoy the locally grown fruits like mango, bananas, etc.\nIn essence, the guachinches have emerged as an offshoot of wine production activity, and not as proper restaurants or food establishments. For this reason, they have never been regulated and guachinche owners didn’t pay any taxes for this activity, although over the time many winemakers and their families became restaurateurs on a professional basis. So with the time along with legal guachinches plenty of clandestine establishments started to appear which served cheap wine from Latin America as their own and actually functioned as restaurants but without the obligations to comply with the fiscal and health requirements applicable to restaurants.\nIn recent years, legal restaurants and bars have complained heavily about the unfair competition from guachinches, since those attracted customers by ridiculously low prices and a wide range of dishes on the menu. So in 2013, the Canarian government has issued a decree 83/2013 regulating the guachinche activity as a complementary tourist activity aimed at a preservation of local traditions and the natural rural environment and introducing a number of rules that limit the food and beverages that can be served at a guachinche and define its operating conditions. These rules include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39248664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39248664", "title": "Heracles' Bow", "text": "Heracles' Bow\n\nHeracles’ Bow is a collection of ten essays, written by James Boyd White in 1985, that examine forensic rhetoric as it creates community, as an example of what White calls constitutive rhetoric. White supported the Law and Literature Movement. This movement was in contradiction to two other movements of the 1970/80s: Law and economics and Critical Legal Studies (CLS), holding that a scientific view of law left little room to examine the rhetoric of written and spoken law itself.\n\nIn \"Heracles' Bow: Persuasion and Community in Philoctetes\", through an analysis of the ancient Greek play Philoctetes, distinguishes between two methods of persuasion, dolos (deceitful persuasion) and peitho (genuine statements made for the purpose of forming community). White compares using rhetoric on another person as a means-to-an-end against viewing the person as an end-in-itself. He relates this to the teaching of law through a discussion of methods that an attorney should use in the art of persuading others.\n\nIn, \"Rhetoric and Law: The Arts of Cultural and Communal Life\", White compares two definitions of law: his own, which is that law is a branch of rhetoric, and the traditional view of law as institutional authority. He outlines three elements specific and necessary to legal rhetoric: first, that lawyers need to speak the language of their audience, or that law is culture-specific; second, that law is always a creative performance; and third, that legal rhetoric contains an ethical identity, or ethos.\n\n\"The Study of Law as an Intellectual Activity\", originally a lecture given to a class of first-year law students, outlines how learning law is not simply memorizing a set of rules. White claims that, in learning law, it is imperative that students first identify their own ethos to become effective practitioners.\n\nIn \"The Invisible Discourse of the Law\", originally a lecture given to educators on writing, White argues that legal language is difficult to understand because the law is generalized and non-specific. These characteristics mean that legal language is always subject to the interpretation of the reader, thus creating a rhetorical situation.\n\nWhite contends in \"Reading Law and Reading Literature\" that law is a language and a lawyer must also operate as a literary critic. He explains how law is its own form of language, which means that it is subject to open interpretation. The language of the law creates a legal culture just as spoken languages have cultures associated with them. A lawyer must use good judgment in interpreting the law just as individuals use good judgment in interpreting how to speak to one another.\n\nIn \"The Judicial Opinion and the Poem\" White examines how reading poems and cases during his legal training enforced his belief that the practice of law is an art, and one can use this training to discover Truth.\n\nIn the next essay, White reasons that it is impossible for a narrative to exclude the author’s values, no matter how factual it may be. Using Gibbons’ History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as an example, he illustrates how the form, syntax, and presentation of any writing necessarily shape the way a reader receives the facts. As a result, the opinion of the reader is shaped by the opinion of the writer.\n\n\"Telling Stories in the Law and Ordinary Life\" explores how legal stories take root in the stories told by laypeople in social situations. He argues that it is impossible to tell a story in the language of the law without relying on a non-legal situation.\n\nDoes criminal law make sense as a system of meaning? White seeks to answer that question through an examination of the purpose of criminal law, which he concludes to be placing blame. He examines the rhetoric of criminal law in order to identify its true audience.\n\nIn the last essay, White constructs his own Socratic dialogue to determine whether the ancient Platonian argument of rhetoric vs. dialectic can be applied to modern law. He argues that today’s attorneys are a modern day version of Plato's \"Gorgias\" and concludes with the importance of maintaining ethics in the practice of law.\n\nDavid Cole argues that White’s view and the CLS are not that different; both are built on ideology. Cole criticizes White for relying too much on law as an end in itself, and failing to address the practical application of tangible, codified law. Meanwhile, Weisberg’s main criticism of \"Heracles’ Bow\" is that White’s explanation remains too abstract. He contends that White does not express any knowledge of the actual law or the application thereof. Weisburg argues that White relies on law too much as a function of pure rhetoric, and that he ignores the scientific aspect of the discipline. This is a common criticism of the Law and Literature Movement. Victoria Kahn claims that White’s view of the law ignores the relationship of law and inequality. She criticizes his work for its lack of explaining how the rhetoric of law is applied to different genders, races, and classes in different ways. She argues that seeing law simply as a rhetorical situation ignores the real-life power struggles within the application of law to society.\n"}

Hexbug was inspired by BEAM robotics, and uses many elements of it. Originally released in the US through RadioShack, it is now sold in most major retail stores. The original was based on 6-legged arthropods, but now comes in several different varieties. The name \"Hexbug\", however, has more to do with the shape of the packaging it is sold in than the number of legs it has.\n\nThis Hexbug is an autonomous toy bug that reacts to loud sounds and pressure on the antennae and scurries around the room. It was the first Hexbug made and is classified by the NATO Phonetic Alphabet rather than color; Alpha (orange), Bravo (green), Charlie (blue), Delta (yellow), and Echo (red). There are 5 different original hexbugs and all are different shapes. Released in 2007 at RadioShack.\n\nThe Spider is a remote-controlled hexapod robot. The movement is remote controlled, capable of changing direction by its head rotation. The head determines the direction by pressing the leg joints into moving forward as the head pointed. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) Button cell batteries.\n\nThe Battle Spider is a variant of the Spider. Equipped with LED light and sensor, it can engage in laser-tag battle. Unlike the standard Spider and the Battle Spider 2.0, the first edition of Battle Spider can only move forward. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) batteries.\n\nThe Battle Spider 2.0 is a revised edition of the Battle Spider, it is capable of walking backward like the standard Spider. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) batteries.\n\nThe Scarab is a fast moving mechanical robot made to resemble a beetle with six legs. The movement is autonomous and random, reacting to obstacles with a rapid change in direction. The Scarab will automatically get back onto its feet if it is upside-down. Internal gears and motors are visible through its translucent shell. It is powered by three replaceable LR44 (AG13) batteries.\nThe Tarantula is an eight-legged remote-controlled robot resembling the Strandbeast. It is capable of all direction movements as well as rotation.\n\nA development of the Nano v2 (2013), released in 2017. These bugs, like their v2 and original counterparts are also a bristlebot. A major improvement is that they have five spines on their back compared to the three spines on the v2. Other improvements include less oscillation. With less oscillation, they can move faster. Their spines gives them the ability to climb vertically between two suitably spaced plates or tube walls. As the back now have five spines, they are very stable on their backs compared to the v2 and self-righting on their backs is now very stable.\n\nA variety of clear plastic tube habitats are offered with them. These range from a simple vertical tube to demonstrate climbing, through to multi 'bot habitats with multiple horizontal arenas linked by curved climbing tubes in clear plastic. A variety of additional construction set tube parts are available, including twisted tubes and funnels also black holes.\nA line of miniature robotic fish, released in 2013. The built in sensors contained in the robots detect liquid, which activates the caudal fin. Available as a fish, jellyfish, and seahorse.\n\nA line of robot construction set for building robots, the VEX Robotics kit allows the player to build their own contraptions as well as up-scaled versions of the Hexbug products. It is named after the VEX Robotics learning platform developed by Innovation First, which was prominently utilized for STEM education.\n\nThe crab was the second bot manufactured for HEXBUG. It could only move from side to side and reacted to obstacles and sound. It was most likely removed due to a common defect with its back legs.

Originally announced in 1994, \"Hyper Force\" was showcased in E3 1995 but it was not released until 2000, a year after the system was declared as an open platform by Hasbro Interactive in .\n\n\"Hyper Force\" received mixed to positive reception from critics since its release, with praise towards the graphics, controls and gameplay, while the music, sound effects and technical shortcomings of the game were regarded as negative points.\n\n\"Hyper Force\" is a 2D, side-scrolling, action-adventure platform game which takes places on the fictional planet Terran where the player controls a lone soldier from the Interstellar Special Forces across four areas, each having a set of six levels to travel through on a mission to destroy the megacorporation Trans Con, who plans to launch a attack against Earth. Progress is manually kept by the cartridge's EEPROM by saving on either of the three slots available by pausing the game at any time and pressing Option on the controller and they are allowed to resume their last game by pressing Option at the title screen and choosing either saved slot to continue. The game cartridge also keeps high-scores and settings made by the player as well.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, the player fights against a variety of enemies and robots, who randomly drop power-ups, health, tech items that increase the score and money to pick up after being destroyed, with the later being used at the Interstellar Special Forces shop after finishing a level to buy new weapons and their respective upgrades, health recharge and lives, though items are also scattered in the level to pick up as well. After finishing six levels, a story cutscene is shown to progress the story. In various levels there hidden locations that contains items and other important elements introduced later in the game. Introduced in the first level are ropes that the player can hang on and traverse through the level while also shoot enemies when hanging, but players can also hang off from them by pressing down or jump from them by pressing both the jump and the shoot buttons at the same time. \n\nAlso scattered through the level are obstacles such as spikes and traps, with more obstacles such as destructible blocks and colored barriers that obstruct the pathway of the player, with the later becoming more important when other colored barriers are introduced and these can be opened by finding their respective colored switch. When shooting at the enemies on the ground, players can also aim their shots by crouching or looking up. Players can also collide with enemies but they do not receive points by doing so and if they die, they are sent back to the start of the level but item pick ups are not respawned and the game is over once all lives are lost.\n\nIn the year 2099 before the start of a new century, mankind has managed to expand into the stars through development of devices that allows interstellar travel possible and at a short time, with technological breaktroughs creating new levels of medical care and automation but megacorporations have unlimited desires to expand their operations in outer space, with Trans Con being the most ruthless by decimating multiple planets and harnessing resources to break the restrains of the Terran High Command. Not wanting to lose corporative support, politicians chosed to ignore the situation, which became more delicated and as a result they turn to the Interstellar Special Forces to erradicate Trans Con and their empire, by destroying their multiple bases of operations and affiliated cops, guardians and soldiers without involvement of the population by sending a lone soldier from the special forces, who faces the possibility of being disowned by the government if he fails in completing the task.\n\nWhen the lone soldier destroys Trans Con's mining bases and crosses through Varmox City, he receives a message from ISF that the megacorporation has created a supersoldier after arriving at their rocket garden fortress and by the time he arrives at their secret laboratories, receives another message that Trans Con is preparing to start a clone war against Earth unless he stops their scientists in the area. Although the lone soldier succeeds in stopping the scientists on the laboratories, one of the supersoldiers named the Trans Con Warrior manages to escape. After destroying it, the soldier activates a self-destruct button that annihilates Trans Con alongside their empire with the lone soldier escaping from their homeworld, returning to Earth and he is honored for his work.\n\n\"Hyper Force\" was first previewed in 1994 on French magazine \"CD Consoles\", featuring a different graphical artstyle from the final release. Their preview article also mentioned Visual Impact working on a second project for the Jaguar, which was inspired by \"Doom\". It was primarily developed in Belgium. Internal testing reports in regards to the game from Atari Corporation indicated that many elements of the game were criticized. The game was showcased in a playable state at E3 1995, where it was slated to be published by Computer West, who published both \"Cannon Fodder\" and \"Pinball Fantasies\" for the Jaguar in 1995 respectively but \"Hyper Force\" went unreleased due to the discontinuation of the Jaguar for not performing well both commercially and critically, until Songbird Productions picked the rights and licensed the game from Visual Impact to release it, however, since the developer did not provided the source code of the game, it was released as it was received by the publisher. The game was released almost a year after the system was declared as an open platform by Hasbro Interactive in 1999.\n\n\"Hyper Force\" received mixed to positive reviews since its release. Eric Mylonas of \"GameFan\" gave a positive outlook to the game and compared it with \"Contra\", praising the graphics and difficulty while criticizing the color choices in the game and limited sprite animations, remarking that \"What here is good but a little more animation would have been nice\".\n\nDavid Sherwin of \"The Atari Times\" gave positive remarks to the gameplay, controls and graphics but criticized the music, sound effects, the process of saving the game and bugs in regards to restoring the game. He summarized by saying \"\"Hyper Force\" doesn't bring very many new things to modern console gaming and, with its somewhat dated side-scrolling blaster action and limited graphic environments, is definitely showing its age. That being said, \"Hyper Force\" is a polished and professional effort that will provide hours of entertainment for most Jaguar gamers\".\n\n"}

The film was inspired due to Chan's early love for musicals, with such films as \"The Sound of Music\".\n\n"}

Multiple users can connect to the HAVA from any Internet connection simultaneously with channel-changing capabilities and full operation of the video source. The devices allow a PC to operate as a personal video recorder with pause, fast forward and rewind functions. The HAVA device also works as a TV tuner for Windows Media Center-enabled PCs without being directly connected to a video source.\n\nMonsoon Multimedia was created in 2004 by the founders of Dazzle and Emuzed. HAVA's main engineering and development operations are based in Tomsk, Russia and New Delhi, India. In 1996, the founder of Monsoon Multimedia, Prabhat Jain, founded Dazzle, where he developed the PC hardware and software products to compress video based on MPEG standards. In 2000, he founded Emuzed, where Prabhat Jain created a TiVo-type product for the PC based on Microsoft's Media Center Edition PC operating system.\n\nIn November 2008, Prabhat Jain announced the appointment of consumer technology industry veteran William Loesch as CEO of the company. Loesch brought 30 years of experience in the computer software and hardware industries, primarily in the consumer digital video sector. Loesch is not currently listed on the company website as an active member of the team (11/2/2011).\n\nWhat was claimed to be the first US lawsuit over a GPL violation concerned use of BusyBox in an embedded device. The lawsuit, case 07-CV-8205 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York was filed on 20 September 2007 by the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) on behalf of the Busybox developers against Monsoon Multimedia Inc., after BusyBox code was discovered in a firmware upgrade and attempts to contact the company had apparently failed. The case was settled with release of the Monsoon version of the source and payment of an undisclosed amount of money to Andersen and Landley.\n\nIn January 2013 Sling Media filed suit alleging infringement of five patents, against both Belkin International and Monsoon Multimedia in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Belkin part of the suit was settled in May 2013, and in December 2013 the United States International Trade Commission found that Monsoon was indeed violating the patents. The commission issued cease-and-desist orders and banned the importation of Monsoon Multimedia products into the United States.\n\nMonsoon Multimedia's line of place-shifting devices enable multiple networked PCs within the home to simultaneously view live TV or DVR content. The number of PCs and mobile device that can connected to a single Monsoon device are limited only by the bandwidth of the network or broadband connection. Only one remote client at a time can view a place-shifted program, but the remote device can be watching while multiple home PCs watch the same program.\n\nReleased in August 2010, the Vulkano adds an electronic program guide to its PC software, as well as support for YouTube video streaming on TV with an included remote control, as well as future support for Netflix and other streaming video services. Future Google TV web-browsing support is planned for 2011. There is also a Vulkano model that includes a 500 GB external hard drive for DVR recordings, which can be accessed from mobile devices. The Vulkano does not support Windows Media Center integration as the previous HAVA models did, but includes UPnP technology for photo, music, and video streaming from PCs and mobile devices. In November 2010, Monsoon added a Vulkano Platinum model, which does not include any storage drive, program guide, or recording capabilities.\n\nAnnounced at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, the Vulkano Flow is a mobile accessory. When connected to any set-top box the Vulkano Flow can stream TV content to mobile devices inside or outside of the home. It will soon be available for $99.\n\nAlso announced at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, the Vulkano Blast integrates DVR, web video, placeshifting, Universal Plug and Play streaming UPnP, Mobile Video Recording and 160 GB internal storage.

The HAVA Platinum takes a 720p or 1080i signal and converts it to standard-definition resolution before streaming it over a network or over the Internet. This device also adds PC software that stores streamed content, enabling the PC or laptop to pause, rewind and fast-forward streamed content. The stored program can also be burned to DVD.\n\nControls HD digital cable, satellite, or DVR programs wirelessly on any WiFi-enabled PC or mobile phone.

Streams wirelessly, DVD quality video direct from the TV source to multiple Windows Vista or Media Center PCs simultaneously.\n\nThe HAVA Titanium HD adds Wi-Fi to make a wireless connection to a Wi-Fi-equipped broadband router or modem, and it features two USB ports. One is for plugging in an external USB HDD drive that can then be used as a DVR. The other USB port is for the included Wi-Fi 802.11g adapter, which sits in a cradle and is connected to a 3-foot USB cable so the adapter can be located in a spot with good reception.\n\nThe HAVA devices come with a HAVA Player software interface that is downloaded onto the user's PC or mobile phone. This interface enables the user to send remote control commands from their PC to their TV source. This is done through the included wide range of virtual remote control designs. The Vulkano device includes an electronic program guide (EPG) enabled software player.\n\nWith the release of the Vulkano in August 2010, Monsoon introduced free Vulkano players for the iPad and iPhone, which only support WiFi, and not yet 3G connections. Monsoon also released an Android and BlackBerry player, and plans a future release for Symbian.\n\nMonsoon Multimedia announced support for Windows Mobile in May 2007 enabling users to connect to the HAVA and view video content from video sources such as live TV from a smartphone, pocket PC or PDA.\n\nIn April 2008, Monsoon Media announced HAVA Player support for the Nokia N800, N810 and N810 WiMax Internet Tablets enabling users to connect to a HAVA device to view and control video content from video sources such as live TV from a Nokia Internet Tablet.\n\nIn May 2008, Monsoon Multimedia announced the HAVA Player for S60, HAVA support for Symbian S60 3rd edition mobile phones. The HAVA Player for S60 enables users to connect to a HAVA device to view and control their home TV from S60 mobile phones.\n\nIn September 2009, the HAVA Player was released to the Apple iPhone and the iPod Touch. The app is free, but is not 3G-enabled.\n\nIn 2018 the company disappeared; because by design all the players were using the company's central server to locate devices for remote viewing, when the server went down all Hava and Vulkano devices have become useless.\nThe company left all device owners disappointed with no alternative solution: could have been a direct connection based on IP address without a central server like Slingbox player option.\nIt is unknown if some knowledgeable users or anyone else was able to come up with a way to use these devices again, as the forum (hosted on the company's website) is gone too.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "235225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235225", "title": "Movie star", "text": "Movie star\n\nA movie star (also known as a film star and cinema star) is an actor who is famous for their starring, or leading, roles in motion pictures. The term is used for actors who are marketable stars and whose names are used to promote movies, for example in trailers and posters.\n\nIn the early days of silent movies, the names of the actors and actresses appearing in them were not publicized or credited because producers feared this would result in demands for higher salaries. However, audience curiosity soon undermined this policy. By 1909, actresses such as Florence Lawrence and Mary Pickford were already widely recognized, although the public remained unaware of their names. Lawrence was referred to as the “Biograph Girl” because she worked for D. W. Griffith's Biograph Studios, while Pickford was \"Little Mary.\" In 1910, Lawrence switched to the Independent Moving Pictures Company, began appearing under her own name, and was hailed as \"America's foremost moving picture star\" in IMP literature. Pickford began appearing under her own name in 1911.\n\nThe Independent Moving Pictures Company promoted their \"picture personalities\", including Florence Lawrence and King Baggot, by giving them billing, credits and a marquee. Promotion in advertising led to the release of stories about these personalities to newspapers and fan magazines as part of a strategy to build brand loyalty for their company's actors and films. By the 1920s, Hollywood film company promoters had developed a \"massive industrial enterprise\" that \"...peddled a new intangible—fame.\" Early Hollywood studios tightly controlled who was a movie star, as only they had the ability to place stars' names above the title; according to film historian Jeanine Basinger, this was done \"only for economic reasons\".\n\nHollywood \"image makers\" and promotional agents planted rumors, selectively released real or fictitious biographical information to the press, and used other gimmicks to create glamorous personas for actors. Publicists thus \"created\" the \"enduring images\" and public perceptions of screen legends such as Judy Garland, Rock Hudson, Marilyn Monroe, and Grace Kelly. The development of this \"star system\" made fame \"something that could be fabricated purposely, by the masters of the new 'machinery of glory'.\" However, regardless of how \"...strenuously the star and their media handlers and press agents may ... try to 'monitor' and 'shape' it, the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process.\" According to Madow, \"fame is a 'relational' phenomenon, something that is conferred by others. A person can, within the limits of his natural talents, make himself strong or swift or learned. But he cannot, in this same sense, make himself famous, any more than he can make himself loved.\"\n\nMadow goes on to point out \"fame is often conferred or withheld, just as love is, for reasons and on grounds other than 'merit'.\" According to Sofia Johansson the \"canonical texts on stardom\" include articles by Boorstin (1971), Alberoni (1972) and Dyer (1979) that examined the \"representations of stars and on aspects of the Hollywood star system\". Johansson writes that \"more recent analyses within media and cultural studies (e.g. Gamson 1994; Marshall 1997; Giles 2000; Turner, Marshall and Bonner 2000; Rojek 2001; Turner 2004) have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive, contemporary, 'celebrity culture'.\" In the analysis of the celebrity culture, \"fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process, connected to widespread economic, political, technological and cultural developments.\"\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, entertainment companies began using stars for a range of publicity tactics including press releases, movie junkets, and community activities. These promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research, to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures. In some cases, publicity agents may create “provocative advertisements” or make an outrageous public statement to trigger public controversy and thereby generate \"free\" news coverage. Movie studios employed performers under long-term contracts. They developed a star system as a means of promoting and selling their movies. \"Star vehicles\" were filmed to display the particular talents and appeal of the most popular movie stars of the studio.\n\nMovie stars in other regions too have their own star value. For instance, in Asian film industries, many movies often run on the weight of the star's crowd pulling power more than any other intrinsic aspect of film making.\n\nA number of Chinese film actors have become some of the most popular movie stars in Eastern Asia, and several are also well known in the Western world. They include Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Stephen Chow, Sammo Hung, Gong Li, Ziyi Zhang, Maggie Cheung, and the late Bruce Lee.\n\nThe Indian film industry, of which one is commonly known as Bollywood, has its own set of rules in this aspect. There are often superstars in this region who command premium pay commensurate with their box office appeal. Male Indian actors who are among the most popular movie stars in India and Southern Asia include Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Naseeruddin Shah, Raj Babbar, Mohanlal, Amol Palekar,Aamir Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Hrithik Roshan, Arjun Rampal, Govinda, Shahid Kapoor and Anil Kapoor. Actresses include Sridevi, Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Kajol, Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai, Katrina Kaif, Kareena Kapoor, Karisma Kapoor, Manisha Koirala, Tabu, Priyanka Chopra, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukerji, Deepika Padukone, Hema Malini, Madhubala, Meena Kumari, Zeenat Aman, Reena Roy, Vyjayanthimala, and Rekha.\n\nSome mainstream Indian movie stars, like the Khans of Bollywood (Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Dilip Kumar), Raj Kapoor, Nargis, Mithun Chakraborty, Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai gained international fame across Asia and Eastern Europe. For example, Bollywood films were popular in the Soviet Union, more so than Hollywood films and occasionally even domestic Soviet films. Indian actors like Raj Kapoor, Nargis and Mithun Chakroborty were household names in the Soviet Union, with films such as \"Awaara\" (1951) and \"Disco Dancer\" (1982) drawing more than 60 million viewers in the country. The Hindi film actors Raj Kapoor and Aamir Khan also became very popular in China, with films such as \"Awaara\", \"3 Idiots\" (2009), and \"Dangal\" (2016), one of the top 20 highest-grossing films in China.\n\nThe film industry of the Malay Archipelago (also known as Nusantara) consists primarily of film industries in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore. Over the past century, these four cinemas have collaborated on a number of projects. A number of actors from this region have become some of the most sought-after movie stars in southeast Asia, commonly in Malay-speaking countries.\n\nActors such as P. Ramlee, Rano Karno, Rima Melati, Deddy Mizwar, Jins Shamsuddin, Eman Manan, Alex Komang, Christine Hakim, Fauziah Ahmad Daud, Nora Aunor, Joseph Estrada, Jose Padilla, Nordin Ahmad, Saadiah, Fernando Poe Jr., Roy Marten, and Yusof Haslam are considered movie stars of the 20th century, some of them having acted in all four countries.\n\nOther, more recent movie stars include Romalis Syafril, Erra Fazira, Rosyam Nor, Shaheizy Sam and Maya Karin, from Malaysia; Nicholas Saputra, Vino G. Bastian, Dian Sastrowardoyo, Tora Sudiro, and Iko Uwais, from Indonesia; Claudine Baretto, Piolo Pascual, John Lloyd Cruz, Jericho Rosales, Aga Muhlach, Kristine Hermosa, Dingdong Dantes, and Bea Alonzo, from the Philippines; and a few from Singapore, such as Aaron Aziz and Adi Putra.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Now TV \"White\" Box is no longer officially available as it is succeeded by the Now TV \"Black\" Box. All of the Now TV boxes and the Now TV Streaming Stick provide access to live television channel streams and video on demand content courtesy of the available Entertainment, Sky Cinema, Sky Sports, and Kids Passes. There is limited access to the Roku Channel Store in which an approved list of application software can be downloaded such as BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, Sky Sports Box Office and the Sky Store. Users were able to side-load apps via developer mode, but this was disabled by Sky in March 2017.\n\nIn July 2013 Now TV launched the Now TV \"white\" box (based on the 2011 Roku LT) allowing consumers when connected to Wi-Fi to stream Now TV content to their television via an analogue audio/video output or an HDMI connection capable of outputting up to 720p video resolution.\n\nIn August 2015 Now TV launched the Now TV \"black\" Box (based on the 2015 Roku 2). It offers the same user interface as the original Now TV \"white\" box, but with updated technical specifications such as a higher performance CPU, an Ethernet port (in addition to Wi-Fi), a USB port (not currently functional), a microSD card slot (not currently functional), the capability of outputting up to 1080p video resolution via an HDMI connection.. It does not have an analogue audio/video output connection like its \"white\" box predecessor. The Now TV \"black\" Box is currently the only Now TV device available in Ireland and Italy.\n\nIn July 2016 Now TV launched the first generation Now TV Smart Box (based on the 2015 Roku 4) providing the same access as previous boxes, but with updated technical specifications, such as a higher performance CPU and an internal DVB-T/DVB-T2 digital terrestrial television tuner giving the ability to access Freeview and Freeview HD television channels that can be paused and rewound up to 30 minutes.

The Now TV \"Smart Stick\" has a feature called \"Hotel connect\" which allows users to connect to Wi-Fi networks that require signing in to the Wi-Fi network through a web browser.\n\nIn September 2018 Now TV launched the second generation Now TV Smart Box (Based around the 2016 Roku Premiere+). The second generation Smart box is much smaller in size compared to it's original predecessor mainly due to the removal of the internal DVB-T/DVB-T2 digital terrestrial television tuner that gave it the ability to access Freeview and Freeview HD television channels. The new Smart box features the same Wi-Fi Direct remote control with voice search that is included with the Now TV Smart Stick. The new Smart Box is capable of outputting at up to 2160p (4K) at 60fps.\n\nNow TV offers four \"channel packages\" in the UK, three channel packages in Ireland, and four channel packages in Italy, all providing live streaming and video on demand. \n\nThe subscriptions in both the UK and Ireland are branded as \"Now TV Passes\": Entertainment Pass, Sky Cinema Pass, Sky Sports Pass, Sky Sports Mobile Pass, a Kids Pass, and a hayu Pass (The \"White\" Now TV box does not support the hayu pass).

{"id": "21146909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21146909", "title": "Oceania (board game)", "text": "Oceania (board game)\n\nOceania is a board game by Klaus Teuber, published by Mayfair Games. It is a simpler version of Entdecker, and is played with one or two players. The solitaire version's objective is completely different from the two player version's.\n\nEach player, in turn, places a wooden ship on one of the starting spaces or on a tile already placed. At the beginning of the game, of course, the only spaces available are starting spaces. These spaces appear on three sides of the board; the fourth side is a continuation of the ocean frame, but the ship cannot start there. Then, the player picks one tile from the top of the pile. Each tile has four sides, with water or land on each side. All of the possible combinations that have water on at least one side are included, with varying frequencies, in the pile. (The water, land, water, land tiles show two island fragments, one on each side with a strait going down the middle, not the other way around.) Tiles placed into the board must match water to water and land to land. If a tile fits, the player must place it. Each player has pieces in one of the two colors (white or black) depicting one, two, or three scouts. Players may place one scout piece on the tile that was placed if it has land on it (if it is the WLWL piece, the scout piece may be placed on either side). If a tile does not fit, it is placed in front of the player. Later in the game, the player may choose to give up one scout piece from the supply in order to place one of these pieces on the board. If an empty space is completely surrounded, it is filled with reserve tiles of the correct variety, which are next to the board. If a number of spaces are surrounded with only land, they are filled with tiles from the reserve pile that have land on all four sides.\n\nThe game can end in three ways:\n\nOn each island where one player has a majority of the scouts, that player receives points equal to the number of the tiles in the island. If the two island fragments of a WLWL tile are joined by other pieces that go around them, the tile still only counts as one tile. If the players are tied, nobody scores points. Tiles in front of a player because they could not be placed are each worth -2 points if the player has not given up a scout piece to place them. The winner is the player with the most points.\n\nThe scouts are not used in this game. The player repeatedly places the ship on the board and puts tiles out. A tile that does not fit is placed in a discard pile. The score is the sum of the squares of the number of tiles in each island, minus twenty points for each space that is not filled at the end of the game.\n\nThis version of the game can be played online at PlayCatan, even though it is not strictly a Catan game. This is because of its relationship to the Catan series (also created by Klaus Teuber and published by Mayfair Games), and because its parent game, Entdecker, can be viewed as the discovery of the island of Catan, as the publisher says at this link: .\n"}
{"id": "34826435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34826435", "title": "Parody in popular music", "text": "Parody in popular music\n\nThe original use of the term \"parody\" in music referred to re-use for wholly serious purposes of existing music. In popular music that sense of \"parody\" is still applicable to the use of folk music in the serious songs of such writers as Bob Dylan, but in general, \"parody\" in popular music refers to the humorous distortion of musical ideas or lyrics or general style of music.\n\nBefore the 20th century popular song frequently borrowed hymn tunes and other church music and substituted secular words. \"John Brown's Body\", the marching song of the American Civil War, was based on the tune of an earlier camp-meeting and revival hymn, and was later fitted with the words \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord\", by Julia Ward Howe. This practice continued into the First World War I, with many of the soldiers' songs being based on hymn tunes (for instance \"When this lousy war is over\", to the tune of \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\" and \"We are Fred Karno's Army\", to the tune of \"The Church's One Foundation\"). \nFolk song has often been written to existing tunes, or slight modifications of them. This is another very old (and usually non-humorous) kind of musical parody that still continues. For instance, Bob Dylan took the tune of the old slave song \"No more auction block for me\" as the basis for \"Blowin' in the Wind\".\n\nThe emerging form of Jazz music frequently recycled themes from the staider \"white\" popular music of the time, as well as producing occasional parodies (usually called \"travesties\") of well known classical themes.\n\nIn the 1940s, Spike Jones and his \"City Slickers\" parodied popular music in their own unique way, not by changing lyrics, but adding wild sound effects and comedic stylings to formerly staid old songs such as \"Cocktails for Two\" and \"April Showers.\" Beginning in 1949, Homer and Jethro did country music arrangements of popular songs, with parody lyrics, such as \"Hart Brake Motel\" (for \"Heartbreak Hotel\") and \"The Battle of Kookamonga\" (after Johnny Horton's \"The Battle of New Orleans\").\n\nThe comedy pianist Victor Borge coined some of his signature bits on Bing Crosby's radio show during the 1940s, and later popularized them on TV on Dean Martin's show. Borge parodied classical composition styles by taking a very well known tune like \"Happy Birthday to You\" and playing it in the styles of Mozart, Brahms, Wagner, Beethoven and others. He would also parody two compositions simultaneously by finding common melody notes and using them for transitioning one composition into another, the most famous example being \"Moonlight Sonata\" transitioning into \"Night and Day\" (or a minor version of \"Happy Birthday to You\").\n\nThe 1957 Broadway musical \"Jamaica\" parodied the then very fashionable commercial variety of Calypso music. A musical using heavy parody was the 1959 show \"Little Mary Sunshine\", which poked fun at old-fashioned operetta.\n\nStan Freberg created parodies of popular songs in the 1950s and 1960s, mocking the musical conventions of the day, such as Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\", in which the vocalist rips his jeans from too much hip-swiveling and drowns in reverberative sound effects at the end. Another major parodist was Allan Sherman, who began making hit records with parodies such as the now-classic \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)\" (to the tune of Amilcare Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\" from the opera La Gioconda) and \"When I Was A Lad\" (after Gilbert & Sullivan's \"Ruler of the Queen's Navee\" from \"HMS Pinafore\").\n\nBandleader and pianist Paul Weston and his wife, singer Jo Stafford, created the musical duo, \"Jonathan and Darlene Edwards\", as a parody of bad cabaret acts. Initially it began as a private party joke but they recorded several albums and one, \"Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris\", won a Grammy Award in 1961 for best comedy record.\n\nThe self-described \"piano-wielding fugitive from Harvard\", Tom Lehrer; and Victor Borge, originally from Denmark, who switched from a concert piano career to comedy, have also created parodies of classical piano pieces and opera.\n\nIn 1965, musical satirist Peter Schickele created P. D. Q. Bach, a supposedly newly discovered member of the Bach family, whose creative output parodies musicological scholarship, the conventions of Baroque and classical music, as well as introducing elements of slapstick comedy. Schickele continues to tour and record under the pseudonym P. D. Q. Bach to the present day.\n\nRay Stevens became a country star in the 1970s and 1980s with a few serious songs (such as \"Everything is Beautiful\"), more novelty songs (such as \"The Streak\", \"Shriner's Convention\", and \"Mississippi Squirrel Revival\") and many parody songs, such as the adult-contemporary send-up \"I Need Your Help Barry Manilow\", and the Beach Boys parody \"Surfin USSR\".\n\nThe Barron Knights became famous for their parodies of pop songs in the 1970s.\n\nThe song \"A Little Green Rosetta\" from the Frank Zappa album \"Joe's Garage\" lampoons Steve Gadd's status as one of the highest-paid session drummers in popular music. The music parodies a number of styles including reggae and lounge jazz.\n\nA successful parodist is \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, now in his fourth decade of writing song parodies. He got his start sending tapes to be played by Barret Hansen, AKA Dr. Demento, on his nationally syndicated radio show. Seattle, WA-based disc jockey and longtime parodist Bob Rivers records parodies of hit songs from a variety of genres and periods satirizing current events. Dabbling in topical parodies is Buffalo, New York-based humorist Mark Russell, who appears several times a year on PBS television. The New York, NY performing troupe Forbidden Broadway annually parodies the Great White Way's most popular current musicals and their songs on stage and recordings.\n\nIn the science fiction fan community filk music thrives as a source of both parodies and original music, as it has since at least the 1930s.\n\nTom Lehrer song \"The Elements\" adapts a tune from Gilbert & Sullivan to the periodic table, and more recently he turned \"That's Entertainment\" into a précis on his real vocation, \"That's Mathematics\" (carefully altering the melody to avoid litigation).\n\nRay Charles wrote his hit song \"I Got a Woman\" as a paraphrase on Gospel songs, which provoked anger from the Christian community. The 1992 film \"Sister Act\" had Whoopi Goldberg's character do the opposite with Mary Wells' \"My Guy\", rewriting its lyrics (and subsequently re-titling it as \"My God\") to accommodate the nun choir.\n\nRichard Cheese and The Lounge Kittens produce parodies not in the traditional sense of someone like Yankovic, but rather derive their humor from exactly the opposite means. While traditional parody puts new lyrics to largely unchanged music, they keep the lyrics intact but alter the musical style, thus altering the intent of the song. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of very familiar lyrics from popular rap, metal, and rock songs (particularly containing profane, violent, or sexually explicit lyrics) with their exceedingly clean, \"white bread\", campy, lounge style. Me First and the Gimme Gimmes does likewise in a complete opposite manner: they perform hard, sped-up punk renditions of folk songs, soft rock, showtunes, R&B, and other genres not usually associated with punk. Yankovic has also ventured into this practice; all but two of his albums feature medleys of either classic rock or then-current hit songs done as fast polkas. Ray Stevens has had hits of Glenn Miller's \"In the Mood\" done in the style of clucking chickens, and a honky-tonk or bluegrass version of Michael Jackson's \"Bad\".\n\nMusical parody in recent years has included the 2005 musical Altar Boyz, which parodies both Christian rock and the \"boy band\" style of pop, the Christian parody band Apologetix, who have targeted popular music from the 1950s to the present, and the Capitol Steps, a group of current and former U.S. Congress staff members based in Washington, DC who focus on politics and other public figures. Mac Sabbath, a tribute band who perform Black Sabbath songs with rewritten lyrics satirizing the fast food industry in McDonald's-themed costumes and stage theatrics, went viral in late 2014, bringing the band notable press coverage and enabling them to tour internationally.\n\nIn 2009 a group from London, The Midnight Beast, gained fame after posting on YouTube their parody of the song \"Tik Tok\" by Ke$ha. Since then, the group has parodied other pop songs. Another major Parody Music Artist called Rucka Rucka Ali also made a Parody of \"Tik Tok\" by Ke$ha called \"Go Cops\", Rucka Rucka Alis \"Go Cops\" song has accumulated over 11 million hits on YouTube (Not including Re-Uploads). A popular theme of parodies on YouTube today is video games, with the most common ones being Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto and (the most common) Minecraft.\n\nAs it has become easier to publish songs quickly, online increasing volumes of topical, comic parodies have begun to emerge. In the UK these have tended to be similar in nature to the type of news inspired songs which have regularly appeared on BBC Radio 4 comedy The Now Show since 1998. The Amateur Transplants, one group which produce these, came to public attention in 2005 with a song “London Underground”, satirizing the then strikes, and parodying the Jam song \"Going Underground\" London writing team, Kathryn and Nick, have also produced a wide range of satirical songs to raise awareness for their other writing. In December 2013, Bitcoin Examiner listed their song “Coin Fever” —a wry take on the Bitcoin hype—to the tune of \"Goldfinger\", as its top Bitcoin song of the year.\n\n\"Mad Magazine\" provoked an early legal backlash against parody when in 1961 the magazine published a songbook in which various topical ditties such as \"The Last Time I Saw Maris\", \"Albert Einstein\", and \"There's No Business Like No Business\" were included (in poem format; with a parenthetical phrase after each title, stating \"Sung to the tune of...\"). Several music publishers joined in a lawsuit taking the magazine to court. The matter eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to review the decision by a lower court dismissing the suit against \"Mad.\"\n\nMusical parody was briefly threatened in the mid-1990s when a case (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.) was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court by country music Roy Acuff's music publishing company against the lead singer of the rap music group 2 Live Crew for recording a lewd version of one of Acuff's songs without his permission. However, the ruling was in favor of the rappers, finding that the fair use doctrine extended to parody as protected derivative work.\n\nOn October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the FOX show \"Family Guy\" of infringing its copyright on the song \"When You Wish upon a Star\", through a parody song entitled \"I Need a Jew\" appearing in the episode \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\". Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a \"thinly veiled\" copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, MacFarlane, and Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages. Bourne argued that \"I Need a Jew\" uses the copyrighted melody of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\" On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that \"Family Guy\" did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.\n\n\n"}

It starred Kay Aldridge as Nyoka the Jungle Girl, a character who first appeared in the Edgar Rice Burroughs-inspired serial \"Jungle Girl\".\n\nNyoka, with help from Larry Grayson, attempts to discover the Golden Tablets of Hippocrates. The tablets contain the medical knowledge of the Ancients — not to mention being buried along with gold and other treasure. Also hunting for the tablets are Queen Vultura (\"Ruler of the Arabs\") and Cassib.\n\n\n\n\"Perils of Nyoka\" was budgeted at $169,296 although the final negative cost was $175,010 (a $5,714, or 3.4%, overspend). It was the most expensive Republic serial of 1942. It was filmed between March 20 and May 2, 1942, with the outdoor action sequences shot primarily at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif. The serial's production number was 1197. The success of the original serial \"Jungle Girl\" prompted the sequel, but the studio did not want to pay licensing fees to Burroughs again, so it avoided any repetition of the term \"Jungle Girl,\" to which he had the rights. Instead, \"Nyoka,\" the name of the main character in the first film, was placed in the title of the sequel, because that name was an original creation of Republic's writers, not of Burroughs.\n\n\"Perils of Nyoka\"'s official release date is 27 June 1942, although this is actually the date the seventh chapter was made available to film exchanges. The serial was re-released on 2 April 1952, under the new title \"Nyoka and the Tigermen\", between the first runs of \"Radar Men from the Moon\" and \"Zombies of the Stratosphere\".\n\nA version for French territories was titled \"KING -KONG CHEZ LES ARABES / KING KONG bij de ARABIEN\n\n\"Perils of Nyoka\" was one of twenty-six Republic serials re-released as a film on television in 1966. The title of the film was changed to \"Nyoka and the Lost Secrets of Hippocrates\". This version was cut down to 100-minutes in length.\n\nJim Harmon and Donald F. Glut write that this is probably the best Jungle serial ever made and that it \"lavished in increased production values.\" Cline notes that \"Perils of Nyoka\" stands out in the memories of the original serial audiences despite the strong competition of 1942.\n\n"}
{"id": "1038024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1038024", "title": "Pirate decryption", "text": "Pirate decryption\n\nPirate decryption most often refers to the decryption, or decoding, of pay TV or pay radio signals without permission from the original broadcaster. The term \"pirate\" in this case is used in the sense of copyright infringement and has little or nothing to do with sea piracy, nor with pirate radio, which involved the operation of a small broadcast radio station without lawfully obtaining a license to transmit. The MPAA and other groups which lobby in favour of intellectual property (specifically copyright and trademark) regulations have labelled such decryption as \"signal theft\" even though there is no direct tangible loss on the part of the original broadcaster, arguing that losing out on a potential chance to profit from a consumer's subscription fees counts as a loss of actual profit.\n\nThe concept of pay TV involves a broadcaster deliberately transmitting signals in a non-standard, scrambled or encrypted format in order to charge viewers a subscription fee for the use of a special decoder needed to receive the scrambled broadcast signal. \n\nEarly pay TV broadcasts in countries such as the United States used standard over-the-air transmitters; many restrictions applied as anti-siphoning laws were enacted to prevent broadcasters of scrambled signals from engaging in activities to harm the development of standard free-to-air commercial broadcasting. Scrambled signals were limited to large communities which already had a certain minimum number of unencrypted broadcast stations, relegated to certain frequencies. Restrictions were placed on access of pay TV broadcasters to content such as recent feature films in order to give free TV broadcasters a chance to air these programs before they were siphoned away by pay channels.\n\nUnder these conditions, the pay TV concept was very slow to become commercially viable; most television and radio broadcasts remained in-the-clear and were funded by commercial advertising, individual and corporate donations to educational broadcasters, direct funding by governments or license fees charged to the owners of receiving apparatus (the BBC in the UK, for example).\n\nPay TV only began to become common after the widespread installation of cable television systems in the 1970s and 1980s; early premium channels were most often movie broadcasters such as the US-based Home Box Office and Cinemax, both currently owned by Time Warner. Signals were obtained for distribution by cable companies using C-band satellite dish antennae of up to ten feet in diameter; the first satellite signals were originally unencrypted as extremely few individual end-users could afford the large and expensive satellite receiving apparatus.\n\nAs satellite dishes became smaller and more affordable, most satellite signal providers adopted various forms of encryption in order to limit reception to certain groups (such as hotels, cable companies, or paid subscribers) or to specific political regions. Early encryption attempts such as Videocipher II were common targets for pirate decryption as dismayed viewers saw large amounts of formerly-unencrypted programming vanishing. Nowadays some free-to-air satellite content in the USA still remains, but many of the channels still in the clear are ethnic channels, local over-the-air TV stations, international broadcasters, religious programming, backfeeds of network programming destined to local TV stations or signals uplinked from mobile satellite trucks to provide live news and sports coverage.\n\nSpecialty channels and premium movie channels are most often encrypted; in most countries, broadcasts containing explicit pornography must always be encrypted to prevent reception by those who wish children not to be exposed to this sort of \"adult content.\"\n\nInitial attempts to encrypt broadcast signals were based on analogue techniques of questionable security, the most common being one or a combination of techniques such as:\n\nThese systems were designed to provide decoders to cable operators at low cost; a serious tradeoff was made in security. Some analogue decoders were addressable so that cable companies could turn channels on or off remotely, but this only gave the cable companies control of their own descramblers — valuable if needed to deactivate a stolen cable company decoder but useless against hardware designed by signal pirates.\n\nThe first encryption methods used for big-dish satellite systems used a hybrid approach; analogue video and digital encrypted audio. This approach was somewhat more secure, but not completely free of problems due to piracy of video signals.\n\nDirect broadcast satellites and digital cable services, because of their digital format, are free to use more robust security measures such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES) or the RSA and IDEA digital encryption standards. When first introduced, digital DBS broadcasts were touted as being secure enough to put an end to piracy once and for all. Often these claims would be made in press releases.\n\nThe enthusiasm was short-lived. In theory the system was an ideal solution, but some corners had been cut in the initial implementations in the rush to launch the service. The first US DirecTV smart cards were based on the BSkyB VideoCrypt card known as the Sky 09 card. The Sky 09 card had been introduced in 1994 as a replacement for the compromised Sky 07 card. It, the Sky 09 card, had been totally compromised in Europe at the time (1995). The countermeasure employed by NDS Group, the designers of the VideoCrypt system was to issue a new smartcard (known as the Sky 10 card) that included an ASIC in addition to the card's microcontroller. This innovation made it harder for pirates to manufacture pirate VideoCrypt cards. Previously, the program in the Sky card's microcontroller could be rewritten for other microcontrollers without too much difficulty. The addition of an ASIC took the battle between the system designers and pirates to another level and it bought BSkyB at least six months of almost piracy-free broadcasting before the pirate Sky 10 cards appeared on the market in 1996. Initial pirate Sky 10 cards had an implementation of this ASIC but once supplies ran out, pirates resorted to extracting the ASICs from deactivated Sky cards and reusing them.\n\nThe first US DirecTV \"F\" card did not contain an ASIC and it was quickly compromised. Pirate DirecTV cards based on microcontrollers that were often ironically more secure than that used in the official card became a major problem for DirecTV. Similar errors had been made by the developers of the UK's terrestrial digital Xtraview Encryption System, which provided no encryption and relied on hiding channels from listings.\n\nThe DirecTV \"F\" card was replaced with the \"H\" card, which contained an application-specific integrated circuit to handle decryption. However, due to similarities between the \"H\" and other existing cards, it became apparent that while the signal could not be received without the card and its ASIC, the card itself was vulnerable to tampering by reprogramming it to add channel tiers or additional programming, opening TV channels to the prying eyes of the pirates.\n\nTwo more card swaps would be necessary before the piracy headaches at DirecTV would finally go away; a number of other providers are also in the middle of swapping out all of their subscribers' smartcards due to compromised encryption methods or technology.\n\nA number of vulnerabilities exist even with digital encryption:\n\n\nOn May 15, 2008, a jury in the Echostar vs NDS civil lawsuit (8:2003cv00950) awarded Echostar just over US$1500 in damages; Echostar originally sought $1 billion in damages from NDS. However, a jury was not convinced of the allegations Echostar had made against NDS and awarded damages only for the factual claims that were proven and for which the jury believed an award should be given in accordance with the laws of the United States.\n\n\nIn some cases, fraudulent cloning has been used to assign identical serial numbers to multiple receivers or cards; subscribe (or unsubscribe) one receiver and the same programming changes appear on all of the others. Various techniques have also been used to provide write protection for memory on the smartcards or receivers to make deactivation or sabotage of tampered cards by signal providers more difficult.\n\nSystems based on removable smartcards do facilitate the implementation of renewable security, where compromised systems can be repaired by sending new and redesigned cards to legitimate subscribers, but they also make the task of replacing smartcards with tampered cards or inserting devices between card and receiver easier for pirates. In some European systems, the conditional-access module (CAM) which serves as a standardized interface between smartcard and DVB receiver has also been targeted for tampering or replaced by third-party hardware.\n\nImprovements in hardware and system design can be used to significantly reduce the risks of any encryption system being compromised, but many systems once thought secure have been proven vulnerable to sufficiently sophisticated and malicious attackers.\n\nTwo-way communication has also been used by designers of proprietary digital cable TV equipment in order to make tampering more difficult or easier to detect. A scheme involving the use of a high-pass filter on the line to prevent two-way communication has been widely promoted by some unscrupulous businesses as a means of disabling communication of billing information for pay-per-view programming but this device is effectively worthless as a cable operator remains free to unsubscribe a digital set-top box if two-way communication has been lost. As a device intended to pass signals in one direction only, the line filters offer nothing that couldn't be done (with the same results) by an inexpensive signal booster - a simple one-way RF amplifier already widely available cheaply and readily for other purposes. Also, many such boxes will disallow access to pay-per-view content after a set number of programs are watched before the box can transmit this data to the headend, further reducing the usefulness of such a filter.\n\nSome of the terminology used to describe various devices, programs and techniques dealing with Pay-TV piracy is named for the particular hacks. The \"Season\" interface for example is named after the Season7 hack on Sky TV which allowed a PC to emulate a legitimate Sky-TV smartcard. The Season7 referred to the seventh and final season of which was then showing on Sky One. The \"Phoenix\" hack was named after the mythical bird which can reanimate itself. The hack itself reactivated smartcards that had been switched off by the providers.\n\nSome of the terminology used on Internet discussion sites to describe the various devices, programs and techniques used in dealing with video piracy is strange, non-standard, or specific to one system. The terms are often no different from the brand names used by legitimate products and serve the same function.\n\n\n\nSmart card piracy involves the unauthorised use of conditional-access smart cards, in order to gain, and potentially provide to others, unauthorised access to pay-TV or even private media broadcasts. Smart card piracy generally occurs after a breach of security in the smart card, exploited by computer hackers in order to gain complete access to the card's encryption system.\n\nOnce access has been gained to the smart card's encryption system, the hacker can perform changes to the card's internal information, which in turn tricks the conditional-access system into believing that it has been allowed access, by the legitimate card provider, to other television channels using the same encryption system. In some cases, the channels do not even have to be from the same television provider, since many providers use similar encryption systems, or use cards which have the capacity to store information for decoding those channels also. The information on how to hack the card is normally held within small, underground groups, to which public access is not possible. Instead, the hacking groups may release their hack in several forms. One such way is simply to release the encryption algorithm and key. Another common release method is by releasing a computer program which can be used by the smart card user to reprogram their card. Once complete, the now illegally modified smart card is known as a \"MOSC.\" (Modified Original Smart Card). A third such method, more common in recent times, is to sell the information gained on the encryption to a third party, who will then release their own smart card, such as the K3 card. This third party, for legal reasons, will then use a fourth party to release encrypted files, which then allow the card to decode encrypted content.\n\nAlong with modifying original cards, it is possible to use the information provided by the smart card to create an encryption emulator. This, in turn, can be programmed into a cable or satellite receiver's internal software, and offered for download on the internet as a firmware upgrade. This allows access to the encrypted channels by those who do not even own a smart card. In recent times, many underground forum websites dedicated to the hobby of satellite piracy and encryption emulated Free To Air (FTA) receivers have been set up, giving up-to-date information on satellite and cable piracy, including making available firmware downloads for receivers, and very detailed encryption system information available to the public.\n\nUpon gaining the knowledge that their system has been compromised, the smart card providers often have several counter measure systems against unauthorised viewing, which can be put in place over the air, in most cases causing virtually no disruption to legitimate viewers. The simplest form of counter measure is a key change. This simply halts viewing for those viewing without authorisation temporarily, since the new key can easily be accessed in the hacked card, and implemented. There are often other more complicated procedures which update a part of the smart card in order to make it inaccessible. These procedures can also, however, be hacked, once again allowing access. This leads to a game of \"cat and mouse\" between the smart card provider, and the hackers. This, after several stages of progression, can leave the smart card provider in a situation where they no longer have any further counter measures to implement. This leaves them in a situation where they must perform a card and encryption change with all legitimate viewers, in order to eliminate the viewing of the service without permission, at least for the foreseeable future.\n\nSuch has been the success of implementing new smart card systems, that another form of smart card piracy has grown in popularity. This method is called card sharing, which works by making available the smart card decoding information in real time to other users, via a computer network. Police monitoring of unsecured card sharing networks has led to prosecutions.\n\nVirtually every common encryption system is publicly known to have been compromised. These include Viaccess, Nagravision, SECA Mediaguard and Conax. The MediaCipher system, owned by Motorola, along with Scientific Atlanta's PowerKEY system, are the only digital TV encryption systems which have not publicly been compromised. This is largely thanks to there being no PC card conditional-access modules (CAMs) available for either encryption system.\n\nDespite the unauthorised decryption of media being illegal in many countries, smart card piracy is a crime which is very rarely punished, due to it being virtually undetectable, particularly in the case of satellite viewing. Laws in many countries do not clearly specify whether the decryption of foreign media services is illegal or not. This has caused much confusion in places such as Europe, where the proximity of many countries, coupled with the large land mass covered by satellite beams, allows signal access to many different providers. These providers are reluctant to pursue criminal charges against many viewers as they live in different countries. There have, however, been several high-profile prosecution cases in the USA, where satellite dealers have been taken to court resulting in large fines or jail time.\n\nAn Internet key sharing scheme consists of one smart card with a valid, paid subscription which is located on an Internet server. It generates a stream of real-time decryption keys which are broadcast over the Internet to remotely located satellite receivers. Limiting factors in the number of remotely located satellite receivers are the network latency and the period between the updated keys and the ability of the card client's receiver to use the decrypted key stream.\n\nEach receiver is configured in an identical manner, a clone receiving the same television signal from a satellite and, from the internet server, the same decryption keys to unlock that signal. As the server must have individually subscribed smart cards for each channel to be viewed, its continued operation tends to be costly and may require multiple subscriptions under different names and addresses. There is also a risk that as the number of card clients on the card sharing network grows, it will attract the attention of the satellite TV service provider and law enforcement agencies and the monitoring of IP addresses associated with this card sharing network may identify individual users and server operators who then become targets for legal action by the satellite TV service provider or by legal authorities.\n\nKey sharing schemes are typically used where replacement of compromised smart card systems (such as the deprecation of Nagra 1/2 in favour of Nagra 3) has made other pirate decryption methods non-functional.\n\nIn February 2014, an episode of BBC's \"Inside Out\" disclosed that the complete Sky TV package could be obtained from black-market sources for as little as £10 per month through Internet key sharing, Swansea and Cardiff were highlighted with significant activity in pubs using cracked boxes to show Premier League football.\n\nIn some countries such as Canada and many Caribbean nations (except for the Dominican Republic), the black market in satellite TV piracy is closely tied to the gray market activity of using direct broadcast satellite signals to watch broadcasts intended for one country in some other, adjacent country. Many smaller countries have no domestic DBS operations and therefore few or no legal restrictions on the use of decoders which capture foreign signals.\n\nThe refusal of most providers to knowingly issue subscriptions outside their home country leads to a situation where pirate decryption is perceived as being one of the few ways to obtain certain programming. If there is no domestic provider for a channel, a grey market (subscribed using another address) or black market (pirate) system is prerequisite to receive many specific ethnic, sport or premium movie services.\n\nPirate or grey-market reception also provides viewers a means to bypass local blackout restrictions on sporting events and to access hard-core pornography where some content is not otherwise available.\n\nThe grey market for US satellite receivers in Canada at one point was estimated to serve as many as several hundred thousand English-speaking Canadian households. Canadian authorities, acting under pressure from cable companies and domestic broadcasters, have made many attempts to prevent Canadians from subscribing to US direct-broadcast services such as AT&T's DirecTV and Echostar's Dish Network.\n\nWhile litigation has gone as far as the Supreme Court of Canada, no judicial ruling has yet been made on whether such restrictions violate the safeguards of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which are intended to protect freedom of expression and prevent linguistic or ethnic discrimination. Domestic satellite and cable providers have adopted a strategy of judicial delay in which their legal counsel will file an endless series of otherwise-useless motions before the courts to ensure that the proponents of the grey-market systems run out of money before the \"Charter Challenge\" issue is decided.\n\nAccording to K. William McKenzie, the Orillia Ontario lawyer who won the case in the Supreme Court of Canada, a consortium headed by David Fuss and supported by Dawn Branton and others later launched a constitutional challenge to defeat section 9(1)(c) of the Radiocommunication Act on the basis that it breached the guarantee of Freedom of Expression enshrined in section 2 (c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights.\n\nThe evidence compiled by Mr. McKenzie from his broadcasting clients in opposition to this challenge was so overwhelming that it was abandoned and the Court ordered that substantial costs be paid by the applicants.\n\nIn most cases, broadcast distributors will require a domestic billing address before issuing a subscription; post boxes and commercial mail receiving agencies are often used by grey-market subscribers to foreign providers to circumvent this restriction.\n\nThe situation in the US itself differs as it is complicated by the legal question of subscriber access to distant local TV stations. Satellite providers are severely limited in their ability to offer subscriptions to distant locals due to the risk of further lawsuits by local affiliates of the same network in the subscribers home designated market area. California stations have sued satellite providers who distributed New York signals nationally, as the distant stations would have an unfair advantage by broadcasting the same programming three hours earlier.\n\nThere is also a small \"reverse gray market\" for Canadian signals, transmitted with a footprint which sends full-strength DBS signals to many if not all of the contiguous 48 US states. This is desirable not only to receive Canadian-only content, but because some US-produced programs air in Canada in advance of their US broadcast. The question of signal substitution, by which Canadian cable and satellite providers substitute the signal of a local or domestic channel over a foreign or distant channel carrying the same program, is rendered more complex by the existence of a reverse grey market. Signal substitution had already been the cause of strong diplomatic protests by the United States, which considers the practice to constitute theft of advertising revenue.\n\nThe lack of domestic competition for premium movie channels in Canada is one factor encouraging grey-market reception; language is another key issue as most Spanish-language programming in North America is on the US system and most French-language programming is on the Canadian system. A larger selection of sports and ethnic programming is also available to grey-market subscribers.\n\nIt could be said that the 1000-channel universe is a \"reality\" in North America, but only for the signal pirates as many legal and geographic restrictions are placed on the ability to subscribe to many if not most of the physically available channels.\n\nOther countries such as Nicaragua during Sandinista rule, Cuba, Iran (Islamic Republic of Iran) and Afghanistan during Taliban rule and Iraq during the Saddam Hussein regime, have attempted to prohibit their citizens from receiving any satellite broadcasts from foreign sources.\n\nThe situation in Europe differs somewhat, due to the much greater linguistic diversity in that region and due to the use of standardized DVB receivers capable of receiving multiple providers and free-to-air signals. North American providers normally lock their subscribers into \"package receivers\" unable to tune outside their one package; often the receivers are sold at artificially low prices and the subscription cost for programming is increased in order to favour new subscribers over existing ones. Providers are also notorious for using sales tactics such as bundling, in which to obtain one desired channel a subscriber must purchase a block of anywhere from several to more than a hundred other channels at substantial cost.\n\nMany European companies such as British Sky Broadcasting prohibit subscriptions outside the UK and Ireland. But other satellite providers such as Sky Deutschland do sell yearly subscription cards legally to customers in other European countries without the need for an address or other personal information. The latter also applies to virtually all the Adult channel cards sold in Europe.\n\nA number of strategies have been used by providers to control or prevent the widespread pirate decryption of their signals.\n\nOne approach has been to take legal action against dealers who sell equipment which may be of use to satellite pirates; in some cases the objective has been to obtain lists of clients in order to take or threaten to take costly legal action against end-users. Providers have created departments with names like the \"office of signal integrity\" or the \"end-users group\" to pursue alleged pirate viewers.\n\nAs some equipment (such as a computer interface to communicate with standard ISO/IEC 7816 smartcards) is useful for other purposes, this approach has drawn strong opposition from groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. There have also been US counter-suits alleging that the legal tactics used by some DBS providers to demand large amounts of money from end-users may themselves appear unlawful or border on extortion.\n\nMuch of the equipment is perfectly lawful to own; in these cases, only the misuse of the equipment to pirate signals is prohibited. This makes provider attempts at legal harassment of would-be pirates awkward at best, a serious problem for providers which is growing due to the Internet distribution of third-party software to reprogram some otherwise legitimate free-to-air DVB receivers to decrypt pay TV broadcasts with no extra hardware.\n\nUS-based Internet sites containing information about the compromised encryption schemes have also been targeted by lawyers, often with the objective of costing the defendants enough in legal fees that they have to shut down or move their sites to offshore or foreign Internet hosts.\n\nIn some cases, the serial numbers of unsubscribed smartcards have been blacklisted by providers, causing receivers to display error messages. A \"hashing\" approach of writing arbitrary data to every available location on the card and requiring that this data be present as part of the decryption algorithm has also been tried as a way of leaving less available free space for third-party code supplied by pirates.\n\nAnother approach has been to load malicious code onto smartcards or receivers; these programs are intended to detect tampered cards and maliciously damage the cards or corrupt the contents of non-volatile memories within the receiver. This particular Trojan horse attack is often used as an ECM (electronic countermeasure) by providers, especially in North America where cards and receivers are sold by the providers themselves and are easy targets for insertion of backdoors in their computer firmware. The most famous ECM incident was the Black Sunday attack launched against tampered DirecTV \"H\" on 3 January 21, 2001 and intended to destroy the cards by overwriting a non-erasable part of the cards internal memory in order to lock the processor into an endless loop.\n\nThe results of a provider resorting to the use of malicious code are usually temporary at best, as knowledge of how to repair most damage tends to be distributed rapidly by hobbyists through various Internet forums. There is also a potential legal question involved (which has yet to be addressed) as the equipment is normally the property not of the provider but of the end user. Providers will often print on the smartcard itself that the card is the property of the signal provider, but at least one legal precedent indicates that marking \"this is mine\" on a card, putting it in a box with a receiver and then selling it can legally mean \"this is not mine anymore\". Malicious damage to receiver firmware puts providers on even shakier legal ground in the unlikely event that the matter were ever to be heard by the judiciary.\n\nThe only solution which has shown any degree of long-term success against tampered smartcards has been the use of digital renewable security; if the code has been broken and the contents of the smartcard's programming widely posted across the Internet, replacing every smartcard in every subscriber's receiver with one of different, uncompromised design will effectively put an end to a piracy problem. Providers tend to be slow to go this route due to cost (as many have millions of legitimate subscribers, each of which must be sent a new card) and due to concern that someone may eventually crack the code used in whatever new replacement card is used, causing the process to begin anew.\n\nPremiere in Germany has replaced all of its smartcards with the Nagravision Aladin card; the US DirecTV system has replaced its three compromised card types (\"F\" had no encryption chip, \"H\" was vulnerable to being reprogrammed by pirates and \"HU\" were vulnerable to a \"glitch\" which could be used to make them skip an instruction). Both providers have been able to eliminate their problems with signal piracy by replacing the compromised smartcards after all other approaches had proved to provide at best limited results.\n\nDish Network and Bell TV had released new and more tamper-resistant smart cards over the years, known as the ROM2, ROM3, ROM10, ROM11 series. All these cards used the Nagravision 1 access system. Despite introducing newer and newer security measures, older cards were typically still able to decrypt the satellite signal after new cards were released (A lack of EEPROM space on the ROM2 cards eventually led to them being unable to receive updates necessary to view programming). In an effort to stop piracy, as by this point the Nagravision 1 system had been thoroughly reverse-engineered by resourceful hobbyists, an incompatible Nagravision 2 encryption system was introduced along with a smart card swap-out for existing customers. As more cards were swapped, channel groups were slowly converted to the new encryption system, starting with pay-per-view and HDTV channels, followed by the premium movie channels. This effort culminated in a complete shutdown of the Nagravision 1 datastream for all major channels in September, 2005. Despite these efforts to secure their programming, a software hack was released in late August, 2005, allowing for the decryption of the new Nagravision 2 channels with a DVB-S card and a PC. Just a few months later, early revisions of the Nagravision 2 cards had been themselves compromised. Broadcast programming currently uses a simulcrypt of Nagravision 2 and Nagravision 3, a first step toward a possible future shutdown of Nagravision 2 systems.\n\nVarious groups have been targeted for lawsuits in connection with pirate decryption issues:\n\nOne of the most severe sentences handed out for satellite TV piracy in the United States was to a Canadian businessman, Martin Clement Mullen, widely known for over a decade in the satellite industry as \"Marty\" Mullen.\n\nMullen was sentenced to seven years in prison with no parole and ordered to pay DirecTV and smart card provider NDS Ltd. US$24 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty in a Tampa, Florida court in September 2003 after being arrested when he entered the United States using a British passport in the name \"Martin Paul Stewart\".\n\nMr. Mullen had operated his satellite piracy business from Florida, the Cayman Islands and from his home in London, Ontario, Canada. Testimony in the Florida court showed that he had a network of over 100 sub-dealers working for him and that during one six-week period, he cleared US$4.4 million in cash from re-programming DirecTV smartcards that had been damaged in an electronic counter measure.\n\nNDS Inc. Chief of Security John Norris pursued Mullen for a decade in three different countries. When Mullen originally fled the United States to Canada in the mid-1990s, Norris launched an investigation that saw an undercover operator (a former Canadian police officer named Don Best) become one of Mullen's sub-dealers and his closest personal friend for over a year. In summer of 2003 when Mullen travelled under another identity to visit his operations in Florida, US federal authorities were waiting for him at the airport after being tipped off by Canadian investigators working for NDS Inc.\n\nIronically the NDS Group were accused (in several lawsuits) by Canal+ (dismissed as part of an otherwise-unrelated corporate takeover deal) and Echostar (now Dish Network) of hacking the Nagra encryption and releasing the information on the internet. The jury awarded EchoStar $45.69 actual damages (one month's average subscription fee) in Claim 3.\n\nBell TV (as Bell ExpressVu) was sued by Vidéotron, a Québécor-owned rival which operates cable television systems in major Québec markets. Québécor also owns TVA, a broadcaster. Bell's inferior security and failure to replace compromised smartcards in a timely fashion cost Vidéotron cable subscribers, as viewers could obtain the same content for free from satellite under the compromised Nagra1 system from 1999 to 2005; pirate decryption also deprived TVA's French language news channel LCN of a monthly 48¢/subscriber fee. The Superior Court of Quebec awarded $339,000 and $262,000 in damages/interest to Vidéotron and TVA Group in 2012. Québec's Appeal Court ruled these dollar amounts \"erroneus\" and increased them in 2015; despite an attempt to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, a final award of $141 million in damages and interest was upheld.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40651", "title": "Scale (music)", "text": "Scale (music)\n\nIn music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale. Some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending, for example, the melodic minor scale.\n\nOften, especially in the context of the common practice period, most or all of the melody and harmony of a musical work is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a staff with a standard key signature.\n\nDue to the principle of octave equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or interval) between two successive notes of the scale. However, there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by microtonal music, there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.\n\nA measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a semitone interval, while a major scale is defined by the interval pattern T–T–S–T–T–T–S, where T stands for whole tone (an interval spanning two semitones), and S stands for semitone. Based on their interval patterns, scales are put into categories including diatonic, chromatic, major, minor, and others.\n\nA specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first degree (or tonic). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, C major indicates a major scale with a C tonic.\n\nScales are typically listed from low to high pitch. Most scales are \"octave-repeating\", meaning their pattern of notes is the same in every octave (the Bohlen–Pierce scale is one exception). An octave-repeating scale can be represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major scale is C–D–E–F–G–A–B–[C], with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major scale is C–B–A–G–F–E–D–[C], with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.\n\nThe distance between two successive notes in a scale is called a scale step.\n\nThe notes of a scale are numbered by their steps from the root of the scale. For example, in a C major scale the first note is C, the second D, the third E and so on. Two notes can also be numbered in relation to each other: C and E create an interval of a third (in this case a major third); D and F also create a third (in this case a minor third).\n\nA single scale can be manifested at many different pitch levels. For example, a C major scale can be started at C4 (middle C; see scientific pitch notation) and ascending an octave to C5; or it could be started at C6, ascending an octave to C7. As long as all the notes can be played, the octave they take on can be altered.\n\nScales may be described according to the number of different pitch classes they contain:\n\n\nScales may also be described by their constituent intervals, such as being hemitonic, cohemitonic, or having imperfections. Many music theorists concur that the constituent intervals of a scale have a large role in the cognitive perception of its sonority, or tonal character.\n\n\"The number of the notes that make up a scale as well as the quality of the intervals between successive notes of the scale help to give the music of a culture area its peculiar sound quality.\" \"The pitch distances or intervals among the notes of a scale tell us more about the sound of the music than does the mere number of tones.\"\n\nScales may also be described by their symmetry, such as being palindromic, chiral, or having rotational symmetry as in Messaien's modes of limited transposition. \n\nScales can also be described by their distribution patterns and possibilities for notation. For example, a heliotonic scale is one that can be notated with one note head on each line and space, using only single and double alterations (flats, double-flats, sharps, and double-sharps). Thus all heliotonic scales are heptatonic, but not all heptatonic scales are heliotonic. Since heliotonia is a metric of a scale's tone distribution pattern, is related to evenness, coherence, spectra variation, and the Myhill Property.\n\nThe notes of a scale form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in combination. A 5-note scale has 10 of these harmonic intervals, a 6-note scale has 15, a 7-note scale has 21, an 8-note scale has 28. Though the scale is not a chord, and might never be heard more than one note at a time, still the absence, presence, and placement of certain key intervals plays a large part in the sound of the scale, the natural movement of melody within the scale, and the selection of chords taken naturally from the scale.\n\nA musical scale that contains tritones is called tritonic (though the expression is also used for any scale with just three notes per octave, whether or not it includes a tritone), and one without tritones is \"atritonic\". A scale or chord that contains semitones is called hemitonic, and without semitones is anhemitonic.\n\nScales can be abstracted from performance or composition. They are also often used precompositionally to guide or limit a composition. Explicit instruction in scales has been part of compositional training for many centuries. One or more scales may be used in a composition, such as in Claude Debussy's \"L'Isle Joyeuse\". To the right, the first scale is a whole-tone scale, while the second and third scales are diatonic scales. All three are used in the opening pages of Debussy's piece.\n\nScales in traditional Western music generally consist of seven notes and repeat at the octave. Notes in the commonly used scales (see just below) are separated by whole and half step intervals of \"tones\" and \"semitones.\" The harmonic minor scale includes a three-semitone step; the anhemitonic pentatonic includes two of those and no semitones.\n\nWestern music in the Medieval and Renaissance periods (1100–1600) tends to use the white-note diatonic scale C–D–E–F–G–A–B. Accidentals are rare, and somewhat unsystematically used, often to avoid the tritone.\n\nMusic of the common practice periods (1600–1900) uses three types of scale:\n\nThese scales are used in all of their transpositions. The music of this period introduces \"modulation,\" which involves systematic changes from one scale to another. Modulation occurs in relatively conventionalized ways. For example, major-mode pieces typically begin in a \"tonic\" diatonic scale and modulate to the \"dominant\" scale a fifth above.In the 19th century (to a certain extent), but more in the 20th century, additional types of scales were explored:\n\nA large variety of other scales exists, some of the more common being:\n\nScales such as the pentatonic scale may be considered \"gapped\" relative to the diatonic scale. An \"auxiliary scale\" is a scale other than the primary or original scale. See: modulation (music) and Auxiliary diminished scale.\n\nIn many musical circumstances, a specific note of the scale is chosen as the tonic—the central and most stable note of the scale. In Western tonal music, simple songs or pieces typically start and end on the tonic note. Relative to a choice of a certain tonic, the notes of a scale are often labeled with numbers recording how many scale steps above the tonic they are. For example, the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) can be labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, reflecting the choice of C as tonic. The expression scale degree refers to these numerical labels. Such labeling requires the choice of a \"first\" note; hence scale-degree labels are not intrinsic to the scale itself, but rather to its modes. For example, if we choose A as tonic, then we can label the notes of the C major scale using A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on. When we do so, we create a new scale called the A minor scale. See the musical note article for how the notes are customarily named in different countries.\n\nThe scale degrees of a heptatonic (7-note) scale can also be named using the terms tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, subtonic. If the subtonic is a semitone away from the tonic, then it is usually called the leading-tone (or leading-note); otherwise the leading-tone refers to the raised subtonic. Also commonly used is the (movable do) solfège naming convention in which each scale degree is denoted by a syllable. In the major scale, the solfège syllables are: do, re, mi, fa, so (or sol), la, ti (or si), do (or ut).\n\nIn naming the notes of a scale, it is customary that each scale degree be assigned its own letter name: for example, the A major scale is written A–B–C–D–E–F–G rather than A–B–D–D–E–E–G. However, it is impossible to do this in scales that contain more than seven notes, at least in the English-language nomenclature system.\n\nScales may also be identified by using a binary system of twelve zeros or ones to represent each of the twelve notes of a chromatic scale. It is assumed that the scale is tuned using 12-tone equal temperament (so that, for instance, C is the same as D), and that the tonic is in the leftmost position. For example, the binary number 101011010101, equivalent to the decimal number 2773, would represent any major scale (such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B). This system includes scales from 100000000000 (2048) to 111111111111 (4095), providing a total of 2048 possible species, but only 351 unique scales containing from 1 to 12 notes.\n\nA more mathematically flexible schema for binary representation, espoused by theorist Ian Ring in his study of musical scales, has bits representing ascending tones, with the smaller bits representing lower pitches and higher bits representing higher pitches. This causes the bits to appear reversed compared with Duncan's system. Under this schema, a major scale is 101010110101 = (2741), a single root tone is 1, and a chromatic scale is still 111111111111 (4095). All the tone possibilities that begin with a root tone, and are thus scale-like, are odd-numbered.\n\nScales may also be shown as semitones from the tonic. For instance, 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 denotes any major scale such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which the first degree is, obviously, 0 semitones from the tonic (and therefore coincides with it), the second is 2 semitones from the tonic, the third is 4 semitones from the tonic, and so on. Again, this implies that the notes are drawn from a chromatic scale tuned with 12-tone equal temperament. For some fretted string instruments, such as the guitar and the bass guitar, scales can be notated in tabulature, an approach which indicates the fret number and string upon which each scale degree is played.\n\nComposers transform musical patterns by moving every note in the pattern by a constant number of scale steps: thus, in the C major scale, the pattern C–D–E might be shifted up, or transposed, a single scale step to become D–E–F. This process is called \"scalar transposition\" or \"shifting to a new key\" and can often be found in musical sequences and patterns. (It is D-E-F# in Chromatic transposition). Since the steps of a scale can have various sizes, this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the music. In Western tonal music, the simplest and most common type of modulation (or changing keys) is to shift from one major key to another key built on the first key's fifth (or dominant) scale degree. In the key of C major, this would involve moving to the key of G major (which uses an F#). Composers also often modulate to other related keys. In some Romantic music era pieces and contemporary music, composers modulate to \"remote keys\" that are not related to or close to the tonic. An example of a remote modulation would be taking a song that begins in C major and modulating (changing keys) to F# major.\n\nThrough the introduction of blue notes, jazz and blues employ scale intervals smaller than a semitone. The blue note is an interval that is technically neither major nor minor but \"in the middle\", giving it a characteristic flavour. A regular piano cannot play blue notes, but with electric guitar, saxophone, trombone and trumpet, performers can \"bend\" notes a fraction of a tone sharp or flat to create blue notes For instance, in the key of E, the blue note would be either a note between G and G or a note moving between both. \n\nIn blues, a pentatonic scale is often used. In jazz, many different modes and scales are used, often within the same piece of music. Chromatic scales are common, especially in modern jazz.\n\nIn Western music, scale notes are often separated by Equal temperament tones or semitones, creating 12 intervals per octave each separating two tones where the higher tone has a oscillation frequency of a fixed ratio (by a factor equal to the twelfth root of two, or approximately 1.059463) higher than the frequency of the lower one. A scale uses a subset consisting typically of 7 of these 12 as scale steps. Other traditional tempered scale systems divide the octave to equal intervals by numbers other than 12. Examples are 53 in the Middle East, and 72 in southern India.\n\nMany other musical traditions use scales that include other intervals. These scales originate within the derivation of the harmonic series. Musical intervals are complementary values of the harmonic overtones series. Many musical scales in the world are based on this system, except most of the musical scales from Indonesia and the Indochina Peninsulae, which are based on inharmonic resonance of the dominant metalophone and xylophone instruments.\n\nSome scales use a different number of pitches. A common scale in Eastern music is the pentatonic scale, which consists of five notes that span an octave.\n\nSome scales span part of an octave; Several such short scales are typically combined to form a scale spanning a full octave or more, and usually called with a third name of its own. The Middle Eastern music has around a dozen such basic short scales that are combined to form hundreds of full-octave spanning scales. Among these middle eastern scales Hejaz scale has one scale step spanning 14 intervals (of the middle eastern type found 53 in an octave) roughly similar to 3 semitones (of the western type found 12 in an octave), while Saba scale, another of these middle eastern scales, has 3 consecutive scale steps within 14 commas, i.e. separated by roughly one western semitone either side of the middle tone.\n\nGamelan music uses a small variety of scales including Pélog and Sléndro, none including equally tempered nor harmonic intervals. Indian classical music uses a moveable seven-note scale. Indian Rāgas often use intervals smaller than a semitone. Arabic music maqamat may use quarter tone intervals. In both rāgas and maqamat, the distance between a note and an inflection (e.g., śruti) of that same note may be less than a semitone.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "637346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=637346", "title": "Takarazuka Revue", "text": "Takarazuka Revue\n\nThe is a Japanese all-female musical theater troupe based in Takarazuka, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Women play all roles in lavish, Broadway-style productions of Western-style musicals, and sometimes stories adapted from shōjo manga and Japanese folktales. The company is a division of the Hankyu Railway company; all members of the troupe are employed by the company.\n\nThe Takarazuka Revue was founded by Ichizo Kobayashi, an industrialist-turned-politician and president of Hankyu Railways, in Takarazuka, Japan in 1913. The city was the terminus of a Hankyu line from Osaka and already a popular tourist destination because of its hot springs. Kobayashi believed that it was the ideal spot to open an attraction of some kind that would boost train ticket sales and draw more business to Takarazuka. Since Western song and dance shows were becoming more popular and Kobayashi considered the Kabuki theater to be old and elitist, he decided that an all-female theater group might be well received by the general public.\n\nThe Revue had its first performance in 1914. Ten years later, the company had become popular enough to obtain its own theater in Takarazuka, called the \"Dai Gekijō\" meaning \"Grand Theater\". Today, the company owns and operates another theater, the Takarazuka Theater, in Tokyo. Currently Takarazuka performs for 2.5 million people each year and the majority of its fans are women.\n\nPart of the novelty of Takarazuka is that all the parts are played by women, based on the original model of Kabuki before 1629 when women were banned from the theater in Japan. The women who play male parts are referred to as \"otokoyaku\" (, literally \"male role\") and those who play female parts are called \"musumeyaku\" (, literally \"daughter's role\"). The costumes, set designs and lighting are lavish, the performances melodramatic. Side pathways extend the already wide proscenium, accommodating elaborate processions and choreography.\n\nRegardless of the era of the musical presented, period accuracy is relaxed for costumes during extravagant finales which include scores of glittering performers parading down an enormous stage-wide staircase and a Rockette-style kick line. Lead performers portraying both male and female roles appear in the finale wearing huge circular feathered back-pieces reminiscent of Las Vegas or Paris costuming.\n\nBefore becoming a member of the troupe, a young woman must train for two years in the Takarazuka Music School, one of the most competitive of its kind in the world. Each year, thousands from all over Japan audition. The 40 to 50 who are accepted are trained in music, dance, and acting, and are given seven-year contracts. The school is famous for its strict discipline and its custom of having first-year students clean the premises each morning.\n\nThe first year, all women train together before being divided by the faculty and the current troupe members into \"otokoyaku\" and \"musumeyaku\" at the end of the year. Those playing \"otokoyaku\" cut their hair short, take on a more masculine role in the classroom, and speak in the masculine form.\n\nThe company has five main troupes: , , , , and ; as well as superior members, a collection for senior actresses no longer part of a regular troupe who still wish to maintain their association with the revue and perform from time to time. Flower and Moon are the original troupes, founded in 1921. Snow Troupe began in 1924. Star Troupe was founded in 1931, disbanded in 1939, and reestablished in 1948. Cosmos, founded in 1998, is the newest troupe.\n\nWhile on the surface it would appear that the Takarazuka Revue was intended to grant Japanese women freedom from social oppression, ironically, it began as quite the opposite. According to Takarazuka scholar Lorie Brau, \"The production office and corporate structure that control Takarazuka are overwhelmingly patriarchal.\" Although Takarazuka embodies Shiraishi’s idea that the actresses become \"good wives and wise mothers\" upon leaving the company, it also simultaneously represents progressive feminist points of view. Some believe that its appeal to the female audience is on account of the perceived link to freedom from traditional Japanese society’s imposed ideas of gender and sexuality. So while Takarazuka \"reinforces the status quo and sublimates women's desires through its dreamy narratives, there remains some possibility that certain spectators find it empowering simply to watch women play men.\"\n\nSome Takarasienne shows, such as \"The Rose of Versailles\" and \"Elisabeth\", feature androgynous characters. The \"otokoyaku\" represents the woman’s idealized man without the roughness or need to dominate, the \"perfect\" man who can not be found in the real world. It is these male roles that offer an escape from the strict, gender-bound real roles lauded in Japanese society. In a sense, the otokoyaku provides the female audience with a \"dream\" of what they desire in reality.\n\nIn addition to their claim to \"sell dreams\", the actresses of the Takarazuka Revue take on another role, empowering themselves as women in a male-dominated culture. Kobayashi's desire to make his actresses into good wives and mothers has often been hindered by their own will to pursue careers in the entertainment business. It is becoming increasingly more common for women to stay in the company well into their thirties, beyond the conventional limits of marriageable age. The actresses’ role within the Takarazuka Revue thus overlaps into the culture surrounding it, adding to their appeal to the female-dominant audience. \"In fact, it is the carrying over of this 'boyishness' into everyday life and the freedom that this implies that captures the attention of some fans.\"\nThe \"otokoyaku\", however, is not bound to her assigned male role in the theater. Tsurugi Miyuki, top \"otokoyaku\" star of the Moon Troupe, said that she conceived male impersonation as just a \"role\" that she wore like the makeup and costume that helped create her \"otokoyaku\" image. She said she reverts to her nonperforming \"feminine\" self after performance. Other \"otokoyaku\" feel uncomfortable switching to female roles. \"Otokoyaku\" Matsu Akira, who retired in 1982, stated: \"Even though I am a female, the thing called 'female' just won't emerge at all.\"\n\nAlthough traditionally an all-female troupe, in 1946 the Takarazuka employed male performers who were trained separately from the female members of the troupes. Ultimately, however, the female members opposed these new male counterparts, and the department was dissolved, the last male department terminating in 1954. A recent Japanese musical, \"Takarazuka Boys\", was based on this chapter of the company's history.\n\nWhile the casts are all-female, the staff (writers, directors, choreographers, designers, etc.) and orchestra musicians may be male or female. It is not uncommon in Takarazuka for a predominantly male orchestra to be led by a female conductor.\n\nThe five troupes of the Takarazuka Revue have certain differences of style and material which make each unique.\n\nThe Flower Troupe is considered the \"treasure chest\" of \"otokoyaku\". Many of the most popular former and current top stars of the company originated in Flower Troupe; these include Miki Maya (who held the first Budokan solo concert in Takarazuka's history), Sumire Haruno and Tomu Ranju of Flower, Jun Shibuki, Jun Sena and Kiriya Hiromu of Moon, and Hikaru Asami of Snow. Their performances tend to have larger budgets, with lavish stage and costume designs, and are often derived from operatic material.\n\nWhile tending to be a home for young performers (with Yūki Amami in her sixth year reaching the status of top star in the 1990s), the members of Moon Troupe are also strong singers. The term \"Musical Research Department\" is occasionally used in articles about the troupe, underscoring the troupe's focus on music. Their material tends toward drama, Western musicals, and modern settings, such as \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"Me and My Girl\". During the era of Makoto Tsubasa as top star, they had at least two musicals adopted from classic western novels.\n\nSnow Troupe is considered the upholder of traditional dance and opera for the whole company, being the vanguard of traditional Japanese drama in a company that tends towards Western material. They were the first troupe to perform \"Elisabeth\" in Japan. The troupe has been moving towards the opera and drama style of Moon and Flower.\n\nStar Troupe tends to be the home of Takarazuka's stars. They, along with Flower Troupe, have very strong \"otokoyaku\" players. In recent years, many of the company's prominent \"musumeyaku\" have also originated from Star Troupe, such as Hana Hizuki, Shizuku Hazakura, and Yuki Aono.\n\nCosmos, the newest troupe, is less traditional and more experimental. When it was first formed, it culled talent from the other troupes. The Cosmos style is influenced by performers like Asato Shizuki, the founding \"otokoyaku\" top star; Yōka Wao and Mari Hanafusa, the \"Golden Combi\" who headed the troupe for six of its first eight years. Cosmos were the first troupe to perform \"Phantom\" and to have a Broadway composer (Frank Wildhorn) write their musical score. Most of the \"otokoyaku\" in this troop are above 170 cm (the most notable is Hiro Yuumi, the tallest in the company since she joined in 1997 until her retirement in 2013). While it had a troupe-born actress become \"musumeyaku\" top back in 2006 with Asuka Toono, it wasn't until 2014 that an actress originating from this troupe became an \"otokoyaku\" top star: Seina Sagiri, the former top star of Yukigumi(2014-2017).\n\nWhile the majority of Takarazuka works are written \"in house\" by members of the creative staff, they are often adapted from Western classic musicals, operas, plays, novels or films:\nNovels:\n\nFilms:\nOperas:\n\n\nMusicals:\n\nPlays:\nStories based in Japan and modeled on historical accounts or traditional tales, are often referred to as or, less frequently, . Among the most common of these adapted to the Takarazuka stage is .\n\nPopular manga series have often shaped Takarazuka, such as in the case of Riyoko Ikeda's \"The Rose of Versailles\". Other manga adaptations include \"The Window of Orpheus\", also by Ikeda, Osamu Tezuka's \"Black Jack\" and \"Phoenix\", and Yasuko Aoike's \"El Halcón\".\n\nRecent examples of works adapted from Japanese novels or short stories include Moon Troupe's , based upon the short story by Ryōtarō Shiba, and Flower Troupe's , based upon the Kogoro Akechi story by Edogawa Rampo.\n\nIn 2009, Takarazuka Revue performed two shows based on an adaptation of Capcom's videogame series \"Phoenix Wright\". They took the stage in January 2013 to represent the courtroom game again with the production titled \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth: Ace Attorney 3\". In June 2013, the Revue would debut at Tokyo's TOKYU THEATRE Orb an adaptation of another Capcom videogame, \"Sengoku Basara\", done by the Flower Troupe. This focused on character Yukimura Sanada, played by Tomu Ranju, the same actress who had taken the role of Phoenix Wright prior to becoming a top star.\n\nAmong works adapted from other Asian sources is the Beijing opera \"Farewell My Concubine\", detailing the romance between General Xiang Yu and his lover Madam Yu.\n\nMusicals have also been performed throughout the years based upon people and events in American, European, and Asian history. Among the more recognizable of these biographical adaptations are \"Last Party: S. Fitzgerald's Last Day\", about F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"Valentino\", about Rudolph Valentino, \"Dean\", about James Dean, and \"Saint-Exupéry -The Pilot Who Became \"The Little Prince\"-\", about Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.\n\nFinally, original stories round out Takarazuka fare, including musicals such as \"Boxman\" by Cosmos Troupe, \"Too Short a Time to Fall in Love\" performed by Star and Moon Troupes, and \"Silver Wolf\" by Moon and Snow Troupes.\n\nTakarazuka has occasionally worked with notable writers, composers, and choreographers to create original content for the revue. In 1993, Tommy Tune wrote, directed and choreographed the revue \"Broadway Boys\" to accompany Moon Troupe's rendition of \"Grand Hotel\". In 2006, Takarazuka worked with Frank Wildhorn, musical writer and composer of \"Jekyll & Hyde\" and \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\", to create \"Never Say Goodbye\" for Cosmos Troupe.\n\nThe current top stars of each group are:\n\nThe terms upperclassmen (上級生) and lowerclassmen (下級生) (the Japanese terms are gender-neutral) are used to distinguish senior and junior members of Takarazuka. Lowerclassmen are the actresses who have been performers in Takarazuka for less than seven years. They are employees of the company, and usually work as background dancers and in \"shinjin kōen\" (performances exclusively for underclassmen). After the seventh year they become upperclassmen, and negotiate contracts with the company instead of being employed by it.\n\nTakarazuka roster members who went on to work in stage, movies and television include:\nWomen make up the primary audience of Takarazuka; in fact, some estimates say the audience is 90 percent female. There exist two primary theories as to what draws these women to Takarazuka. These theories, put forward by Western scholars, complement each other, drawing on the traditional homoerotic elements of Japanese performing arts, and the ancient subversive nature of the feminine in Japan. One is that the women are drawn to its inherent lesbian overtones. One author states, \"It was not masculine sexuality which attracted the Japanese girl audience but it was feminine eroticism\". Another theory is that the girls are not drawn to the implicit sexuality of Takarazuka, but instead are fascinated by the \"otokoyaku\" (the women who play male roles) \"getting away with a male performance of power and freedom\".\n\nFavoring the first theory, American Jennifer Robertson observes that lesbian themes occur in every Takarazuka performance, simply by virtue of the fact that women play every role. The audience clearly picks up on it and responds. Within the first ten years of Takarazuka's founding, the audience was vocally responding to the apparent lesbianism. Female fans wrote love letters to the \"otokoyaku\". In 1921 these letters were published and several years later newspapers and the public rallied a cry against Takarazuka, claiming it was quickly becoming a \"symbol of abnormal love\". In order to combat this, the producers kept its actresses in strict living conditions; they were no longer allowed to associate with their fans. Robertson mentions a phenomenon of \"S\" or \"Class S\" love, a particular style of love wherein women who have been influenced by Takarazuka return to their daily lives feeling free to develop crushes on their female classmates or coworkers. This type of romance is typically fleeting and is seen in Japanese society as more of a phase in growing up rather than \"true\" homosexuality. Robertson sums up her theory thus: \"Many [women] are attracted to the Takarazuka \"otokoyaku\" because she represents an exemplary female who can negotiate successfully both genders and their attendant roles and domains.\"\n\nThe other theory, supported by Canadian Erica Abbitt, is that the female audience of Takarazuka is drawn not exclusively by lesbian overtones, but rather by the subversion of stereotypical gender roles. Japan is a society notorious for its rigid conception of gender roles. While the original goal of the show may have been to create the ideal good wife and wise mother, off stage, on-stage gender roles are, by necessity, subverted. The \"otokoyaku\" must act the way men are supposed to act. Abbitt insists that a large portion of the appeal of Takarazuka comes from something she calls \"slippage\", referring to the enjoyment derived from a character portraying something they are not, in this case a woman portraying a man. While not denying the presence of lesbian overtones within Takarazuka, Abbitt proposes the cause for the largely female audience has more to do with this subversion of societal norms than sexual ones.\n\nSome fans demonstrate their loyalty to a particular performer by joining her fan club. Club members can be identified by their wearing scarves of a particular color or even jackets colorfully embroidered with the star's name. Following performances at the Takarazuka Grand Theatre or Tokyo Takarazuka Theatre, as many as several hundred fans congregate in their various club groups and stand in orderly ranks on either side of the street in front of the theatre. The clubs are arranged by actress seniority within the troupe. Theatre officials set up barricades and oversee the assembly.\n\nWhenever an actress exits the theatre, the frontmost group will sit and all the others follow suit (much like the \"wave\" seen in athletic arenas) with subsequent intervals of standing and sitting. The fans wait patiently, with little conversation, for their favorites to exit the theatre, their decorum contrasting markedly to the noisy, competitive and often pushy autograph-seekers who wait outside stage doors in the West. An almost eerie ritualistic calm prevails. As the stars come out of the building one by one, some alone but most accompanied by staff members of their club, orderly quiet continues to prevail. The glamorous performers, now mostly in slacks or jeans with high heels and wearing oversize visored \"newsboy\" caps to hide their hair (and some with sunglasses even at night), move along to their own particular fan clubs. Rather than requesting autographs, the fans proffer cards, which are gathered efficiently by each star, who may say a few words but then waves and moves on. Once the last stars have emerged and departed, the clubs disband quietly.\n\nTakarazuka has had a profound influence on the history of anime and manga, especially shōjo manga. Osamu Tezuka, a highly influential manga creator, grew up in the town of Takarazuka. His mother knew many of the Takarazuka actresses, and as a child he knew them and watched many of their performances. Based on their stories of noble princes played by female actresses, Tezuka created \"Princess Knight\" the first manga aimed at a female audience, which tells the story of Princess Sapphire, a girl born with both a male and female heart who struggles between the desire to fight as a noble prince and to be a tender, gentle princess. The great success of \"Princess Knight\" and other Tezuka stories began the tradition of manga written for a female audience, especially the very influential \"Rose of Versailles\" and \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" series, both of which borrow directly from \"Princess Knight\" by including specific Tezuka images, character designs and names. \"Rose of Versailles\" is one of Takarazuka's best-known musicals. Women in masculine roles continue to be a central theme in shōjo manga and anime as well as some shōnen, and Tezuka himself explored the theme in many of his later works, including \"Dororo\", \"Phoenix\" and \"Black Jack\".\n\nWhile the influence of Osamu Tezuka and Takarazuka on anime and manga is general, there are still many series which show more specific influences. The Takarazuka Revue inspired the plot of the original \"Sakura Wars\" video game, along with additional inspiration from Takarazuka's one-time competitor the Shochiku Kagekidan (Shochiku Revue).\n\nThe Zuka Club in \"Ouran High School Host Club\" is based on the Takarazuka Revue. The characters Haruka Tenoh and Michiru Kaioh of \"Sailor Moon\" were loosely based on the actors of the Takarazuka Revue.\n\n\"The Virgin's Mask\" by Jūrō Kara, a significant work of post-war theater, features an aging \"\"Zuka\"-girl\" attempting to reclaim her youth through ritualistic bathing in a tub of virgins' tears.\n\nAfter the scandal of women writing love letters to the \"otokoyaku\" and the revelation of an actual lesbian relationship between a \"otokoyaku\" and a \"musumeyaku\", the revue greatly limited itself in order to do away with the lesbian image. Women wore militaristic uniforms, heightening the attraction even more among some audience goers. There was another scandal in 1932 when, for the first time, one of the \"otokoyaku\" cut her hair short (previously all of the actresses had their hair long and the \"otokoyaku\" simply hid their hair under hats). In August 1940, the actresses were even forbidden to answer fan mail and socialize with their admirers. In the years since then, the regulations have relaxed but not by much.\n\nA 1996 black-and-white photograph of a Takarasienne, taken by Daido Moriyama, appeared on the October 1999 cover of \"Art in America\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20619668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20619668", "title": "Tickled", "text": "Tickled\n\nTickled is a 2016 New Zealand documentary about \"competitive endurance tickling\" and videos featuring it, and the practices of those producing the videos, directed by David Farrier and Dylan Reeve. The film explores possible legal and ethical issues with certain individuals making the videos, and has itself been the subject of legal challenges. A follow-up special, \"The Tickle King\", aired on HBO in February 2017.\n\nDavid Farrier, a New Zealand television reporter whose beat focuses on \"quirky and odd stories\", sees videos online about an activity described as \"competitive endurance tickling\", in which young athletic men are restrained and tickled by each other; he begins to research it for a story. He requests for an interview with the videos' producer Jane O'Brien Media, but the company refused to \"associate with a homosexual journalist\" (Farrier is actually bisexual). Since Farrier considers the act of tickling other men \"pretty gay,\" he is confused and offended by the hostile response, but intrigued. Farrier partners with television producer Dylan Reeve to learn more about tickling videos and the people who produce them.\n\nAfter blogging about the incident, they receive legal threats from Jane O'Brien Media, who send Kevin Clarke and two other representatives to New Zealand. Although their interactions are superficially cordial, the Jane O'Brien Media people seem intent on bullying the investigators into dropping the project. Farrier and Reeve respond by traveling to Los Angeles, and find the representatives at a site where the company records videos, but are turned away at the door.\n\nResearching the phenomenon further, they uncover information about a person known as Terri DiSisto (alias \"Terri Tickle\"), who pioneered recruiting and distributing tickling videos online in the 1990s. They interview independent tickling-video producer Richard Ivey whose operations are a low-key affair with an acknowledged homoerotic aspect. They speak to a few former participants in Jane O'Brien Media's videos who describe coercive and manipulative treatment by the producers, such as defamation campaigns against them, exposing their personal information and contacting school or work associates to discredit them as homosexual or as sexual deviants, in retaliation for challenging or speaking out against the company. A local recruiter in Muskegon, Michigan, describes \"audition\" videos he had helped make, which were published by O'Brien Media without the participants' consent.\n\nFarrier and Reeve chance upon documents on a defunct tickling-video web site, which link Jane O'Brien Media to David D'Amato, the former school administrator behind the \"Terri Tickle\" alias. They learn that D'Amato had served a six-month prison sentence for disabling computer systems at two different universities on multiple dates, in retaliation against an 18-year-old male student who attempted to terminate their online relationship, begun when the young man was 17. They determine that D'Amato now lives on a substantial inheritance from his father, a successful lawyer. After considerable effort to locate him, they confront him on the street, to which he responds with additional legal threats. Before returning to New Zealand, Farrier contacts D'Amato's stepmother for comment; she implicitly confirms her stepson's \"tickling\" past, and Farrier informs her that he believes D'Amato is still involved in it.\n\nUnder the working title \"Tickle King: The Hunt for the Truth in Competitive Tickling\", Farrier and Reeve raised NZ$29,570 on Kickstarter in June 2014, intended primarily to cover the costs of the crew traveling to the United States for a week. The project also received funding from the New Zealand Film Commission.\n\nThe soundtrack includes music from \"Upstream Color\" by Shane Carruth.\n\nThe film was screened at the January 2016 Sundance Film Festival, after which Magnolia Pictures picked up distribution and HBO picked up US TV rights. In March 2016 it was presented as part of the True/False Film Festival.\n\nThe film was released to New Zealand theaters on 27 May 2016. It was released by Magnolia Pictures to US theaters on 17 June, and in Australia and the United Kingdom on 19 August.\n\n\"Tickled\" has received critical acclaim. In a review headlined \"fetish documentary goes from giggly to grim\", Nigel Smith of \"The Guardian\" gives the movie four (of five) stars. Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" states the onscreen presence of the filmmakers \"is justified because the harassment they experience in pursuing the story becomes a big part of its narrative\". \"The Salt Lake Tribune\", giving it 4.5 stars, said it was \"an act of journalistic courage\" and that they \"reveal the harm that can be done by an individual with a lot of money and a vindictive streak\". Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\", giving it a Critic's Pick, said \"Farrier and Mr. Reeve see the humor, but they also see the pathos—because it's all fun and giggles until someone gets hurt.\"\n\nArmond White of \"Out\" magazine was critical of the movie, commenting that it \"zips past its sexual aspects\", and concluding that it is ultimately \"frustrating, a blue-balls documentary\".\n\nAt Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 106 critics. Metacritic gives the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n\nThe shocking truth is uncomfortably pursued to its fullest, and the result is a riveting piece of investigative journalism.\n\nIn the movie, D'Amato is seen accusing Farrier of being in America illegally, by using a tourist visa for journalism. Farrier, who routinely travels internationally on assignment, states he was on a journalist visa. Farrier also shows documents from O'Brien Media, coaching international video participants to travel under a tourist visa when coming to the US for paid performances.\n\nAfter the premiere screening at Sundance, in March 2016, D'Amato filed a federal lawsuit against the filmmakers for making false accusations, including the implication that D'Amato used extortion and abused minors, and stating that D'Amato has no relationship with O'Brien Media. In response, Farrier told \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" that \"given the number of hollow legal threats we faced during the making of it, it's almost refreshing to see a real case being filed by real lawyers.\"\n\nIn June 2016, Kevin Clarke of O'Brien Media created a website to counter the documentary.\n\nD'Amato attended the 18 June 2016 screening at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles, and confronted Dylan Reeve, saying, \"You need to lawyer up. You need to get criminal counsel.\" Clarke argued with Reeve during a public question-and-answer session after the film, saying \"The film is a piece of garbage full of lies. Release the audio tapes that show you're lying. And if you don't release it, it's the same as admitting you're lying.\" \n\nD'Amato filed a $40 million defamation and slander lawsuit in Nassau County court alleging that his stepmother Dorothy D'Amato made statements in the film with the intention to injure his business, causing mental distress.\n\nD'Amato died at age 55, on 13 March 2017. The filmmakers posted a statement on their web site that they were \"incredibly sad\" to learn of it, and asking that his death be treated with respect.\n\n"}
{"id": "11655685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11655685", "title": "Worm charming", "text": "Worm charming\n\nWorm charming, worm grunting, and worm fiddling are methods of attracting earthworms from the ground. The activity is usually performed to collect bait for fishing but can also take the form of a competitive sport in areas such as east Texas. As a skill and profession worm charming is now very rare, with the art being passed through generations to ensure that it survives.\n\nMost worm charming methods involve vibrating the soil, which encourages the worms to the surface. In 2008 researchers from Vanderbilt University claimed that the worms surface because the vibrations are similar to those produced by digging moles, which prey on earthworms. The same technique is used by many species of bird, which devour the worms as they appear above ground.\n\nThe activity is known by several different names and the apparatus and techniques vary significantly. \"Worm grunting\" generally refers to the use of a \"stob\", a wooden stake that is driven into the ground, and a \"rooping iron\" which is used to rub the stob. \"Worm fiddling\" also uses a wooden stake but utilises a dulled saw which is dragged along its top.\n\nTechniques vary from sprinkling the turf with water, tea and beer, to music or just \"twanging\" with a garden fork. In some organized competitions, detergents and mechanical diggers have been banned.\n\nWorm charming is a behavior also observed in the animal kingdom, especially among birds. The methods used vary; however, tapping earth with feet to generate vibrations is widespread. One common example is the \"Seagull dance\". The wood turtle also seems to be adapted for worm charming, as it is known to stamp its feet – a behavior that attracts worms to the surface and allows the turtle to prey on them.\n\nWorms are most commonly found in damp or wet conditions and tend to move away from dry soil. The success of worm charming can often depend on these soil conditions, with charmers choosing damp locations or using water to attract the worms.\n\nWorms are sold as a live bait for fishermen, and many sellers use worm charming techniques to gather their stock. In some locations professional worm grunters need to obtain a permit in order to ply their trade.\n\nIn most competitions the fiddlers with the collector (or collectors) of the most worms in a set time being declared as the winners. They usually have a zone in which to perform their charming, measuring three yards square.\nOne of the first worm charming events took place in a school fête at Willaston County Primary School in Willaston, Cheshire. The \nWorld Worm Charming Championships started in 1980 and is now an annual event that celebrates the sport. It was organised by then-deputy headmaster John Bailey, who wrote the original rules for the competition.\n\nThe current world record was established on June 29, 2009, by 10-year-old Sophie Smith of Willaston, England, who raised 567 worms during Britain's World Worm Charming Championship.\n\nRules of The British and European Federation of Wormcharmers include a plot no greater than 3 metres by 3 metres, a five-minute warm up period, a three-person team of charmer, catcher and counter and that all worms must be returned to the ground after the contest according to the British Association of Worm Length Supporters (BAWLS).\n\nAlso known as the International Festival of Worm Charming, this event takes place in the small village of Blackawton, South Devon, during the early May Bank Holiday. It has been running since 1984 and is accompanied by a Real Ale Beer Festival and other activities.\n\nThe Great Canadian Worm Charming Championship and Festival Canadian Competition was held at the Shelburne Fiddle Park in Shelburne, Ontario, on June 9, 2012.\n\nThe town of Sopchoppy, Florida, has held an annual \"Worm Gruntin' Festival\" since 2000. The event includes a ball and the crowning of a \"Worm Gruntin' King and Queen\". Sopchoppy is one of the settings and worm grunting a plot element in the 2017 novel \"Clownfish Blues\" by Tim Dorsey.\n\n\n"}
