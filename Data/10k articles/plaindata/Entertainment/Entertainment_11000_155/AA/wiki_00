{"id": "17553510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17553510", "title": "American Ninja Challenge", "text": "American Ninja Challenge\n\nAmerican Ninja Challenge was a nationwide competition sponsored by G4 TV to send a number of American citizens to Japan to compete in the TBS hit TV show \"Sasuke\" (known as \"Ninja Warrior\" in US). American Ninja Challenge has been held since \"Sasuke\" 19 (the 19th competition) and currently merged into the TV series \"American Ninja Warrior\" that premiered on December 12, 2009 and succeeded American Ninja Challenge.\n\nG4's Attack of the Show hosts Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn broadcast a competition to ninja aspirees everywhere to create a video displaying their 'ninja moves'. Hundreds of people sent in submissions, and six finalists were selected. Through various competitions in America, the two winners were chosen; Collin Bell from Washington and Brett Sims from South Carolina went to Japan. They then participated in the Ninja Warrior Sasuke tournament.\n\nOnce the videos were sent in, six finalists were chosen. The six finalists were: Russelis Perry aka \"Blackie Chan\") from Colorado Springs, Colorado; martial artist Joe Simonsen from West Islip, New York; Freerunner Brian Orosco from San Francisco, California; Rick Seedman from New York City, New York; freerunner Levi Meeuwenburg from Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Mark Witmer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nThese six finalists then went to a US Navy training camp, where they competed on a marine training obstacle course. In '1v1' challenges, three of the six competitors were eliminated. Once there were three challengers left, they competed on an improvised course consisting of several of the new Ninja Warrior's most difficult obstacles.\n\nThe winner, Levi Meeuwenberg, cleared it in 45 seconds, followed by Brian Orosco at 1:12 and Russelis Perry in third place at 1:16. In Japan the two top finalists Levi and Brian were joined by former finalist Brett Sims to take on the course at Midoriyama.\n\nLevi and Brian, prior to leaving for Japan, met with U.S. Olympic athlete and Ninja Warrior competitor Paul Terek, who has reached the third stage in past Ninja Warrior competitions. Paul trained them in strategies and tactics to quickly and successfully defeat some of the trickier obstacles of Ninja Warrior. Afterward, they headed to Japan, where they enjoyed Japanese culture and met for a dinner with Ninja Warrior's all-stars, including Makoto Nagano, the winner of the 17th Ninja Warrior tournament. Some other all-stars they met were: Shingo Yamamoto, gas station manager, and firefighter Toshihiro Takeda, who has reached the third stage more than any other competitor.\n\nThe third American Ninja Challenge contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008, and aired as part of November 12, 2008. Viewers got to vote for their favorite competitors and the top three would be picked and flown directly to Japan to compete in Sasuke 21. The three winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and freerunner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg (the first woman to qualify) of Valley Village, California. These winners joined American Ninja Challenge 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from \"Attack of the Show!\", Olivia Munn and Kevin Pereira to compete. In Japan, they have the ultimate experience, along with training at Muscle Park, a scaled-down version of the Sasuke course located in a section of shopping mall called \"Muscule Park\".\n\nThe fourth and final Ninja Challenge contest winner was David Campbell. He joined up with former Ninja Challenge winners Luci Romberg and Levi Meeuwenberg to compete in Sasuke 22. Also joining them was the returning host Olivia Munn for the run to the top of mount Midoriyama. This season concluded the American Ninja Challenge, which subsequently evolved into its own national format - American Ninja Warrior. Beginning with the 4th season of American Ninja Warrior, the qualifiers would compete on a replicated Sasuke Midoriyama course in the Las Vegas, USA (and no longer participate in the Japanese version of the show). Beginning with ANW5, additional \"Special\" competitions would also be arranged between the finalists of the Japanese and USA editions of the show.\n\nThe popularity of the American Ninja Challenge led G4 to create a licensed version of \"Sasuke\" titled American Ninja Warrior, with contestants from the United States and all play-by-play commentary in English.\n\n\n"}

In 1611 he was granted a pension of two shillings a day, and in 1617 he accompanied James on his visit to Scotland. His influence was considerable and he was greatly courted and flattered, but his success appears to have turned his head. He became presumptuous, insolent, and mischievous and was much disliked by the members of the court. \nJames seems to have favoured him; indeed in August 1618, Archie got the monopoly on tobacco pipes.\n\nAt the Newmarket races in 1612, he even tried to excite jealousy between James and Henry, Prince of Wales, by pointing out how more courtiers stayed with Henry once they were parted. Thereafter Henry's friends would always toss Archie in a blanket when they saw him.\n\nIn 1623 he accompanied Prince Charles and Buckingham in their royal marriage negotiations in Spain, where he was much caressed and favoured by the Spanish court and, according to his own account, was granted a pension. His conduct here became more intolerable than ever. He rallied the infanta on the defeat of the Armada and censured the conduct of the expedition to Buckingham's face. Buckingham declared he would have him hanged, to which the jester replied that \"dukes had often been hanged for insolence but never fools for talking.\" On his return he gained some complimentary allusions from Ben Jonson by his attacks upon the Spanish marriage.\n\nHe retained his post on the accession of Charles I, and accumulated a considerable fortune, including the grant by the king of 1000 acres (4 km²) in Ireland. After the death of Buckingham in 1628, whom he declared \"the greatest enemy of three kings,\" the principal object of his dislike and rude jests was William Laud, whom he openly vilified and ridiculed.\n\nHe pronounced the following grace at Whitehall in Laud's presence: \"Great praise be given to God and little laud to the devil\" (Laud stood only five feet tall, and bitterly resented remarks on the subject), and after the news of the rebellion in Scotland in 1637 he greeted Laud on his way to the council chamber at Whitehall with: \"Who's fool now? Does not your Grace hear the news from Stirling about the liturgy?\" On Laud's complaint to the council, Archy was sentenced the same day \"to have his coat pulled over his head and be discharged the king's service and banished the king's court.\"\n\nHe settled in London as a money-lender, and many complaints were made to the privy council and House of Lords of his sharp practices. In 1641 on the occasion of Laud's arrest, he enjoyed a mean revenge by publishing \"Archy's Dream; sometimes Jester to his Majestie, but exiled the Court by Canterburie's malice\". Subsequently, he resided at Arthuret in Cumberland, according to some accounts his birthplace, where he possessed an estate, and where he died in 1672, his burial taking place on 1 April.\n\nHe was twice married, his second wife being Sybilla Bell. There is no record of any legal offspring, but the baptism of a \"base son\" of Archibald Armstrong is entered in the parish register of 17 December 1643. \"A Banquet of Jests: A change of Cheare\", published about 1630, a collection chiefly of dull, stale jokes, is attributed to him, and with still less reason probably \"A choice Banquet of Witty Jests ... Being an addition to Archee's Jests, taken out of his Closet but never published in his Lifetime\" (1660).\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}
{"id": "18813089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18813089", "title": "Baseball Talk", "text": "Baseball Talk\n\nBaseball Talk was a set of 164 \"talking\" baseball cards that were released by Topps Baseball Card Company and the LJN Corporation during the spring of 1989. Each card featured a plastic disk affixed to the back of an oversized baseball card. When placed in the SportsTalk player the cards would play two to three minutes of recorded audio. The player retailed for $24.99 and was labeled for ages six and up. It required four AA alkaline batteries to operate. The cards featured most of the better known players in baseball in 1988 and were sold in toy stores throughout the United States and Canada during 1989 Major League Baseball season. LJN and Topps planned to debut talking NFL and NBA cards (it stated in print advertising \"Coming Soon - NFL Football and NBA Basketball Talking Cards), but those plans, along with follow-up MLB editions, were canceled as the card players often broke or played with poor audio quality. Stores were flooded with returned boxes of Baseball Talk and by the fall of 1989 many of the cards and players could be found in discount bins at places like Toys R Us and Target. At one point, packs of cards that had been priced at $4 a piece were selling for as low as 50 cents by stores that were eager to move a failed product.\n\nThe SportsTalk player was sold with four cards (a checklist card that served as an introduction to the series, a Hank Aaron card, and the cards of 1988 stars Don Mattingly and Orel Hershiser). Additional cards were sold with four to a pack and were labeled in a manner that let the buyer know what cards were inside. Mel Allen narrated eight cards that featured highlights from historic games as well as 33 cards of former stars such as Babe Ruth and Duke Snider. Hall of Fame legends like Ted Williams, Sandy Koufax, Warren Spahn, Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Bob Feller were omitted from the set as they did not agree to take part.\n\nDon Drysdale interviewed the players of the National League for their cards and Joe Torre did the same for the American League players. Many of the cards featured amusing or humorous anecdotes, such as Mike Flanagan recounting how his Japanese baseball glove manufacturer (Mizuno) spelled his name \"Mike Franagan\" and that the company's executives told him, \"Mr. Franagan, we're very grad you use our grub.\"\n\nBecause the cards and players were on the market for a short period of time and that many of the players didn't work well, a complete set and a working player today are very rare and sell for a Beckett book value of $250–$300 (Beckett 2008 Almanac).\n\nThe following is the numerical checklist for the only set of cards ever released for Baseball Talk.\n\n1. 1975 World Series, Game 6 \n\n2. 1986 World Series, Game 6 \n\n3. 1986 ALCS, Game 5 \n\n4. 1956 World Series, Game 5 \n\n5. 1986 NLCS, Game 6 \n\n6. 1969 World Series, Game 5 \n\n7. 1984 World Series, Game 5 \n\n8. 1988 World Series, Game 1 \n\n9.

{"id": "9282855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9282855", "title": "Celebrity Big Brother 5 racism controversy", "text": "Celebrity Big Brother 5 racism controversy\n\nThe \"Celebrity Big Brother 5\" racism controversy was a series of events related to incidents of allegedly racist behaviour by contestants on the fifth series of the British reality television show \"Celebrity Big Brother\", broadcast on British television station Channel 4 in January 2007. The controversy centred on comments made by British contestants Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd, and Jo O'Meara, concerning Indian contestant Shilpa Shetty. The screening of these comments on UK television resulted in national and international media coverage, responses from the UK and Indian governments, and the show's suspension during the 2008 season.\n\nMany agencies and corporations cancelled their contracts with the housemates accused of racism, citing the allegations as the reason for the terminations. Also, many sponsors of the \"Big Brother\" series cancelled their sponsorship of the show. After the show, Goody stated that she understood her comments appeared as racist and apologised for any offence caused. Shetty later told the media that she forgave Goody. After conducting an investigation, Ofcom ruled that Channel 4 had breached the Broadcasting Code, and statutory sanctions were placed on the network.\n\nThe fifth UK series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\" began on Wednesday 3 January 2007. On the first day, eleven celebrity housemates entered the Big Brother House, including model Danielle Lloyd, singer Jo O'Meara and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. Then, on Friday 5, former \"Big Brother\" housemate Jade Goody entered the house, accompanied by her boyfriend Jack Tweed and her mother Jackiey Budden. Each day, Channel 4 broadcast a daily \"highlights\" show, featuring selected events of the previous 24 hours in the House, which itself was repeated the following morning, although offensive language and other potentially objectionable content was removed for pre-watershed broadcasting.\n\nDuring Budden's stay in the house, she and Shetty clashed on numerous occasions. Budden claimed that she was unable to pronounce \"Shilpa\", and referred to Shetty as \"Princess\" and \"the Indian\". During her eviction interview on Wednesday 10 January, after Budden used the term \"the Indian\", presenter Davina McCall did not question her use of the term – but focussed instead on Budden's failure to pronounce \"Shilpa\" properly. After Budden's eviction, Goody's boyfriend Jack Tweed called Shetty a \"cunt\", which was bleeped for broadcast, and a wanker. The night that Carole Malone was evicted, Lloyd referred to Shetty as a \"dog\".\nThe following day, Shetty cooked a chicken meal for the housemates. According to Lloyd and O’Meara, Shetty had undercooked the chicken. When they suggested that chicken may be cooked differently in India, O'Meara retorted: \"That's why they're all thin, because they're sick all the time, because they're ill.\" Lloyd also mentioned that she didn't like Shetty touching her food because she didn't \"know where her hands have been\".\nThe tensions in the house came to a peak on Tuesday 16 January, when an explosive argument between Shetty and Goody erupted, seemingly over stock cubes. During this argument, Goody told Shetty that she was \"no fucking princess here\", \"normal\" and needed \"a day in the slums\", while Shetty told Goody that she needed \"etiquette classes\" and that her \"claim to fame was [\"Big Brother\"]\". Lloyd and O'Meara laughed throughout the exchange and, when the argument had abated, Lloyd said: \"I think she should fuck off home. [...] Does that mean that I need elocution lessons, because she can't understand what I fucking say? She can't even speak English properly anyway.\"\nAfter the argument, Shetty asked fellow housemates if they thought they were \"reacting to [her] like this because [she was] Indian\". In a conversation with Cleo Rocos, who contested the idea that the others' motivation was racism, Shetty replied: \"It is, I'm telling you.\" However, in a later Diary Room conversation with Big Brother, she retracted this statement.\nThe next morning, in a conversation with Lloyd, Goody referred to Shetty as, amongst other things, \"Shilpa Poppadom\". Following this exchange, Goody was called to the Diary Room to explain her comment, where she clarified that she had not meant it with racist intent. The following day, Big Brother called Goody back to the Diary Room, where she was informed that: \"Big Brother will not tolerate any racist behaviour or anything that could be seen as racist behaviour.\" Goody then discussed the \"poppadom\" comment directly with Shetty, amongst other grievances the two had with each other. Finally, Goody apologised to Shetty, and Shetty apologised to Goody.\nOn Friday 19 January, Goody was eliminated from the competition by public vote (receiving 82% of the votes to evict), and left the House. Following O’Meara, Lloyd and Tweed’s eventual evictions from the House, Shetty was announced as the winner of the show on Sunday 28 January, with 63% of the public vote.\n\nOn 15 January, it was reported that media regulator Ofcom was investigating \"approximately 200 complaints of racism\" received by them. Following the broadcast of Lloyd and O'Meara's conversation about cooking in India, this number increased to 3,500 complaints, with a further 1,000 complaining to Channel 4 directly. By 5pm on Tuesday 16, the complaint figures stood at 10,000 to Ofcom, and 2,000 to Channel 4.\nOn 18 January – the day after the episode that included the \"Oxo cube\" argument, Lloyd's subsequent \"fuck off home\" remark and Shetty voicing her concern about potential racism – the chief executive of Ofcom, Ed Richards, stated that 25,000 complaints had been received, calling it a \"UK record\". Later that day, Channel 4's chief executive, Andy Duncan, spoke about the events of the series. He said that Channel 4 was \"very concerned by the number of complaints and some of the surrounding discussion and complaint\", and opined that \"the level of complaint and comment shows the programme has touched a real nerve.\" In addition, directory inquiry service 118 118 received \"1,058 angry callers\" during Wednesday's broadcast, which was after Shetty’s statement was shown.\nBy 20 January, the day after Goody's eviction, the number of complaints stood at 40,000. The final figure was clarified by Ofcom as \"just over\" 44,500 complaints. As of 2018, \"Celebrity Big Brother 5\" is the British television broadcast with the second highest number of complaints, after \"\".\n\nThe controversy generated over 300 newspaper articles in Britain, 1,200 in English newspapers around the globe, 3,900 foreign language news articles, and 22,000 blog postings on the internet.\nBritish tabloid newspapers were vitriolic towards Goody, Lloyd and O'Meara during their stay in the house – particularly towards Goody. \"The Daily Mirror\" ran a front-page editorial entitled \"Beauty V Bigot\", referring to her as a \"racist bully\". They later referred to Goody as a \"vile racist\", and to Lloyd as Goody's \"partner-in-crime\". In the same print, they misquoted Goody as saying \"Go back to the slums\" – she actually said \"You need a day in the slums\". On Friday 19 January, as Goody and Shetty faced the public vote for eviction that night, \"The Sun\"s front page carried the headline: \"Evict Face Of Hate\", accompanied by six photos of Goody and the official telephone number required to vote to evict her from \"Big Brother\".\nThe BBC became the subject of complaints after making the controversy its lead story, on the same day that Ruth Turner was arrested for her involvement in the Cash for Honours scandal.\n\nLeicester East MP Keith Vaz tabled an Early Day Motion in Parliament addressing this issue. The controversy coincided with a visit by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to India. When questioned by journalists, he said: \"I want Britain to be seen as a country of fairness and tolerance. Anything detracting from this I condemn.\" Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to comment on the issue as he had not seen the programme, although he did \"condemn racism in all its forms.\" London mayor Ken Livingstone stated, \"The racism towards Shilpa Shetty on \"Celebrity Big Brother\" is completely unacceptable\". He went on to accuse the producers of the programme of selectively editing the show \"to broadcast participants' racist comments\".\nAnand Sharma, India's junior minister for external affairs, told journalists that the Indian government would take \"appropriate measures\" once more information became available, while Kamal Nath, India's trade minister, reportedly said that \"Celebrity Big Brother\" could lead to a \"diplomatic crisis\".\nEquality and Human Rights Commission chairman Trevor Phillips stated that Channel 4 must \"make clear that they got it wrong, they intervened too little too late\". A small protest involving \"dozens\" of Shetty's fans took place in Patna, eastern India, during which straw effigies of \"Big Brother\" producers were burned. Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi, India's information and broadcasting minister, opined that Shetty should appear before the Indian high commission in London when she left the house, stating: \"If there has been some racism shown against her in the show, it is not only an attack on women but also on the skin and the country.\" The India Tourism Office placed an \"open letter\" to Goody as advertisements in several national newspapers, inviting her to \"experience the healing nature of India\".\n\nOn 18 January, The Carphone Warehouse suspended its sponsorship of \"Celebrity Big Brother\" with immediate effect over the alleged racism, before permanently ending its contract with Channel 4 altogether. Speaking about the suspension, the company's chief executive, Charles Dunstone, stated:\nOur concern has rapidly mounted about the broadcast behaviour of individuals within the \"Big Brother\" house. We are totally against all forms of racism and bullying and indeed this behaviour is entirely at odds with the brand values of the Carphone Warehouse. As a result we feel that as long as this continues we are unable to associate our brand with the programme. We had already made it clear to Channel 4 that were this to continue, we would have to consider our position. Nothing we saw last night gave us any comfort. Accordingly we have instructed Channel 4 to remove our sponsorship name and branding with immediate effect.\nOther sponsors of the show, including Beauty-boxes.com, Zamya, United Biscuits, Cobra Beer, Cow & Gate and Moneysupermarket.com withdrew sponsorship from the programme. Vanni Treves, Channel 4's former chairman, urged Channel 4 to cancel the show, while Hertsmere Borough Council, the owners of \"Big Brother\"'s studios in Borehamwood, threatened to refuse permission to film.\nFragrance chain The Perfume Shop, pharmacy chain Boots, and Debenhams department stores withdrew Jade Goody's brand of perfume, \"Shh...\", from their stores. HarperCollins cancelled plans to publish the paperback version of Jade Goody's autobiography. The book, titled \"Jade: My Autobiography\" was published in hardback in May 2006, and was scheduled to be released in paperback on 5 February 2007. A spokesman for the firm stated:\nIn light of recent events, HarperCollins has decided it wouldn't be appropriate to proceed with the paperback publication of Jade: My Autobiography as planned on 5 February. The author and agent support this decision.\nAct Against Bullying, a charity supported by Goody, dropped all mention of her from their website citing the racism allegations as the cause. Motorcycle insurance company Bennetts also terminated its six-figure agreement with Danielle to be the official model for their company, citing the racism allegations for this termination.\n\nOn 16 January, after thousands of complaints had been received, Channel 4 issued the following statement:Matters of bullying or racial abuse in any form are taken extremely seriously by Channel 4 and Endemol. The nature of the show often includes incidents where conflicts arise and housemates are encouraged to resolve issues among themselves. Housemates are closely monitored at all times to ensure they have the appropriate support inside the house which includes being able to talk in confidence to producers. Shilpa herself has not voiced any concerns of racial slurs or bullying against her. Appropriate measures to reprimand individual behaviour would take place where necessary.In spite of this, complaints figures continued to rise, leading the network to issue another statement the following day. They denied that any \"overt racial abuse or racist behaviour\" had occurred, but acknowledged that a \"cultural and class clash between [Shetty] and three of the British females\" had.\nIt is typical on \"Big Brother\" that live evictions are attended by a large crowd gathered outside the House and, following their interview with Davina McCall, evicted housemates then attend a press conference. Channel 4 announced on the afternoon of the eviction that both events had been cancelled, and that all profits from the vote to evict that week would be donated to charity.\nOn 22 January, Channel 4's board of directors held a meeting to discuss the issue. Following the meeting, its chairman issued the following statement:\nClearly many people were worried and offended by what they saw. I want to reassure them that we take the views of our audience very seriously and profoundly regret any offence that may have been caused. On behalf of the board the Chief Executive and I have commissioned a review of the editorial and compliance processes that support Big Brother. The board will receive a full report and seek to identify any lessons that can be learned for the future. The programme remains on air for a further week and the channel is focused on its completion. We are expecting to hear from Ofcom in the near future detailing the nature and number of complaints they have received and requesting a formal response to their questions. Our own review will also help support this process. All board members of Channel 4 abhor racism. We are also committed to ensuring that the channel continues to fulfil its remit to explore important social issues.\n\nThe launch show of \"Celebrity Big Brother\" (aired on 3 January 2007) averaged 7.1 million viewers, and ratings fell to 3.9 million by 7 January. Ratings quickly rose as media coverage reported alleged racism towards Shilpa from fellow female contestants; the episode which aired on 2007/01/16 saw a ratings boost with the show sharing 18% of the available audience and ratings of 4.5 million viewers. The episode the following night also rose in ratings, with 5.2 million viewers. The ratings once again rose on Jade's eviction night to an average of 7.8 million viewers, and a peak of 8.8 million viewers, which were the highest viewing figures in the history of \"Celebrity Big Brother\"' and second for any \"Big Brother\" show after the \"Big Brother 3\" finale, which landed a record 10 million viewers. The \"Big Brother 3\" final night was the same night that Jade left the house for the first time back in 2002.\n\nAfter Shetty confided in Cleo Rocos that she though the conflicts within the House could be racially motivated, her words compelled police to investigate whether or not to classify her treatment as 'racial hatred' under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986.\nOn Thursday 18 January, Hertfordshire Police released the following statement:\nHertfordshire Constabulary is investigating allegations of racist behaviour in the Big Brother house and will be conducting enquiries, including a review of the tapes. We will continue to liaise with Ofcom and with Endemol, whom we have strongly encouraged to ensure that any form of behaviour that could raise similar concerns, does not occur. We will continue to closely monitor the situation over the next few days. Hertfordshire Constabulary will not tolerate racism in any form and is taking these allegations seriously. The constabulary has experience of investigating and resolving incidents in the Big Brother house in past seasons.\nPolice also confirmed they had spoken to Goody and her mother Budden, stating:\nAn investigation into allegations of racist behaviour inside the Celebrity Big Brother house is continuing. Hertfordshire Constabulary can confirm police will be making approaches to speak to housemates if and when appropriate once they have left the house. We are also making contact with two of the housemates who have already been evicted but at this stage no interviews have taken place.\n\nOn 1 February, three days after the series concluded, an anonymous handwritten note was handed to the police, written on the back of a production schedule for an episode of \"Big Brother's Little Brother\", alleging that footage existed of some housemates singing a \"racist song\" featuring the word “\"paki\". Channel 4 confirmed that police would require a \"court order\" to see unbroadcast footage of the show. Ultimately, it transpired that untransmitted footage did exist, featuring some housemates creating a limerick about Shetty. The word \"paki\" was never actually used, but referred to.\nOn 9 March 2007, police stated that no formal charges would be brought against any of the participants of \"Celebrity Big Brother\", stating:\n[Channel 4] declined to co-operate and stated they would contest any application to court [...] Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, it was felt that it would not be in the public interest to effect arrests or to pursue footage through the courts. The CPS has concluded that whilst what occurred was clearly offensive, it was not criminal.\nThe police also confirmed that, without specifying names, they had interviewed four housemates in relation to the controversy, while two others “would not speak to them”.\n\nRegulatory authority Ofcom announced its intention to conduct the investigation into the viewer complaints about the series, and continued after the conclusion of the criminal investigation. Channel 4 made its submission to Ofcom in April. Channel 4 was criticised for the announcement and promotion of its eighth series of \"Big Brother\" before the investigation had concluded, with Ofcom stating that it was \"aware of the benefits\" of announcing its findings before the new series began.\nOfcom’s Adjudication of Findings was published on 24 May 2007. After examining a large number of events throughout the series, it decided that the broadcast of three events in particular had breached Ofcom's Broadcasting Code:\nIt also decided that, while Jackiey Budden's use of the expression \"The Indian\" was \"deeply offensive\", the circumstances and Channel 4's response led Ofcom to consider this matter resolved.\nChannel Four also confidentially supplied Ofcom with uncensored and untransmitted material from the programme. Firstly, this clarified Jack Tweed's use of the word \"cunt\", and not the word \"Paki\" which had been reported. However, this also revealed conversations that took place between Goody, Lloyd, O'Meara and Tweed on Tuesday 16 January 2007, a few hours after the \"Oxo cube\" row between Goody and Shetty. In the first conversation, they discussed whether \"the P word\" had been used by any housemate (which Jack clarified by saying \"It rhymes with tacky\"). In subsequent conversations, they created limericks which featured the rhyming words \"tacky\", \"happy\", \"nappy\", \"crappy\", \"yappy\" and \"strappy\". These conversations, which were never broadcast, led to Big Brother issuing formal warnings to O'Meara and Tweed in the Diary Room, threatening immediate ejection from the House if their behaviour recurred.\nChannel Four clarified that Brighter Pictures, the production company that supplies \"Big Brother\" to the channel, had suppressed the footage and logged the material under the heading \"racist\". However, Ofcom responded that although Channel Four were unaware of the material, it highlighted a significant breakdown in communication between it and the producers, meaning that they were \"not in possession of all the relevant facts and as a result, failed to maintain proper control over their programme\".\nAs a result of broadcasting the three offending scenes, repeating one of them in early morning syndication and for their failing to be aware of what was happening in the House at a critical time, Ofcom decided to impose an official sanction on the network, directing them to broadcast a statement of their findings three times during the broadcast of \"Big Brother 8\".\nOn the same day as Ofcom published their findings, Channel 4 issued a press statement accepting the verdict, with Chief Executive Andy Duncan stating:We accept Ofcom's judgement that on the occasions in question we did not ensure that \"Big Brother\" intervened with the necessary promptness or strength. We would like to say sorry once again for the offence caused to viewers as a result. Ofcom did not rule this material should not have been broadcast, but that we should have done more to contextualise it by challenging and reprimanding the offending housemates. We believe the initiatives we have announced will help prevent a repeat of the public offence caused by the programme.\n\nIn addition to Ofcom’s investigation of the series, Channel 4 also commissioned its own internal review of the events of the series. It concluded that: \"[...] great offence was caused by the broadcast of several comments made by housemates, irrespective of their motivation. Channel 4 appeared to be somehow condoning the behaviour of some of the housemates because interventions were felt to be too late or insufficiently forceful.\" Subsequently, the network agreed to change and improve their compliance systems, introduce an \"additional editorial perspective\", \"acknowledge and contribute to public debate provoked by its programmes\" and update the \"Big Brother\" rules. However, the review also commented on what it described as the \"hostile\" media coverage of the programme, and denied that Channel 4 had \"deliberately engineered\" tension in the House between Shetty and her housemates.\nNine days into the eighth series of \"Big Brother\", and exactly two weeks after Ofcom and Channel 4's separate findings were published, contestant Emily Parr was removed from the \"Big Brother\" House following her use of the term \"nigger\" during a conversation with another housemate. Subsequently, Channel 4 was praised by several sources.\n\"Celebrity Big Brother\" did not air in 2008, after Channel 4 decided to \"rest\" the format. It was replaced by \"\", before \"Celebrity Big Brother\" returned in January 2009. The contestants were spoken to \"in detail\" about the controversy, and how to avoid a repeat incident. On 26 August 2009, just before the conclusion of the tenth series of \"Big Brother\", Channel 4 announced that it would not be renewing its contract with Endemol to screen \"Big Brother\" after its end in 2010. The rights were bought by Channel 5, who broadcast the program for seven years before deciding not to renew their contract with Endemol in 2018.\n\nSince the controversy, and following the removal of Parr in the eighth series, \"Big Brother\" has continued to have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of any potentially offensive or discriminatory language – either on the programme or in public before it – resulting in the removal of several Housemates. These have included Ken Morley, Christopher Biggins, Rodrigo Alves, Tila Tequila, Andrew Tate and Ellis Hillon.\n\nAfter she was evicted from the House, Jade Goody made several appearances in the media, such as an interview with News of the World, and appearances on \"Big Brother's Little Brother\" and \"The Wright Stuff\", during which she apologised profusely for her behaviour on the programme, and confirmed that her fee for appearing on \"Celebrity Big Brother\" was being donated to charity. She maintained that she was not racist, but understood how her comments could have been interpreted as such. On 29 January, she was admitted to Priory Hospital for issues relating to mental health. She made few public appearances over the course of 2007. In 2008, she was offered a place on the second series of India's version of \"Big Brother\", entitled \"Bigg Boss\", which she accepted. The series was presented by her former housemate, and subject of the racism controversy, Shilpa Shetty, and the two were reunited on the launch night of the show. Two days into the series, Goody was forced to leave the Bigg Boss House, after receiving a call from her doctor indicating that she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. She released her second and final autobiography in September 2008, entitled \"Catch A Falling Star\". Her condition continued to worsen over the next few months and, in February 2009, she was informed that her cancer was terminal. She died on 22 March 2009.\n\nJo O'Meara, like Goody, was treated for mental health issues after she left the House. She gave an interview in which she described suicidal thoughts. In a statement on 1 February, she apologised for her behaviour, and also discussed her introduction into the house, her eviction, her interview with Davina McCall and the death threats she had received. A year later, she gave birth to a son. In 2015, she took part in an S Club 7 reunion, and continues to work in animal rights activism.\n\nDanielle Lloyd faced less hostility upon her eviction from the House, and continued to be a prominent figure in the media over the course of 2007 and 2008. In May 2007, she threatened to sue Endemol for unfair editing, and to make her own complaint to Ofcom. In 2017, Lloyd addressed the controversy in an episode of \"In Therapy\".\n\nShilpa Shetty, during her interview with McCall after being announced as the winner of the show, said:\n\n\"Things happen, people make mistakes and we all learn from them. But I can say one thing for sure. Jade didn't mean to be racist. She isn't a racist. I really don't want to leave England putting anyone in trouble. This country has given me so much. I just want to thank all of Great Britain for giving me this fantastic opportunity to make my country proud.\"\n\nIn May 2007, her next film, entitled \"Life In A... Metro\" became the first Bollywood film to premiere in Leicester Square. A year later, following Goody's brief appearance on \"Bigg Boss\", Shetty announced that she had forgiven her.\n"}
{"id": "371283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371283", "title": "Dame Edna Everage", "text": "Dame Edna Everage\n\nDame Edna Everage is a character created and performed by Australian comedian Barry Humphries, known for her lilac-coloured or \"wisteria hue\" hair and cat eye glasses or \"face furniture\", her favourite flower, the gladiolus (\"gladdies\") and her boisterous greeting: \"Hello, Possums!\" As Dame Edna, Humphries has written several books including an autobiography, \"My Gorgeous Life\", appeared in several films and hosted several television shows (on which Humphries has also appeared as himself and other alter-egos).\n\nHumphries has regularly updated Edna, originally a drab Melbourne housewife satirising Australian suburbia. Then he caused the Edna character to adopt an increasingly outlandish wardrobe after performances in London in the 1960s through which his Edna character grew in stature and popularity. Following film appearances and an elevation to damehood in the 1970s, the character evolved to \"Housewife and Superstar\", then \"Megastar\" and finally \"Gigastar\". Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Dame Edna became increasingly known in North America after multiple stage and television appearances.\n\nEdna describes her chat-shows as \"an intimate conversation between two friends, one of whom is a lot more interesting than the other\". The character has been used to satirise the cult of celebrity, class snobbery, and prudishness and is often used by Humphries to poke fun at the political leaders and fashions of the times. Her exuberant persona and scathing commentary on society and celebrity, as well as her habit of treating celebrities like ordinary people (on her TV shows) and ordinary people like celebrities (in her stage shows) have become signatures.\n\nAlthough Humphries freely states that Edna is a character he plays, Edna refers to Humphries as her \"entrepreneur\" or manager. Humphries and his staff of assistants and writers only refer to Edna as \"she\" and \"her\", never mixing the character with Humphries himself. It is this precision and richness of identity which gives Dame Edna her unique force as a character.\n\nIn March 2012, Humphries announced that the character would be retired at the end of the current stage tour;, but as of 2013 he has decided to bring her back.\n\nWhile Dame Edna is a fictitious character (whose life story has been entirely created by Barry Humphries), so complete is her identity as an individual that Macmillan published \"My Gorgeous Life\", Edna's \"autobiography\" (written by Humphries but credited to Edna herself), on its non-fiction list. Humphries has also written an \"Unauthorised Biography\" of his life as Edna's manager: \"Handling Edna\", published in 2010.\n\nAccording to \"My Gorgeous Life\", and statements Edna has made over the years, she was born Edna May Beazley in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, with a sibling who would give birth to Barry McKenzie. Everage started her stage career in a sketch entitled \"Olympic Hostess\" in the revue \"Return Fare\" on 19 December 1955 as Mrs. Norm Everage, an \"average Australian housewife\" from Moonee Ponds, a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria. She spends her time visiting world leaders and jet-setting between her homes in Los Angeles, London, Sydney, Switzerland and Martha's Vineyard. She is a friend and confidante of the Queen and has advised prime ministers and presidents. Edna once took an on-air phone call from President Ronald Reagan to assure him that he was, indeed, still the president; and at stageshows she has claimed to be giving former Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, elocution lessons.\n\nThe character has three adult children, Bruce, Kenny, and Valmai. Her first daughter, Lois, when still an infant, went missing and was believed to have been abducted by a \"rogue koala\" during a family camp-out in the outback, à la Azaria Chamberlain. In \"Handling Edna, the Unauthorised Biography\", Humphries absolves the koala of any role in the affair and reveals the true fate of Lois, who in fact survived abduction to become a Catholic nun. Edna's surviving daughter, Valmai, has assisted Dame Edna on her most recent programmes for ITV1, including \"The Dame Edna Treatment\" and has assisted on her live tour shows. Edna takes great pride in her two sons: Bruce, who works as an engineer in South Melbourne and is married to Joylene from Ivanhoe, and her youngest, Kenneth (or Kenny), who is a fashion designer in London and designs all of her frocks. Dame Edna refers often to him and his partner, Clifford Smale, both of whom Edna believes are searching for \"Miss Right\", although she admits they are looking \"in some very strange places\". Kenny appeared in Sir Les Patterson's documentary \"Les Patterson and the Great Chinese Takeaway\" as a boutique owner in Hong Kong. Dame Edna's mother is incarcerated in a \"maximum-security twilight home for the permanently bewildered\". Valmai and Kenny are the only family members (so far) who have appeared on stage or screen with their mother. Her husband, Sir Norman Everage, died in 1988 after many years in hospital suffering from prostate problems and a \"testicular murmur\"; Edna founded the non-profit \"Friends of the Prostate\" in his honour. Dame Edna was not with Norm when he died. And due to his insistence that all his organs be donated; by the time she reached his bedside, Norm had been \"globally recycled\" and all that remained was \"a dent in the pillow\". As a result, Dame Edna almost believed that Norm's cremation was a \"waste of money\".\n\nIn recent years, Edna has demonstrated her social conscience and sensitivity, telling audiences of her intention to adopt an African child from \"the country where Madonna shops for loved ones\".\n\nDame Edna spent many years accompanied by her bridesmaid and constant companion Madge Allsop (played by Emily Perry), a New Zealander from Palmerston North who assisted Dame Edna with her appearances and television shows. (Perry died at the age of 100 in 2008 and now Dame Edna's daughter Valmai has replaced her on stage). Madge never spoke a public word (although she sang on Comic Relief), and while she was often the butt of Dame Edna's jokes, the two were devoted. In \"Handling Edna, the Unauthorised Biography\", Humphries gives Madge a voice and explains the sad loss of her own husband in New Zealand's boiling mud, whilst the couple were on their honeymoon.\n\nOn some of her shows (\"The Dame Edna Experience\") Dame Edna was joined on stage by 'Chuck' (Charlton Heston) where he would be mildly humiliated and mistreated.\n\nDame Edna is praised for her insights into her homeland. When asked why Australians are so good at sport she commented: \"Good food and diet; open air life; juicy steaks; sunshine — and the total absence of any kind of intellectual distraction\".\n\nDame Edna launched a campaign to be appointed as a BBC newsreader in 2009 after the corporation announced it wished to seek a female newsreader over 50 years old.\n\nOn 7 March 2007, Melbourne renamed a city street in her honour: Dame Edna Place, formerly Brown Alley off Little Collins Street, was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, John So. Dame Edna Place is opposite Royal Arcade and The Causeway, between the major roads, Elizabeth Street and Swanston Street; it was, until its renaming, a service alley for adjoining buildings. Dame Edna was not at the renaming ceremony but was represented by ten look-alike Dames. Everage Street in suburban Moonee Ponds has also been named in her honour.\n\nIn 1982, Dame Edna's alter-ego Barry Humphries was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for \"services to the theatre\" and on 16 June 2007 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to entertainment.\n\nIn MAC Cosmetics 2008 Winter Line-Up, a Dame Edna collection of cosmetics were released including eye shadow, lipstick, powder, and nail polish.\n\nA bronze statue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands in January 2009. It is located by the Yarra river near Harbour Town which also includes statues of singer John Farnham, Dame Nellie Melba, and Graham Kennedy.\n\nBarry Humphries was invited to join the fledgling Union Theatre Repertory Company early in 1955 and toured Victorian country towns performing \"Twelfth Night\", directed by Ray Lawler. On tour, Humphries invented Edna gradually as part of the entertainment for the actors during commutes between country towns. Humphries gradually developed a falsetto impersonation of a Melbourne housewife, imitating the Country Women's Association representatives who welcomed the troupe in each town. At Lawler's suggestion, Mrs Everage (later named Edna after Humphries' nanny) made her first appearance in a Melbourne University's UTRC revue at the end of 1955, as the city prepared for the 1956 Olympic Games. The sketch involved a houseproud \"average housewife\" offering her Moonee Ponds home as an Olympic billet, spruiking her home as possessing \"burgundy wall-to-wall carpets, lamington cakes and reindeers frosted on glass dining-room doors\".\n\nAt this time the character was billed as \"Mrs Norm Everage\" (Humphries describing this name as \"Everage as in 'average', husband Norm as in 'normal'\") and had none of the characteristic flamboyant wardrobe of later years.\n\nHis mother (whom the interviewer William Cook said \"sounds like a frightful snob\") was a major inspiration for Edna, although he denied it when she was alive to protect her feelings. Her first monologue in 1955 was about her \"lovely home\", reflecting young Barry’s own site visits accompanying his builder father. Originally she was a \"mousy\" character and too quiet to please the raucous crowd at The Establishment club in London.\n\nAccording to one author, Edna came into her own during the 1980s when the policies of Thatcherism—and what he described as the \"vindictive style of the times\"—allowed Dame Edna to sharpen her observations accordingly. Lahr wrote that Edna took Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's \"seemingly hypocritical motto\" of \"caring and compassion\" for others and turned it on its head, Edna became the voice of Humphries' outrage.\n\nHumphries played the character at comedy clubs, satirising the atmosphere of 1950s Melbourne suburbia. An interview with \"Mrs Everage\" was one of the programmes screened on HSV-7's first day of programming in 1956. Another revue called Rock'n'Reel followed in 1958 at the New Theatre in Melbourne. She appeared in a televised revue shown on New Year's Eve, 1958, \"Wild Life and Christmas Belles\".\n\nThe character's overseas debut, now as Edna Everage, was in the early 1960s at comedian Peter Cook's nightclub, The Establishment, in London's West End, where she received a poor review from Bamber Gascoigne, then the drama critic for \"The Spectator\". Barry Humphries cites Cook as being instrumental in launching Edna's UK career. While her first appearances at the Establishment Club was a flop, the mousy Edna being too quiet to please that raucous crowd, a 2016 interviewer William Cook saw the early failure as a blessing, so that Humphries spent the sixties as a jobbing actor rather than as a pampered star.\n\nIn 1972, the character appeared as Barry McKenzie's \"Aunt Edna\" in the film, \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\". In the sequel \"Barry McKenzie Holds His Own\", the Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam cameos at the close of the film to confer upon Edna the title of Dame, henceforth to be known as \"Dame Edna\".\n\nFollowing the lukewarm reception to Edna's early appearances in Humphries' 1969 stageshow \"Just a Show\" and the BBC television series \"The Barry Humphries Scandals\", a growing awareness and appreciation among British audiences for Edna emerged and Humphries devised a stage show titled \"Edna Everage Housewife Superstar\" which was successfully presented in London's West End in the mid-1970s. The show featured monologues, songs and what was becoming an Edna trademark – interaction with the theatre audience.\n\nIn April 1976, Edna made an appearance in \"A Poke in the Eye (with a Sharp Stick)\" – the first of what became Amnesty International's Secret Policeman's Ball series of benefit shows. Edna performed a song for the show and was featured in the film of the show. She also appeared in the 1981 Amnesty show \"The Secret Policeman's Other Ball\". Edna made a cameo appearance in the 1978 film \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". In 1979 she was the subject of a BBC \"Arena\" mockumentary: \"La Dame aux Gladiolas\".\n\nHumphries debuted the character off-Broadway in New York City in the late 1970s, but the show received such a poor review from \"The New York Times\" that Humphries later joked that he thought, \"Well, I'll go back to Broadway but I'll wait till the critic's dead – and I had to wait 25 years. I had to wait a quarter of a century for that critic to die\".\n\nDame Edna's success grew in the UK throughout the 1980s and early 1990s with semi-regular stage and television shows. Her first TV specials were in 1978/79 on BBC, but she became popular with broadcaster ITV after her initial performance on \"An Audience With...Dame Edna Everage\" in 1980, in front of an audience of invited celebrities. She went on to perform two more \"An Audience With...\" specials (in 1984 and 1988), the only performer ever to make three shows in the series.\n\nIn 1987, Edna starred alongside Humphries's vulgar alter-ego Les Patterson in the comedy feature \"Les Patterson Saves the World\". In the same year \"The Dame Edna Experience\", ostensibly a talk show which she described as \"really a monologue interrupted by total strangers\" aired, featuring high-profile \"celebrity guests\" such as Sean Connery, Mel Gibson, Joan Rivers, and Germaine Greer (an old friend of Humphries'), as well as Madge, her silent, sour-faced \"bridesmaid and travelling companion\". In 1989, the show was back for a second season, this time taking place in her \"luxury penthouse suite\" where her guests stayed and, in the case of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, did her grocery shopping. Subsequently, these shows were aired in the U.S. on PBS, broadening her audience and enlarging her fame. \"Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch\" a reality/game show hybrid, aired in 1992, and saw her and Madge having a look at her \"by invitation only, ladies audience\" member's houses, and evaluating their housekeeping skills. U.S. television specials followed, as did an unsuccessful series which aired only one episode. She appeared as a guest of Phil Donahue on his talk show on 17 February 1993.\n\nIn 1997, she appeared in another television talk show \"Dr Dame Edna Kisses It Better\". Edna continued her Australian stage and television appearances including a record five appearances as guest presenter at the TV Week Logie Awards and a role as a co-narrator (along with Humphries and Les Patterson) of the ABC's Australian social history series \"Barry Humphries Flashbacks\" in 1999.\n\nIn 2000 and 2004, Dame Edna appeared on Broadway, and toured America with both shows. These were ostensibly not \"performances\", but rather \"appearances\", with Dame Edna giving monologues and interacting with audience members. Her 2000 show, \"The Royal Tour,\" won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show, and a Tony Award.\n\nDuring 2001 and 2002, Dame Edna appeared in the fifth season of the television show \"Ally McBeal\" playing the guest role of Claire Otoms, a client of the show's law firm who later became a secretary at the same firm. The character shared Dame Edna's voice and style and was explicitly listed in the opening credits as being played by Dame Edna Everage (although Barry Humphries received a credit in the closing credits). Claire Otoms is an anagram of \"A Sitcom Role\".\n\nIn the 2002 motion picture \"Nicholas Nickleby\" Dame Edna plays the role of Mrs. Crummles, an actress and wife of the manager of a provincial theatre company. Barry Humphries also appears in the film as Mr. Leadville.\n\nDame Edna appeared at the Party at the Palace in London in 2002 where she referred to the Queen as the \"jubilee girl\".\n\nThe nostalgic \"Barry Humphries: Back to my Roots\" tour featured Humphries, Edna, Sir Les and Sandy Stone around Australia in 2003.\n\nIn 2003, she had an interview punctuated with NPR Weekend Edition's host Scott Simon's table-pounding laughter.\n\nThe character celebrated her 50th \"birthday\" in 2005. To mark the occasion, in 2006, Australia Post featured Edna on a postage stamp and the Lord Mayor of Melbourne presented Edna with the key to the city. She toured Australia with the stageshow \"Barry Humphries Back With a Vengeance\" and appeared on camera \"together\" with Humphries for the first time in an interview by Ray Martin for Australia's 60 Minutes. She also appeared on screen at the Closing Ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne while 1000 \"Commonwealth Dames\" danced around the arena wearing purple wigs, garish costumes and gladioli, singing along to her song, \"We've Made The Most Of Melbourne\" : \"It's not as small as Adelaide, Compared to Canberra, it's bliss, And if you've been to Melbourne, You can give Sydney a miss.\"\n\nOn 20 May 2006 she appeared on ITV's coverage of The Prince's Trust 30th Birthday Concert.

The show opened as the second production for the newly refurbished Henry Miller's Theatre and was planned to run from 18 March through 18 July 2010 (with previews beginning on 22 February), but lukewarm reviews and low ticket sales led to the limited engagement being cut short and closing on 4 April 2010, after 27 previews and 20 regular performances.

Actress Salma Hayek responded angrily, penning a furious letter in which she denounced Dame Edna. After \"Vanity Fair\" received death threats, the magazine published a full-page apology to the Hispanic community.\n\nHumphries commented later: \"If you have to explain satire to someone, you might as well give up\". When Dame Edna was questioned about the controversy on the eve of her 2003 Australian tour, she retorted that Hayek's denunciation was due to \"professional jealousy\", and that Hayek was envious because the role of painter Frida Kahlo (for which Hayek received an Oscar nomination) had originally been offered to Edna:\n\nWhen I was offered the part of Frida I turned it down, and she was the second choice. I said 'I'm not playing the role of a woman with a moustache and a monobrow, and I'm not having same-sex relations on the screen' ... I'm not racist. I love all races, particularly white people. You know, I even like Roman Catholics.\n\nIn 1994, she was impersonated by Simon Amstell on \"Good Morning with Anne and Nick\". Dame Edna has been mentioned on \"The Simpsons\" in \"The Regina Monologues\", \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\", and \"HOMR\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2840857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2840857", "title": "Dennō Senshi Porygon", "text": "Dennō Senshi Porygon\n\nThe episode is infamous for certain repetitive visual effects that induced photosensitive epileptic seizures in a substantial number of Japanese viewers, an incident referred to as the by the Japanese press. As a result of the seizures 685 viewers were taken to hospitals; 2 people remained hospitalized for more than two weeks. Due to this, the episode has not been rebroadcast worldwide. After the incident, the \"Pokémon\" anime went into a four-month hiatus, and it returned on TV Tokyo on April 16, 1998, thus making the episode perhaps the most controversial episode of the entire \"Pokémon\" series. Since then, the episode has been parodied and referenced in cultural media, including \"The Simpsons\" and \"South Park\".\n\nAsh, Misty, Brock and Pikachu discover that the system used to transfer Pokémon from one Pokémon Center to the other is malfunctioning. On Nurse Joy's request, they go to Professor Akihabara, the one who created the Poké Ball transfer system. He tells them that Team Rocket stole his prototype Porygon, a digital Pokémon that can exist in cyberspace, and is using it to steal trainers' Pokémon from inside the computer system.\n\nAkihabara sends Ash, Misty, Brock, Pikachu and his second Porygon into the system to stop Team Rocket, whom they learn have set up a blockade that stops Pokéballs from traveling the network. Porygon is able to defeat Team Rocket's Porygon, but Nurse Joy, monitoring the situation and unaware that Ash and the others are inside, has sent an anti-virus program into the system to combat the computer virus Team Rocket set up. Pikachu uses a Thunderbolt attack on the program, which manifests as \"vaccine missiles\", which causes an explosion. The group and Team Rocket successfully escape the computer, and with Team Rocket's blockade removed, the system returns to normal.\n\n\"Dennō Senshi Porygon\" aired in Japan on December 16, 1997 at 6:30 PM Japan Standard Time (09:30 UTC). It was broadcast over 37 TV stations that Tuesday night. It held the highest ratings for its time slot and was watched by approximately 4.6 million households.\n\nTwenty minutes into the episode, Pikachu stops \"vaccine\" missiles with his Thunderbolt attack, resulting in an explosion that flashes red and blue lights. Although there were similar parts in the episode with red and blue flashes, two anime techniques, \"paka paka\" and \"flash\" made the scene particularly intense. These flashes were bright strobe lights, with blinks at a rate of about 12 Hz for approximately six seconds.\n\nAt this point, viewers started to complain of blurred vision, headaches, dizziness and nausea. Some experienced seizures, blindness, convulsions and loss of consciousness. Japan's Fire Defense Agency reported that 685 viewers – 310 boys and 375 girls – were taken to hospitals by ambulances. Although many victims recovered during the ambulance trip, more than 150 were admitted to hospitals. Two were hospitalized for more than two weeks. Some had seizures when parts of the scene were rebroadcast during news reports on the seizures. Only a small fraction of the 685 children treated were diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy. The incident was referred to as by the Japanese press,\n\nLater studies showed that 5–10% of the viewers had mild symptoms that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who were not sent to hospital reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over three years after the event found that most had no further seizures. Scientists believe that the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by the \"Pokémon\" episode was unprecedented.\n\nAn article in \"USA Today\" reassured parents that American children were unlikely to suffer seizures provoked by cartoons as US networks did not air anime, with its \"fast-paced style of animation\", though anime has become more prevalent on American television since. The incident was included in the 2004 edition and the 2008 Gamer's Edition of the Guinness World Records book, holding the record for \"Most Photosensitive Epileptic Seizures Caused by a Television Show\".\n\nNews of the incident spread quickly through Japan. The following day the television station that had originated the lone broadcast of that episode, TV Tokyo, issued an apology to the Japanese public, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures. Officers from Atago Police stations were ordered by Japan's National Police Agency to question the anime's producers about the show's contents and production process. An emergency meeting was held by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in which the case was discussed with experts and information collected from hospitals. Video retailers all over Japan removed the \"Pokémon\" anime from their rental shelves.\n\nReaction was swift on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Nintendo's shares fell by 400 yen (almost 5%) the following morning to 12,200 yen. Nintendo produces the game upon which the \"Pokémon\" anime series is based. Then-president of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, said at a press conference the day after the episode had aired that the video game company was not responsible since the original \"Pokémon\" game for its Game Boy product was presented in black and white.\n\nAfter the airing of \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\", the \"Pokémon\" anime went into a four-month hiatus until it returned in April 16, 1998 with airing of \"Pikachu's Goodbye\" and \"The Battling Eevee Brothers\". After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday. The opening theme was also redone, and black screens showing various Pokémon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen. Before the seizure incident, the opening was originally one Pokémon image per screen. Before the resumption of broadcast, was shown. Broadcast in Japan on April 16, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over the circumstances of the program format and the on-screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime being cancelled. Many Japanese television broadcasters and medical officials came together to find ways to make sure the incident was not repeated. They established a series of guidelines for future animated programs, including:\n\n\nThis episode kept the episodes \"Rougela's Christmas\" (\"Holiday Hi-Jynx\") and \"Iwark as a Bivouac\" (\"Snow Way Out!\") off their original broadcast date in Japan following the incident. Those two episodes were about to air after \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\" on December 23, 1997 and January 6, 1998 respectively. They were eventually only aired on October 5, 1998 as an hour-long special. Airing out of order caused confusion to viewers because Ash still had a Charmander instead of Charizard, and Misty did not have Togepi yet, but Starmie and Horsea. Also, a New Year special was about to air between these episodes on December 30, 1997, but it was cancelled after TV Tokyo pulled any mention of Pokémon from their channel following the incident.\n\nTo prevent any similar incidents from occurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, and it has not aired since in any country. After the Pokémon incident, TV broadcasters voluntarily added on-screen warnings to shows targeted at young children encouraging viewers to watch anime in a well-lit room and to sit far away from the television set. In an effort to put the event out of public concern and prevent victims from reliving the traumatizing event, the anime has not featured Porygon in any subsequent episodes.\n\nThe \"Pokémon Shock\" incident has been parodied many times in popular culture, including an episode of \"The Simpsons,\" \"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\". In the episode, the Simpson family travels to Japan. When they arrive at their hotel in Tokyo, Bart is seen watching an anime entitled Battling Seizure Robots featuring robots with flashing eye lasers, and asks: \"Isn't this that cartoon that causes seizures?\", and the flashing eyes cause him to have a seizure. Marge and Lisa are also affected and Homer walks in seeing them all convulsing on the floor and joins in. The same scene is seen again in the episode's end credits, this time covering the entire screen.\n\nAn episode of \"South Park\" that first aired in November 1999, \"Chinpokomon\", revolves around a \"Pokémon\"-like phenomenon, called \"Chinpokomon\", with which the children of South Park become obsessed. \"Chinpokomon\" toys and video games are sold to American children in South Park by a Japanese company. The company's president, Mr. Hirohito, uses the toys to brainwash the American children, making them into his own army to topple the \"evil\" American \"empire\". These toys included a video game in which the player attempts to bomb Pearl Harbor. While playing this game, Kenny has an epileptic seizure and later dies, in reference to the \"Pokémon\" seizure incident.\n\nIn the pilot episode of \"Drawn Together\", Ling-Ling, who is a parody of Pikachu, states that his goal in the Drawn Together house is to \"destroy all, and give children seizures\". There follows a scene with flashing lights.\n\nIn \"So Yesterday\", a novel by Scott Westerfeld, this episode is mentioned and shown to one of the characters. The flashing red light that caused the seizure is also used in the story telling elements.\n\n"}

It is the fourth installment of \"The Fast and the Furious\" franchise. The film, which stars Vin Diesel, \nPaul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster, is set between the second and installments and bridges from the first film into a present-day setting, with main members of the original cast reprising their roles. Originally released on April 3, 2009, it received negative reviews upon release, but was a box office success grossing $363 million worldwide. It was followed by \"Fast Five\" in 2011.\n\nFor this entry and onward \"Fast & Furious\" is the official brand name of the franchise, which was used for future installments, as well as video games and a .\n\nFive years after the first film, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his new crew, consisting of his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Tego Leo (Tego Calderon), Rico Santos (Don Omar), Cara (Mirtha Michelle) and Han Lue (Sung Kang), are hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic. Dominic suspects that the police are on their trail, forcing the crew to disband and go their separate ways, with Han deciding to go to Tokyo. Realizing that he must leave, Dominic runs, leaving Letty behind to protect her from harm.\n\nThree months later, Dominic is now residing in Panama City. He gets a call from his sister, Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), who tells him that Letty has been murdered. Dominic heads back to Los Angeles to attend her funeral and examine the crash and finds traces of nitromethane on the ground. He visits the only car mechanic that sells nitromethane in LA and forces him into giving him the name David Park, the man who ordered the fuel, and informs him that the only car that uses nitromethane in the area is a green 1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport.\n\nMeanwhile, FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is trying to track down a Mexican drug lord, Arturo Braga (John Ortiz). His search leads him to David Park, and he tracks him down using an illegal modification record on his car. Dominic arrives at Park's apartment first and hangs him out of the window by his ankles before Brian arrives. Brian saves Park and Park becomes the FBI's new informant. Park gets Brian into a street race. Brian selects a modified 2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 from the impound lot. Dominic races in his modified 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454. Gisele Yashar (Gal Gadot), the liaison for Braga, reveals that the winner will become the last driver on a team that traffics heroin between the Mexico–United States border. Dominic wins by bumping Brian's car while it is in nitro, making him lose control. Brian uses his power as an FBI agent to arrest another driver, Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team.\n\nThe team meets up with Braga's personal henchman, Fenix, and Dominic notices that Fenix drives the same Torino the mechanic described. They drive across the border using underground tunnels to avoid detection. Brian has prior knowledge that after the heroin was delivered, Braga ordered the drivers to be killed. Upon discovering this, Dominic confronts Fenix and learns that he himself killed Letty when she tried to escape him. A stand-off ensues, though not before Dominic creates a diversion by loosening his car with nitrous – sparking a vehicle explosion that destroys his car and several others, including Brian's. In the ensuing chaos, Dominic and Brian hijack a 1999 Hummer H1 with $60 million worth of heroin in it. Dominic and Brian drive back to LA and hide the heroin in a police impound lot, where Brian picks up a modified Subaru Impreza WRX STI Hatchback; they subsequently drive back to Dominic's house, where they reunite with Mia.\n\nDominic finds out Brian was the last person to contact Letty, which results in Dominic attacking Brian until Brian explains that Letty was working undercover - she was tracking down Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's record. Brian tells his superiors that in exchange for Dominic's pardon, he will lure Braga into a trap, forcing him to show up to exchange money for the heroin. At the drop site, the man who claims to be \"Braga\" is revealed as a decoy, and \"Campos\" – the real Braga – escapes with Fenix and the pair flee to Mexico. In the ensuing chaos, Fenix nearly runs over Gisele, before Dom saves her.\n\nBrian and Dominic travel to Mexico to catch Braga, with the help of Gisele, who gives them directions as a favored return for Dom saving her life. Brian and Dom find him at a church and apprehend him. As Braga's henchmen try to rescue him, Brian and Dominic drive through the underground tunnels back to the United States. Brian crashes his car after taking fire from Braga's men. He is then injured after being T-boned by Fenix. Before Fenix can kill Brian, Dominic drives into and kills Fenix. As police and helicopters approach the crash site on the American side of the border, Brian tells Dominic to leave, but Dominic refuses – saying he is not running anymore. Despite Brian's request for clemency, the judge sentences Dominic to 25 years to life. Brian resigns from the FBI and Dominic boards a prison bus that will transport him to Lompoc penitentiary. As the bus drives down the road, Brian, Mia, Leo, and Santos arrive in their cars to intercept it.\n\n\nThe film was announced in July 2007. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and the rest of the cast of the original film all reprised their roles. Filming began in 2008. The movie cars were built in Southern California's San Fernando Valley. Around 240 cars were built for the film. However, the replica vehicles do not match the specifications they were supposed to represent. For example, the replica version of \"F-Bomb\", a 1973 Chevrolet Camaro built by Tom Nelson of NRE and David Freiburger of \"Hot Rod\" magazine, included a 300 hp crate V8 engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission, whereas the actual car included a twin-turbo 1,500 hp engine and a 5-speed transmission.\n\nThe original Dodge Charger 426 Hemi R/T that was used in the original movie was a 1970, but the car in this movie was a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi with a slightly modified front grill and rear tail lights to appear as a 1970 car; the original 1970 Dodge Charger was in pieces, being totally disassembled for restoration.\n\nThe original red 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 seen in the end credits of the first Fast & Furious movie, also makes an appearance but is later highly modified for a street race.\n\nThe most radical vehicles built for the film were the Chevy trucks constructed for the fuel heist. Powered by 502ci GM big block motors, the '67 had a giant ladder-bar suspension with airbags using a massive 10-ton semi rear axle with the biggest and widest truck tires they could find. The '88 Chevy Crew Cab was built with twin full-floating GM 1-ton axles equipped with Detroit Lockers and a transfer case directing power to both axles and capable of four-wheel burnouts.\n\nAnother vehicle built for the film was the blue Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 owned by an uncredited owner which brought a 241-mile per hour top speed at the Bayshore Route Highway in Japan. It was a hard car to build by the production so they made clones by acquiring Nissan Skyline 25GT's and made them look like the original car. The Skyline \nthat was also used at the desert was actually a dune buggy using a Skyline R34's shell.\n\nThe score to \"Fast & Furious\" was composed by Brian Tyler, who recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox. The score album was released on CD by Varèse Sarabande Records with over 78 minutes worth of music.\n\nThe trailers for the film feature the track \"We Are Rockstars\" by Does It Offend You, Yeah? and a Travis Barker-remixed version of \"Crank That\" by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em.\n\nThe official soundtrack was released on March 31, 2009 on Star Trak. The first single from the soundtrack was titled \"Blanco\" and is by Pitbull featuring Pharrell Williams and is produced by The Neptunes. The second single from the album is \"Krazy\" by Pitbull featuring Lil Jon. The track is also featured on Pitbull's album \"Rebelution\". The third and final single from the album is \"Bad Girls\" by Robin Thicke. The soundtrack also features the song \"G-Stro\" by Busta Rhymes featuring Pharrell Williams and also produced by The Neptunes. The track is a leftover track from Busta Rhymes' album \"Back on My B.S.\" Amazon.com gave the album an average score of 3.5 out of 5, calling it a Spanish-themed rap soundtrack with mostly average tracks. Interscope and Star Trak Records released the soundtrack for the film with \"Crank That\" not included.\n\nAnother song that was omitted from the album was song \"Rising Sun\" by South Korean group TVXQ.\n\nThe Japanese version of the movie features the song \"Before I Decay\" by Japanese rock group The GazettE.\n\nAlso featured in the background under a club scene which was omitted from the album, was song \"Ride\" written by Kervins Joseph and Travis Baker, published by InDigi Avenue Music Publishing (ASCAP), courtesy InDigi Music, and Virtual Diva performed by Don Omar.\n\nIt was originally set to release on June 12, 2009, but moved it up to April 3, 2009 instead.

{"id": "27290468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27290468", "title": "Graphic Artists Guild", "text": "Graphic Artists Guild\n\nThe Graphic Artists Guild is a guild of graphic designers, illustrators, and photographers and is organized into seven chapters around the United States. It is a member of the international organization Icograda.\n\nIn the mid-1960s most automobile advertising contained illustrations, not photographs. Many of the illustrators who worked for the advertising agencies servicing the automobile industry were unhappy with their pay and working conditions. Many were members of the Society of Illustrators, but they were told that the Society did not do advocacy work. So those artists banded together to form the Guild as a union of artists. On November 2, 1967, the Graphic Artists Guild charter, based on the Screen Actors Guild constitution, was signed in Detroit, Michigan, by 113 artists. After the Detroit chapter, and the first national office (eventually located in New York City), were founded, artists organized chapters in Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; and San Francisco, California.\n\nIn 1970, the Detroit chapter called a strike against Campbell-Ewald, the advertising agency that serviced Chevrolet. Guild members struck for better wages and the right of Campbell-Ewald's freelance graphic artists to accept work from other clients. The strike failed when Campbell-Ewald hired scabs to break the strike. With the failure of the strike the Detroit chapter declined and the Guild's headquarters was moved to New York.\n\nOver the years, the Guild has merged with several other artists groups, including the Illustrators Guild in 1976, the Graphic Artists for Self-Preservation and the Creative Designers Guild in 1978, the Textile Designers Guild in 1979, the Cartoonist Guild in 1984, the Coalition of Designers in 1987, and the Society of Professional Graphic Artists in Seattle became the Guild’s Seattle chapter in 1993.\n\nIn December 2008, the Guild sued the Illustrators Partnership of America and five individuals for libel regarding what the Guild considered defamatory public comments in connection with the IPA's effort to form a separate illustrators rights-collecting society with 13 organizations, the American Society of Illustrators Partnership. In 2011, Judge Debra James of the Supreme Court, Civil Branch, New York County, dismissed this US$1 million-dollar tortious interference and defamation lawsuit. The Guild filed a motion to appeal.\n\nFor most of its history, the Graphic Artists Guild has been an independent union, negotiating its first collective bargaining contract for artists at the Children’s Television Workshop in 1986. In 1993 the Guild became the collective bargaining agent for the graphic artists employed at Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) primary member station, WNET. After years of negotiations with the American Federation of Teachers, Communications Workers of America, and the United Auto Workers (UAW), the Guild in 1999 voted to affiliate with the UAW, becoming Local 3030. Affecting the Guild's decision were the experiences of the National Writers Union, which had seen 50% membership growth under UAW auspices.\n\nAs Guild membership declined from 2,083 in 1999 to 1,832 in 2003, the Guild's affiliation with UAW became economically unfeasible. In 2004, a majority of the Guild members voted to disaffiliate at the end of the five-year agreement.\n\nIn the 1970s, Guild lobbying helped sway the Copyright Royalty Tribunal to raise fees and improve reporting procedures regarding use of previously published art for PBS and its affiliate stations.\n\nIn 1979, the Guild began a long-term campaign to stop work-for-hire contracts, where the art buyer assumes control over a freelance artist's work. A 1989 Supreme Court decision, Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, followed the Guild's position to rule that a company obtaining the services of a freelancer cannot compel a work-for-hire situation, or assume one is in place, unless both parties sign a written contract agreeing to such an arrangement.\n\nIn 1980, the Guild represented a group of textile designers, terminated by Print-a-Pattern for trying to form a union, in an unfair labor practices action before the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nIn the early 1980s, artists' fair-practices law based on the Guild's model law were passed in California, New York, and Oregon. In response to Guild opposition, the IRS withdrew a proposed rule that would have disallowed a home studio deduction where the artist had a primary source of income at another location and from another type of work.\n\nIn 1985, the Boston chapter succeeded in passing the Arts Preservation Act in Massachusetts, which states, \"No person, except an artist who owns or possesses a work of fine art which the artist has created, shall intentionally commit, or authorize the intentional commission of any physical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction of a work of fine art.\"\n\nUnder the Tax Reform Act of 1986, writers and artists were barred from deducting expenses except in the year in which they booked the income for those expenses. The Graphic Artists Guild and 44 other artists groups successfully lobbied to have that provision repealed in 1988.\n\nIn 2002 the Northern California Chapter lobbied the state's Board of Equalization on behalf of illustrator Heather Preston. This effort resulted in a ruling that virtually exempts sales tax on all on the artwork of graphic artists.\n\nIn April 2010, the Graphic Artists Guild filed suit against Google to halt further development of the Google Books Library Project. The issue in the lawsuit is Google’s digitization of millions of books for the benefit of Google Books. The books in dispute include protected visual works, such as photographs, illustrations, and charts. Google had previous negotiated a settlement with text authors and other rights holders whose work was unlawfully digitized, but that agreement did not address the rights of visual artists.\n\nThe Graphic Artists Guild published the first edition of its \"Pricing & Ethical Guidelines\" in 1973. \"Pricing & Ethical Guidelines\" began as a 20-page pamphlet and has grown into a 400-page book.\n\nUp through the 1990s, the Guild also published the \"Directory of Illustration\" and a \"Corporate and Communication Design\" annual.\n\n"}
{"id": "2635441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2635441", "title": "Handgame", "text": "Handgame\n\nHandgame, also known as stickgame, is a Native American guessing game.\n\nAny number of people can play the Hand Game, but each team (the \"hiding\" team and the \"guessing\" team) must have one leader each. The Hand Game is played with two pairs of 'bones', each pair consisting of one plain and one striped bone. Typically ten sticks are used as counters with some variations using additional count sticks such as extra stick or \"kick Stick\" won by the starting team. The \"raw\" or \"uncooked\" counting sticks will be divided evenly between both opposing teams. \nDifferent rules such as which bone will be guessed, the plain or striped bone, is determined by the traditional format of the tribe or region - the plain bone or the striped bone. California, Oklahoma, and Dakota Indians generally call for the striped bone, where as most other tribes prefer to guess for the plain bone. \nThe two teams, one \"hiding\" and one \"guessing,\" sit opposite one another; two members of the \"hiding\" team take a pair of bones and hide them, one in each hand, while the team sings, and uses traditional instruments(drums, sticks, rattles, clappers), and attempts to distract the \"guessing\" team. The leader or 'Captain' of the \"guessing\" team, or a team member selected by the Captain, then must guess the pattern of the hidden bones. Since each hider holds one plain and one striped bone in each hand, there are initially four possibilities: both to the left, both to the right, both inside, or both outside. A gesture with a stick or hand generally accompanies each call. For each hider mis-guessed, the calling team must turn over one stick to the hiders . If a hider is guessed he must surrender the guessed bones to the calling side. The side continues hiding and singing until both pairs of bones have been guessed and surrendered. Then the teams reverse roles, and the game continues in this manner until one team holds all the sticks.\n\nHandgame predates recorded history. The oral tradition tells us that people originally learned Handgame from the animals. Historical documentation states that games were once played for land use and female companionship, and later on for horses and cattle. Today, handgame is played during traditional gatherings, powwows, tribal celebrations, and more recently in tournaments hosted by individual tribes or Indian organizations. More recent versions of handgame played by tribes in the Northwest added an extra stick, or \"kickstick\"; this variation was promulgated by the Paiute medicine man Wovoka when he traveled to the Northwest to teach the Ghost Dance. Handgame bones and counting sticks have been identified in ancient anthropological digs. \n\nHandgame continues to spread amongst Native American tribes; the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act classified it as Class I gaming, leaving its regulation to individual tribes.\n\nIn 2010, Tulalip's Battle of Nations Stick Game Tournament, the largest handgame tournament to date in the US, attracted 177 teams competing for a $US 30,000 first prize.\n\nSinger Judy Trejo has recorded a CD, \"Stick Game Songs of the Paiute,\" on Canyon Records.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41507141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41507141", "title": "Kona Lanes", "text": "Kona Lanes\n\nKona Lanes was a bowling center in Costa Mesa, California, that opened in 1958 and closed in 2003 after 45 years in business. Known for its futuristic design, it featured 40 wood-floor bowling lanes, a game room, a lounge, and a coffee shop that eventually became a Mexican diner. Built during the advent of Googie architecture, its Polynesian Tiki-themed styling extended from the large roadside sign to the building's neon lights and exaggerated rooflines.\n\nWhen Kona Lanes was demolished in 2003, it was one of the last remaining examples of the Googie style in the region; its sister center, Java Lanes in Long Beach, was razed in 2004. Much of Kona's equipment was sold prior to the demolition; the distinctive sign was saved and sent to Cincinnati, where a portion is on permanent display in the American Sign Museum.\n\nCosta Mesa's planning commission approved a proposal to build a department store on the site; following public outcry, those plans were scrapped. In 2010, the still-vacant land was rezoned for senior citizens' apartments and commercial development. Construction on the apartments began ten years after Kona Lanes was demolished.\n\nKona Lanes opened in 1958, featuring the Tiki-inspired signage and architecture that became popular following World War II, including what the \"Los Angeles Times\" called its \"flamboyant neon lights and ostentatious rooflines meant to attract motorists like moths\". The building on Harbor Boulevard near Adams Avenue was one of three in the Googie style that architects Powers, Daly, & DeRosa designed at around the same time; Kona Lanes and its sister center, Java Lanes, used names that suggested South Pacific island locales. Author Andrew Hurley called them \"expensive and attractive buildings that screamed, 'Have fun here, and Kona retained much of that atmosphere over the years. Its massive neon-lit street sign remained for the life of the building, and Kona was the only bowling establishment in the area to reject automatic scoring equipment throughout its existence.\n\nKona Lanes hosted the Southern California PBA Open twice in 1964; Billy Hardwick won in April and Jerry Hale in December. Longtime general manager Dick Stoeffler, known at the time as the producer and host of \"TV Bowling Tournament\" on KTLA, finished third during the televised finals in his own building in December, behind Hale and Hardwick. When Stoeffler rolled back-to-back 300 games in one league session at Kona in 1968, he was one of only four men in the United States to have managed the feat.\n\nChampions who bowled at Kona Lanes during its 45-year history include three-time Professional Bowlers Association Tour winner Jack Biondolillo; six-time male Bowling Writers Association of America Bowler of the Year and future PBA Hall of Famer Don Carter; John Haveles, an Orange County Bowling Hall of Fame inductee who began a stint as Kona's manager in 1974; future Michigan Women's Bowling Association Hall of Famer Cora Fiebig; two-time female BWAA Bowler of the Year Aleta Sill; and Barry Asher, the multiple PBA Tour champion and Hall of Fame inductee who later ran the pro shop at Fountain Bowl in nearby Fountain Valley. Kona Lanes and Tustin Lanes hosted nearly 10,000 teams of five players each taking part in the United States Bowling Congress Women's Championships in 1986.\n\nUnder Dick Stoeffler's management, Kona Lanes kept busy 24 hours a day, which made him one of the most successful proprietors in the country. Stoeffler met his future wife there, and other couples had similar experiences. Kona was often so busy that customers had to make reservations to get a lane during open (non-league) bowling hours. At its peak, Kona Lanes averaged more than 80 lines on each of its 40 lanes.\n\nBowling as a participation sport flourished in the early 1960s, but its popularity was diluted due to overbuilding; the number of bowling alleys sanctioned by the then-American Bowling Congress peaked at about 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was one of more than 30 in southern California alone. A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the customer base remained steady because an increase in open bowling made up for fewer league bowlers.\n\nJack Mann bought Kona Lanes in 1980 and re-branded it New Kona Lanes the following year. Mann's family owned several bowling centers in the region; he was behind the creation of Fountain Bowl in 1973 and the short-lived Regal Lanes in Orange in 1974. He also owned Tustin Lanes before selling it to his youngest son, Alex. Mann bought Kona not because he loved bowling, but because it would continue to pay dividends if he was no longer able to work. He later sold Kona to his son Jack Jr.\n\nThe center's lounge, known as the Outrigger Room, hosted many local artists over the years. Jazz quintet The Redd Foxx Bbq released four songs recorded there, and Roscoe Holland recorded a set of eight live performances for his album \"Beyond the Reef\".\n\nIn later years, much of the bowlers' area was taped off for rock concerts and weekend promotions like Club Crush, which proved popular among teenagers and also led to album recordings. A planned event featuring a local punk rock group was shut down by the Costa Mesa Police Department, leading to negative publicity.\n\nKona Lanes continued to lose business to newer centers, despite efforts to appeal to a more diverse customer base by hosting local music acts, supporting a Polynesian-themed restaurant called Kona Korral, and promoting gimmicks like \"nude bowling\". Eventually, the property became more valuable than the business. The landowners, C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, gave Jack Mann Jr. a choice: spend $10–20 million to update the center, or give it up. Mann chose the latter rather than spend such a sum on a site without a long-term lease.\n\nPlans to build a Kohl's department store on the site occupied by Kona Lanes and the already-closed Edwards Cinema Center and Ice Capades Chalet were approved by the city's planning commissioners, but they were met with resistance by neighbors who did not believe the store was a good fit for the area. Then-mayor Karen Robinson complained that Costa Mesa's policy-makers were discarding recreation as part of the quality of residents' lives, and appealed the commissioners' decision in February 2003. The city council later rejected the proposal. The continuing efforts to save Kona Lanes failed; it closed for good in May 2003 and was demolished soon after.\n\nThe 7.5-acre parcel was rezoned in 2010 for senior housing that was expected to provide a new customer base for the restaurants and retailers already in the area and for commercial developments still to come. The lot had sat unused for about ten years before construction on the 215-unit complex began; Azulón at Mesa Verde opened in 2014. Several dozen palm and eucalyptus trees were saved and replanted on the site.\n\nActivity at Kona Lanes increased in its final days, due to the nostalgic value of potential keepsakes. Manager Juanita Johnson said people were asking to buy furniture, office equipment, and more. \"Some of that is older than I am.\" The more substantial items, including the original wood lanes, had been sold off prior to demolition, while dumpster divers hit the parking lot each day, looking for any items of interest.\n\nThe loss of Kona Lanes was a repeated topic at political events. One Costa Mesa city council candidate said he made a commitment to public service when the building was torn down with little resistance. Another would-be council member agreed that the demolition should never have happened.\n\nIn 2012, Costa Mesa made plans to upgrade The Triangle, a retail space along Harbor Boulevard two miles south of the Kona Lanes site. Those plans featured a 10-lane bowling alley that opened in 2014. One city official said the center answered residents' longtime call for a new, upscale bowling facility.\n\nThe huge, neon-lit KONA LANES BOWL sign was featured in publications by the Costa Mesa Historical Society, along with \"The Book of Tiki\" and \"Tiki Road Trip\"; it also inspired professional paintings, and was one of several Costa Mesa landmarks memorialized in a mural painted on the local Floyd's 99 Barbershop. In 2003, Costa Mesa Planning Commissioner Katrina Foley led an effort to save the sign from the scrap heap.\n\nThanks in part to a private donation, the marquee was trucked 2,500 miles to Cincinnati, one of the first 20 signs accepted by the American Sign Museum. The \"Kona Lanes\" portion was refurbished and put on permanent display; the larger \"Bowl\" section buckled and tore during the unloading process and could not be saved.\n\n\n\n"}

Because of its difficulty, the Latin balladeers are often recognized as skilled singers such as the case of Nino Bravo, José José, Luis Miguel or Raphael.\nIn recent decades it has become the dominant musical genre of Latin pop.\n\nThe Latin or romantic ballad has its origin in the Latin American bolero in the 1950s (Lucho Gatica, Leo Marini), but also in the romantic song in Italian (Nicola Di Bari) and French (Charles Aznavour) in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn Mexico, the first ballad recorded as such is \"Sonata de Amor\" (Sonata of Love) of Mario Álvarez in 1961. In 1965 the famous bolero singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero, sang his first ballad, \"Pobres besos míos\" (My Poor Kisses).\n\nThe heyday of the ballad was reached in the mid-1970s, where artists such as José José, Camilo Sesto, Raphael, Roberto Carlos, Rocío Dúrcal and others released a big number of hits. The main hits of José José were \"El triste\" (The Sad One), \"La nave del olvido\" (The Ship of Forgetfullness), \"Te extraño\" (I Miss You, also written by Manzanero), \"Amar y querer\" (To love and To want), or \"Gavilán o paloma\" (Hawk or Dove), \"El pasado\" (The Past), \"Volcán\" (Volcano) or \"Lo que no fue no será\" (What Never Was Will Never Be). By Roberto Carlos the songs \"Amigos\" (Friends) or \"Detalles\" (Details). By Camilo Sesto the hits \"Fresa Salvaje\" (Wild Strawberry), \"Perdóname\" (Forgive Me) or \"Vivir Así es Morir de Amor\" (To Live Like This is to Die of Love). Rocío Dúrcal enjoyed worldwide success and was known as \"La Dama de la canción\" (The Lady of Song). Her successful ballads include \"Costumbres\" (Customs), \"Amor Eterno\" (Eternal Love), \"Diferentes\" (Different), among many others that were released in Latin America.[2] These songs are widely known today in Latin America.\n\nIn the course of their existence the genre merged with diverse rhythms to form several variants, such as romantic salsa and cumbia aside others.\n\nFrom the 1990s, globalization and media internationalization processes that integrated contributed to the ballad's spread international spread and further homogenize around a common Latin identity. As part of the Latin Americanization of the United States and the dominant presence in the genre of multinational record labels, Miami has become the main producer of ballads which in turn has fed back trends of migration of Latino and Hispanic performers, producers and musicians to that city. By the turn of the 2010s however, Latin ballads have begun to lose popularity as uptempo Latin genres such as bachata, reggaeton, and Spanish-language electropop music have gained popularity with the Hispanic audience in the radio.\n\nThe ethnomusicologist Daniel Party defines the romantic ballad as \"a love song of slow tempo, played by a solo singer accompanied by an orchestra usually\" .\n\nThe ballad and bolero are often confused and songs can fall in one or the other category without too much presicion. The distinction between them is referring primarily to a more sophisticated and more metaphorical language and subtle bolero, compared with a more direct expression of the ballad.\n\nParty stressed that the romantic ballad derive from \"Latin common sensibility\" He draws on the research of Jesus Martin-Barbero to highlight that the romantic ballad is an expression of a broader cultural process, called by Martin-Barbero as \"emotional integration in Latin America\", a phenomenon that would explain a generalization of the ways of feeling and express the emotions of the Latinos, through gestures, sounds, rhythms and cadences common literary devices, linked in turn to the telenovela.\n"}
{"id": "1315695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1315695", "title": "Le Lido", "text": "Le Lido\n\nLe Lido is a cabaret and burlesque show located on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France. It opened in 1946 at 78 Avenue des Champs -Élysée and moved to its current location in 1977. It is known for its exotic shows including dancers, singers, and other performers. Famous names have performed there including: Edith Piaf, Siegfried and Roy, Sylvie Vartan, Johnny Hallyday, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, Eartha Kitt, Josephine Baker, Kessler Twins, Elton John, Laurel & Hardy, Dalida, Shirley MacLaine, Mitzi Gaynor, Juliet Prowse and Noël Coward.\n\nFounded by Joseph and Louis Clérico, Le Lido opened on June 20, 1946. Le Lido was preceded by an artificial beach in a townhouse basement in the 1920s, running as a nightclub/casino in the late night hours.\n\nIn 1955, after a visit by the entertainment director of the Stardust Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, the Clérico brothers along with Donn Arden brought the Lido to the Stardust Las Vegas. This started a series of imports of Parisian cabaret shows to Las Vegas: Follies Bergeres to the Tropicana, Nouvelle Eve to Hotel El Rancho Vegas and Casino de Paris to the Dunes. The Stardust edition of Le Lido closed in 1992.\n\nLe Lido moved in 1977 to the Normandie on the Champs-Élysées.\n\nIn 2006, Sodexo, the international food service company, purchased Le Lido and has invested 24 million euro into developing its current show.\n\nThe Lido was closed from December 2, 2014, to April 2, 2015, while a new version of the show was prepared. The new version was developed by Franco Dragone. Each version of Le Lido is made up of 10–20 scenes and runs for about an hour and a half. Two shows are run every day of the week. A pre-show dinner is offered with the first evening show of each day at an additional cost.\n\nEach Le Lido show features singers and dancers, which always include the famous Bluebell Girls. A few featured dancers, showgirls and lead singers may be added. The Lido is known for its spectacular costumes featuring thousands of dollars in feathers and rhinestones, rich fabrics, and top quality furs.\n\nThe opening or \"theme\" scene welcomes the audience and sets the tone for the evening. It may also set the colour scheme for the show and will feature special effects and lighting. Music may be original or a medley of current popular songs mixed with music from Broadway or Hollywood films; often the opening number is a potpourri of styles and performers may change costumes several times. Between the production numbers, specialty \"vaudeville/cabaret\" acts are featured, such as jugglers, acrobats or magicians. At least one scene will feature water effects – another thing the Lido is known for. The stage itself can be raised and lowered, may change back and forth into an ice rink or swimming pool, and can feature elaborate set pieces which come up from below. The closing number often features a number called \"Merci Beaucoup\" (featured in the television show Shirley Maclaine at The Lido de Paris) and usually has some particularly spectacular costumes.\n\nAmong the last of its kind, the Lido has a special place in the history of nightclubs and floorshows and continues a tradition of the \"naughty but nice\" opulent production shows originally started by The Follies Bergeres.\n\nFounded by Margaret Kelly, also known as Miss Bluebell, the dancers of the Lido are known as the Bluebell Girls. Until her retirement in 1986, each dancer was hand-selected by Kelly. Then the dancers were under the direction of Pierre Rambert until his retirement in Dec 2014. According to the Forbes, they are \"some of the world’s most beautiful and talented burlesque dancers\". \n\nThe cast comes from all over the world, and are noted for their statuesque height, averaging a height of 5' 11\". It is interesting that while many of the performers in the shows are French a large number come from the UK and many of the tall statuesque \"showgirls\" who may top 6 feet without heels may come from South Africa and the USA.\n\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union, showgirls and classically trained dancers now come from Ukraine and many other former Soviet states.\n\nEvery few years, Le Lido develops a new version of its show. The show used to change more frequently, now each iteration may run for several years until the management feels it has run its course and a new production is called for. Each show can take millions of dollars to develop. The following are the titles of each show produced by the Le Lido:\n\n\"Shirley Maclaine at the Lido\" (1979) produced by Gary Smith and Dwight Hemion – Nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy-Variety or Music Program.\n\nThe Bluebell Girls were featured in a 1960 episode of \"Close-Up\", a Canadian TV show broadcast on the CBC\n\nNumerous clips of several of the shows of the last 20 years and even full videos of all the production numbers from some editions are available on YouTube.\n\n\n"}

The earliest known masked wrestler in the United States was The Masked Marvel who famously \"crashed\" the international tournament, which featured many of the top stars of the \"Farmer\" Burns-Frank Gotch era, held at the Manhattan Opera House in 1915. In North America, many professional wrestlers have traditionally worn masks after they had been used in an area, or \"territory\", that their popularity and drawing ability diminished, it would be an easy way for a wrestler to begin working in a new area as a \"fresh face\". Sometimes workers wore masks in one territory and unmasked in another territory in order to keep their two identities separate. Several wrestlers used one or two personas for their entire career such as The Destroyer (1962–1984), Mr. Wrestling (1965–1983) and Masked Superstar (1976–1986).\n\nWrestling masks also have a significant cultural importance in lucha libre, and puroresu to a lesser extent; famed \"luchadores\" such as Blue Demon, Mil Máscaras and El Santo have achieved an almost iconic status in Mexico. In Japan, masked wrestlers are also very popular. Many are heavily influenced by anime and manga characters such as Tiger Mask and Black Tiger during the 1980s, and Jushin Thunder Liger in the 90s. Many of these stars would appear in World Championship Wrestling during the \"Monday Night Wars\" period.\n\nIn recent years, World Wrestling Entertainment has re-used masked characters for comedic purposes. Edge and Christian donned the masks worn by the WWF's original Los Conquistadores in their feud with World Tag Team Champions The Hardy Boyz in 2000. Under the guise of El Gran Luchadore, Paul London, Shannon Moore, Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle each challenged JBL for the WWE Championship in 2004.

She started her career in England, particularly as a singer and radio/television presenter before returning to Australia where she became a popular actress remains best known to early television audiences as presenter of the self-titled musical variety program \"The Lorrae Desmond Show\" from 1960 until 1964, her live singing performances as a forces sweetheart and for her soap opera roles including the 1970s in Number 96 and her long-running role as Shirley Gilroy an original character from 1981 in the television series \"A Country Practice\", which she played to 1992.\n\nDesmond was born on 2 October 1932, in Mittagong, New South Wales, to Alice and Des Hunt. She travelled to Britain in the 1950s, and at 16, as Lorrae started her career as a singing cigarette girl and became a celebrity there, she performed as a solo artist and with backing group The Rebels, she appearing in cabaret, pantomime, radio, and live recording, including several shows for the BBC, including \"Meet Lorrae\" and \"Swing with Lorrae\". She even featured in her own comedy series \"Trouble for Two\" in 1958, was in the cast of several Terry-Thomas TV specials, and competed to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957.\n\nIn his book \"Bounder\" (2008), Graham McCann states that Desmond might have married Terry-Thomas, who had been her constant companion for seven years. Instead, the actor overcame a 26-year age gap to marry Belinda Cunningham. Desmond refuted this in an ABC interview in April 2008, saying that she dated Thomas for 10 years, but they would never have married.\n\nIn 1962, she made history by being the first woman to win the Gold Logie (which was in fact Silver, as women at the time received the Silver Statuette, and men received the Gold Statuette) for her work on her variety show \"The Lorrae Desmond Show\". The Gold Logie award that year was a dual honour, with Tommy Hanlon Jr. also winning the coveted trophy.\n\nDesmond married Sydney surgeon Dr Alex Gorshenin in 1963. They travelled to the United States together, where he continued to study. They moved back to Sydney but the marriage did not last long.\n\nThe Australian Government invited her to tour Vietnam from 1967 to 1971, to entertain the troops. She was widely courted as being the Australian Forces Sweetheart, amongst others including Little Pattie. Desmond was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1970 for services to entertainment and the welfare of the Australian Forces in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2000, Desmond was a supporter of the Paralympic Games.\n\nDesmond's television appearances include \"Homicide\", \"Number 96\" (1973) and \"Arcade\" (1980). She also had a guest appearance on \"Home and Away\" as Isobel Dupre.\n\nDesmond appeared as Shirley Gilroy in \"A Country Practice\", an original character, from 1981 to 1992, opposite Brian Wenzel who played her husband Frank Gilroy. In 1984 she won the Logie for Best Supporting Actress for this role. In one of the series' iconic episodes in 1992, the long-running character Shirley was killed off in an off-screen plane crash, with actress Desmond stating she did not want a prolonged death storyline arc like Molly Jones (Anne Tenney).\n\nDesmond co-wrote the lyrics to the musical \"Man of Sorrows\" (originally titled \"Jesus Christ Revolution\") which premiered in Melbourne in 1972.\n\nAbout the industry, she said: What I really wanted to do was write lyrics for songs. I did do a few weeks in \"Home And Away\" after \"ACP\", but I’m a bit sick of performing—after you've been doing it for 50 years you're just going around in circles! The thing I liked most about being a performer was putting the act together, which is why I've come back to writing. It's still pleasant to be recognised as Shirley because people are always nice to me. And with those \"ACP\" repeats on Hallmark, it goes from generation to generation.\n\nIn 2001, she obtained the rights to write the lyrics for a musical play based on Bryce Courtenay's novel \"Smoky Joe's Cafe\", about the effects of the Vietnam War on a veteran. The play, entitled \"Honey\", premiered in 2007 at the Riverside Theatre Parramatta.\n\nShe was also a magazine columnist for \"That's Life\"; she wrote an article called \"Ask Lorrae\", where readers would write in, asking for advice and information.\n\nDesmond took part in an \"A Country Practice\" reunion special in 2006, as part of the \"Television Turns 50\" celebrations, and the series' 30th-anniversary reunion in 2011.\nIn 2017, Lorrae who was the first female to win a Gold Logie, appeared at the Logie awards, to present an award opposite her cousin's son, Chinese Australian actor and presenter Sam Pang.\n\nShe toured Australia performing in \"High Society\", and her own one-woman show.\n\n\n"}

It marks the only film in the series not directed by Don Coscarelli, although he acts as producer and co-writer. It is directed by David Hartman and stars A. Michael Baldwin, Reggie Bannister, and Angus Scrimm in his final appearance as the Tall Man.\n\nThe film begins with Reggie, running about in the desert, still on the trail of his nemesis - the Tall Man. He then pays a man to offer him a ride, but realizes it's actually his car they're in, and the man stole it when he recalls putting a gun in the middle compartment. He chucks the man out, but two spheres suddenly fly by, and one sphere kills the man on the road while the other chases after Reggie. He manages to defeat them however, but then wakes up in a hospital sitting with Mike talking to him as he sits in a wheelchair, who apparently looks after him due to him having an early stage of dementia. He then tells Mike his story. In an apparent dream setting, Reggie meets a woman who mistakes him for a friend. Her car isn't working, so Reggie offers her a lift. They go to a cabin on a farm, and Reggie learns that a Bulgarian man named Demeter helps out. Reggie explains to her about his dealings with The Tall Man over the years, and she is amazed by his tale. He tries his usual lady wooing, but is turned down. As he plays a song, he cannot remember her name, and goes to sleep. Later, The Tall Man shows up with more of his deadly spheres. A flashback scene then shows Reggie in the hospital, but it is the hospital from the 1860s. The Tall Man (or his original identity, Jebediah) is lying in the bed next to him. They then talk. Jebediah explains he's nearly finished, and has lost many friends. He says they are both there basically to die. \n\nReggie wakes up the next morning, remembering the lady's name is Dawn. He gets no answer when he asks her a question, and finds that she's been killed by spheres, that then give chase. Reggie equips himself with a shotgun. The spheres force him into a nearby barn. A man armed with an axe confronts him, and it's revealed he is Demeter. A sphere kills a horse. Another sphere then manages to get inside the barn, killing Demeter, before Reggie fights it off. Reggie speaks to Mike again in the hospital. Mike tells him about a new threat looming. Back in his dream, Reggie goes through the woods. Along a path, he encounters a gigantic sphere hovering in the sky, and Reggie is back at the hospital again. Reggie alternates between the other world in both his dream, and the present time. The Tall Man appears, and says their paths cross again. It's 1979; a younger self will attend a funeral in Morningside, and that all his efforts got him nowhere. The Tall Man proclaims he can resurrect Reggie's dead family in exchange for him ceasing his meddling. \n\nReggie is next seen in a mortuary, contending with the dwarf \"Lurker\" followers of The Tall Man, and the Lady in Lavender appears. She is shot by Reggie and seemingly killed. Continuing on, Reggie goes into a large cave, shooting a dwarf and the place shakes. The Tall Man asks him if he's considered his offer, but when Reggie retaliates, The Tall Man again reminds him his chances are depleting. Reggie wants his friends Jodie and Mike back, but The Tall Man recognizes his \"loyalty\" for his friends as foolishness. In yet another dream sequence which he alternates with the nightmare world, Reggie is strapped to a gurney as armed masked people appear. One is called Chunk and the other is revealed to be the person Reggie knew as Dawn despite her death, but she says her name is actually Jane and she thinks Reggie is delusional. She radios in some people. Reggie fails to convince her they know each other, but she gets him medical attention instead. More evil dwarf things show up to attack Reggie, but Chunk saves him and gives him a weapon. Dawn & Chunk take Reggie to other members of their group who are fighting the Tall Man. Mike reunites with Reggie, and then escape the nightmare hospital. Mike tells Reggie he's been out of action for a decade in a coma, and the Earth has changed. He says it's no longer their home, it's The Tall Man's now.\n\nIn the dream world, Reggie wanders around the hospital hallways, but a nurse orders him back to his room. In the nightmare world, an enemy has grabbed him. A spiked sphere then kills one of the people helping Reggie. Mike visits Reggie at the hospital, and says his dream orientates him. Mike reveals he had a dream too where he was in the desert, looking for Reggie. It turns out Mike still has his connection to The Tall Man. Mike reveals The Tall Man unleashed an alien virus that caused an apocalypse on society worldwide. Jane is caught by The Tall Man, so Chunk, Mike and Reggie go after The Tall Man. In his own red planet world, they face and battle The Tall Man, Jane is killed. Chunk, who posed as a dwarf next to the Tall Man, then turns the tables. Chunk blows himself up to try to kill The Tall Man. Back at the hospital, Reggie fights some Gravers alongside Mike. Jodie shows up in a car spewing bullets to save them. After driving awhile, they decide to drive north as The Tall Man hates the cold. In a flashback to the hospital, however, Reggie seemingly passes away in bed while Mike & Jody are holding his hands, and the film ends. \n\nDuring the end-credits, Chunk appears through a portal along a desert road, missing a hand, and meets up with Rocky. Chunk flirts with her, asking Rocky if he has a chance. Rocky teases back saying that there are no other guys around, but Rocky then sees Reggie and the others pulling up in the Barricuda heading north, and they get in. Lots of giant spheres are then shown in the sky in the distance, indicating the war with The Tall Man is far from over.\n\n\nIn 2004, six years after the release of \"\", series director Don Coscarelli told \"Fangoria\", \"I’d also still like to do another \"Phantasm\" film. Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm are still in great shape and raring to go.\"\n\nIn March 2005, it was announced that Coscarelli was in the final stages of talks with New Line Cinema to produce a new entry. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", the new film was \"being developed as a relaunch and as a possible trilogy about Mike's coming of age.\" This version never came to fruition.\n\nRumors about a sequel were reignited in June 2007 by footage contained in Don Coscarelli's \"Farewell to the Alamo Drafthouse\", featuring Angus Scrimm and A. Michael Baldwin in their roles. However an interview with Reggie Bannister surfaced on YouTube, and, when asked about the possibility of a fifth film, he stated there was no activity or development but that anything was possible in the future.\n\nIn June 2012, rumors again surfaced that Coscarelli would begin a new \"Phantasm\" sequel. According to a report on Dread Central, a reliable source told them the script was completed and filming would begin later in the year. Coscarelli disputed this claim, publicly stating, \"I have no solid news to report on a new project now.\" The director, however, was being coy with film news sites. According to what Coscarelli and new co-writer-director David Hartman told \"Entertainment Weekly\", the film was shot secretly in and around southern California during 2012 and 2013.\n\nOn March 26, 2014, news of \"Ravager\"s completion was released via various film news sites. The next day, a teaser trailer debuted on the film's official site. In a 2014 \"sneak peek\" video preview on the official Phantasm website, director Hartman mentioned in quick passing, \"This thing is going to be in the can 2015... for sure.\" In September 2015 at Scarefest in Lexington, Kentucky, it was announced that the film has been delayed until 2016. The next month, Reggie Bannister announced that \"Ravager\" is completed and is awaiting a distributor.\n\nProduction on the film was briefly halted when Coscarelli supervised a 4K restoration of the original \"Phantasm\". On January 9, 2016, actor Angus Scrimm, who played The Tall Man, died at age 89.\n\n\"Phantasm V: Ravager\" premiered in Austin's Fantastic Fest on September 25, 2016. It was released in the United States in theaters and via digital HD on October 7, 2016. The film and its predecessors are expected to be digitally remastered for home media soon thereafter.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 54% of 13 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.1/10. Metacritic, another review aggregator, rated it 51/100 based on seven reviews. Joe Leydon of \"Variety\" and Marten Carlson of \"Consequence of Sound\" both criticized the film's narrative cohesiveness. Leydon speculated that the film's troubled production may have cause this, and Carlson more directly blamed the film's origin as a series of shorts. Both said this will probably cause outsiders to be confused by the film. In comparing it to the previous films, Carlson said it \"captures the heart, if not the quality\", though fans will likely forgive its faults, as they did the first film. Leydon, though describing it as \"a patchwork quilt of outtakes from its four predecessors\", also cited the appeal to fans to revisit their favorite characters. Though recognizing the film's narrative weakness, Michele Galgana of \"Screen Anarchy\" wrote, \"Still, it's impossible to overlook the fun that you see all these guys having, and their hearts are all in the right place.\"\n\nSimon Abrams of \"Roger Ebert.com\" gave the film two and a half stars saying the \"CGI-intensive action scenes are distractingly ugly-looking. The camerawork is also amateurish, and the film's drab, undistinguished dialogue is only interesting when it's explicitly calling back to the original \"Phantasm.\"\" Marten Carlson of \"Consequence of Sound\" criticized the look of the film saying \"at its best, though, the film’s cheap production is impossible to ignore. The cinematography is flat and appears to have been shot on a consumer HD camera. The special effects are achieved primarily with low-grade CGI that’s laughable at times.\" Carlson ultimately said \"All formal complaints aside, Ravager is successful in its attempt to capture the spirit of the series. Phantasm has always been about family, the love between brothers and friends, and seeing Reggie and Mike together again, we can only feel the sincerity of their relationship.\" Reviewers at \"Bloody Disgusting\" were split with Trace Thurman placing it on his \"5 Worst Horror Movies of 2016\" yet John Squires loved it. However, both agreed the film looked like a \"cheaply-made student film.\"\n\n"}

Prostitutes from Caio also travel to Ziguinchor in Senegal and Banjul in The Gambia to work.\n\nYounger prostitutes in the cities often work in bars.\n\nThere have been reports of child sex tourism on the Bissagos Islands.\n\nLike other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV is a problem in the country. Adult prevalence is 3.1%\n\nCondom use amongst sex workers is irregular, which has led to an HIV prevalence amongst sex workers of 39%.\n\nChild prostitution is a problem in the country. Many children engage in prostitution for survival. The activity mainly takes place in clubs, bars and hotels. The government takes little action, relying on NGOs to try and address the problem.\n\nAround 2000-2004 there have been reports of child sex tourism on the Bissagos Islands.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a source country for children subjected to sex trafficking. The extent to which adults are subjected to forced prostitution is unclear. Bissau-Guinean girls are subjected to child sex trafficking in Guinea and Senegal.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Guinea-Bissau as a Tier 2 Watch List country.\n"}
{"id": "993216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=993216", "title": "Revenge tragedy", "text": "Revenge tragedy\n\nRevenge tragedy (sometimes referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) is a theoretical genre in which the principal theme is revenge and revenge's fatal consequences. Formally established by American educator Ashley H. Thorndike in his 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" a revenge tragedy documents the progress of the protagonist's revenge plot and often leads to the demise of both the murderers and the avenger himself.\n\nThe genre first appeared in Early modern Britain with the publication of Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" during the latter half of the 16th century\".\" Earlier works, such as Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca (1560's) and Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561), are also considered revenge tragedies. Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602), \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593), and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606).\n\nThe genre of revenge tragedy is a modern invention, developed as a means of explaining early modern tragedies that maintain a theme or motif of revenge in varying degrees. Classification of the revenge tragedy is at times contentious, as with other early modern theatrical genres. Lawrence Danson suggested that Shakespeare and his contemporaries had a \"healthy ability to live comfortably with the unruliness of a theatre where the genre was not static but moving and mixing, always producing new possibilities.\" On the contrary, Shakespeare's 1623 First Folio's famously depicts the printer-imposed (William Jaggard and Edward Blount) three genres of comedy, history, and tragedy, leading readers to falsely believe that plays are easily categorized and contained. While these three genres have remained staples in discussions of genre, other genres are often either invoked or created to accommodate the generic slipperiness of early modern drama. These include not only revenge tragedy, but also city comedy, romance, pastoral, and problem play, among others.\n\nIt is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy. Lily Campbell argues that revenge is the great thematic uniter of all early modern tragedy, and \"all Elizabethan tragedy must appear as fundamentally a tragedy of revenge if the extent of the idea of revenge be but grasped.\" Fredson Bowers's work (1959) on the genre not only widened and complicated what revenge tragedy is, but also increased its function as a productive lens in the work of dramatic interpretation. For example, \"Titus Andronicus\" was originally marketed in the First Folio as \"The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus.\" \"Hamlet\" was similarly titled in the First Folio as \"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" and \"The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" in the Second Quarto edition (1604). It's not unusual to find present-day editors classifying these plays as tragedies; however, it is becoming increasingly common to also read and interpret early modern drama with other genres in mind, such as revenge tragedy.\n\nWhile these conventions don't apply to all plays that can be considered revenge tragedies, the events listed are common within the genre:\n\nLucius Seneca was a prominent playwright of the first century, famous for helping shape the genre of revenge tragedy with his ten plays: \"Hercules Furens, Troades, Phoenissae, Medea, Phaedra, Oedipus, Agamemnon, Thyestes, Hercules Oetaeus, and Octavia.\" The importance of his plays lies in the difficulty of the period. While the Elizabethan tragedy was considered more acceptable, revenge tragedy sought to unleash the carnal side of human nature on stage in a much more grotesque way. It was a transitional time in the literary world that would eventually lead to grueling pieces like these. Infamous scenes like the cannibalistic feast in \"Thyestes\" introduce the audience to another dimension of the human experience, challenging them to reflect on extreme emotions and dig deeper into the conventions of the genre.\n\nSeneca’s \"Thyestes\", a tale of revenge and horror with prominent cannibalism, can be identified as one of the first \"revenge pieces.\" In the power struggle between two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, there is a clear theme of revenge. The underlying plot is Thyestes's affair with Atreus' wife. He stole his treasured golden fleece, and sneakily took the throne of Mycenae from him. After a long period of exile, Thyestes is allowed to return to Mycenae. However, the conflict escalates when Atreus executes his revenge by tricking Thyestes into eating his children. Although overtly grotesque, this piece of literature follows the conventions of the revenge tragedy genre. Ultimately, everyone ends up dead and revenge has been taken to a level that was not anticipated in the beginning.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright from the 16th century. Through plays like \"Hamlet\" and \"Titus Andronicus\", Shakespeare portrayed the basic characteristics of a revenge tragedy. He presented elements that are quite similar to those from Seneca's tragedies, establishing tragedy as a more well-known genre.\n\n\"Titus Andronicus\" depicts the madness of Titus, who wanted to take revenge on Tamora and her sons for what they did to Lavinia and Bassianus. This leads him to kill everybody that he faced in his search to satisfy himself and avenge them. The main plot focuses on Titus's revenge against Tamora and her sons, but also there are other people to whom he seeks vengeance. This is an element that can define a revenge tragedy. The appearance of cannibalism in the last scene at the banquet and grotesque elements during the play relate \"Titus Andronicus\" to Seneca's earlier revenge tragedies.\n"}
{"id": "177831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177831", "title": "Saturday-morning cartoon", "text": "Saturday-morning cartoon\n\nSaturday-morning cartoon is a colloquial term for the original animated television programming that was typically scheduled on Saturday mornings in the United States on the major television networks. The genre's popularity had a broad peak from the late 1960s through the early 1990s; after this point, it declined in the face of changing cultural norms, increased competition from formats available at all times, and heavier regulations. In the last two decades of the genre's existence, Saturday-morning cartoons were primarily created and aired to meet educational television mandates, or E/I. Minor television networks, in addition to the non-commercial PBS in some markets, continue to air animated programming on Saturday while partially meeting those mandates.\n\nIn the United States, the generally accepted times for these and other children's programs to air on Saturday mornings were from 8:00 a.m. to noon Eastern Time. Until the late 1970s, American networks also had a schedule of children's programming on Sunday mornings, though most programs at this time were repeats of Saturday morning shows that were already out of production. In some markets, some shows were pre-empted in favor of syndicated or other types of local programming. Canadian Saturday morning cartoons were largely defunct by 2002. At least one U.S. broadcast television network still aired non-E/I animated programs on Saturday mornings as late as 2014; among the \"Big Three\" traditional major networks, the last non-educational cartoon (\"Kim Possible\") last aired in 2006. Cable television networks have since then revived the practice of debuting their most popular animated programming on Saturday mornings on a sporadic basis.\n\nAn animated feature film may use 24 different drawings \"per second\" of finished film. Due to lower budgets, Saturday morning cartoons are often produced with a minimum amount of animation drawings, sometimes no more than three or four per second. In addition, the movements of the characters are often repeated, very limited, or even confined to mouths and eyes only. An exception to the 24-frames-per-second rule is when animation is \"shot in twos\" in which 12 drawings per second are used and the switch to 24 frames per second is for quick events such as explosions or \"wild takes\".\n\nAlthough the Saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children's programming beginning in the early 1950s, the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on Saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s, when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertisers. Furthermore, limited animation, such as that produced by such studios as Filmation Associates, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, Total Television, Jay Ward Productions and Hanna-Barbera Productions, was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot, as compared to live-action programming. While production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming, the cost of talent was far less (voice actors Daws Butler, Don Messick, June Foray, Mel Blanc, Paul Frees, Jean Vander Pyl, Hal Smith, Howard Morris, Allen Melvin, Bill Scott, Dayton Allen, Janet Waldo, Paul Winchell, Hans Conried, Casey Kasem and, in later years, Jim Cummings, Frank Welker, Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell, Tress MacNeille, Tara Strong, Corey Burton, Nancy Cartwright, Cree Summer, Maurice LaMarche and Tom Kenny became known for their ability to hold several characters at once, sometimes even on the same show) and networks could rerun children's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series, negating the financial disadvantages. The experiment proved successful, and the time slot was filled with profitable programming.\n\nUntil the late 1960s, a number of Saturday-morning cartoons were reruns of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier. These included Hanna-Barbera's \"Top Cat\", \"The Jetsons\" and \"Jonny Quest\", Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.'s \"The Alvin Show\", and Bob Clampett's \"Beany and Cecil\".\n\nSome Saturday morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for movie theaters, such as the \"Bugs Bunny\" and \"Road Runner\" cartoons produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons, the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for that studio prior to establishing their own company; the \"Mighty Mouse\" and \"Heckle and Jeckle\" cartoons produced by Paul Terry's \"Terrytoons\", and Walter Lantz's \"Woody Woodpecker\" cartoons. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind (DePatie-Freleng was particularly associated with this business model), so that by selling the shorts to theaters, the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone, which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user. Some of these legacy characters later appeared in \"new\" versions by other producers (\"Tom and Jerry\" by Hanna and Barbera for their own company, and later by Filmation; \"Mighty Mouse\" by Filmation and later by Ralph Bakshi, \"The Pink Panther\" by Hanna-Barbera with Friz Freleng as a consultant).\n\nThe remainder of the networks' Saturday-morning schedules were filled by reruns of black-and-white live-action series made in the 1950s, usually with a western background (\"The Lone Ranger\", \"The Roy Rogers Show\", \"Sky King\", \"Fury\", \"Rin-Tin-Tin\", \"My Friend Flicka\", etc.) and occasional first-run live-action series such as \"The Magic Land of Allakazam\", the later color episodes of \"Howdy Doody\", \"The Shari Lewis Show\", \"Shenanigans\", and \"Watch Mr. Wizard\".\n\nIndependent stations (TV stations not affiliated with networks) often did not show cartoons on Saturday mornings, instead running feature films (usually B-Westerns or low-budget series movies such as \"The Bowery Boys\" or \"Bomba the Jungle Boy\"), chapters of \"cliffhanger\" serial films, comedy short subjects originally made for movie theatres (\"Laurel and Hardy\", \"The Three Stooges\", and \"Our Gang\"/\"The Little Rascals\"), older live-action syndicated series like \"The Adventures of Superman\", \"The Cisco Kid\", \"Ramar of the Jungle\", \"The Abbott and Costello Show\", \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", \"Hopalong Cassidy\", \"Flash Gordon\" and \"Sheena, Queen of the Jungle\"; and regional sports shows, often wrestling or bowling programs.\n\nThe mid-1960s brought a boom in superhero cartoon series, some adapted from comic books, (\"Superman\", \"Aquaman\", \"Spider-Man\", \"The Fantastic Four\"), and others original (\"Space Ghost\", \"The Herculoids\", \"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio\", etc.) Also included were parodies of the superhero genre (\"Underdog\", \"The Super Six\", and \"George of the Jungle\", among others.) Another development was the popular music-based cartoon, featuring both real-life groups (\"The Beatles\", \"The Jackson 5ive\", and \"The Osmonds\") as well as anonymous studio musicians (\"The Archies\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\"). Live-action series continued to some extent with Sid and Marty Krofft's \"H.R. Pufnstuf\" and \"Sigmund and the Sea Monsters\", Hanna-Barbera's \"The Banana Splits\", Stan Burns and Mike Marmer's \"Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp\", ABC's \"Curiosity Shop\" (produced by Chuck Jones), Don Kirshner's widely popular \"The Monkees\", and the British-made slapstick comedy \"Here Come the Double Deckers\".\n\nWith the 1970s came a wave of animated versions of popular live-action prime time series, mainly with the voices of the original casts, including \"The Brady Bunch\" (\"The Brady Kids\"), \"Star Trek\" (\"\"),\"Emergency!\"(Emergency+4) \"Gilligan's Island\" (\"The New Adventures of Gilligan\" and later \"Gilligan's Planet\"), \"Happy Days\" (\"The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang\"), \"Laverne & Shirley\" (\"Laverne & Shirley in the Army\"), \"Mork & Mindy\" (\"Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour\"), \"The Partridge Family\" (\"Partridge Family 2200 A.D.\"; the cast was also semi-regulars on \"Goober and the Ghost Chasers\"), and \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" (\"The Dukes\"). Less literally adapted was \"The Oddball Couple\", which turned Neil Simon's mismatched roommates into a scruffy dog and a fastidious cat. Many of these animated spinoffs featured storylines and settings that would not be feasible in most live-action series (such as trips around the world and/or into space). The ties between the animated spin-offs and their live-action origins varied widely, depending on how much input the original cast and crew were willing to contribute (and how much the animation companies were willing to pay for that talent); in retrospective, animated versions of TV series are generally not treated as canon.\n\nOther adaptations of familiar characters and properties included \"Tarzan\" (\"Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle\"), \"Planet of the Apes\" (\"Return to the Planet of the Apes\"), \"Lassie\" (\"Lassie's Rescue Rangers\") and \"Godzilla\". At this same time, the great success of \"Scooby-Doo\" spawned numerous imitations, combining \"Archies\"-style teen characters and funny animals with light-weight mystery stories (\"Speed Buggy\", \"Jabberjaw\", etc.) Comedian Bill Cosby successfully blended educational elements with both comedy and music in the popular, long-running \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\".\n\nFilmation, primarily a cartoon producer, also turned out several live-action Saturday morning series in the 1970s; including \"Shazam!\" and \"Isis\" (with animated sequences), \"Jason of Star Command\", \"The Ghost Busters\" (not related to the later movie series, but a vehicle for former \"F Troop\" stars Larry Storch and Forrest Tucker) and \"Uncle Croc's Block\".\n\nA Hanna-Barbera adaptation of the Belgian comic strip \"The Smurfs\" became a huge success in the 1980s, bringing with it other series with fairytale-like settings (\"My Little Pony\", \"Monchichis\", \"Trollkins\", \"Snorks\", etc.) Most of the genres made popular in previous generations (funny animals, superheroes, teen mysteries, science fiction and live-action adaptations) continued to appear as well, with the exception of the musical band cartoons (only one of note, the syndicated \"Jem and the Holograms\", emerged in the 1980s); by this time, the bands were engaged in making music videos of their own, and listeners looking for their favorite bands ended up migrating to MTV. CBS and the producing team of Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, acclaimed for their Emmy-winning prime time specials adapted from Charles M. Schulz's comic strip \"Peanuts\", brought Schulz's characters to Saturday mornings in \"The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show\"; later in the 1980s, the successful \"Garfield\" comic strip and TV specials were adapted into the long-running \"Garfield and Friends\", also on CBS.\n\nOther adaptations of familiar characters and properties included \"The Lone Ranger\", \"Star Wars\" (\"\" and \"\") and \"Zorro\" (\"The New Adventures of Zorro\").\n\nDuring the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, a glut of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters began appearing on Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nParents' lobby groups such as Action for Children's Television appeared in the late 1960s. They voiced concerns about the presentation of commercialism, violence, anti-social attitudes and stereotypes in Saturday morning cartoons. By the 1970s, these groups exercised enough influence that the television networks felt compelled to lay down more stringent content rules for the animation houses. By 1978, the Federal Trade Commission was openly considering a ban on all advertising during television programming targeting preschoolers, and severe restrictions on other children's program advertising, which would have effectively killed off the format; the commission ultimately dropped the proposal.\n\nThe networks were encouraged to create educational spots that endeavored to use animation and/or live-action for enriching content. The \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" series on ABC became a television classic; ABC also had several other short-form animated featurettes, including \"Time for Timer\" and \"The Bod Squad\", that had long runs. Just as notable were CBS's news segments for children, \"In the News\" and NBC's \"Ask NBC News\" and \"One to Grow On\", which featured skits of everyday problems with advice from the stars of NBC primetime programs.\n\nThe decline of the timeslot somewhat began in the early 1990s for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nAnimation companies survived by shifting their resources: adult-oriented cartoons, many in prime time, experienced a revival in the 1990s as the Saturday morning cartoons were in decline, as did animated feature films (see, for example, the Disney Renaissance). Fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming, networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s; by this point, these consisted either of repurposed reruns from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the United States. As the popularity of these blocks continued to decline and no hit shows emerged from them, by the early 2010s cartoons began an outright phaseout, with the major networks opting to fill their educational mandates by commissioning live-action, mostly documentary/human interest series that were far less labor-intensive and expensive to produce (and, more importantly for the networks, less restrictive in regard to commercials). Some of the space formerly filled by Saturday morning cartoons would be occupied by paid programming and expanded coverage of college football, both of which greatly expanded as the result of separate government rulings in 1984.\n\nA 1996 Federal Communications Commission mandate, issued in the wake of the Children's Television Act, requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children's educational/informational (\"E/I\") programming per week.\n\nTo help their affiliates comply with the regulations, broadcast networks began to reorganize their efforts to adhere to the mandates, so their affiliates would not bear the burden of scheduling the shows themselves on their own time thus eliminating the risk of having network product preempted by the mandates. This almost always meant that the educational programming was placed during the Saturday morning cartoon block.\n\nNBC abandoned its original Saturday morning cartoon lineup in 1992, replacing it with a Saturday morning edition of \"Today\" and adding an all live-action teen-oriented block, \"TNBC\", which featured \"Saved by the Bell\", \"California Dreams\" and other teen comedies. Even though the educational content was minimal to non-existent, NBC labeled all the live-action shows with an E/I rating and provided the legal fiction of a blanket educational summary boilerplate provided to stations to place in their quarterly educational effort reports for the FCC. Cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002, after cable network Discovery Kids (now Discovery Family) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction, beating out other children's television companies (notably Nickelodeon, which already programmed CBS's Saturday morning block as Nick Jr. on CBS).\n\nCBS followed NBC's example in 1997 by producing \"CBS News Saturday Morning\" for the first two hours of its lineup and an all live-action block of children's programming. The experiment lasted a few months, and CBS brought back its animated \"CBS Storybreak\" series.\n\nIn 2004, ABC was the last of the broadcast networks to add a Saturday morning edition of its morning news program (in their case, \"Good Morning America Weekend\") in the first hour of its lineup, mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the February 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster which occurred on a Saturday morning, forcing them to take coverage from other video wire services. Prior to that, and particularly in the early 1990s, it was not uncommon for affiliates to preempt part or all of ABC's cartoon lineup with local programming.\n\nFox carried little or no E/I programming, leaving the responsibility of scheduling the E/I shows to the affiliates themselves (although the network did eventually add daily reruns of \"The Magic School Bus\" to meet the E/I mandates from 1998 to 2001). Following the closure of its 4Kids TV block in 2008, Fox would not carry any children's programming at all for five years until the launch of Xploration Station. The WB was far more accommodating; for several years, the network aired the history-themed \"Histeria!\" five days a week, leaving only a half-hour of E/I programs up to the local affiliates to program.\n\nSeveral channels, while not offering original animated series, do air reruns of older Saturday morning cartoons. Boomerang, a spin-off channel of Cartoon Network, specialized primarily in reruns of Saturday morning cartoons from the 1960s and 1970s (the majority of which come from Hanna-Barbera, which, like Boomerang, is owned by Time Warner). In the 2010s, the channel's focus shifted toward airing reruns of canceled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s (many of which were never intended for the Saturday morning programming block), and as of 2014, all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots. Hub Network owned the broadcast rights to rerun several of Fox Kids' most popular programs (this was a byproduct of former Fox Kids head Margaret Loesch working as head of the Hub Network at the time); the majority of that programming was dropped or relegated to early morning timeslots when Loesch left the network and the channel was relaunched as Discovery Family in 2014. A handful of digital subchannels also make use of Saturday morning cartoon reruns, including Luken Communications's PBJ and Ion Media Networks' Qubo.\n\nIn 2011, the major networks began to phase out weekend-morning educational programming aimed towards preteen audiences, in favor of live-action reality and docuseries outsourced to other producers. Litton Entertainment took over programming the Saturday morning children's blocks from ABC, CBS, The CW and NBC in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2016 respectively. These programs are ostensibly aimed at teenagers and families, and networks have legally declared these new programs to be oriented towards viewers between the ages of 13 and 16. This distinction is important from a legal basis, as it removes the requirement for the programs to comply with the advertising limits imposed by the Children's Television Act.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, broadcast networks were now becoming units of larger entertainment companies. ABC was bought by The Walt Disney Company in 1996, which began airing all Disney-produced programming by 1997 and canceled programs produced by companies other than Disney (with the notable exceptions of two shows \"The Bugs and Tweety Show\", which continued to air until Warner Bros. discontinued the show in 2000) and Science Court which was produced by Burns & Burns also ran until 2000. After being purchased by Disney, ABC's Saturday morning cartoons became part of a block called Disney's One Saturday Morning before switching to a block of live-action and animated programs under the banner ABC Kids in 2002. Many of the block's shows were produced by Disney and also aired on Disney Channel and/ or Toon Disney. At one point, ABC Kids had only two animated shows on its schedule, while the remainder of the lineup consisted of live-action entertainment shows. By late 2008, all shows that were part of the ABC Kids block were reruns of older episodes that originally aired a few years earlier, this remained the case for the next three years, with no episodes added into rotation (thus, for instance, the first season of \"Hannah Montana\" was still running on ABC Kids in constant repeats even though several further seasons had aired on Disney Channel by the time the block ended).\n\nDisney Channel (which, like ABC, is owned by The Walt Disney Company) launched a Saturday morning block of its popular animated programming, initially named Toonin' Saturdays, in June 2011. On August 27, 2011, ABC ended the ABC Kids block. ABC was the first network to outsource its E/I liabilities and Saturday morning program block to Litton; Litton's ABC block is known as the \"Weekend Adventure\". Disney Channel quietly ended its Saturday morning cartoon block in 2014, then brought it back in 2017 as \"Get Animated!\"\n\nIn 1999, CBS was purchased by Viacom, bringing it under the same ownership as popular children's network Nickelodeon. CBS in turn ran programming from Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. from 2000 until 2006, nearly a year after Viacom split into two separate companies (Nickelodeon went to a newly created company under the Viacom name and CBS became the flagship property of CBS Corporation). The two parties ended the Nickelodeon/Nick Jr.-branded block, which was replaced by the DIC Entertainment (now Cookie Jar Group) produced KOL Secret Slumber Party in September 2006. The block was rebranded as KEWLopolis, featuring an increased amount of animated series, in September 2007. On September 19, 2009, KEWLopolis was rebranded as Cookie Jar TV, with its target audience shifted toward preschoolers.\n\nCookie Jar TV ended its run on September 21, 2013, at which point Litton also took over programming CBS' E/I liabilities and Saturday morning programming. Litton's CBS block is known as the \"CBS Dream Team\". This is the second time CBS has dropped animated children's programming from its lineup; the network had previously gone with an all-live-action programming lineup for the 1997-98 season when the E/I rules took effect, but reverted to animated programming the following season. The \"Dream Team\" block is also unusual among the other Litton blocks as it includes scripted programming (as of 2016, only one scripted program, the government-funded police procedural \"The Inspectors\", airs on the block).\n\nFrom 1990 to 2002, Fox ran the Fox Kids block, which featured both animated and live-action series in the afterschool hours on weekday afternoons from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. (outcompeting with syndicated afternoon children's programs on independent stations and affiliates of smaller networks). Among its notable series included animated series such as \"Taz-Mania\"; \"\"; \"X-Men: The Animated Series\"; \"Eek! The Cat\"; \"Bobby's World\"; \"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" and \"Animaniacs\", live action shows like \"Power Rangers\" (American adaptation of \"Super Sentai\"); \"Goosebumps\" and \"Big Bad Beetleborgs\"; and Japanese anime series such as \"Digimon\" and \"\". Fox sold its children's division as part of its 2001 sale of Fox Family Channel (now Freeform) to The Walt Disney Company; the network then leased its remaining Saturday morning block to 4Kids Entertainment in 2002.\n\nThe 4Kids-produced block, which by that point became 4Kids TV, ended its run on December 27, 2008, Fox opted to drop children's programming altogether rather than lease the block to another company, becoming the third broadcast network (after Pax TV and UPN) to completely abandon children's programming, replaced 4Kids TV with a two-hour infomercial block called \"Weekend Marketplace\"; as with 4Kids TV and its predecessors, Fox has allowed several stations the option to decline to carry the block and lease it to another station in the market, especially those stations which had never carried Fox Kids following the affiliation changes resulting from Fox's 1994 affiliation agreement with New World Communications. Fox's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates instead hold the responsibility of carrying children's programming (generally through programs purchased off the syndication market).\n\nOn September 13, 2014, Fox's owned-and-operated stations (among some of their other affiliates, such as those owned by Tribune Company) picked up a new block entitled \"Xploration Station\" from Steve Rotfeld Productions. The three-hour block features E/I programs focused on science and space.\n\nOrigins\n\n\"Kids' WB\" debuted on The WB on September 9, 1995, as a block on weekday mornings, weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings. During the run of the weekday morning blocks, the network aired the animated series \"Histeria!\" to meet E/I content quotas for the network's affiliates. The \"Kids' WB\" weekday morning block ended in 2001, while the weekday afternoon block was discontinued on December 30, 2005 with The WB retaining the two afternoon hours to run a lineup of off-network syndicated reruns.\n\nThe CW begins airing children's programming\n\n\"Kids' WB\", now reduced to just the Saturday morning block that was expanded to five hours from four with the removal of the weekday afternoon lineup, moved to The CW (which is part-owned by The WB's former parent Time Warner) on September 23, 2006 (CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta debuted the block the following day as it opted to carry the block on Sundays). The \"Kids' WB\" block ended its run on May 17, 2008, and was replaced on May 24, 2008 by the 4Kids Entertainment-produced \"The CW4Kids\" (4Kids already produced Fox's \"4Kids TV\" block at that time, which would not end for another seven months due to a dispute with the network over distribution on Fox stations and compensation for the time lease). \"The CW4Kids\" was renamed \"Toonzai\" on August 14, 2010 (with the former brand being retained as a sub-brand to fulfill branding requirements imposed by 4Kids), \"Toonzai\" was replaced by \"Vortexx\", produced under a time lease agreement with Saban Brands (which had acquired some of 4Kids' assets, including certain programs, in an auction earlier in the year) on August 25, 2012.\n\n\"Vortexx\" ended its run on September 27, 2014, at which point the CW turned over its E/I liability and Saturday morning programming to Litton as well. Litton's CW block is known as \"One Magnificent Morning\" and, at five hours in length, it is two hours longer than the blocks Litton programs for ABC and CBS.\n\nNBC entered into a partnership with digital cable and satellite network Discovery Kids to provide original programming from the channel on NBC's Saturday morning lineup in 2002; Discovery Kids on NBC ran on the network from September 14, 2002 to September 2, 2006. NBC replaced that block with Qubo, a three-hour \"edutainment\" block that debuted on September 9, 2006 (with accompanying blocks on co-owned Spanish network Telemundo on weekend mornings and on Ion Television once weekly), as part of a programming partnership between parent company NBCUniversal, Ion Media Networks, Scholastic Press, Nelvana and Classic Media, that resulted in the creation of a companion digital multicast network on Ion Television's stations; the Qubo blocks on NBC and Telemundo ended on June 30, 2012, leaving only the Ion block and standalone Qubo Channel.\n\nOn July 7, 2012, NBC launched a new Saturday morning block aimed at preschool-aged children, NBC Kids, under a time lease agreement with co-owned cable network Sprout (which NBC, through corporate parent Comcast, also owned a minority interest before purchasing it outright in 2012). NBC Kids, which was the only and final Saturday morning programming block to air animated programming, ended its run on September 25, 2016.\n\nOn February 24, 2016, NBC announced a new E/I block produced by Litton Entertainment, The More You Know—a brand extension of NBC's public service announcement brand of the same name, and it launched on October 8, 2016, resulting in NBC removing all cartoons from its Saturday morning lineups for the first time since September 1992.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, ThisTV launched airing a daily children's program block called Cookie Jar Toons, which was programmed by Cookie Jar Group. The block featured mainly scripted animated and live action series; Cookie Jar-produced programs that did not count towards E/I quotas aired under the sub-block This is for Kids. Cookie Jar Toons/This is for Kids was discontinued on October 31, 2013, effectively removing Saturday children's programming from the network; after Tribune Broadcasting assumed part-ownership of ThisTV from Weigel Broadcasting the following day, Tribune replaced the block with a three-hour Sunday morning lineup of exclusively E/I-compliant programs from various syndication distributors.\n\nOn May 2, 2017, Sinclair Broadcasting Group announced that it would introduce a new children's programming block named \"KidsClick\", which airs on mainly CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, and nationally on This TV, beginning on July 1, 2017. The block was transferred from This TV to TBD nationally starting on July 1, 2018. As it currently runs, no E/I programming is part of the block.\n\nThe Cookie Jar Kids Network (formerly DiC Kids Network) was a syndicated children's programming block that aired select animated (and some live action) series from the Cookie Jar Group program library on Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliated stations, and Independent stations to allow these stations to meet required E/I programming quotas. This block ended on September 18, 2011.\n\nPBS has run daytime children's programming targeted at children between the ages of 4 and 12 since the network debuted on October 5, 1970. Its afternoon and Saturday morning children's programming was folded into a daily block called PTV (which aired weekdays from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to Noon local time). On September 6, 1999, the block was rebranded as PBS Kids and spun off a 24-hour cable channel using the same name, which was turned into a joint venture with Comcast, HIT Entertainment and Sesame Workshop in 2005, becoming PBS Kids Sprout. The PBS Kids cable channel was funded by DirecTV.\n\nThen, PBS Kids was divided into two sub-blocks and they were: PBS Kids Go! and the PBS Kids Preschool Block. An additional three-hour weekend morning block for preschool-aged children that was produced in conjunction with the Canadian production company Nelvana called the PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch debuted on September 30, 2000 and lasted until 2004. PBS Kids Go! debuted in 2004 and ended in 2013. The network continues to offer Saturday morning programming as of 2015, though as with most PBS programming, local member stations retain the right to refuse it outright for other programming such as instructional/DIY/cooking programming, carrying it on Sundays instead, or placing it on a subchannel. Also, other PBS member stations maintain full-time or half-time subchannels with self-programmed and slotted PBS Kids content which may share channel space with other networks such as Create or a local state political proceedings coverage network.\n\nRetro Television Network's Saturday morning lineup consisted of classic cartoons from the 1960s through 1990s, most of which were produced by Filmation licensed via DreamWorks Classics. Due to corporate consolidation which led to the DreamWorks library being owned by NBCUniversal (which had been unpaid in the past by the network for older primetime dramas) in 2016, this lineup was eventually pulled for low-cost barter E/I content and other newer cartoons unable to find distribution otherwise.\n\nOnly one cartoon series that aired on Saturdays was Bill Cosby's \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" during the early morning hours since moving from weeknights in 2012, having made it one of the only 3 subchannel networks that still aired cartoons without any advertisements aimed towards children and the only network that aired an African American cartoon since \"The Proud Family\" aired on ABC Kids from 2002 to 2005. Bounce TV still airs 3-hour E/I mandates on Saturdays. \"Fat Albert\" was discontinued on the network in July 2015 due to Cosby's assault allegations currently going through the court system, in concert with the network also removing his late 1990s CBS sitcom from their schedule.\n\nTeleXitos airs both cartoons and 3-hour children's programming; however, only two non-E/I programming airs in the early morning and afternoon hours such as \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" and \"\". Like Retro Television Network and MundoMax, it doesn't air commercials aimed at children. It's the only Spanish-language subchannel to air cartoons on Saturdays.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47515356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47515356", "title": "Shadowmatic", "text": "Shadowmatic\n\nShadowmatic is a puzzle game developed and published by indie studio Triada Studio Games from Armenia. Shadowmatic is an imagination stirring puzzle where the player rotates abstract objects in a spotlight to find recognizable silhouettes in projected shadows, relevant to the surrounding environment. The project is focused on delivering photorealistic graphics across iOS devices, combined with a challenging and relaxing gameplay. \"Shadowmatic\" was released on January 15, 2015 for iOS. The game won a 2015 Apple Design Award for the attention to detail, high-fidelity rendering, excellent execution, and perfect representation of Multi-touch game play.\n\nShadowmatic is a single player shadow puppet game. In the game, the player is presented with a very obscure, abstract object that, generally, doesn’t resemble anything. There’s an off-screen light source casting a shadow on the wall and the player's task is to rotate the object until the shadow forms a recognizable silhouette. Some levels feature two or three floating objects, adding more dimensions to the solution as the player attempts to not only rotate them correctly, but also position them relative to each other within 3D space, and thereby reveal the silhouette. In the levels with two or three objects, a button is supplied to switch control between them. \nHolding down this button and sliding a finger on the screen orbits the two objects around each other, which is a necessary aspect of the shadow's formation.\n\nLike other puzzle games, Shadowmatic is based on levels. Each level is themed, and the theme is reflected in the room’s surroundings—the animal levels, for example, take place in what looks like a jungle, while baby-themed levels take place in a nursery. The player will have to solve each stage before being able to move on to the next. In total, Shadowmatic has 70 levels that are spread out across the nine rooms. A progress meter at the bottom indicates how close the player is to finding it — the more dots are lit up, the closer.\n\nIf the player is stuck, there is a hints system, where they can pay with the in-game currency to reveal a clue about the silhouette they are trying to find. Even though it’s there, the developers don’t recommend using it to enjoy the game to the fullest. In-app purchases exist to purchase more hints. The player can also earn hints by completing levels.\nThe players earn hint-points depending on how fast they can solve it, and there are also secondary objectives and secrets that they'll discover as they go. The game has full Game Center integration for three leaderboards (score, completed levels, and secrets found), as well as 24 achievements to obtain.\n\nShadowmatic has received several awards including: \"Best Game Art\" Indie Prize at the Casual Connect Amsterdam 2016, \"Excellence in Visual Art\" and the \"Media Choice Award\" at the DevGAMM Moscow 2015. In June 2015 the game received the prestigious Apple Design Award at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2015.\nShadowmatic was featured in the CNN International's \"Silk Road: Past, Present, Future\" show's segment on digital technology and innovation in Armenia.\n"}

The term seems to have first appeared as a translation from the original Spanish , used to describe the post-Spanish-civil-war poetry movement of the 1950s and 60s (including poets such as ). Later, José Eduardo Limón, for example, has used it to describe Mexican-American Chicano poetry in Texas during the same period. Elsewhere, others have used the term to describe English-language poets such as W.H. Auden and George Bernard Shaw. Boston University has recently offered courses in “the social poetry of Central America.”\n\nMore recently, John Stubley has made use of the term as part of the Centre for Social Poetry. Stubley expands the idea to include what Owen Barfield describes as poetic “effect” – which distinguishes between the poetic \"form\" of words on a piece of paper, and the poetic \"effect\" of a “felt change of consciousness”. Stubley explores this poetic effect or experience as it occurs between human beings (socio-poetic experience), together with all that they can turn their minds and hands to in relation to the organisation (i.e., \"poeticisation\") of social life. He attempts to create spaces that give expression to imaginations of objective realities at work within the human and social organisms, thereby opening up the way to individual and social transformation.\n"}

An alternate version of Tai appears in Toei Company's 1999 series as the main protagonist of \"Digimon Adventure\", a supporting character in the sequel and once again as the protagonist of the films \"Digimon Adventure tri.\". In this timeline, Tai the leader of the first season DigiDestined. He is adventurous and a born leader, and is usually the first to spring into action. He is partnered with the dinosaur-like Agumon in the \"Digimon Adventure\" anime series.\n\nTai was created by manga author Tenya Yabuno from \"V-Tamer 01\". Multiple voice actors have voiced him across the franchise. Critical reception to Tai has been positive by writers from manga and anime websites. While his role and personality in the first Digimon series has been positive, writers expressed mixed thoughts about Tai's characterization in \"Tri\" due to lacking his hotblooded personality.\n\nTai's original character was designed by Tenya Yabuno, one of the authors of manga \"V-Tamer 01\". He was based on Kentarou Kamon, the protagonist of the \"Digimon\" manga pilot, \"C'mon Digimon\". While creating the \"Digimon Adventure\" short, director Mamoru Hosoda wanted to focus on Tai and Kari's relationship with Koromon, the Digimon that appeared in their house, but did not want to portray it as friendship, instead portraying Digimon as dangerous creatures.\n\nProducer Satoru Nishizono revealed that as the staff decided on Tai's name using kanji that related to \"luck\". While Tai was conceptualized as the main character, Toei wanted to focus on all the Digidestined children at the same time resulting in an ensemble cast. Nishizono stated that with the exception of Tai and Agumon, Toei was told to make in-depth young characters to fit's the series' viewers. The staff considered Tai to remain as a protagonist for the next sequel but instead ended as a supporting character. For \"Digimon Adventure: Children's War Game!\", Hosoda wanted to focus on Tai's naivete through his nervousness on interacting with Sora despite needing her help. While finding Tai's actions out of character, Hosoda wanted Tai to try his best to apologize with Sora.\n\nFor \"tri.\", Keitaro Motonaga stated the staff at Toei devised multiple scenarios to compare how he aged with his previous appearances. The staff also focused on his rivalry with Matt Ishida, due to how differently the two matured. Motonaga also commented that Tai was in a stage where he thought he would not be a teenager, which changed his characterization. In the \"Digimon Adventure tri.\" series, Tai's teenage appearance was designed by Atsuya Uki.\n\nIn Japan, Tai's appearances were voiced by Toshiko Fujita. During auditions, the staff immediately chose her as they were fans of her works. Fujita liked Tai's character, due to how he cares for his sister and for his clumsy personality. She did not find difficulties in voicing Tai for the first series. She also liked the relationship between Tai and Agumon, believing it to be one of the best from the anime based on their similarities. For \"tri\", Fujita was replaced by Natsuki Hanae, who had been a fan of the series since he was a child and enjoyed Tai's character based on his bravery and sense of justice. He rewatched the first anime and the film before auditioning. at the same time pressured. When reading the script, Hanae noted Tai was different due to how he aged and felt this change was natural.\n\nIn the English dub, the character's name was shortened to \"Tai\" from \"Taichi.\" Joshua Seth provides his voice. He did not find any impressions, during his audition for the character with comments on how he was close to the people in the cast. He felt Tai was similar to him so he \"pitched up [his voice] little bit younger\". Additionally, he stated he enjoyed voicing the character. However, by the time the film \"Revenge of Diaboromon\" was dubbed in English, he had retired from the voice acting industry in 2005, causing casting director Jeff Nimoy to cast Jason Spisak as his replacement, remarking how similar he sounded to Seth. Seth commented that his regular is very similar to the one from Tai in \"Tri\" was not difficult as he initially thought he had to \"warm\" up to the character.\n\nIn the \"V-Tamer 01\" story line, Tai is V-Pet trainer whose Digimon partner is a Veedramon that is named Zeromaru. Ending up in the Digital World after being summoned by MagnaAngemon, Tai accepts to aid in saving the Digital World from Daemon. During his adventures, Tai encounters Davis after he ended up in his universe, Ryo Akiyama, and Takuya Kanbara.\n\nIn the first \"Digimon Adventure\" short film, set in 1995, Tai and Kari discover a Digi-Egg hatching from Botamon to Koromon. This leads to their first encounter with Digimon. Greymon defeats Parrotmon, before they vanished. In \"Digimon Adventure\", set in 1999, Tai, Matt, Sora, Izzy, Mimi, Joe and T.K., receive each their \"Digivices\", and they are sent to the Digital World. There, they befriend each partners and use them to defeat one of the Digimon villains.\n\nIn \"Digimon Adventure 02\", Tai becomes a middle school student. He passes his goggles to Davis Motomiya, as he and the original group act as mentors, and support to the new Kids, whose membership includes their youngest members T.K and Kari. In the series epilogue, set in 2027, Tai becomes a United Nations diplomat for the Digital World and has a son with a Koromon as his partner Digimon.

They learn from their teacher and agent, Daigo Nishijima, that a mysterious virus are infecting every Digimon, and causing distortions between the human world and the Digital World.\n\nTai appears in several Digimon video games released by Namco Bandai. \n\nIn Japan, several image songs were released under Tai's name. was performed by Toshiko Fujita and released on March 24, 2000 on the compilation CD album \"Digimon Adventure: Best Hit Parade\". For \"Digimon Adventure 02\", a character CD single was released on June 21, 2000 under Tai's name and contained his theme song, and a duet with Agumon titled \"Team\", with Fujita providing Tai's voice once again. On August 1, 2009, a CD album titled was released to celebrate the show's 10th anniversary, with Fujita returning to perform under Tai's name.

When the same question was asked three more times, his rank fell to 6th, rose to 4th, and finally landed at 5th. IGN listed him as 62nd best animated character, praising his ability to admit his mistakes and his relationship with his Digimon partner, Agumon, which made one of the most popular characters from the 90s. In a poll he was voted as the 5th \"Which catcher/trainer would take home the gold?\"\n\nMultiple writers for manga and anime have commented on Tai's character. IGN listed how Tai forces Agumon to evolve into SkullGreymon as one of the best moments from the first \"Digimon\" anime. Additionally, Tai and Koromon's brief return to the real world as listed as another moment due to Tai's brief interactions with his younger sister, Kari. Anime News Network highly praised Tai's character in the first series due to how he matures as a kid due to how he takes care of his sister most notably when she was sick and he got tired of seeing her inside the house while her parents were busy at work. Additionally, the site commented on Tai and Yamato's misrelationship due to their multiple differences that made them often clash. Retro Junk liked for how he looks after his group and that despite his issues, his friends respect him. THEM Anime Reviews liked the rivalry between Tai and Yamato, citing that at the same time both are similar character due to the two of them being big brothers who are often worried about their siblings. The same site also praised Joshua Seth for giving making Tai more appealing. Adam \"OMEGA\" Arnold from Animefringe praised the amount of focus given to Tai's character in the trilogy film \"Digimon: The Movie\" alongside other present characters. Shamus Kelley from Den of Geek also acclaimed Seth's acting in the movie due to the multiple emotions Tai shows across the trilogy as well as how the character tries to handle his relationship with Sora. In the book \"Digimon Power: The Ultimate Guide to the Coolest New Monster Game!\" a young reader expressed he liked Tai's character design for how large and spiky is his hair. In the book \"Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces\", Brian Camp stated that Tai's apparent relationship with Sora who is later revealed to be interested into Matt was well handled as due to the characters' ages in contrast to other Western series.\n\nTai's characterization in \"Tri.\" resulted in mixed comments by Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network due his new hesitations which might not appeal to viewers of the series. While feeling it as part of Tai's character arc Christian Chiok from Japanator found Tai's traits out of character contrasting previous \"Digimon\" main characters. However, there were positive comments by Shamus Kelley from Den of Geek approved of Tai's new character arc noting that \"Tri\" focuses on personal responsibility and his potential for character growth. DVDTalk's writer Chris Zimmerman praised the still ongoing arguments between Tai and Yamato in \"Tri\" as fans from the first \"Digimon\" series would still find it memorable due to the history between these two characters. Otaku USA noted the arguments between these two characters as well and stated \"Tai is actually the character who seems to be suffering from arrested development the most\". Kelley complained about Tai and Yamato's still ongoing conflict in the next films commenting there were already enough in the first film and the possibility that Tai did not have character development in such movie. For the next film, Kelley readdressed such issues that were more present in the movie. In a \"Coexistence\" review, Anime Now's Richard Eisenbeis believes Tai managed to fully mature during the climax of the film due to his decisions in regards to who is the enemy, contrasting the original series where it was more obvious where Tai, as a kid, could easily is the enemy.\n\n"}

The film was remade for American audiences by James Young in 1921, starring George Arliss in his film debut.\n\nFrom the original ad campaign, \"Here is a story mounted in settings and scenes of splendor and luxury. A story that is as old as yesterday; as true as today; and as new as tomorrow. A production of real mark and unexcelled distinction. As the central figure George Arliss is an unforgettable picture of fiendish, subtle, domineering and diabolic ingenuity; of cunning, sardonic and unrelenting resourcefulness. Yet he is the suave, charming, polished and artistic Devil.\"\n\nThis satiric drama was based on the 1908 play by Ferenc Molnar that launched Arliss on Broadway, and was used to entice him into his very first (of many) films. Earlier versions were made by no less than Thomas Edison and D.W. Griffith. The original play title was \"The Devil; A Comedy in Three Acts.\" In an interview from Motion Picture World, January 1921, Mr. Arliss told reporters he decided to go into films, after being impressed by the work of Charlie Chaplin. The director then made a screen test to show Arliss how intimate the camera was, and how it exaggerated gestures. Arliss said films would probably lead to better acting on the stage, when actors could study their technique on the big screen.\n\nDr. Muller (Arliss), a friend to all, finds pleasure in turning the goodness in people to evil ends. He meets Marie Matin (Lucy Cotton) and her fiancé, Georges Roben (Roland Bottomley), while viewing a new painting, \"The Martyr-Truth Crucified by Evil.\" Marie declares that the picture was wrong: Evil could never triumph over Truth, and though Muller says he agrees with her, he plots to prove otherwise. To this end, he entangles Marie with artist Paul de Veaux (Edmund Lowe), Georges's best friend, causing the latter's model, Mimi (Sylvia Breamer), to become jealous. Georges, believing that he is standing between Paul and Marie, releases Marie from her engagement. Marie finds Paul and Mimi alone together, late one evening, and turns back to Georges, whom she marries. This does not discourage Muller, who but for Marie's purity almost succeeds in his evil designs. As a last resort, Muller lures Marie to his apartment to trick her. There in a moment of dramatic conflict—she prays for help; a vision of a shining cross appears; and Muller is consumed in flames. Note: This was also the first film for Fredric March and Mrs. George Arliss.\n\nThis once lost film has recently been rediscovered and is now being restored by the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nOn a 2010 episode of The History Channel series \"American Pickers\" the show's hosts are invited to search under the stage of a turn of the century theater and film hall. Under the stage, they find a dusty stack of old movie posters, the main and most vivid being a forgotten poster for the 1921 version of \"The Devil\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "90742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90742", "title": "Uncle Scrooge", "text": "Uncle Scrooge\n\nUncle Scrooge (stylized as Uncle $crooge) is a comic book starring Scrooge McDuck (\"the richest duck in the world\"), his nephew Donald Duck, and grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and revolving around their adventures in Duckburg and around the world. It was first published in Four Color Comics #386 March 1952, as a spin-off of the popular \"Donald Duck\" series and is still presently ongoing. It has been produced under the aegis of several different publishers, including Western Publishing (initially in association with Dell Comics and later under its own subsidiary, Gold Key Comics and its Whitman imprint), Gladstone Publishing, Disney Comics, Gemstone Publishing, Boom! Studios, and IDW Publishing, and has undergone several hiatuses of varying length. Despite this, it has maintained the same numbering scheme throughout its six decade history, with only IDW adding a secondary numbering that started at #1.\n\nBesides Scrooge and his family, recurring characters include Gyro Gearloose, Gladstone Gander, Emily Quackfaster, and Brigitta MacBridge. Among the adversaries who make repeat appearances are the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell, John D. Rockerduck and Flintheart Glomgold. \"Uncle Scrooge\" is one of the core titles of the \"Duck universe\".\n\nIts early issues by famed writer/artist (and creator of Scrooge McDuck) Carl Barks formed the inspiration for the syndicated television cartoon \"DuckTales\" in the late 1980s. Several stories written by Barks and published in \"Uncle Scrooge\" were adapted as episodes of \"DuckTales\".\n\nThe first 70 issues mostly consisted of stories written and drawn by Carl Barks. The 71st issue had a story written by Barks and drawn by Tony Strobl. Subsequent Gold Key Comics issues combined reprints of earlier Barks tales with new material by creators such as Strobl, Vic Lockman, Phil DeLara, Jack Manning, and Pete Alvarado.\n\nWhen Gladstone Publishing relaunched the title in 1986, a new generation of American creators began contributing to the title, including Don Rosa, William Van Horn, John Lustig, Pat McGreal, Dave Rawson, and Michael T. Gilbert. As before, their work was intermingled with Carl Barks reprints, as well as with translations of European Disney comics by such creators as Daan Jippes, Fred Milton and Romano Scarpa originally published by Oberon, Egmont (originally Gutenberghus) and Disney Italy/Mondadori.\n\n\nScrooge made his first appearance in the Donald Duck story \"Christmas on Bear Mountain\" as a curmudgeonly man who decides to test Donald and his nephews to see if they are worthy of inheriting his wealth. Barks found the character and his wealth a useful springboard for stories and re-used him in a number of subsequent Donald Duck one-shot adventures and ten pagers appearing in \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\". By 1952 the popularity of the character convinced Dell to give Scrooge a try-out as a lead character in the seminal \"Only a Poor Old Man\" in Dell's \"Four Color\" anthology series, a story Barks expert Michael Barrier has termed a masterpiece. After two further \"Four Color\" appearances Scrooge was granted his own title starting with issue number 4 (counting the try-out issues as one through three).\n\nThe series continued uninterrupted (though not always on a monthly schedule) until 1984, when Western Publishing (the parent company of Gold Key/Whitman, who were publishing the title at the time) withdrew from the comic book business. Western had held the Disney comic book license since the late 1930s, and their withdrawal left the license, and \"Uncle Scrooge\", in limbo for two years, when Another Rainbow, who had been publishing hardbound compilations of Carl Barks's work for several years, acquired it and launched Gladstone Publishing, resuming the title where Whitman had left off.\n\nGladstone continued publishing \"Uncle Scrooge\" until their license expired in 1990. At that point, the series shifted over to Disney Comics with little change in editorial direction. It was one of only three monthly titles to survive the \"Disney implosion\" of 1991 (the others being \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" and \"Donald Duck Adventures\"), and continued to be published by Disney Comics until 1993, when Disney Comics folded and the license was reacquired by Gladstone Publishing. Gladstone went through their own implosion in 1998, and \"Uncle Scrooge\" was briefly converted into a double-sized (64 page), \"prestige\" format series, before Gladstone ended publication entirely later that year.\n\nNo further issues were published until 2003, when Gemstone Publishing (whose editorial staff included several former employees of Gladstone) acquired the license and resumed publication of \"Uncle Scrooge\". Gemstone maintained the prestige format previously adopted by Gladstone, and continued to publish the series until November 2008. Financial difficulties at Gemstone ended its run then, and the license was acquired by Boom! Studios, who reverted to the standard 32 page format when they began publication in late 2009. Boom's run ended in 2011, when the Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Marvel Entertainment lead to the consolidation of all Disney comics licenses under Marvel Comics.\n\nIn January 2015, IDW Publishing announced that they would be publishing the title, starting in April 2015.\n\nOver the years, Scrooge McDuck has proven popular enough to appear as the main character in a number of other comic book series. Many of these series include republications of stories originally written for the \"main\" \"Uncle Scrooge\" title in the United States or various European countries.\n\nScrooge often appeared in \"The Beagle Boys\" alongside his frequent adversaries, published irregularly by Gold Key from 1963 to 1979. When that title ended, it was relaunched as \"The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge\" in March 1979 and lasted for twelve issues, until February 1980.\n\nIn 1987, Gladstone Publishing began publication of \"Uncle Scrooge Adventures\", which they would continue to publish until 1998, excluding the period from 1990 through 1993, when Disney Comics held the license to publish Disney comics.\n\nScrooge was also a major character in three different comic book titles tied in with the \"DuckTales\" television series. The first of these consisted of 13 issues and was published by Gladstone Publishing from 1987 to 1990. The second consisted of 18 issues published by Disney Comics from 1990 through 1991. The final (to date) was published over six issues by Boom Kids! in 2011. Several \"DuckTales\" comics starring Scrooge would also appear in the pages of \"Disney Adventures\" in the early 1990s.\n\nFinally, \"The Adventurous Uncle Scrooge McDuck\", published by Gladstone, ran for two issues in 1998. A third issue was planned but cancelled along with the rest of Gladstone's output other than \"Uncle Scrooge\" and \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" following a collapse in comics sales.\n\n\n"}

The series takes an in-depth look into the cases of people who have gone missing. The show is produced by Tenderfoot TV.\n\nThe series explores cases of people who went missing or have disappeared in order to discover what happened to them and their whereabouts. The first season dealt with the disappearance of Tara Grinstead, a beauty queen and school teacher who disappeared in Ocilla, Georgia. Season 2 aired in August 2018 focusing on the disappearance of Kristal Reisinger in Crestone, Colorado.\n\nIn 2016, documentary filmmaker Payne Lindsey of Tenderfoot TV studios began researching the Tara Grinstead cold case as a possibility for a new film. Lindsey became aware of Tara Grinstead's case because of its reputation as the largest case file in Georgia state history, but he also soon discovered that his grandmother's friend was one of the last people to see Tara alive. Inspired by the popular NPR podcast Serial, Lindsey recorded his research in a podcast style format detailing the specifics of the case, as well as interviews with key witnesses. The podcast, \"Up and Vanished,\" premiered on Apple Podcasts and the show's website, upandvanished.com, on August 7, 2016. Soon after the podcast's release it made the top charts and began receiving attention and notoriety within the small Ocilla, Georgia community. The podcast is credited with reigniting the discussion on the case after it sat dormant for twelve years. In the statement by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation announcing the arrest of Ryan Alexander Duke in connection to the murder, the GBI's spokesperson thanked the media for keeping the public interested in the case.\n\nA television show based on the podcast is in development with Oxygen set to premier sometime in the future.\n"}

{"id": "18824506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18824506", "title": "Walking in the United Kingdom", "text": "Walking in the United Kingdom\n\nWalking is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities in the United Kingdom, and within England and Wales there is a comprehensive network of rights of way that permits access to the countryside. Furthermore, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land has opened up since the enactment of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. In Scotland the ancient tradition of universal access to land was formally codified under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. However, there are few rights of way, or other access to land in Northern Ireland. \n\nWalking is used in the United Kingdom to describe a range of activity, from a walk in the park to trekking in the Alps. The word \"hiking\" is used in the UK, but less often than walking; the word rambling is also used, and the main organisation that supports walking is called The Ramblers. Walking in mountainous areas in the UK is called hillwalking, or in Northern England, including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking, from the dialect word fell, for high, uncultivated land. Mountain walking can sometimes involve scrambling.\n\nThe idea of undertaking a walk through the countryside for pleasure developed in the 18th-century, and arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature, associated with the Romantic movement. In earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy.\n\nThomas West, an English priest, popularised the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed\n\nto encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.\n\nTo this end he included various \"stations\" or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. Published in 1778 the book was a major success.\n\nAnother famous early exponent of walking for pleasure was the English poet William Wordsworth. In 1790 he embarked on an extended tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany, a journey subsequently recorded in his long autobiographical poem \"The Prelude\" (1850). His famous poem \"Tintern Abbey\" was inspired by a visit to the Wye Valley made during a walking tour of Wales in 1798 with his sister Dorothy Wordsworth. Wordsworth's friend Coleridge was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799, he and Wordsworth undertook a three weeks tour of the Lake District. John Keats, who belonged to the next generation of Romantic poets began, in June 1818, a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the Lake District with his friend Charles Armitage Brown.\n\nMore and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th-century, of which the most famous is probably Robert Louis Stevenson's journey through the Cévennes in France with a donkey, recorded in his \"Travels with a Donkey\" (1879). Stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay \"Walking Tours\". The subgenre of travel writing produced many classics in the subsequent 20th-century. An early American example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist John Muir's \"A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf\" (1916), a posthumous published account of a long botanising walk, undertaken in 1867.\n\nDue to industrialisation in England, people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were often cramped and unsanitary. They would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the countryside. However, the land in England, particularly around the urban areas of Manchester and Sheffield, was privately owned and trespass was illegal. Rambling clubs soon sprang up in the north and began politically campaigning for the legal 'right to roam'. One of the first such clubs, was 'Sunday Tramps' founded by Leslie White in 1879. The first national grouping, the Federation of Rambling Clubs, was formed in London in 1905 and was heavily patronised by the peerage.\n\nAccess to Mountains bills, that would have legislated the public's 'right to roam' across some private land, were periodically presented to Parliament from 1884 to 1932 without success. Finally, in 1932, the Rambler's Right Movement organised a mass trespass on Kinder Scout in Derbyshire. Despite attempts on the part of the police to prevent the trespass from going ahead it was successfully achieved due to massive publicity. However, the Mountain Access Bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers, including the organisation The Ramblers, who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights, and it was eventually repealed.\n\nThe effort to improve access led after World War II to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and in 1951 to the creation of the first national park in the UK, the Peak District National Park. The establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors enthusiasts. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 considerably extended the right to roam in England and Wales.\n\nA walking tour is an extended walk in the countryside, undertaken by an individual, or group for several days. Walking tours have their origin in the Romantic movement of the late 18th, early 19th-century. It has some similarities with backpacking, trekking, and also tramping in New Zealand, though it need not take place in remote places. In the late 20th-century, with proliferation of official and unofficial long distance walking routes, walkers now are more likely to follow a long distance way, than to plan their own walking tour. Such tours are also organised by commercial companies, and can have a professional guide, or are self-guided; in these commercially organised tours, luggage is often transported between accommodation stops.\n\nIn England and Wales the public has a legally protected right to \"pass and repass\" (i.e. walk) on footpaths, bridleways and other routes which have the status of a public right of way. Footpaths typically pass over private land, but if they are public rights of way they are public highways with the same protection in law as other highways, such as trunk roads. Public rights of way originated in common law, but are now regulated by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. These rights have occasionally resulted in conflicts between walkers and landowners. The rights and obligations of farmers who cultivate crops in fields crossed by public footpaths are now specified in the law. Walkers can also use permissive paths, where the public does not have a legal right to walk, but where the landowner has granted permission for them to walk.\n\nDefinitive maps of public rights of way have been compiled for all of England and Wales as a result of Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, except the 12 Inner London boroughs which, along with the City of London, were not covered by the Act.\n\nTo protect the existing rights of way in London the Ramblers launched their \"Putting London on the Map\" in 2010 with the aim of getting \"the same legal protection for paths in the capital as already exists for footpaths elsewhere in England and Wales. Currently, legislation allows the Inner London boroughs to choose to produce definitive maps if they wish, but none do so\".\n\nWalkers long campaigned for the right to roam, that is access to privately owned uncultivated land. In 1932 the mass trespass of Kinder Scout had a far-reaching impact. The 1949 Countryside Act created the concept of designated open Country, where access agreements were negotiated with landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 gave walkers a conditional right to access most areas of uncultivated land.\n\nIn Scotland there is a traditional presumption of universal access to land. This was formally codified into Scots law under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, which grants everyone the right to be on most land and inland water for recreation, education and going from place to place providing they act responsibly. The basis of access rights in Scotland is one of shared responsibilities, in that those exercising such rights have to act responsibly, whilst landowners and managers have a reciprocal responsibility to respect the interests of those who exercise their rights. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides detailed guidance on these responsibilities.\n\nResponsible access can be enjoyed over the majority of land in Scotland, including all uncultivated land such as hills, mountains, moorland, woods and forests. Access rights also apply to fields in which crops have not been sown or in which there are farm animals grazing; where crops are growing or have been sown access rights are restricted to the margins of those fields. Access rights do not apply to land on which there is a building, plant or machinery. Where that building is a house or other dwelling (e.g. a static caravan) the land surrounding it is also excluded in order to provide reasonable measures of privacy. The issue of how much land surrounding a building is required to provide \"reasonable measures of privacy\" has been the main issue on which the courts have been asked to intervene. In \"Gloag v. Perth and Kinross Council\" the sheriff allowed about surrounding Kinfauns Castle, a property belonging to Ann Gloag, to be excluded from access rights. In \"Snowie v Stirling Council and the Ramblers’ Association\" the courts allowed about to be excluded, but refused permission for a wider area to be excluded and required the landowner to keep the driveway unlocked to allow access.\n\nIn addition to the general right of access the public also have the right to use any defined route over which the public has been able to pass unhindered for at least 20 years. However, local authorities are not required to maintain and signpost public rights of way as they are in England and Wales.\n\nNorthern Ireland has very few public rights of way and access to land in Northern Ireland is more restricted than other parts of the UK, so that in many areas walkers can only enjoy the countryside because of the goodwill and tolerance of landowners. Permission has been obtained from all landowners across whose land the Waymarked Ways and Ulster Way traverse. Much of Northern Ireland's public land is accessible, e.g. Water Service and Forest Service land, as is land owned and managed by organisations such as the National Trust and the Woodland Trust.\n\nNorthern Ireland shares the same legal system as England, including concepts about the ownership of land and public rights of way, but it has its own court structure, system of precedents and specific access legislation.\n\nLong-distance paths are created by linking public footpaths, other rights of way, and sometimes permissive paths, to form a continuous walking route. They are usually waymarked and guidebooks are available for most long-distance paths. Paths are generally well signposted, although a map is also needed, and a compass may sometimes be needed on high moorland. There are usually places to camp on an extended trip, but accommodation of various kinds is available on many routes. However, occasionally paths are distant from settlements, so that camping is necessary. Water is not available on high downland paths, like The Ridgeway, though taps have been provided at some spots.\n\nFifteen paths in England and Wales have the status of National Trails, which attract government financial support. Twenty-nine paths in Scotland have the similar status of Scotland's Great Trails. The first long-distance path was the Pennine Way, which was proposed by Tom Stephenson in 1935, and finally opened in 1965. Other paths include South Downs Way and Offa's Dyke Path. Major guides to these long-distance footpaths in Britain are provided by HMSO for the Countryside Commission, one of the first being that for the Pennine Way by Tom Stephenson in the 1960s.\n\nWalks or hikes undertaken in upland country, moorland, and mountains, especially when they include climbing a summit are sometimes described as hillwalking or fellwalking in the United Kingdom. Though hillwalking can entail scrambling to reach a mountain summit, it is not mountaineering. Fellwalking is a word used specifically to refer to hill or mountain walking in Northern England, including the Lake District, Lancashire, especially the Forest of Bowland, and the Yorkshire Dales, where fell is a dialect word for high, uncultivated land.\n\nPopular locations for hillwalking include the Lake District, the Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales, Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains, Wales, Dartmoor and the Scottish Highlands, including the Cairngorms, the largest National Park in the UK. The mountains in Britain are modest in height, with Ben Nevis at the highest, but the unpredictably wide range of weather conditions, and often difficult terrain, can make walking in many areas challenging. Peak bagging provides a focus for the activities of many hillwalkers. The first of the many hill lists compiled for this purpose was the Munros – mountains in Scotland over – which remains one of the most popular.\n\nThe United Kingdom offers a wide variety of ascents, from gentle rolling lowland hills to some very exposed routes in the moorlands and mountains. The term \"climbing\" is used for the activity of tackling the more technically difficult ways of getting up hills involving rock climbing while hillwalking refers to relatively easier routes.\nMany of the world's mountaintops may be reached by walking or scrambling up their least steep side. In Great Britain ridge routes which involve some scrambling are especially popular, including Crib Goch on Snowdon, the north ridge of Tryfan, Striding Edge on Helvellyn and Sharp Edge on Blencathra in the Lake District, as well as numerous routes in Scotland such as the Aonach Eagach ridge in Glencoe. Many such routes include a \"bad step\" where the scrambling suddenly becomes much more serious.\n\nIn Britain, the term \"mountaineering\" tends to be reserved for technical climbing on mountains, or for serious domestic hillwalking, especially in winter, with additional equipment such as ice axe and crampons, or for routes requiring rock-climbing skills and a rope, such as the traverse of the Cuillin ridge, on the Scottish island of Skye. The British Mountaineering Council provides more information on this topic.\n\nNavigation and map-reading are essential hillwalking skills on high ground and mountains, due to the variability of British and Irish weather and the risk of rain, low cloud, fog or the onset of darkness. In some areas it is common for there to be no waymarked path to follow. In most areas walking boots are essential along with weatherproof clothing, spare warm clothes, and in mountainous areas a bivvy bag or bothy bag in case an accident forces a prolonged, and possibly overnight halt. Other important items carried by hillwalkers are: food and water, an emergency whistle, torch/flashlight (and spare batteries), and first aid kit. And, where reception permits, a fully charged mobile phone is recommended. Hillwalkers are also advised to let someone know their route and estimated time of return or arrival.\n\nW A Poucher (1891–1988) wrote several hillwalking guide books, in the 1960s, which describe, in detail, the various routes up specific mountains, along with the precautions needed and other practical information useful to walkers. The guides cover Wales, Peak District, Scotland, Isle of Skye and the Lake District. Even more detailed guides were written by Alfred Wainwright (1907–1991) but these are mainly restricted to the Lake District and environs. His main series of seven books was first published between 1955 and 1966. Both authors describe the major paths, their starting points and the peaks where they end, with important landmarks along each route. Neither are entirely comprehensive. More recently Mark Richards has written numerous walking guides, especially for the Lake District, for the publisher Cicerone, who are now the leading publisher of walking guides in the UK. The Scottish Mountaineering Club are, through the experience and knowledge of their members, the largest publishers of guidebooks to climbing and walking in Scotland.\n\nWalking is a popular recreational activity in London, despite traffic congestion. There are many areas that provide space for interesting walks, including commons, parks, canals, and disused railway tracks. This includes Wimbledon Common, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, Hampton Court Park, and Epping Forest. In recent years access to canals and rivers, including the Regents Canal, and the River Thames has been greatly improved, and as well a number of long distance walking routes have been created that link green spaces.\n\nThe following are some of long distance routes in London:\n\nChallenge walks are strenuous walks by a defined route to be completed in a specified time. Many are organised as annual events, with hundreds of participants. In May and June, with longer daylight hours, challenge walks may be 40 or more miles. A few are overnight events, covering distances up to 100 miles. Well-known challenge walks include the Lyke Wake Walk and the Three Peaks Challenge in Yorkshire, and the Three Towers Hike in Berkshire. See also Long Distance Walkers Association.\nThere are also some challenge walks aimed at children, young adults and youth groups such as the Chase Walk.\n\nIn the UK the health benefits of walking are widely recognised. In 1995 Dr William Bird, a general practitioner, started the concept of \"health walks\" for his patients—regular, brisk walks undertaken to improve an individual's health. This led to the formation of the Walking for Health Initiative (WfH, formerly known as 'Walking the way to Health' or WHI) by Natural England and the British Heart Foundation. WfH trains volunteers to lead free health walks from community venues such as libraries and GP surgeries. The scheme has trained more than 35,000 volunteers and there are more than 500 Walking for Health schemes across the UK, with thousands of people walking every week. In 2008 the Ramblers launched its flagship Get Walking Keep Walking project, funded by the Big Lottery and Ramblers Holidays Charitable Trust. Unlike regular health walks, the Get Walking Keep Walking model uses targeted outreach programmes based around a 12-week walking plan to encourage regular independent walking. In the same year, a new organisation, Walk England was formed, with aid from the National Lottery and the Department for Transport, to provide support to health, transport and environmental professionals who are working to encourage walking.\n\nThe government agency responsible for promoting access to the countryside in England is Natural England. In Wales the comparable body is the Countryside Council for Wales, and in Scotland Scottish Natural Heritage. The Ramblers (Britain's Walking Charity) promotes the interests of walkers in Great Britain and provides information for its members and others. Local Ramblers volunteers organise hundreds of group-led walks every week, all across Britain. These are primarily for members; non-members are welcomed as guests for two or three walks. The Get Walking Keep Walking project provides free led walks for residents in certain areas, information and resources to those new to walking. \n\nAmong the organisations that promote the interest of walkers are: the Ramblers Association, the British Mountaineering Council, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, The Online Fellwalking Club, and the Long Distance Walkers Association, which assists users of long-distance trails and challenge walkers. Organisations which provide overnight accommodation for walkers include the Youth Hostels Association in England and Wales, the Scottish Youth Hostels Association, and the Mountain Bothies Association.\n\n\n"}

Pieces can be performed by the writer, or by another performer, sometimes anonymously. Since its launch, \"YKB\" has been continuously performed across the United States.\n\n\"Yoni Ki Baat\" was developed in 2003 by South Asian Sisters, a non-profit collective of South Asian women based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Co-founders Maulie Dass, Sapna Shahani, and Vandana Makker sent out a call in February 2003, and described receiving an outpouring of submissions. The first public performances in July 2003 at UC Berkeley included monologues dealing with abuse, menstruation, masturbation, orgasms, marriage, religious faith, and political protest.\n\nAccording to co-founder Vandana Makker:\"\"Yoni Ki Baat\" allows individuals who identify as women of South Asian ancestry the space to share their stories around issues that are often 'taboo' (and therefore not discussed) in our communities.

{"id": "6104770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6104770", "title": "Zuffa", "text": "Zuffa\n\nZuffa, LLC () is an American sports promotion company specializing in mixed martial arts. It was founded in January 2001 in Las Vegas, Nevada, by Station Casinos executives Frank Fertitta III and Lorenzo Fertitta to be the parent entity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) after they purchased it from the Semaphore Entertainment Group. The word \"Zuffa\" is an Italian word (), meaning \"fight\". On July 11, 2016, Zuffa announced that it would be purchased by WME-IMG for the price of $4.025 billion.\n\nThroughout the existence of the International Fight League (IFL) between 2006 and 2008, both Zuffa and the IFL had competed in a hostile relationship. Zuffa accused the IFL of and sued them for illegally using proprietary information obtained by hiring executives from the UFC organization. The IFL responded with their own suit claiming that Zuffa was threatening potential partners not to work with the IFL, including Fox Sports Net (a deal with Fox Sports was later signed before resolution of the suit). The tension between the IFL and the UFC worsened with accusations that the IFL had attempted to buy out several top UFC fighters.\n\nIn July 2008, there were reports of the IFL's possible purchase by the UFC. That same month, Joe Favorito, former IFL senior vice president, cited financial troubles for the closing of the company on July 31, 2008. Anonymous sources stated that Zuffa had bought the IFL. Other reports cited the UFC's airing of IFL footage on its programming, and the signing of previous IFL fighters, as an indirect confirmation of the purchase.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, Zuffa acquired the assets of the World Fighting Alliance, and formed WFA Enterprises, LLC. as a subsidiary to handle these assets, including select fighter contracts. On the same day, it was reported that Zuffa was formalizing plans to buy World Extreme Cagefighting, to be run as a separate promotion from the UFC.\n\nFollowing the purchase of the WEC, Zuffa made several changes to the promotion. This included modifying the WEC's cage, transferring to a focus on lighter weight classes, giving it the ability to host events in Las Vegas, and having the championships of fighters who were contracted UFC fighters vacated. From 2007 to the end of 2010, the WEC was run as a separate promotion under the Zuffa banner, airing events 28 to 53 on Versus in the US and on The Score in Canada. On October 28, 2010, Dana White announced that the WEC would be absorbed into the UFC in early 2011.\n\nOn March 27, 2007, it was announced that Frank Fertitta III and Lorenzo Fertitta were acquiring the assets of Pride Fighting Championships, the UFC's largest rival, from Dream Stage Entertainment. To handle the take over, the Fertitta brothers created a new corporate entity to handle the assets, Pride FC Worldwide Holdings LLC. With common ownership in place, Zuffa and Pride Worldwide would be working closely together. Although goals of reviving Pride were not realized, many of Pride's assets, including contracts with fighters and intellectual property, are now regularly utilized by the UFC.\n\nStarting around 2008, UFC president Dana White began a long media battle with their main competitor, Strikeforce, and their main media partner, Showtime. White had expressed that he had \"no beef with Strikeforce\", instead indicating a greater dislike for Showtime, and Ken Hershman in particular. However, White did express in an interview that he had a mutual relationship with Strikeforce founder and CEO Scott Coker, explaining that Coker was caught up in his battle with Showtime.\n\nOn March 1, 2011, Scott Coker was noted for dismissing rumors of a pending sale to Zuffa as \"crazy.\" Coker went on to explain that Strikeforce was searching for \"strategic partners\" and that there were at least two (some reports say three) potential investors, but that \"the UFC is not one of them.\" One of the potential investors has been documented to have been ProElite.\n\nHowever, on March 12, 2011, it was announced in an interview of Dana White by journalist Ariel Helwani that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce. The deal was made between Zuffa and partial Strikeforce owner Silicon Valley Sports and Entertainment. The amount of money involved has not been officially disclosed, however, it has been reported that the deal was worth $40 million.\n\nSources have confirmed that Scott Coker attempted to not sell Strikeforce to Zuffa. However, Coker ultimately failed and agreed to sell Strikeforce's licensing rights, fighter contracts, and video library to Zuffa on March 10 or 11. On March 14, 2011, Zuffa held a conference call to officially announce the acquisition of Strikeforce. On March 28, 2011, Scott Coker stated that he felt that the acquisition would be good for the sport of mixed martial arts. This was in contradiction of his original resistance of selling Strikeforce to Zuffa. Ultimately, Strikeforce was operated as a separate company, similar to that of the WEC, until January 12, 2013, when the final Strikeforce show was held in Oklahoma City. After which, the promotion was dissolved, and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.\n\nWhen United Glory was originally formed in 2006, it was known as Ultimate Glory before a lawsuit with Zuffa forced a name change.\n\nIn June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a multi-year, multi-event broadcast deal to show and archive all Invicta FC events on UFC Fight Pass. This has allowed the UFC to further expand its women's divisions by adding a strawweight division in July 2014, and signing Invicta fighters such as Carla Esparza and Felice Herrig.\n\nIn June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a development deal with the recently revived, Vale Tudo Japan. A brand that was brought back in 2012 by the long running, Shooto promotion. The UFC plans on promoting and operating a new tournament series that will focus on 135 and 145 pound divisions. There were plans of a \"The Ultimate Fighter\"-like TV show to help promote these tournaments but it is unclear on what the status remains on it.\n\nOn January 12, 2010, Zuffa sold a minority interest in the company to Flash Entertainment. The company announced the completion of a deal in which a 10-percent interest in the company to the Abu Dhabi government-owned Flash Entertainment. With the sale, company ownership would be 40.5 percent held by Lorenzo Fertitta, the company’s CEO and chairman, 40.5 percent held by his older brother, Frank Fertitta III, 10 percent by Flash Entertainment and nine percent by Dana White. Flash Entertainment was formed in 2008 by the Abu Dhabi government’s Executive Affairs Authority.\n\nIn December 2010, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against video game publisher Ubisoft, for what they claimed was a violation of trademark on the game, \"Fighters Uncaged\", packaging. On the packaging of the game the trademarked term, \"Ultimate Fighting\" is shown in all capital letters. Zuffa claimed that the use of the term is identical or confusingly similar to the use of the UFC's trademarks. While Ubisoft failed to provide any comments on the lawsuit, by August 2011, the two companies announced the dissolution of the lawsuit.\n\nIn May 2011, it was announced that Zuffa would be holding a charity auction featuring more than 100 items to benefit the Lone Survivor Foundation during the last week of May 2011. All products were autographed by UFC fighters and included baseball caps, T-shirts, MMA gloves, and DVDs. Products generally ranged in price from $50 to a few thousand dollars.\n\nIn February 2014, Zuffa was one of a number of major combat sport promotions to support a major brain trauma study that was being conducted by the Cleveland Clinic. This was further followed up in February 2016, when Zuffa donated a million dollars to the Ruvo Center.\n\nThe current rules used in the UFC were first established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board in 2000, in consultation with the UFC and other MMA promotions in the United States. The first UFC event under the new rules was UFC 28, held before Zuffa's takeover. New Jersey's \"Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\" has since been established throughout the country by other state athletic commissions, including Nevada and California. The UFC has, however, kept close ties with state commissions, especially the Nevada State Athletic Commission, of which Lorenzo Fertitta is a former board member.\n\nDuring the early years of mixed martial arts, when Pride Fighting Championships along with the Ultimate Fighting Championship were early premierships of the sport, it has been documented that there was a noteworthy lack of rules and regulations regarding drug testing for PED's. This led to a widespread debate and discussion regarding how prevalent the use of steroids were in the sport, as well as a long list of competitors in the UFC and other major organizations facing failed drug tests. This was further highlighted by continued problems with UFC champions, including Jon Jones and Anderson Silva, failing drug tests. So in February 2015, Zuffa announced a more aggressive year round, random-testing approach for its competitors to begin in July 2015.\n\nZuffa has been one of the largest and most aggressive spenders among anti-piracy political lobbyists in the United States since the end of the 2000s. One thing in particular that sets them apart from other sports leagues is that, in addition to supporting efforts of stricter piracy laws, they have also on numerous occasions gone after selected individuals in addition to pirate hosting websites. Some of the most notable cases have included, a well publicized lawsuit with Justin.tv in 2011 and a $32 million settlement involving a New York man in 2014.\n\nZuffa has always maintained the stance that the large amounts of illegal streams of their events causes massive financial losses. In response to having such a stringent stance it has been extremely controversial and has caused a number of debates within the mixed martial arts community on its effectiveness. As a result, the UFC began experimenting on an online subscription model known as UFC Fight Pass in 2014. It is unclear how beneficial the service has been since its emphasis has been largely minimal next to UFC's partnership with Fox and noticeable decline in average PPV buyrates, highlighted by the S&P downgrading Zuffa's credit rating in late 2014.\n\nOn May 9, 2011 it was announced that Zuffa would be providing year-round customized insurance coverage for any injury suffered by a UFC or Strikeforce athlete. The policy covers any injuries that occur during competition, training, and non-training related accidents. The policy was underwritten by Houston-based specialty insurance group HCC Insurance Holdings and went into effect on June 1, 2011.\n\nThe details of the policy include:\n\nAn insurance policy is not a first for mixed martial arts or combat sports as a whole. Former promotions such as the International Fight League, offered insurance to its athletes. However Zuffa's policy is the first to cover a large group of combat sport athletes. According to UFC president Dana White, the policy was a goal of the company since Zuffa first purchased the UFC in 2001. In addition UFC chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Fertitta stated that the policy took three years to establish while trying to find possible insurers. Prior to the introduction of this policy, Zuffa provided up to $100,000 for an athlete on each event to cover injuries sustained during competition. However, if an athlete was injured outside of competition they would have to pay for their own medical expenses.\n\nNotable incidents where UFC athletes were injured outside of competition include,\n\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship has been accused of monopolistic business practices both in casual criticism and in formal lawsuits for a number of years. There are numerous fighters who have accused the company of various wrongdoing's regarding issues including unequal pay, predatory actions toward rival promotions, lack of a pension or union safety net, and other perceived unethical business practices. These perceptions have been most highlighted by a Federal Trade Commission investigation that took place between 2011 and 2012. As well as in a series of class action lawsuits filed against the company in late 2014 and early 2015.\n\nIn the months following the March 2011 acquisition of rival promotion Strikeforce, rumours began to circulate that a possible investigation by the FTC would take place. These rumours later came to be true when it was officially announced around the end of January 2012 that the FTC had in fact conducted an investigation, and found no wrongdoings regarding the UFC being a monopoly.\n\n2014\n\nOn December 16, 2014 a class action lawsuit was filed against Zuffa by fighters Cung Le, Jon Fitch and Nate Quarry. Within a few days, Javier Vazquez and Dennis Hallman filed a second class action. And on December 24, Brandon Vera and Pablo Garza filed a third lawsuit. Shortly after the initial news spreading, Zuffa quickly responded following the first class action with the statement that, \"The UFC will vigorously defend itself and its business practices.\" This soon led other promoters such as Scott Coker, President of Bellator MMA, expressing an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit, while rejecting his organization as being labeled a \"minor league\" as was done several times in the initial filing. By the end of December 2014, the UFC made a formal statement stating, \"We are proud of the company we have built, confident in our legal position, and intend to prevail in this lawsuit.\"\n\n2015\n\nOn February 7, 2015, a fourth lawsuit was filed against the UFC, this one by Mac Danzig and Gabe Ruediger. It was around this time that Zuffa motioned to move the hearing date from May 7 to March 26, as well as to move the venue from Northern California to Las Vegas, where they are headquartered. A few weeks later, Zuffa motioned to have the lawsuits dismissed, in four separate documents they claim, \"The Complaints' vague and conclusory allegations fall far short of the Supreme Court's requirements in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, for pleading specific facts showing a plausible antitrust claim.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, a fifth lawsuit was added by Kyle Kingsbury and Darren Uyenoyama on March 20, 2015. On April 12, the plaintiff athletes filed an opposition to February's motion to dismiss and transfer. Following the May 7 hearing regarding the motion to change venue, a Californian federal judge granted Zuffa the motion to change venue to Las Vegas after citing contract agreements from the former employees. As a result of the change of venue to Nevada, Zuffa was denied its motion to remain a discovery for 15 years of its financial records. Subsequently, following this denial, debate a began on who, what, and how UFC sensitive information should be viewed, especially by MMAFA founder, Rob Maysey.\n\nBoth sides have argued for different criteria, so as not to put them at an disadvantage. However, Zuffa has requested a two-tiered system of confidentiality: confidential and highly confidential. They have stated they feel that Maysey's access to highly confidential information could have an influential impact on him and his role in the MMAFA. Meanwhile, Maysey has openly stated his goal is to represent the fighters and ultimately try to get a reform similar to the Ali Act of 2000.\n\nMoving forward to September 25, 2015, due to the gradual nature and complications regarding the lawsuit; Zuffa requested another dismissal of the case and asked that it be thrown out of Las Vegas federal court. In a surprise bench ruling, this was ultimately denied, which promoted the UFC to release a formal response. The following week, magistrate judge Peggy Leen ruled that the UFC could not prevent plaintiffs attorney Rob Maysey from viewing its most highly confidential and sensitive business and financial information. This has officially caused an expert discovery that is estimated to last from 12–16 months (September 2016 to January 2017). In doing so, both parties will have to hand over various highly confidential and sensitive documents.\n\nThe goal of the expert discovery is to determine three key factors for antitrust liability to all hold true: (1) Does the UFC have monopoly power? (2) Did the UFC acquire or maintain such power through exclusionary conduct? (3) Did the UFC cause antitrust injury since having a monopoly is not always illegal in the United States? This is expected to involve a wide range of important figures (past and present) in both mixed martial arts and boxing, including most top ranked UFC staff, Scott Coker, Bjorn Rebney, Ray Sefo, Frank Shamrock, Fedor Emelianenko, Randy Couture, Ben Askren, Mark Cuban, Oscar De La Hoya, Bob Arum, Lou DiBella, Ken Hershman, Bob Meyrowitz, and even various PRIDE FC executives. Following this ruling through the end of 2015, both sides have provided well over 100,000 documents.\n\n2016\n\nStarting in January, the UFC defense team filed its official answer, denying the fighters’ antitrust claims. In an amended complaint, which contained nearly identical legal and economic substance to the original version from December 2014. The only major difference being the number of plaintiff fighters has declined from eleven to six. Pablo Garza, Gabe Ruediger, Darren Uyenoyama, Dennis Hallman, and Mac Danzig all dropped out of the lawsuit while the original three plaintiffs, Cung Le, Nate Quarry, and Jon Fitch, remain along with Brandon Vera, Javier Vazquez, and Kyle Kingsbury. In addition, Zuffa has stood by its point of protecting its brand. And in the latest update, the UFC has inadvertently produced PRIDE FC acquisition materials. This has triggered a new debate on whether the material is of value in the lawsuit or can be used as a privileged document.\n\nAround May 11, 2016, ESPN's Darren Rovell reported that Goldman Sachs was helping Zuffa set up a sale of its majority ownership to one of four bidders at a speculated price range between $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Immediately after Rovell reported this, UFC President Dana White went on \"The Dan Patrick Show\" and denied that the UFC was up for sale, claiming that Zuffa was more focused on \"working on deals and our expansion globally\" than selling the promotion. However, White would further add that Zuffa would be listening to offers if they met the reported $4 billion. Despite White's denial of a potential sale, Dave Meltzer of SB Nation's mmafighting.com reported a month later that the sale of the UFC was imminent, as Zuffa received two bids within the range of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion from both WME-IMG and China Media Capital.\n\nFinally, on July 11, after months of speculation, the UFC released a statement confirming that Zuffa had sold its majority stake to an ownership group headed by WME-IMG for $4.2 billion. ESPN's Darren Rovell and Brett Okamoto would go on further to report that, despite the sale to WME-IMG, Dana White would be staying on with the UFC as President and would \"be given a stake in the new business.\" They would also add that the Abu Dhabi-based Flash Entertainment would still maintain its 10 percent stake in the company.\n\nFollowing the sale of their majority stake in the UFC to WME-IMG, in addition to the success of Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s bout against Conor McGregor in 2016 and 2017. UFC President Dana White has teased the idea of Zuffa potentially becoming involved in the sport of boxing. It's still unclear what the future of this business endeavor is exactly. Though rumors have speculated that Dana White, Ari Emanuel, and others from the UFC have tried to form business partnerships with boxers such as Mikey Garcia and Anthony Joshua. In addition to formulating plans around the long running rumors of Anderson Silva who has long expressed an interest in fighting Roy Jones Jr.. Though this fight in particular is questionable given that both athletes are in the later stages of there careers. Though the UFC did help air Roy Jones Jr.'s \"retirement\" bout on their UFC Fight Pass streaming service in early 2018. Another sign that Zuffa has interested in expanding into the sport of boxing to some degree.\n\nIt has also been thought that UFC is interested in co-promoting boxing matches into their events. Additionally in mid-2018 Dana White, still claiming efforts are being made to expand promotional efforts into boxing. Has stated that he and others aren't interesting in working with any of major boxing sanctioning bodies causing even more speculation. This is all in contrast to Dana White's long time disgust with the business of boxing and many of the major promotional figures. Making some to question if this is related to underwhelming business expectations for the UFC.\n\nOther rumors that have floated around since the change of ownership of the UFC, consist of Bob Arum claiming members of the UFC expressing an interest in purchasing either Top Rank Promotions or at least its video library for $100 million.\n"}
