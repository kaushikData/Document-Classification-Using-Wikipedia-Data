{"id": "540784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540784", "title": "Art film", "text": "Art film\n\nAn art film is typically a serious, independent film, aimed at a niche market rather than a mass market audience. It is \"intended to be a serious, artistic work, often experimental and not designed for mass appeal\", \"made primarily for aesthetic reasons rather than commercial profit\", and contains \"unconventional or highly symbolic content\".\n\nFilm critics and film studies scholars typically define an art film as possessing \"formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films\". These qualities can include (among other elements): a sense of social realism; an emphasis on the authorial expressiveness of the director; and a focus on the thoughts, dreams, or motivations of characters, as opposed to the unfolding of a clear, goal-driven story. Film scholar David Bordwell describes art cinema as \"a film genre, with its own distinct conventions\".\n\nArt film producers usually present their films at special theaters (repertory cinemas or, in the U.S., art-house cinemas) and at film festivals. The term \"art film\" is much more widely used in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia, compared to the rest of Europe, where the term is associated more with auteur films and national cinema (e.g. German national cinema). Since they are aimed at small, niche-market audiences, art films rarely acquire the financial backing that would permit large production budgets associated with widely released blockbuster films. Art film directors make up for these constraints by creating a different type of film, one that typically uses lesser-known film actors (or even amateur actors), and modest sets to make films that focus much more on developing ideas, exploring new narrative techniques, and attempting new film-making conventions.\n\nA certain degree of experience and knowledge is generally required to fully understand or appreciate such films. Film critic Roger Ebert called \"Chungking Express\", a critically acclaimed 1994 art film, \"largely a cerebral experience\" that one enjoys \"because of what you know about film\". This contrasts sharply with mainstream blockbuster films, which are geared more towards escapism and pure entertainment. For promotion, art films rely on the publicity generated from film critics' reviews; discussion of the film by arts columnists, commentators, and bloggers; and word-of-mouth promotion by audience members. Since art films have small initial investment costs, they only need to appeal to a small portion of mainstream audiences to become financially viable.\n\nThe forerunners of art films include Italian silent film \"L'Inferno\" (1911), D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916) and the works of Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, who influenced the development of European cinema movements for decades. Eisenstein's film \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) was a revolutionary propaganda film he used to test his theories of using film editing to produce the greatest emotional response from an audience. The international critical renown that Eisenstein garnered from this film enabled him to direct \"\" as part of a grand 10th anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917. He later directed \"The General Line\" in 1929.\n\nArt films were also influenced by films by Spanish avant-garde creators, such as Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí (who made \"L'Age d'Or\" in 1930), and by the French playwright and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, whose 1930's avant-garde film \"The Blood of a Poet\" uses oneiric images throughout, including spinning wire models of a human head and rotating double-sided masks. In the 1920s, film societies began advocating the notion that films could be divided into \"entertainment cinema directed towards a mass audience and a serious art cinema aimed at an intellectual audience\". In England, Alfred Hitchcock and Ivor Montagu formed a film society and imported films they thought were \"artistic achievements\", such as \"Soviet films of dialectical montage, and the expressionist films of the Universum Film A.G. (UFA) studios in Germany\".\n\n\"Cinéma pur\", a French avant-garde film movement in the 1920s and 1930s, also influenced the development of the idea of art film. The \"cinema pur\" film movement included several notable Dada artists. The Dadaists used film to transcend narrative storytelling conventions, bourgeois traditions, and conventional Aristotelian notions of time and space by creating a flexible montage of time and space.\nThe \"cinema pur\" movement was influenced by German \"absolute\" filmmakers such as Hans Richter, Walter Ruttmann and Viking Eggeling. Richter falsely claimed that his 1921 film \"Rhythmus 21\" was the first abstract film ever created. In fact, he was preceded by the Italian Futurists Bruno Corra and Arnaldo Ginna between 1911 and 1912 (as reported in the \"Futurist Manifesto of Cinema\"), as well as by fellow German artist Walter Ruttmann, who produced \"Lichtspiel Opus 1\" in 1920. Nevertheless, Richter's film \"Rhythmus 21\" is considered an important early abstract film.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Hollywood films could be divided into the artistic aspirations of literary adaptations like John Ford's \"The Informer\" (1935) and Eugene O'Neill's \"The Long Voyage Home\" (1940), and the money-making \"popular-genre films\" such as gangster thrillers. William Siska argues that Italian neorealist films from the mid-to-late 1940s, such as \"Open City\" (1945), \"Paisa\" (1946), and \"Bicycle Thieves\" can be deemed as another \"conscious art film movement\".\n\nIn the late 1940s, the U.S. public's perception that Italian neorealist films and other serious European fare were different from mainstream Hollywood films was reinforced by the development of \"arthouse cinemas\" in major U.S. cities and college towns. After the Second World War, \"...a growing segment of the American film going public was wearying of mainstream Hollywood films\", and they went to the newly created art-film theaters to see \"alternatives to the films playing in main-street movie palaces\". Films shown in these art cinemas included \"British, foreign-language, and independent American films, as well as documentaries and revivals of Hollywood classics\". Films such as Rossellini's \"Open City\" and Mackendrick's \"Tight Little Island\" (\"Whisky Galore!\"), \"Bicycle Thieves\" and \"The Red Shoes\" were shown to substantial U.S. audiences.\n\nIn the late 1950s, French filmmakers began to produce films that were influenced by Italian Neorealism and classical Hollywood cinema, a style that critics called the French New Wave. Although never a formally organized movement, New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful iconoclasm, and their films are an example of European art cinema. Many also engaged in their work with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm. Some of the most prominent pioneers among the group, including François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette, began as critics for the film magazine \"Cahiers du cinéma\". Auteur theory holds that the director is the \"author\" of his films, with a personal signature visible from film to film.\n\nThe French New Wave movement continued into the 1960s. During the 1960s, the term \"art film\" began to be much more widely used in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., the term is often defined very broadly to include foreign-language (non-English) \"auteur\" films, independent films, experimental films, documentaries and short films. In the 1960s, \"art film\" became a euphemism in the U.S. for racy Italian and French B-movies. By the 1970s, the term was used to describe sexually explicit European films with artistic structure such as the Swedish film \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\". In the U.S., the term \"art film\" may refer to films by modern American artists, including Andy Warhol with his 1969 film \"Blue Movie\", but is sometimes used very loosely to refer to the broad range of films shown in repertory theaters or \"art house cinemas\". With this approach, a broad range of films, such as a 1960s Hitchcock film, a 1970s experimental underground film, a European auteur film, a U.S. \"independent\" film, and even a mainstream foreign-language film (with subtitles) might all fall under the rubric of \"art house films\".\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, the term \"art film\" became conflated with \"independent film\" in the U.S., which shares many of the same stylistic traits. Companies such as Miramax Films distributed independent films that were deemed commercially viable. When major motion-picture studios noted the niche appeal of independent films, they created special divisions dedicated to non-mainstream fare, such as the Fox Searchlight Pictures division of Twentieth Century Fox, the Focus Features division of Universal, the Sony Pictures Classics division of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Paramount Vantage division of Paramount. Film critics have debated whether films from these divisions can be considered \"independent films\", given they have financial backing from major studios.\n\nIn 2007, Professor Camille Paglia argued in her article \"Art movies: R.I.P.\" that \"[a]side from Francis Ford Coppola's \"Godfather\" series, with its deft flashbacks and gritty social realism, ...[there is not]... a single film produced over the past 35 years that is arguably of equal philosophical weight or virtuosity of execution to Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\" or \"Persona\"\". Paglia states that young people from the 2000s do not \"have patience for the long, slow take that deep-think European directors once specialized in\", an approach which gave \"luxurious scrutiny of the tiniest facial expressions or the chilly sweep of a sterile room or bleak landscape\".\n\nAccording to director, producer, and distributor Roger Corman, the \"1950s and 1960s was the time of the art film's greatest influence. After that, the influence waned. Hollywood absorbed the lessons of the European films and incorporated those lessons into their films.\" Corman states that \"viewers could see something of the essence of the European art cinema in the Hollywood movies of the seventies... [and so], art film, which was never just a matter of European cinema, increasingly became an actual world cinema—albeit one that struggled to gain wide recognition\". Corman notes that, \"Hollywood itself has expanded, radically, its aesthetic range... because the range of subjects at hand has expanded to include the very conditions of image-making, of movie production, of the new and prismatic media-mediated experience of modernity. There's a new audience that has learned about art films at the video store.\" Corman states that \"there is currently the possibility of a rebirth\" of American art film.\n\nFilm scholar David Bordwell outlined the academic definition of \"art film\" in a 1979 article entitled \"The Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice\", which contrasts art films with the mainstream films of classical Hollywood cinema. Mainstream Hollywood-style films use a clear narrative form to organize the film into a series of \"causally related events taking place in space and time\", with every scene driving towards a goal. The plot of mainstream films is driven by a well-defined protagonist, fleshed out with clear characters, and strengthened with \"question-and-answer logic, problem-solving routines, [and] deadline plot structures\". The film is then tied together with fast pacing, a musical soundtrack to cue the appropriate audience emotions, and tight, seamless editing.\n\nIn contrast, Bordwell states that \"the art cinema motivates its narrative by two principles: realism and authorial expressiveness\". Art films deviate from the mainstream \"classical\" norms of film making in that they typically deal with more episodic narrative structures with a \"loosening of the chain of cause and effect\".\n\nMainstream films also deal with moral dilemmas or identity crises, but these issues are usually resolved by the end of the film. In art films, the dilemmas are probed and investigated in a pensive fashion, but usually without a clear resolution at the end of the film.\n\nThe story in an art film often has a secondary role to character development and an exploration of ideas through lengthy sequences of dialogue. If an art film has a story, it is usually a drifting sequence of vaguely defined or ambiguous episodes. There may be unexplained gaps in the film, deliberately unclear sequences, or extraneous sequences that are not related to previous scenes, which force the viewer to subjectively make their own interpretation of the film's message. Art films often \"bear the marks of a distinctive visual style\" and the authorial approach of the director. An art cinema film often refuses to provide a \"readily answered conclusion\", instead putting to the cinema viewer the task of thinking about \"how is the story being told? Why tell the story in this way?\"\n\nBordwell claims that \"art cinema itself is a [film] genre, with its own distinct conventions\". Film theorist Robert Stam also argues that \"art film\" is a film genre. He claims that a film is considered to be an art film based on artistic status in the same way film genres can be based on aspects of films such as their budgets (blockbuster films or B-movies) or their star performers (Adam Sandler films).\n\nThere are scholars who point out that mass market films such as those produced in Hollywood appeal to a less discerning audience. This group then turns to film critics as a cultural elite that can help steer them towards films that are more thoughtful and of a higher quality. To bridge the disconnect between popular taste and high culture, these film critics are expected to explain unfamiliar concepts and make them appealing to cultivate a more discerning movie-going public. For example, a film critic can help the audience—through his reviews—think seriously about films by providing the terms of analysis of these art films. Adopting an artistic framework of film analysis and review, these film critics provide viewers with a different way to appreciate what they are watching. So when controversial themes such as lesbianism or torture are shown, the public will not immediately dismiss or attack the movie where they are informed by critics of the film's value such as how it depicts realism. Here, art theaters or art houses that exhibit art films are seen as \"sites of cultural enlightenment\" that draw critics and intellectual audiences alike. It serves as a place where these critics can experience culture and an artistic atmosphere where they can draw insights and material.\n\nThe following list is a small, partial sample of films with \"art film\" qualities, compiled to give a general sense of what directors and films are considered to have \"art film\" characteristics. The films in this list demonstrate one or more of the characteristics of art films: a serious, non-commercial, or independently made film that is not aimed at a mass audience. Some of the films on this list are also considered to be \"auteur\" films, independent films, or experimental films. In some cases, critics disagree over whether a film is mainstream or not. For example, while some critics called Gus Van Sant's \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991) an \"exercise in film experimentation\" of \"high artistic quality\", \"The Washington Post\" called it an ambitious mainstream film. Some films on this list have most of these characteristics; other films are commercially made films, produced by mainstream studios, that nevertheless bear the hallmarks of a director's \"auteur\" style, or which have an experimental character. The films on this list are notable either because they won major awards or critical praise from influential film critics, or because they introduced an innovative narrative or film-making technique.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, filmmakers did not set out to make \"art films\", and film critics did not use the term \"art film\". However, there were films that had sophisticated aesthetic objectives, such as Carl Theodor Dreyer's \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928) and \"Vampyr\" (1932), surrealist films such as Luis Buñuel's \"Un chien andalou\" (1929) and \"L'Âge d'Or\" (1930), or even films dealing with political and current-event relevance such as Sergei Eisenstein's famed and influential masterpiece \"Battleship Potemkin\". The U.S. film \"\" (1927) by German Expressionist director F. W. Murnau uses distorted art design and groundbreaking cinematography to create an exaggerated, fairy-tale-like world rich with symbolism and imagery. Jean Renoir's film \"The Rules of the Game\" (1939) is a comedy of manners that transcends the conventions of the its genre by creating a biting and tragic satire of French upper-class society in the years before WWII; a poll of critics from \"Sight & Sound\" ranked it as the fourth greatest film ever, placing it behind \"Vertigo\", \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Tokyo Story\".\n\nSome of these early, artistically-oriented films were financed by wealthy individuals rather than film companies, particularly in cases where the content of the film was controversial or unlikely to attract an audience. In the late 1940s, UK director Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger made \"The Red Shoes\" (1948), a film about ballet, which stood out from mainstream-genre films of the era. In 1945, David Lean directed \"Brief Encounter\", an adaptation of Noël Coward's play \"Still Life\", which observes a passionate love affair between an upper-class man and a middle-class woman amidst the social and economic issues that Britain faced at the time.\n\nIn the 1950s, some of the well-known films with artistic sensibilities include \"La Strada\" (1954), a film about a young woman who is forced to go to work for a cruel and inhumane circus performer in order to support her family, and eventually comes to terms with her situation; Carl Theodor Dreyer's \"Ordet\" (1955), centering on a family with a lack of faith, but with a son who believes that he is Jesus Christ and convinced that he is capable of performing miracles; Federico Fellini's \"Nights of Cabiria\" (1957), which deals with a prostitute's failed attempts to find love, her suffering and rejection; \"Wild Strawberries\" (1957), by Ingmar Bergman, whose narrative concerns an elderly medical doctor, who is also a professor, whose nightmares lead him to re-evaluate his life; and \"The 400 Blows\" (1959) by François Truffaut, whose main character is a young man trying to come of age despite abuse from his parents, schoolteachers, and society. In Poland, the Khrushchev Thaw permitted some relaxation of the regime's cultural policies, and productions such as \"A Generation\", \"Kanal\", \"Ashes and Diamonds\", \"Lotna\" (1954–1959), all directed by Andrzej Wajda, showed the Polish Film School style.\n\nIn India, there was an art-film movement in Bengali cinema known as \"Parallel Cinema\" or \"Indian New Wave\". This was an alternative to the mainstream commercial cinema known for its serious content, realism and naturalism, with a keen eye on the social-political climate of the times. This movement is distinct from mainstream Bollywood cinema and began around the same time as French and Japanese New Wave. The most influential filmmakers involved in this movement were Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak. Some of the most internationally acclaimed films made in the period were \"The Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959), a trio of films that tell the story of a poor country boy's growth to adulthood, and Satyajit Ray's \"Distant Thunder\" (1973), which tells the story of a farmer during a famine in Bengal. Other acclaimed Bengali filmmakers involved in this movement include Rituparno Ghosh, Aparna Sen and Goutam Ghose.\n\nJapanese filmmakers produced a number of films that broke with convention. Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" (1950), the first Japanese film to be widely screened in the West, depicts four witnesses' contradictory accounts of a rape and murder. In 1952, Kurosawa directed \"Ikiru\", a film about a Tokyo bureaucrat struggling to find a meaning for his life. \"Tokyo Story\" (1953), by Yasujirō Ozu, explores social changes of the era by telling the story of an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children, but find the children are too self-absorbed to spend much time with them. \"Seven Samurai\" (1954), by Kurosawa, tells the story of a farming village that hires seven master-less samurais to combat bandits. \"Fires on the Plain\" (1959), by Kon Ichikawa, explores the Japanese experience in World War II by depicting a sick Japanese soldier struggling to stay alive. \"Ugetsu\" (1953), by Kenji Mizoguchi, is a ghost story set in the late 16th century, which tells the story of peasants whose village is in the path of an advancing army. A year later, Mizoguchi directed \"Sansho the Bailiff\" (1954), which tells the story of two aristocratic children sold into slavery; in addition to dealing with serious themes such as the loss of freedom, the film features beautiful images and long, complicated shots.\n\nThe 1960s was an important period in art film, with the release of a number of groundbreaking films giving rise to the European art cinema. Jean-Luc Godard's \"À bout de souffle\" (\"Breathless\") (1960) used innovative visual and editing techniques such as jump cuts and hand-held camera work. Godard, a leading figure of the French New Wave, would continue to make innovative films throughout the decade, proposing a whole new style of film-making. Following the success of \"Breathless\", Goddard made two more very influential films, \"Contempt\" and \"Pierrot le fou\", in 1963 and 1965 respectively. \"Jules et Jim\", by François Truffaut, deconstructed a complex relationship of three individuals through innovative screenwriting, editing, and camera techniques. Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni helped revolutionize filmmaking with such films as \"La Notte\" (1961), a complex examination of a failed marriage that dealt with issues such as anomie and sterility; \"Eclipse\" (1962), about a young woman who is unable to form a solid relationship with her boyfriend because of his materialistic nature; \"Red Desert\" (1964), his first color film, which deals with the need to adapt to the modern world; and \"Blowup\" (1966), his first English-language film, which examines issues of perception and reality as it follows a young photographer's attempt to discover whether he had photographed a murder.\n\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman began the 1960s with chamber pieces such as \"Winter Light\" (1963) and \"The Silence\" (1963), which deal with such themes as emotional isolation and a lack of communication. His films from the second half of the decade, such as \"Persona\" (1966), \"Shame\" (1968), and \"A Passion\" (1969), deal with the idea of film as an artifice. The intellectual and visually expressive films of Tadeusz Konwicki, such as \"All Souls' Day\" (\"Zaduszki\", 1961) and \"Salto\" (1962), inspired discussions about war and raised existential questions on behalf of their everyman protagonists.\nFederico Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960) depicts a succession of nights and dawns in Rome as witnessed by a cynical journalist. In 1963, Fellini made \"8½\", an exploration of creative, marital and spiritual difficulties, filmed in black-and-white by cinematographer Gianni di Venanzo. The 1961 film \"Last Year at Marienbad\" by director Alain Resnais examines perception and reality, using grand tracking shots that became widely influential. Robert Bresson's \"Au Hasard Balthazar\" (1966) and \"Mouchette\" (1967) are notable for their naturalistic, elliptical style. Spanish director Luis Buñuel also contributed heavily to the art of film with shocking, surrealist satires such as \"Viridiana\" (1961) and \"The Exterminating Angel\" (1962).\n\nRussian director Andrei Tarkovsky's film \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966) is a portrait of the medieval Russian icon painter of the same name. The film is also about artistic freedom and the possibility and necessity of making art for, and in the face of, a repressive authority. A cut version of the film was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize. At the end of the decade, Stanley Kubrick's \"\" (1968) wowed audiences with its scientific realism, pioneering use of special effects, and unusual visual imagery. In 1969, Andy Warhol released \"Blue Movie\", the first adult art film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. According to Warhol, \"Blue Movie\" was a major influence in the making of \"Last Tango in Paris\", an internationally controversial erotic art film, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and released a few years after \"Blue Movie\" was made. In Soviet Armenia, Sergei Parajanov's \"The Color of Pomegranates\", in which Georgian actress Sofiko Chiaureli plays five different characters, was banned by Soviet authorities, unavailable in the West for a long period, and praised by critic Mikhail Vartanov as \"revolutionary\"; and in the early 1980s, \"Les Cahiers du Cinéma\" placed the film in its top 10 list. In 1967, in Soviet Georgia, influential Georgian film director Tengiz Abuladze directed \"Vedreba\" (Entreaty), which was based on the motifs of Vaja-Pshavela's literary works, where story is told in a poetic narrative style, full of symbolic scenes with philosophical meanings. In Iran, Dariush Mehrjui's \"The Cow\" (1969), about a man who becomes insane after the death of his beloved cow, sparked the new wave of Iranian cinema.\n\nIn the early 1970s, directors shocked audiences with violent films such as \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971), Stanley Kubrick's brutal exploration of futuristic youth gangs, and \"Last Tango in Paris\" (1972), Bernardo Bertolucci's taboo-breaking, sexually-explicit and controversial film. At the same time, other directors made more introspective films, such as Andrei Tarkovsky's meditative science fiction film \"Solaris\" (1972), supposedly intended as a Soviet riposte to \"2001\". In 1975 and 1979 respectively, Tarkovsky directed two other films, which garnered critical acclaim overseas: \"The Mirror\" and \"Stalker\". Terrence Malick, who directed \"Badlands\" (1973) and \"Days of Heaven\" (1978) shared many traits with Tarkovsky, such as his long, lingering shots of natural beauty, evocative imagery, and poetic narrative style.\n\nAnother feature of 1970s art films was the return to prominence of bizarre characters and imagery, which abound in the tormented, obsessed title character in German New Wave director Werner Herzog's \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" (1973), and in cult films such as Alejandro Jodorowsky's psychedelic \"The Holy Mountain\" (1973) about a thief and an alchemist seeking the mythical Lotus Island. The film \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), by Martin Scorsese, continues the themes that \"A Clockwork Orange\" explored: an alienated population living in a violent, decaying society. The gritty violence and seething rage of Scorsese's film contrasts other films released in the same period, such as David Lynch's dreamlike, surreal \"Eraserhead\" (1977). In 1974, John Cassavetes offered a sharp commentary on American blue-collar life in \"A Woman Under the Influence\", which features an eccentric housewife slowly descending into madness.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, Radley Metzger directed several adult art films, such as \"Barbara Broadcast\" (1977), which presented a surrealistic \"Buñellian\" atmosphere, and \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\" (1976), based on the play \"Pygmalion\" by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, \"My Fair Lady\"), which was considered, according to award-winning author Toni Bentley, to be the \"crown jewel\" of the Golden Age of Porn, an era in modern American culture that was inaugurated by the release of Andy Warhol's \"Blue Movie\" (1969) and featured the phenomenon of \"porno chic\" in which adult erotic films began to obtain wide release, were publicly discussed by celebrities (such as Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (such as Roger Ebert).\n\nIn 1980, director Martin Scorsese shocked audiences, who had become used to the escapist blockbuster adventures of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, with the gritty, harsh realism of his film \"Raging Bull\". In this film, actor Robert De Niro took method acting to an extreme to portray a boxer's decline from a prizewinning young fighter to an overweight, \"has-been\" nightclub owner. Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\" (1982), while labeled as a fast-paced action film, could also be seen as a science fiction art film, along with \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968). \"Blade Runner\" explores themes of existentialism, or what it means to be human. A box-office failure, the film became popular on the arthouse circuit as a cult oddity after the release of a \"director's cut\" became successful via VHS home video. In the middle of the decade, Japanese director Akira Kurosawa used realism to portray the brutal, bloody violence of Japanese samurai warfare of the 16th century in \"Ran\" (1985). \"Ran\" followed the plot of \"King Lear\", in which an elderly king is betrayed by his children. Sergio Leone also contrasted brutal violence with emotional substance in his epic tale of mobster life in \"Once Upon a Time in America\".\nOther directors in the 1980s chose a more intellectual path, exploring philosophical and ethical issues. Andrzej Wajda's \"Man of Iron\" (1981), a critique of the Polish communist government, won the 1981 Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Another Polish director, Krzysztof Kieślowski, made \"The Decalogue\" for television in 1988, a film series that explores ethical issues and moral puzzles. Two of these films were released theatrically as \"A Short Film About Love\" and \"A Short Film About Killing\". In 1989, Woody Allen made, in the words of \"New York Times\" critic Vincent Canby, his most \"securely serious and funny film to date\", \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\", which involves multiple stories of people who are trying to find moral and spiritual simplicity while facing dire issues and thoughts surrounding the choices they make. French director Louis Malle chose another moral path to explore with the dramatization of his real-life childhood experiences in \"Au revoir, les enfants\", which depicts the occupying Nazi government's deportation of French Jews to concentration camps during World War II.\n\nKieślowski was not the only director to transcend the distinction between the cinema and television. Ingmar Bergman made \"Fanny and Alexander\" (1982), which was shown on television in an extended five-hour version. In the United Kingdom, Channel 4, a new television channel, financed, in whole or in part, many films released theatrically through its Film 4 subsidiary. Wim Wenders offered another approach to life from a spiritual standpoint in his 1987 film \"Wings of Desire\", a depiction of a \"fallen angel\" who lives among men, which won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1982, experimental director Godfrey Reggio released \"Koyaanisqatsi\", a film without dialogue, which emphasizes cinematography and philosophical ideology. It consists primarily of slow motion and time-lapse cinematography of cities and natural landscapes, which results in a visual tone poem.\n\nAnother approach used by directors in the 1980s was to create bizarre, surreal alternative worlds. Martin Scorsese's \"After Hours\" (1985) is a comedy-thriller that depicts a man's baffling adventures in a surreal nighttime world of chance encounters with mysterious characters. David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), a film noir-style thriller-mystery filled with symbolism and metaphors about polarized worlds and inhabited by distorted characters who are hidden in the seamy underworld of a small town, became surprisingly successful considering its highly disturbing subject matter. Peter Greenaway's \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\" (1989) is a fantasy/black comedy about cannibalism and extreme violence with an intellectual theme: a critique of \"elite culture\" in Thatcherian Britain.\n\nAccording to Raphaël Bassan, in his article \"\"The Angel\": Un météore dans le ciel de l'animation\", Patrick Bokanowski's \"The Angel\", shown at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, can be considered the beginning of contemporary animation. The characters' masks erase all human personality and give the impression of total control over the \"matter\" of the image and its optical composition, using distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses, and synthetic objects.\n\nIn the 1990s, directors took inspiration from the success of David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and Peter Greenaway's \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\" (1989) and created films with bizarre alternative worlds and elements of surrealism. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's \"Dreams\" (1990) depicted his imaginative reveries in a series of vignettes that range from idyllic pastoral country landscapes to horrific visions of tormented demons and a blighted post-nuclear war landscape. The Coen brothers' \"Barton Fink\" (1991), which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, features various literary allusions in an enigmatic story about a writer who encounters a range of bizarre characters, including an alcoholic, abusive novelist and a serial killer. \"Lost Highway\" (1997), from the same director as \"Blue Velvet\", is a psychological thriller that explores fantasy worlds, bizarre time-space transformations, and mental breakdowns using surreal imagery.\n\nOther directors in the 1990s explored philosophical issues and themes such as identity, chance, death, and existentialism. Gus Van Sant's \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991) and Wong Kar-wai's \"Chungking Express\" (1994) explored the theme of identity. The former is an independent road movie/buddy film about two young street hustlers, which explores the theme of the search for home and identity. It was called a \"high-water mark in '90s independent film\", a \"stark, poetic rumination\", and an \"exercise in film experimentation\" of \"high artistic quality\". \"Chungking Express\" explores themes of identity, disconnection, loneliness, and isolation in the \"metaphoric concrete jungle\" of modern Hong Kong.\n\nDaryush Shokof's film \"Seven Servants\" (1996) is an original high art cinema piece about a man who strives to \"unite\" the world's races until his last breath. One year after \"Seven Servants\", Abbas Kiarostami's film \"Taste of Cherry\" (1997), which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, tells a similar tale with a different twist; both films are about a man trying to hire a person to bury him after he commits suicide. \"Seven Servants\" was shot in a minimalist style, with long takes, a leisurely pace, and long periods of silence. The film is also notable for its use of long shots and overhead shots to create a sense of distance between the audience and the characters. Zhang Yimou's early 1990s works such as \"Ju Dou\" (1990), \"Raise the Red Lantern\" (1991), \"The Story of Qiu Ju\" (1992) and \"To Live\" (1994) explore human emotions through poignant narratives. \"To Live\" won the Grand Jury Prize.\n\nSeveral 1990s films explored existentialist-oriented themes related to life, chance, and death. Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\" (1993) explores themes of chance, death, and infidelity by tracing 10 parallel and interwoven stories. The film, which won the Golden Lion and the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival, was called a \"many-sided, many mooded, dazzlingly structured eclectic jazz mural\" by \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Michael Wilmington. Krzysztof Kieślowski's \"The Double Life of Véronique\" (1991) is a drama about the theme of identity and a political allegory about the East/West split in Europe; the film features stylized cinematography, an ethereal atmosphere, and unexplained supernatural elements.\nDarren Aronofsky's film \"Pi\" (1998) is an \"incredibly complex and ambiguous film filled with both incredible style and substance\" about a paranoid mathematician's \"search for peace\". The film creates a David Lynch-inspired \"eerie \"Eraserhead\"-like world\" shot in \"black-and-white, which lends a dream-like atmosphere to all of the proceedings\" and explores issues such as \"metaphysics and spirituality\". Matthew Barney's \"The Cremaster Cycle\" (1994–2002) is a cycle of five symbolic, allegorical films that creates a self-enclosed aesthetic system, aimed to explore the process of creation. The films are filled with allusions to reproductive organs and sexual development, and use narrative models drawn from biography, mythology, and geology.\n\nIn 1997, Terrence Malick returned from a 20-year absence with \"The Thin Red Line\", a war film that uses poetry and nature to stand apart from typical war movies. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nSome 1990s films mix an ethereal or surreal visual atmosphere with the exploration of philosophical issues. \"Satantango\" (1994), by the Hungarian director Bela Tarr, is a -hour-long film, shot in black and white, that deals with Tarr's favorite theme, inadequacy, as con man Irimias comes back to a village at an unspecified location in Hungary, presenting himself as a leader and Messiah figure to the gullible villagers. Kieslowski's \"Three Colors\" trilogy (1993–4), particularly \"\" (1993) and \"\" (1994), deal with human relationships and how people cope with them in their day-to-day lives. The trilogy of films was called \"explorations of spirituality and existentialism\" that created a \"truly transcendent experience\". \"The Guardian\" listed \"Breaking the Waves\" (1996) as one of its top 25 arthouse films. The reviewer stated that \"[a]ll the ingredients that have come to define Lars von Trier's career (and in turn, much of modern European cinema) are present here: high-wire acting, innovative visual techniques, a suffering heroine, issue-grappling drama, and a galvanising shot of controversy to make the whole thing unmissable\".\n\nA number of films from the 2000s with art film qualities were notable for their use of innovative filmmaking or editing techniques. \"Memento\" (2001), a psychological thriller directed by Christopher Nolan, is about a man suffering from short-term memory loss. The film is edited so that the plot is revealed backwards in ten-minute chunks, simulating the condition of memory loss. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004) is a romance film directed by Michel Gondry about a man who hires a company to erase the memory of a bad relationship. The film uses a range of special effects techniques and camera work to depict the destruction of the man's memories and his transitions from one memory to another.\n\n\"Timecode\" (2000), a film directed by Mike Figgis, uses a split screen to show four continuous 90-minute takes that follow four storylines. \"Russian Ark\" (2002), a film directed by Alexander Sokurov, took Figgis' use of extended takes even further; it is notable for being the first feature film shot in a single, unedited take. \"Waking Life\" (2001), an animated film directed by Richard Linklater, uses an innovative digital rotoscope technique to depict a young man stuck in a dream. \nSeveral 2000s-era films explored the theme of amnesia or memory, but unlike \"Memento\", they did so through the use of narrative techniques rather than filmmaking and editing methods. \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), directed by David Lynch, is initially about a young woman who moves to Hollywood and discovers that an amnesiac is living in her house; as the plot progresses, it becomes apparent that the film is holding something deeper in terms of its plot and characters. \"Oldboy\" (2003), directed by Park Chan-wook, is about a man imprisoned by a mysterious and brutal captor for 15 years. After his abrupt release, he must then chase his old memories. \"Peppermint Candy\" (2000), directed by Lee Chang-dong, starts with the suicide of the male protagonist, and then uses reverse chronology (similar to \"Memento\") to depict the events of the last 20 years, which led the man to want to kill himself.\n\nSome notable films from the 2000s are considered to possess art film qualities yet differed from mainstream films due to controversial subject matter or narrative form. For example, Gus Van Sant's film \"Elephant\" (2003), which depicts mass murder at a high school and echoes the Columbine High School massacre, won top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Other films of his include \"Gerry\", \"Last Days\", and \"Paranoid Park\". Todd Haynes' complex deconstruction of Bob Dylan's persona, \"I'm Not There\" (2007), tells its story using non-traditional narrative techniques, intercutting the storylines of the six different Dylan-inspired characters. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's film \"Pan's Labyrinth\" uses computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create a fantastical world, imagined by a ten-year-old girl to block out the horror of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nLewis Beale of \"Film Journal International\" stated that Australian director Andrew Dominik's western film \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007) is \"a fascinating, literary-based work that succeeds as both art and genre film\". Unlike the action-oriented Jesse James films of the past, Dominik's unconventional epic perhaps more accurately details the outlaw's relinquishing psyche during the final months of his life as he succumbs to the paranoia of being captured and develops a precarious friendship with his eventual assassin, Robert Ford. In 2009, director Paul Thomas Anderson claimed that his film \"Punch-Drunk Love\" about a shy, repressed rage-aholic was \"an art house Adam Sandler film\", a reference to the unlikely inclusion of \"frat boy\" comic Sandler in the film; critic Roger Ebert claims that \"Punch Drunk Love\" \"may be the key to all of the Adam Sandler films, and may liberate Sandler for a new direction in his work. He can't go on making those moronic comedies forever, can he? Who would have guessed he had such uncharted depths?\"\n\nThe CNN review of Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul's \"Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives\" (2010) called it \"an art film for everyone\", unlike his earlier films, which were \"considered inaccessible art house fare\". This film, which won the 2010 Cannes Palme d'Or, \"ties together what might just be a series of beautifully shot scenes with moving and funny musings on the nature of death and reincarnation, love, loss, and karma\". Weerasethakul is an independent film director, screenwriter, and film producer, who works outside the strict confines of the Thai film studio system. His films deal with dreams, nature, sexuality, including his own homosexuality, and Western perceptions of Thailand and Asia. Weerasethakul's films display a preference for unconventional narrative structures (such as placing titles/credits at the middle of a film) and for working with non-actors.\n\nTerrence Malick's \"The Tree of Life\" (2011) was released after decades of development and won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival; it was highly praised by critics. At the Avon Theater in Stamford, Connecticut, a message was posted about the theater's no-refund policy due to \"some customer feedback and a polarized audience response\" to the film. The theater stated that it \"stands behind this ambitious work of art and other challenging films\". \"Drive\" (2011), directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, is commonly called an arthouse action film. Also in 2011, director Lars von Trier released \"Melancholia\", a movie dealing with depression and other mental disorders while also showing a family's reaction to an approaching planet that could collide with the Earth. The movie was well received, some claiming it to be Von Trier's masterpiece with others highlighting Kirsten Dunst's performance, the visuals, and realism depicted in the movie.\n\nJonathan Glazer's \"Under the Skin\" was screened at the 2013 Venice Film Festival and received a theatrical release through indie studio A24 the following year. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson, follows an alien in human form as she travels around Glasgow, picking up unwary men for sex, harvesting their flesh and stripping them of their humanity. Dealing with themes such as sexuality, humanity, and objectification, the film received positive reviews and was hailed by some as a masterpiece; critic Richard Roeper described the film as \"what we talk about when we talk about film as art\". This decade also saw a re-emergence of \"art horror\" with the success of films like \"Black Swan\" (2010), \"Stoker\" (2013), \"Enemy\" (2013), \"The Babadook\" (2014), \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" (2014), \"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\" (2014), \"Goodnight Mommy\" (2014), \"It Follows\" (2015) and \"The Witch\" (2015).\n\n\"Quality artistic television\", a television genre or style which shares some of the same traits as art films, has been identified. Television shows, such as David Lynch's \"Twin Peaks\" and the BBC's \"The Singing Detective\", also have \"a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity\".\n\nAs with much of Lynch's other work (notably the film \"Blue Velvet\"), \"Twin Peaks\" explores the gulf between the veneer of small-town respectability and the seedier layers of life lurking beneath its surface. The show is difficult to place in a defined television genre; stylistically, it borrows the unsettling tone and supernatural premises of horror films and simultaneously offers a bizarrely comical parody of American soap operas with a campy, melodramatic presentation of the morally dubious activities of its quirky characters. The show represents an earnest moral inquiry distinguished by both weird humor and a deep vein of surrealism, incorporating highly stylized vignettes, surrealist and often inaccessible artistic images alongside the otherwise comprehensible narrative of events.\n\nOther television shows that have been called \"artistic television\" include \"The Simpsons\" for its use of a \"flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show\". Charlie Brooker's UK-focused \"Black Mirror\" television series explores the dark and sometimes satirical themes in modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies; while classified as \"speculative fiction\", rather than art television, it received rave reviews. HBO's \"The Wire\" might also qualify as \"artistic television\", as it has garnered a greater amount of critical attention from academics than most television shows receive. For example, the film theory journal \"Film Quarterly\" has featured the show on its cover.\n"}

{"id": "1385257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1385257", "title": "Cheap talk", "text": "Cheap talk\n\nIn game theory, cheap talk is communication between players that does not directly affect the payoffs of the game. Providing and receiving information is free. This is in contrast to signaling in which sending certain messages may be costly for the sender depending on the state of the world.\n\nOne actor has information and the other has ability to act. The informed player can choose strategically what to say and what not to say. Things become interesting when the interests of the players are not aligned.\nThe classic example is of an expert (say, an ecologist) trying to explain the state of the world to an uninformed decision maker (say, politician voting on a deforestation bill). The decision maker, after hearing the report from the expert, must then make a decision which affects the payoffs of both players.\n\nThis basic setting set by Crawford and Sobel has given rise to a variety of variants.\n\nTo give a formal definition, cheap talk is communication that is:\nTherefore an agent engaging in cheap talk could lie with impunity, but may choose in equilibrium not to do so.\n\nIn the basic form of the game, there are two players communicating, one sender \"S\" and one receiver \"R\".\n\nType.\nSender \"S\" gets knowledge of the state of the world or of his \"type\" \"t\". Receiver \"R\" does not know \"t\" ; he has only ex-ante beliefs about it, and relies on a message from \"S\" to possibly improve the accuracy of his beliefs.\n\nMessage.\n\"S\" decides to send message \"m\". Message \"m\" may disclose full information, but it may also give limited, blurred information: it will typically say \"The state of the world is between \"t\" and \"t\"\". It may give no information at all.\n\nThe form of the message does not matter, as long as there is mutual understanding, common interpretation. It could be a general statement from a central bank’s chairman, a political speech in any language, etc. Whatever the form, it is eventually taken to mean \"The state of the world is between \"t\" and \"t\"\".\n\nAction.\nReceiver \"R\" receives message \"m\". \"R\" updates his beliefs about the state of the world given new information that he might get, using Bayes's rule. \"R\" decides to take action \"a\". This action impacts both his own utility and the sender’s utility.\n\nUtility.\nThe decision of \"S\" regarding the content of \"m\" is based on maximizing his utility, given what he expects \"R\" to do. Utility is a way to quantify satisfaction or wishes. It can be financial profits, or non-financial satisfaction—for instance the extent to which the environment is protected.\n\"→ Quadratic utilities:\"\nThe respective utilities of \"S\" and \"R\" can be specified by the following:\nformula_1\nformula_2\n\nThe theory applies to more general forms of utility, but quadratic preferences makes exposition easier. Thus \"S\" and \"R\" have different objectives if \"b ≠ 0\". Parameter \"b\" is interpreted as \"conflict of interest\" between the two players, or alternatively as bias.\"U\" is maximized when \"a = t\", meaning that the receiver wants to take action that matches the state of the world, which he does not know in general. \"U\" is maximized when \"a = t + b\", meaning that \"S\" wants a slightly higher action to be taken. Since \"S\" does not control action, \"S\" must obtain the desired action by choosing what information to reveal. Each player’s utility depends on the state of the world and on both players’ decisions that eventually lead to action \"a\".\n\nNash equilibrium.\nWe look for an equilibrium where each player decides optimally, assuming that the other player also decides optimally. Players are rational, although \"R\" has only limited information. Expectations get realized, and there is no incentive to deviate from this situation.\n\nCrawford and Sobel characterize possible Nash equilibria.\n\n\nWhen interests are aligned, then information is fully disclosed. When conflict of interest is very large, all information is kept hidden. These are extreme cases. The model allowing for more subtle case when interests are close, but different and in these cases optimal behavior leads to some but not all information being disclosed, leading to various kinds of carefully worded sentences that we may observe.\n\nMore generally :\n\nMessages.\nWhile messages could ex-ante assume an infinite number of possible values \"µ(t)\" for the infinite number of possible states of the world \"t\", actually they may take only a finite number of values \"(m, m, . . . , m)\".\n\nThus an equilibrium may be characterized by a partition \"(t(N), t(N). . . t(N))\" of the set of types [0, 1],\nwhere \"0 = t(N) < t(N) < . . . < t(N) = 1\". This partition is shown on the top right segment of Figure 1.\n\nThe \"t(N)\"’s are the bounds of intervals where the messages are constant: for \"t(N) < t < t(N), µ(t) = m\".\n\nActions.\nSince actions are functions of messages, actions are also constant over these intervals:\nfor \"t(N) < t < t(N)\", \"α(t) = α(m) = a\".\n\nThe action function is now indirectly characterized by the fact that each value \"a\" optimizes return for the \"R\", knowing that \"t\" is between \"t\" and \"t\". Mathematically (assuming that \"t\" is uniformly distributed over [0, 1]),\n\nformula_3\n→ \"Quadratic utilities:\"\n\nGiven that \"R\" knows that \"t\"is between \"t\" and \"t\", and in the special case quadratic utility where \"R\" wants action \"a\" to be as close to \"t\" as possible, we can show that quite intuitively the optimal action is the middle of the interval:\nformula_4\n\nIndifference condition.\nWhat happens at \"t = t\"? The sender has to be indifferent between sending either message \"m\" or \"m\".\nformula_5       \"1 ≤ i≤ N-1\"\n\nThis gives information about \"N\" and the \"t\".\n\n\"→ Practically:\"\nWe consider a partition of size \"N\".\nOne can show that formula_6\n\n\"N\" must be small enough so that the numerator is positive. This determines the maximum allowed value formula_7 where formula_8 is the ceiling of formula_9, i.e. the smallest positive integer greater or equal to formula_9. \nExample: We assume that \"b = 1/20\". Then \"N = 3\". We now describe all the equilibria for \"N=1\", \"2\", or \"3\" (see Figure 2).\n\nN = 1: This is the babbling equilibrium. \"t = 0, t = 1\"; \"a = 1/2 = 0.5\".\n\nN = 2: \"t = 0, t = 2/5 = 0.4, t = 1\"; \"a = 1/5 = 0.2, a = 7/10 = 0.7\". \n\nN = N = 3: \"t = 0, t = 2/15, t = 7/15, t = 1\"; \"a = 1/15, a = 3/10 = 0.3, a = 11/15\".\n\nWith \"N = 1\", we get the \"coarsest\" possible message, which does not give any information. So everything is red on the top left panel. With \"N = 3\", the message is \"finer\". However, it remains quite coarse compared to full revelation, which would be the 45° line, but which is not a Nash equilibrium.\n\nWith a higher \"N\", and a finer message, the blue area is more important. This implies higher utility. Disclosing more information benefits both parties.\n\nCheap talk can, in general, be added to any game and has the potential to enhance the set of possible equilibrium outcomes. For example, one can add a round of cheap talk in the beginning of the Battle of the Sexes. Each player announces whether they intend to go to the football game, or the opera. Because the Battle of the Sexes is a coordination game, this initial round of communication may enable the players to select among multiple equilibria, thereby achieving higher payoffs than in the uncoordinated case. The messages and strategies which yield this outcome are symmetric for each player. They are: 1) announce opera or football with even probability 2) if a person announces opera (or football), then upon hearing this message the other person will say opera (or football) as well (Farrell and Rabin, 1996). If they both announce different options, then no coordination is achieved. In the case of only one player messaging, this could also give that player a first-mover advantage.\n\nIt is not guaranteed, however, that cheap talk will have an effect on equilibrium payoffs. Another game, the Prisoner's Dilemma, is a game whose only equilibrium is in dominant strategies. Any pre-play cheap talk will be ignored and players will play their dominant strategies (Defect, Defect) regardless of the messages sent.\n\nIt has been commonly argued that cheap talk will have no effect on the underlying structure of the game. In biology authors have often argued that costly signalling best explains signalling between animals (see Handicap principle, Signalling theory). This general belief has been receiving some challenges (see work by Carl Bergstrom and Brian Skyrms 2002, 2004). In particular, several models using evolutionary game theory indicate that cheap talk can have effects on the evolutionary dynamics of particular games.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "170594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170594", "title": "Dialogue", "text": "Dialogue\n\nDialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in American English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature.\n\nIn the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and techniques for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.\n\nThe term dialogue stems from the Greek διάλογος (\"dialogos\", conversation); its roots are διά (\"dia\": through) and λόγος (\"logos\": speech, reason). The first extant author who uses the term is Plato, in whose works it is closely associated with the art of dialectic. Latin took over the word as \"dialogus\".\n\nDialogue as a genre in the Middle East and Asia dates back to ancient works, such as Sumerian disputations preserved in copies from the late third millennium BC, Rigvedic dialogue hymns and the \"Mahabharata\".\n\nIn the East, In 13th century Japan, dialogue was used in important philosophical works. In the 1200s, Nichiren Daishonin wrote some of his important writings in dialogue form, describing a meeting between two characters in order to present his argument and theory, such as in \"Conversation between a Sage and an Unenlightened Man\" (The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin 1: pp.99-140, dated around 1256), and \"On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land\" (Ibid., pp.6-30; dated 1260), while in other writings he used a question and answer format, without the narrative scenario, such as in \"Questions and Answers about Embracing the Lotus Sutra\" (Ibid., pp.55-67, possibly from 1263). The sage or person answering the questions was understood as the author.\n\nIn the West, Plato (c. 437 BC – c. 347 BC) has commonly been credited with the systematic use of dialogue as an independent literary form. Ancient sources indicate, however, that the Platonic dialogue had its foundations in the \"mime\", which the Sicilian poets Sophron and Epicharmus had cultivated half a century earlier. These works, admired and imitated by Plato, have not survived and we have only the vaguest idea of how they may have been performed. The \"Mimes\" of Herodas, which were found in a papyrus in 1891, give some idea of their character.\n\nPlato further simplified the form and reduced it to pure argumentative conversation, while leaving intact the amusing element of character-drawing. By about 400 BC he had perfected the Socratic dialogue. All his extant writings, except the \"Apology\" and Epistles, use this form.\n\nFollowing Plato, the dialogue became a major literary genre in antiquity, and several important works both in Latin and in Greek were written. Soon after Plato, Xenophon wrote his own \"Symposium\"; also, Aristotle is said to have written several philosophical dialogues in Plato's style (of which only fragments survive).\n\nTwo French writers of eminence borrowed the title of Lucian's most famous collection; both Fontenelle (1683) and Fénelon (1712) prepared \"Dialogues des morts\" (\"Dialogues of the Dead\"). Contemporaneously, in 1688, the French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche published his \"Dialogues on Metaphysics and Religion\", thus contributing to the genre's revival in philosophic circles. In English non-dramatic literature the dialogue did not see extensive use until Berkeley employed it, in 1713, for his treatise, \"Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous\". His contemporary, the Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.\" A prominent 19th-century example of literary dialogue was Landor's \"Imaginary Conversations\" (1821–1828).\n\nIn Germany, Wieland adopted this form for several important satirical works published between 1780 and 1799. In Spanish literature, the \"Dialogues\" of Valdés (1528) and those on \"Painting\" (1633) by Vincenzo Carducci are celebrated. Italian writers of collections of dialogues, following Plato's model, include Torquato Tasso (1586), Galileo (1632), Galiani (1770), Leopardi (1825), and a host of others.\n\nIn the 19th century, the French returned to the original application of dialogue. The inventions of \"Gyp\", of Henri Lavedan, and of others, which tell a mundane anecdote wittily and maliciously in conversation, would probably present a close analogy to the lost mimes of the early Sicilian poets. English writers including Anstey Guthrie also adopted the form, but these dialogues seem to have found less of a popular following among the English than their counterparts written by French authors.\n\nThe Platonic dialogue, as a distinct genre which features Socrates as a speaker and one or more interlocutors discussing some philosophical question, experienced something of a rebirth in the 20th century. Authors who have recently employed it include George Santayana, in his eminent \"Dialogues in Limbo\" (1926, 2nd ed. 1948; this work also includes such historical figures as Alcibiades, Aristippus, Avicenna, Democritus, and Dionysius the Younger as speakers). Also Edith Stein and Iris Murdoch used the dialogue form. Stein imagined a dialogue between Edmund Husserl (phenomenologist) and Thomas Aquinas (metaphysical realist). Murdoch included not only Socrates and Alcibiades as interlocutors in her work \"Acastos: Two Platonic Dialogues\" (1986), but featured a young Plato himself as well. More recently Timothy Williamson wrote \"Tetralogue\", a philosophical exchange on a train between four people with radically different epistemological views.\n\nMartin Buber assigns dialogue a pivotal position in his theology. His most influential work is titled \"I and Thou\". Buber cherishes and promotes dialogue not as some purposive attempt to reach conclusions or express mere points of view, but as the very prerequisite of authentic relationship between man and man, and between man and God. Buber's thought centers on \"true dialogue\", which is characterized by openness, honesty, and mutual commitment.\n\nThe Second Vatican Council placed a major emphasis on dialogue with the World. Most of the Council's documents involve some kind of dialogue : dialogue with other religions (\"Nostra aetate\"), dialogue with other Christians (Unitatis Redintegratio), dialogue with modern society (\"Gaudium et spes\") and dialogue with political authorities (Dignitatis Humanae). However, in the English translations of these texts, \"dialogue\" was used to translate two Latin words with distinct meanings, \"colloquium\" (\"discussion\") and \"dialogus\" (\"dialogue\"). The choice of terminology appears to have been strongly influenced by Buber's thought.\n\nThe physicist David Bohm originated a related form of dialogue where a group of people talk together in order to explore their assumptions of thinking, meaning, communication, and social effects. This group consists of ten to thirty people who meet for a few hours regularly or a few continuous days. In a Bohm dialogue, dialoguers agree to leave behind debate tactics that attempt to convince and, instead, talk from their own experience on subjects that are improvised on the spot.\n\nIn his influential works, Russian philosopher and semiotician Mikhail Bakhtin provided a linguistic methodology to define the dialogue, its nature and meaning:\n\"Dialogic relations\" have a specific nature: they can be reduced neither to the purely logical (even if dialectical) nor to the purely linguistic (compositional-syntactic) They are possible only between complete utterances of various speaking subjects... Where there is no word and no language, there can be no dialogic relations; they cannot exist among objects or logical quantities (concepts, judgments, and so forth). Dialogic relations presuppose a language, but they do not reside within the system of language. They are impossible among elements of a language.\n\nThe Brazilian educationalist Paulo Freire, known for developing popular education, advanced dialogue as a type of pedagogy. Freire held that dialogued communication allowed students and teachers to learn from one another in an environment characterized by respect and equality. A great advocate for oppressed peoples, Freire was concerned with praxis—action that is informed and linked to people's values. Dialogued pedagogy was not only about deepening understanding; it was also about making positive changes in the world: to make it better.\n\nDialogue is used as a practice in a variety of settings, from education to business. Influential theorists of dialogal education include Paulo Freire and Ramon Flecha.\n\nIn the United States, an early form of dialogic learning emerged in the Great Books movement of the early to mid-20th century, which emphasized egalitarian dialogues in small classes as a way of understanding the foundational texts of the Western canon. Institutions that continue to follow a version of this model include the Great Books Foundation, Shimer College in Chicago, and St. John's College in Annapolis and Santa Fe.\n\nEgalitarian dialogue is a concept in dialogic learning. It may be defined as a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.\n\nStructured dialogue represents a class of dialogue practices developed as a means of orienting the dialogic discourse toward problem understanding and consensual action. Whereas most traditional dialogue practices are unstructured or semi-structured, such conversational modes have been observed as insufficient for the coordination of multiple perspectives in a problem area. A disciplined form of dialogue, where participants agree to follow a dialogue framework or a facilitator, enables groups to address complex shared problems.\n\nAleco Christakis (who created \"structured dialogue design\") and John N. Warfield (who created \"science of generic design\") were two of the leading developers of this school of dialogue. The rationale for engaging structured dialogue follows the observation that a rigorous bottom-up democratic form of dialogue must be structured to ensure that a sufficient variety of stakeholders represents the problem system of concern, and that their voices and contributions are equally balanced in the dialogic process.\n\nStructured dialogue is employed for complex problems including peacemaking (e.g., Civil Society Dialogue project in Cyprus) and indigenous community development., as well as government and social policy formulation.\n\nIn one deployment, structured dialogue is (according to a European Union definition) \"a means of mutual communication between governments and administrations including EU institutions and young people. The aim is to get young people's contribution towards the formulation of policies relevant to young peoples lives.\" The application of structured dialogue requires one to differentiate the meanings of discussion and deliberation.\n\nGroups such as Worldwide Marriage Encounter and Retrouvaille use dialogue as a communication tool for married couples. Both groups teach a dialogue method that helps couples learn more about each other in non-threatening postures, which helps to foster growth in the married relationship.\n\nThe German philosopher and classicist emphasizes the original term of dialogue, which goes back to Heraclitus: \"The logos [...] answers to the question of the world as a whole and how everything in it is connected. Logos is the one principle at work, that gives order to the manifold in the world.\" For Dietz dialogue (gr. dia-logos) means \"a kind of thinking, acting and speaking, which the logos \"passes through\"\" Therefore, talking to each other is merely one part of \"dialogue\". Acting dialogically means directing someone's attention to another one and to reality at the same time.\n\nAgainst this background and together with Thomas Kracht, Karl-Martin Dietz developed what he termed \"\" as a form of organizational management. In several German enterprises and organisations it replaced the traditional human resource management, e.g. in the German drugstore chain dm-drogerie markt.\n\nSeparately, and earlier to Thomas Kracht and Karl-Martin Dietz, Rens van Loon published multiple works on the concept of Dialogical Leadership, starting with a chapter in the Dutch book, The Organization as Story (2003). Van Loon is the chair of Dialogical Leadership at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, Department of Humanities and Ethics.\n\nMoral dialogues are social processes which allow societies or communities to form new shared moral understandings. Moral dialogues have the capacity to modify the moral positions of a sufficient number of people to generate widespread approval for actions and policies that previously had little support or were considered morally inappropriate by many. Communitarian philosopher Amitai Etzioni has developed an analytical framework which—modeling historical examples—outlines the reoccurring components of moral dialogues. Elements of moral dialogues include: establishing a moral baseline; sociological dialogue starters which initiate the process of developing new shared moral understandings; the linking of multiple groups' discussions in the form of “megalogues”; distinguishing the distinct attributes of the moral dialogue (apart from rational deliberations or culture wars); dramatization to call widespread attention to the issue at hand; and, closure through the establishment of a new shared moral understanding. Moral dialogues allow people of a given community to determine what is morally acceptable to a majority of people within the community.\n\n"}

The disappearance of the 8 bit technology and its replacement by the 16 bit machines marked the end of this era, during which many software companies based in Spain launched their career: Dinamic Software, Topo Soft, Opera Soft, Made in Spain and Zigurat among others. The name \"Edad de oro del soft español\" was coined by specialized magazines of the time and has been used to refer to these years until nowadays.\n\nIn the year 1983, the first home personal computers started arriving in Spain, all of them 8 bit machines. ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC were the most sold in the country, followed by MSX and Commodore 64 among others. These were simple machines, with lesser resources, therefore easy to manipulate, so many young programmers all over the country started experimenting with them.\n\nThe Golden Era of Spanish Software officially starts with the launch of \"Bugaboo\", by Indescomp, the first Spanish video game to get a massive international distribution. Shortly, \"Fred\" (Roland in the Caves), by the same authors, this time under the company Made in Spain, was another success, and the owners of Made in Spain decided to create Zigurat, a mother company that would at first be dedicated to distribution, turning Made in Spain into a producing company for Zigurat, which also would at first distribute titles from independent companies. Years later, Made in Spain and Zigurat would completely merge into a single producer and distributor company.\n\nMeanwhile, Dinamic Software made their first steps when they launched for ZX Spectrum Yength, a text adventure. And in the field of distribution, Erbe Software, the main Spanish software distributor for more than a decade, started their activity. In their first years, Erbe tried also to produce their own titles, but in this activity they didn't last for long.\n\nIn 1985, with the birth of magazines Micromanía and Microhobby, videogames gained massive popularity, and the rest of the top companies of the Era, Opera Soft in 1986 and Topo Soft in 1987 started their activity, the first one with \"Livingstone, I presume\", and the second one with \"Spirits\", after their authors programmed for Erbe Software \"Las tres luces de Glaurung\" (\"Conquestador\").\n\nThe just born Zigurat had their biggest success on \"Sir Fred\" and \"El misterio del Nilo\", unofficial version of the movie \"The Jewel of the Nile\", which caused problems internationally because one of the characters of the game was too similar to Michael Douglas, and the authors were forced to change the graphic design of this character in the international versions.\n\nDinamic had their first huge successes in the Johny Jones trilogy, comprising \"Saimazoom\", \"Babaliba\", and mainly \"Abu Simbel Profanation\". After this, they would start another trilogy, the \"Moves\" trilogy, comprising \"Army Moves\", \"Navy Moves\", and much later \"Arctic Moves\". And little by little, publishing titles starring famous sportsmen became popular. Dinamic were the first, with \"Basket Master\" starring Fernando Martín, and they were followed by other companies, with titles starring Ángel Nieto, Carlos Sainz, Poli Díaz, Emilio Butragueño and others.\n\nMeanwhile, Opera Soft published \"Goody\", \"Sol Negro\", \"Cosa Nostra\", and above all, \"La Abadía del Crimen\", based on Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", considered one of the best titles of all the Golden Era of Spanish Software and one of the best titles ever released on ZX Spectrum. On the other hand, Topo Soft, the last of the big ones, quickly arrived on top with titles like \"Mad Mix Game\" and its continuation, and \"Survivor\" among others.\n\nMeanwhile, Dinamic published a text adventure version of \"Don Quijote\", and after that, a section of Dinamic dedicated only to text adventures became independent, and they named themselves Aventuras AD, publishing titles like \"El Jabato\" among others.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, there arrived new 16 bit machines, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, and little by little, IBM PC, followed by consoles like NES and Sega Mega Drive. Although the Spanish companies did some tiny efforts to evolve, they never really switched to 16 bits and concentrated on the declining 8-bit market which, almost extinct in Europe, still had strength in Spain, mainly thanks to the rule Erbe Software, main distributor in the country, imposing a sales price of 875 pesetas (5,26 euros) for all their titles, trying to put an end to piracy.\n\nBut at this moment, Spanish companies started having serious financial problems, and one by one they launched their last titles. Topo Soft fundators left the company in 1989 to establish Animagic, whose main title was \"Mortadelo y Filemon II\" (\"Clever and Smart II\"). Born in bad times, they did not last for long. On the other hand, Topo Soft launched \"Lorna\", \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\", and above all, \"Gremlins 2\", being the first time a Spanish video game company managed to get an exclusive license for all Europe from a Hollywood movie. In 1991, aware of the importance of 16 bit, they tried to switch, with the project of creating a desktop environment for MS-DOS, but the project did not success, and Topo closed on bankruptcy in 1992.\n\nMeanwhile, Opera Soft, after publishing \"Gonzalezzz\", \"Mot\" and \"Angel Nieto Pole 500\", starts decaying like the rest of the companies. In their last months, they launched titles like \"La Colmena\" and one dedicated to \"Barcelona 92\", to disappear shortly after. Some of their components, like Gonzalo Suárez Girard (Gonzo Suárez), would later move to Pyro Studios launching titles like \"\" among others.\n\nAventuras AD, paradoxically, had their most successful period during this time of decline, launching the most of their titles during this time, mainly the Ci-U-Than Legends trilogy, composed of \"La diosa de Cozumel\", \"Los templos sagrados\" and \"Chichén Itzá\", being pioneers in Spain creating a predecessor of graphic adventures with \"La aventura espacial\", a text adventure controlled by menus. Nevertheless, the sales did not last for long, and Aventuras AD disappeared in 1992.\n\nZigurat and Dinamic were the only companies which survived from the Golden Era of Spanish Software, although they had to transform and abandon their previous activity. Zigurat, after 8 bit market collapsed, started developing coin up arcade games, lasting for many years. Dinamic Software, on the other hand, after publishing \"After the War\", \"Narco Police\" and \"Risky Woods\", closed on bankruptcy and was refounded as Dinamic Multimedia in 1993, having in PC Fútbol as their biggest success during the 1990s. However, the dot-com bubble finished Dinamic Multimedia in 2001, but before this the original founders of the company, who had left it in 1999, had already founded FX Interactive, which is still active nowadays.\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s have been described as \"lost decades\" for the Spanish video game industry. However, Alberto Flores de Rio wrote in the \"Encyclopedia of Video Games\" that the 2010s may be a resurgence for Spanish-based game development. Akaoni Studio and MercurySteam started off the decade with financially successful games. Alejando Alcolea of \"Hobby Consolas\" called 2015 the possible start for a \"second golden age of Spanish software\".\n"}

Wilson and Christine Woodcock in 1977.\n\nDrawing upon influences in visual arts, choreography, ensemble theatre, film-making, academic and education research Handspan was created to explore alternative forms of puppetry to add to the booth, shadow puppet or marionette shows that were prevalent in Australia at the time.\n\nMajor Handspan works would often utilise multimedia and readily filled conventional stages or more unusual site-specific spaces in their presentation. Other works offered a more intimate audience experience and were scaled to suit venues as diverse as shop front windows or a local swimming pool.\n\nHandspan shows and those of many of their 1980s contemporaries (refer: Twyla Tharp & David Byrne \"Songs from the Catherine-wheel\"; Robert Wilson - \"Einstein on the Beach\" & La Claca - \"Miro\") led to the creation of 'visual theatre' label - i.e. performance where visual spectacle (accompanied by silence or soundscapes) shared eminence with - and sometimes replaced - voiced text.\n\nThe collective format was perhaps a strong element of the company's success as artistic and business roles were often rotated amongst (though not exclusive to) the membership allowing for diverse professional development and load-sharing as part of the company's day-to-day business from the outset.\n\nThe company went on to incorporate around its collective model gathering a board of directors, festival and corporate sponsorship, substantial government funding and many more members over the next 25 years - either as ongoing core members or as contributing participants to the production process at any given time. An annual 'dreaming meeting' would serve as both a group-devised business plan and creative agenda for the next year.\n\nA multi-level office studio space was found and developed (in the old 'Vardar Studios' a former photographic studio at 108 Gertrude St Fitzroy where they remained for 17 years from 1978. From there, Handspan was able to add to their own performance commitments by fostering other artists work as shows in rehearsal, exhibitions, or as a 'build-to-order' collaboration. In 1995 when their building was sold, Handspan moved their studio and offices to Richmond, then finally in 1998 to join other major Arts entities in South Melbourne in the eminent Southgate Arts Precinct.\n\nMany Handspan members developed substantial business, creative and technical professional skills and in time added their own careers as significant individuals to the Australian artscape.\n\nHandspan's merits abound beyond Australian shores, earning several awards from touring the world stage. Possibly their most germane accolade was awarded at the 1983 Spoleto Festival, Italy for the astonishing multimedia work Secrets conceived by and devised with Nigel Triffitt. The founder of the Spoleto Festivals, composer Giancarlo Menotti, was so taken with the work during a visit to Melbourne, that he booked it for his festivals of two Worlds in Spoleto Italy (1983) and in Charleton USA (1984), where its success helped establish 3rd Spoleto Festival in Melbourne, (now renamed the Melbourne Festival). \n\nNotable Handspan Theatre productions included:\n\n\nIn June 2016, a comprehensive archive of the company - its history, its people and its productions and its pictures, was launched, created by Helen Rickards and Maeve Vella: Handspan Theatre: 1977 - 2002 \n\n"}

{"id": "54295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54295", "title": "Hello Kitty", "text": "Hello Kitty\n\n, also known by her full name , is a fictional cartoon character produced by the Japanese company Sanrio, created by Yuko Shimizu and currently designed by Yuko Yamaguchi. She is depicted as a female Gijinka (anthropomorphization of human and Japanese Bobtail) with a red bow and, notably, no mouth. According to her backstory, she is a perpetual 3rd-grade student who lives outside London. According to Sanrio, she is not a cat: she is simply a cartoon character. Sanrio announced in 2018 that Hello Kitty's birthday is November 1. Since the cartoon character's creation, Hello Kitty has a media franchise including a product line, clothing apparel, toy-line, manga comics, anime series, popular music, and other media.\n\nShortly after her creation in 1974, the Hello Kitty vinyl coin purse was introduced by Sanrio in March 1975. The character was then brought to the United States in 1976. The character is a staple of the \"kawaii\" segment of Japanese popular culture. By 2010, Sanrio had groomed Hello Kitty into a global marketing phenomenon, worth a year. By 2014, when Hello Kitty was 40 years old, she was worth about a year. As of 2018, Hello Kitty is the second highest-grossing franchise of all time, with an estimated retail sales revenue exceeding .\n\nOriginally aimed at preadolescent females, Hello Kitty's market has broadened to include adolescent and adult consumers, being found on a variety of products ranging from school supplies to fashion accessories. Several Hello Kitty TV series, targeted towards children, have been produced, as well as several manga comics and anime films. There have been two Sanrio theme parks based on Hello Kitty, Harmonyland and Sanrio Puroland.\n\nIn 1962, Shintaro Tsuji, founder of Sanrio, began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them. Tsuji noted the profits gained by adding a cute design to the sandals and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise. The company produced a line of character merchandise around gift-giving occasions. Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974. The character's first appearance on an item was a vinyl coin purse in Japan where she was pictured sitting between a bottle of milk and a goldfish bowl. She first appeared in the United States in 1976.\n\nSanrio decided to make Hello Kitty British because at the time when she was created, foreign countries, in particular Britain, were trendy in Japan. In addition, Sanrio already had a number of characters set in the US and it wanted Hello Kitty to be different. Shimizu got the name \"Kitty\" from Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass\", where in a scene early in the book Alice plays with a cat she calls \"Kitty\". Sanrio's motto is \"social communication\" and Tsuji wanted the brand name to reflect that. He first considered \"Hi Kitty\" before settling on \"Hello\" for the greeting.\n\nSpokespeople for Sanrio have said that Hello Kitty does not have a mouth because they want people to \"project their feelings onto the character\" and \"be happy or sad together with Hello Kitty.\" Another explanation Sanrio has given for her lack of a mouth is that she \"speaks from the heart. She's Sanrio's ambassador to the world and isn't bound to any particular language\". Representatives for Sanrio have said they see Hello Kitty as a symbol of friendship, and they hope she will encourage friendship between people across the world. While there has been some speculation that Hello Kitty has its origins in Maneki Neko, and that the name Hello Kitty itself is a back-translation of Maneki Neko, which means \"beckoning cat\" in English, no definitive statement supports that speculation.\n\nHello Kitty sold well immediately after the 1974 launch, and Sanrio's sales increased seven times up until they slumped temporarily in 1978. New series with Hello Kitty in different themed designs are released regularly, following current trends. Yuko Yamaguchi, the main designer for most of Hello Kitty's history, has said that she is inspired by fashion, movies and TV in creating new designs.\n\nHello Kitty was originally marketed only towards a child and preteen audience. In the 1990s, the target market for Hello Kitty was broadened to include teens and adults as a retro brand. Marketed to those who could not get Hello Kitty merchandise as children, or who fondly remember items they had, Sanrio began selling Hello Kitty branded products such as purses and laptops. The 1994–1996 \"Face\" series was the first to be designed for a more mature appeal.\n\nAccording to Sanrio, in 1999 Hello Kitty appeared on 12,000 different products yearly. By 2008, Hello Kitty was responsible for half of Sanrio's $1 billion revenue and there were over 50,000 different Hello Kitty branded products in more than 60 countries. Beginning in 2007, following trends in Japan, Sanrio began using darker designs for Hello Kitty with more black and less pink, and pulling away from \"kawaii\" styles.\n\nHello Kitty and Mimmy celebrated their 40th Anniversary on 1 November 2014. The \"Arigato Everyone Birthday Celebration\" took place in Sanrio Puroland in Tokyo for several days.\n\nOriginally aimed at the pre-adolescent female market, the Hello Kitty product range has expanded and goes all the way from dolls, stickers, greeting cards, clothes, accessories, school supplies and stationery to purses, toasters, televisions, other home appliances, massagers, and computer equipment. These products range from mass market items to high-end consumer products and rare collectibles.\n\nSanrio and various corporate partners have released Hello Kitty-branded products, including the Hello Kitty Stratocaster electric guitar (since 2006, with Fender in the US) and an Airbus A330-200 commercial passenger jet airliner, dubbed the Hello Kitty Jet (2005–2009, with EVA Airways in Taiwan). In late 2011 and early 2012, EVA Air revived their \"Hello Kitty Jets\" with their 3 new A330-300s. However, due to high demand, the airline added 2 more onto their existing A330-200s in mid-2012. A year after, EVA Air added another Hello Kitty Jet onto one of their 777-300ERs, which featured other Sanrio characters as well as Hello Kitty.\n\nIn 2009 Hello Kitty entered the wine market with a collection of four wines available for purchase online, continuing an expansion of products targeted at older audiences.\n\nIn Spring 2005, Simmons Jewelry Co. and Sanrio announced a partnership. \"Kimora Lee Simmons for Hello Kitty\" was launched exclusively at Neiman Marcus, with prices ranging from $300 to $5000. Designed by Kimora Lee Simmons and launched as the initial collection, the jewelry is all hand-made, consisting of diamonds, gemstones, semi-precious stones, 18K gold, sterling silver, enamel and ceramic.\n\nIn Fall 2008, Simmons Jewelry Co. and Sanrio debuted a collection of fine jewelry and watches named \"Hello Kitty® by Simmons Jewelry Co.\" The collection launched with Zales Corporation to further expand the reach of the brand, and it developed accessories to satisfy every Hello Kitty fan. The designs incorporate colorful gemstones and sterling silver to attract a youthful audience.\n\nThere is a themed restaurant named Hello Kitty Sweets in Taipei, Taiwan, which opened in 2008. The restaurant's decor and many of its dishes are patterned after the Hello Kitty character. A Hello Kitty Diner opened in the Chatswood area of Sydney, Australia, and a Hello Kitty dim sum restaurant opened in Kowloon, Hong Kong.\n\nHello Kitty cafés have opened around the world, including in Seoul and other locations in South Korea, Bangkok, Thailand, Adelaide, Australia, Irvine, California, and the Santa Anita Mall in California.\n\nIn 2008, a Hello Kitty-themed maternity hospital opened in Yuanlin, Taiwan. Hello Kitty is featured on the receiving blankets, room decor, bed linens, birth certificate covers, and nurses' uniforms. The hospital's owner explained that he hoped that the theme would help ease the stress of childbirth.\n\nHello Kitty is included as part of the Sanrio livery at the Japanese theme parks Harmonyland and Sanrio Puroland.\n\nIn January 2018, Puma collaborated with Hello Kitty to create the new Puma X Hello Kitty For All Time collection, which features the company's signature sneakers for both children and adults.\n\nThere have been several different Hello Kitty TV series. The first animated television series was \"Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater\", an anime series that was 13 episodes long and aired in 1987. The next, an OVA titled \"Hello Kitty and Friends\", came out in 1993 and was also 13 episodes long. \"Hello Kitty's Paradise\" came out in 1999 and was 16 episodes long. \"Hello Kitty's Stump Village\" came out in 2005 and \"The Adventures of Hello Kitty & Friends\" came out in 2006 and has aired 52 episodes. A crossover series with the development name \"Kiss Hello Kitty\" and pairing animated versions of the members of the rock band KISS with Hello Kitty was announced in March 2013, produced by Gene Simmons and planned to air on The Hub Network (now Discovery Family), but it never aired on any network.\n\n\"\" was a long-running live action children's program that aired on TXN from January 1999 to March 2011. It was the longest-running weekly kids television program in the network's history. In January 2011, the show's creators mutually agreed to end the series after twelve seasons, with the final episode being broadcast on 29 March 2011.\n\nIn August 2018 Sanrio began streaming a CGI animated series on Youtube. It features Hello Kitty talking to the camera about her life in the style of vlogging virtual youtubers.\n\nHello Kitty had two manga comics serialized in \"Ribon\", a shōjo manga magazine. \"Hello Kitty Doki\" ran from May 2007 to April 2008, and \"Hello Kitty Peace\" was released in June 2008.\n\nIn March 2016, Sanrio launched a webcomic featuring Hello Kitty as a strawberry-themed superhero called \"Ichigoman\" (\"ichigo\" meaning strawberry), who fights monsters with the help of her giant robot. The webcomic is created by Toshiki Inoue and Shakua Sinkai and updates once a month. The Ichigoman alter-ego originates from a 2011 exhibition of Yuko Yamaguchi's artwork.\n\nHello Kitty has her own branded album, \"Hello World\", featuring Hello Kitty-inspired songs performed by a collection of artists, including Keke Palmer, Cori Yarckin, and Ainjel Emme. Hello Kitty was also chosen by AH-Software to be the basis of the new Vocaloid to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Sanrio.\n\nCanadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne has written and recorded a song called \"Hello Kitty\" for her fifth studio album, \"Avril Lavigne\", released in 2013.\n\nMusician Yoshiki unveiled the Hello Kitty theme song \"Hello Hello\" in November 2014 at the first Hello Kitty Con. Yoshiki, who was the first celebrity to have his own Hello Kitty doll, the \"Yoshikitty\" in 2009, was approached by Yamaguchi to compose the song seven years prior.\n\nNumerous \"Hello Kitty\" games have been produced since the release of the first title for Famicom in 1992; however, the majority of these games were never released outside Japan. Hello Kitty also has made cameo appearances in games featuring other Sanrio characters, such as the Keroppi game, \"\". Special edition consoles such as the Hello Kitty Dreamcast, Hello Kitty Game Boy Pocket, and Hello Kitty Crystal Xbox have also been released exclusively in Japan.\n\nHello Kitty also appeared as a guest character in Sega's \"Sonic Dash\" in 2016, as part of Sega's partnership with Sanrio, and yet also appeared in \"Super Mario Maker\" as a Mystery Mushroom costume that can be unlocked by playing the event course \"Hello Kitty & My Melody\".\n\n\nThere were three \"Hello Kitty\" anime films released in Japan. \"Hello Kitty: Cinderella\" released in 1987, \"Hello Kitty no Oyayubi Hime\" released in 1990 and \"Hello Kitty no Mahō no Mori no Ohime-sama\" released in 1991.\n\nOn 3 July 2015, Sanrio announced a full-length Hello Kitty theatrical feature for 2019.\n\nThe Hello Kitty brand rose to greater prominence during the late 1990s. At that time, several celebrities, such as Mariah Carey, had adopted Hello Kitty as a fashion statement. Newer products featuring the character can be found in a large variety of American department stores.\n\nThe Dutch artist Dick Bruna, creator of Miffy, has suggested that Hello Kitty is a copy of Miffy (in ), being rendered in a similar style, stating disapprovingly in an interview for the British newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\":\n\nMercis, the firm that managed copyrights for Bruna, took Sanrio to court over their Hello Kitty-associated character Cathy, a rabbit which made her first appearance in 1976 and which Mercis argued infringed the copyright for Miffy. A court in Amsterdam ruled in favour of Mercis in November 2010 and ordered Sanrio to stop the production and sale of merchandise featuring Cathy in the Benelux countries. However, in June of the following year the two companies announced that they had reached a settlement agreement to end their legal dispute, resulting in Sanrio ceasing to use the Cathy character and the two firms jointly donating €150,000 for reconstruction after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\nMusti, a cat character created by Belgian cartoonist Ray Goossens, was also cited as an inspiration for Hello Kitty.\n\nIn May 2008, Japan named Hello Kitty the ambassador of Japanese tourism in both China and Hong Kong, which are two places where the character is exceptionally popular among children and young women. This marked the first time Japan's tourism ministry had appointed a fictional character to the role. Dr Sharon Kinsella, a lecturer at Oxford University on Japanese sociology, called the selection of Hello Kitty \"a bit farcical\"; \"as if a dumbed-down cultural icon ... can somehow do something significant to alter the gnarly and difficult state of China-Japan relations.\"\n\nUNICEF has also awarded Hello Kitty the exclusive title of \"UNICEF Special Friend of Children\".\n\nHello Kitty's popularity in Japan peaked in the late 1990s, when she was the country's top-grossing character. In 2002, Hello Kitty lost her place as the top-grossing character in Japan in the Character Databank popularity chart. In a 2010 survey, she was in third place behind Anpanman and Pikachu from \"Pokémon\". In 2010, \"The New York Times\" attributed the character's relative decline in Japan to her biography not being \"compelling enough to draw many fans\", wrote that analysts called the characterization \"weak\", and added that Hello Kitty not having a mouth has dampened her success as an animated TV character. Hello Kitty has nevertheless remained one of the top three highest-grossing characters in Japan as of 2013. Overseas, her global popularity has increased over the years, with worldwide annual sales reaching in 2013. She has been particularly popular in other Asian countries for decades, such as in China, where her cultural impact is comparable to that of Barbie in the Western world.\n\nIn 1994, artist Tom Sachs' was invited to create a scene for Barneys New York Christmas displays and titled it Hello Kitty Nativity; in it the Virgin Mary was replaced by Hello Kitty with an open Chanel bra, the three Kings were Bart Simpsons and the stable was marked by a McDonald's logo. This contemporary revision of the nativity scene received great attention (not all of it positive) and demonstrated Sachs' interest in the phenomena of consumerism, branding, and the cultural fetishization of products.\n\nIn 2009, Tom Sachs' \"Bronze Collection\" was shown at the Public art space in Manhattan's Lever House, as well as in the Baldwin Gallery in Aspen, Colorado, and the Trocadéro in Paris. The collection featured large white bronze casts of a foamcore Hello Kitty sculpture – a style distinctive to the artist. As of April 2010, the Wind-Up Hello Kitty sculpture is still on display at Lever House. Although Sachs did not ask for permission to use the character in his work, a brand marketing manager for Sanrio was quoted as saying \"You know, there was Marilyn Monroe and Andy Warhol, and then Michael Jackson and Jeff Koons. When you’re an icon, that’s what happens.\"\n\nIn 2015, a 9 foot tall pearlescent Hello Kitty sculpture by artist Sebastian Masuda, was exhibited at the Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, New York City, as part of the Japan Society's exhibition: Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection.\n\n"}

{"id": "1968154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968154", "title": "Image dissector", "text": "Image dissector\n\nAn image dissector, also called a dissector tube, is a video camera tube in which photocathode emissions create an \"electron image\" which is then scanned to produce an electrical signal representing the visual image. The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the electron image in focus, and an electron multiplier to scan the electrons. Dissectors were used only briefly in television systems before being replaced by the much more sensitive iconoscope during the 1930s.\n\nAn image dissector focuses a visual image onto a layer of photosensitive material, such as caesium oxide, which emits negatively charged \"photoelectrons\" proportional to the intensity of the light striking the material. Electrostatic deflecting plates or magnetic fields then periodically manipulate the resulting electron image horizontally and vertically before an electron multiplier, or a small aperture leading to a positively charged detector or \"anode\" in the case of the earliest dissector tubes. The electron multiplier or aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the electron image, representing a similarly small area of the visual image. The entire image is scanned several times per second to produce an electrical signal suitably representative of a moving visual image.\n\nBecause the dissector does not store charge, it is useful for viewing the inside of furnaces and monitoring welding systems as it does not suffer from the \"flare\" normal picture tubes experience when looking at intense lights.\n\nIn April 1925, German professor Max Dieckmann and his student Rudolf Hell applied for a patent for a device named Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television). A patent was issued in October 1927, and their experiments were announced in the magazines \"Discovery\" and \"Popular Radio\", but they failed to reduce it to practice. In 1951, Hell claimed that he had made a tube but could not get it to function, since at the time there was an insufficient knowledge of electron optics, the manipulation of an electron beam by electric or magnetic fields.\n\nAmerican television pioneer Philo T. Farnsworth invented the first functional image dissector in 1927, submitting a patent application on January 7, 1927. On September 7 of that year, the image dissector successfully transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at Farnsworth's laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press, the first such successful demonstration of a fully electronic television system.\n\nIn 1929 Farnsworth eliminated a motor generator from the system, so it then had no mechanical parts. Further developments that year included improvements in image clarity and an increase in the number of lines of resolution, such that it exceeded that of the mechanical television systems. Also in 1929, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (\"Pem\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).\n\nSince the electrons emitted within an image dissector are collected by the electron multiplier or anode only during the very brief time an area of the \"electron image\" is exposed, the bulk of the electrons are lost. Thus the earliest image dissectors were very inefficient, and extremely bright illumination was required for it to be used effectively. Farnsworth addressed this problem with the invention of an \"electron multiplier\" (not to be confused with contemporary electron multipliers), a device that increased the number of electrons in a circuit by generating \"secondary emissions\" of electrons from a pair of opposed surfaces, thus amplifying the electrical signal.\n\nFarnsworth applied for a patent for his \"electron multiplier\" on March 3, 1930 and demonstrated its application in 1931. Farnsworth continued to improve the device, which would come to be called a \"multipactor\", such that it reportedly could amplify a signal to the 60th power or better, and showed great promise in other fields of electronics. A significant problem with the multipactor, however, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactorily rapid rate.\n\nOn August 25, 1934, Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of a complete, all-electronic television system, which included his image dissector, at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn April 1933, Farnsworth submitted a patent application entitled \"Image Dissector\", but which actually detailed a cathode ray tube (CRT) camera tube.\n\nBy late 1930s, dissectors were replaced by more efficient iconoscopes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3961621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3961621", "title": "International Aerial Robotics Competition", "text": "International Aerial Robotics Competition\n\nThe International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC) began in 1991 on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology and is the longest running university-based robotics competition in the world. Since 1991, collegiate teams with the backing of industry and government have fielded autonomous flying robots in an attempt to perform missions requiring robotic behaviors never before exhibited by a flying machine. In 1990, the term “aerial robotics” was coined by competition creator Robert Michelson to describe a new class of small highly intelligent flying machines. The successive years of competition saw these aerial robots grow in their capabilities from vehicles that could at first barely maintain themselves in the air, to the most recent automatons which are self-stable, self-navigating, and able to interact with their environment—especially objects on the ground.\n\nThe primary goal of the competition has been to provide a reason for the state-of-the art in aerial robotics to move forward. Challenges set before the international collegiate community have been geared towards producing advances in the state-of-the-art at an increasingly aggressive pace. From 1991 through 2009, a total of six missions have been proposed. Each of them involved fully autonomous robotic behavior that was undemonstrated at the time and impossible for any robotic system fielded anywhere in the world, even by the most sophisticated military robots belonging to the super powers.\n\nIn October 2013 a new seventh mission was proposed. As with previous missions, the Mission 7 involves totally autonomous flying robots, but this is the first IARC mission to involve the interaction between multiple ground robots and even simultaneous competition between two aerial robots working against each other and against the clock to influence the behavior and trajectory of up to ten autonomous ground robots.\n\nIn 2016, the International Aerial Robotics Competition and its creator were officially recognized during the Georgia legislative session in the form of \"Senate Resolution 1255” which recognized it as the longest running aerial robotics competition in the world and for having been responsible for moving forward the state of the art in aerial robotics on several occasions during the past quarter century.\n\nThe initial mission to move a metallic disc from one side of an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries over the next two years when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.\n\nThe competition mission was then toughened and made a bit less abstract by requiring teams to search for a toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found somewhere on the outside of each drum, and bring a sample back from one of the drums—all without any human intervention whatsoever.\n\nIn 1996 a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University, with backing from Draper Labs, created a small fully autonomous flying robot that repeatedly and correctly mapped the location of all five of the toxic waste drums, and correctly identified the contents of two from the air, thereby completing approximately seventy five percent of the mission. The following year, an aerial robot developed by a team from Carnegie Mellon University completed the entire mission.\n\nThe third mission was begun in 1998. It was a search and rescue mission requiring fully autonomous robots to take off, fly to a disaster area and search for survivors and the dead amid raging fires, broken water mains, clouds of toxic gas, and rubble from destroyed buildings. The scenario was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility where the above hazards could be recreated. Because of the realism of the scenario, animatrons were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from the disaster area.\n\nAn aerial robot from Germany's Technische Universität Berlin was able to detect and avoid all of the obstacles (many of which could have destroyed the robot itself), identify all the dead on the ground and the survivors (distinguishing between the two based on movement), and relay pictures of the survivors along with their locations back to first responders who would attempt a rescue. This mission was completed in 2000.\n\nThe fourth mission was initiated in 2001. This fully autonomous mission involved three scenarios requiring the same autonomous behavior.\n\nAll three missions involve the same elements:\n\nThis fourth IARC mission was conducted at the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab using the McKenna MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) site, which replicates a complete German village created for war gaming when the main cold war threat was perceived to come through the Fulda Gap into Germany. The fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated \"all\" of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes—a feat considered by the organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth mission was terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established.\n\nA virtual representation of the McKenna MOUT site was developed by the Army Research Laboratory in 2002 for soldier training and experimentation.\n\nThe fifth mission picked up where the fourth mission left off by demonstrating the fully autonomous aerial robotic behaviors necessary to rapidly negotiate the confined internal spaces of a structure once it has been penetrated by an air vehicle. The nuclear reactor complex explosion scenario of the fourth mission was used as the backdrop for the fifth mission. The fifth mission required a fully autonomous aerial vehicle (presupposed to have been launched from a \"mothership\" just outside the structure as demonstrated during the fourth mission) to penetrate the structure and negotiate the more complex interior space containing hallways, small rooms, obstacles, and dead ends in order to search for a designated target without the aid of global-positioning navigational aids, and relay pictures back to a monitoring station some distance from the structure. The \"First Symposium on Indoor Flight Issues\" was held in conjunction with this 2009 IARC event.\n\nThe sixth mission began in 2010 as an extension of the fifth Mission theme of autonomous indoor flight behavior, however the sixth mission demanded more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2010. This espionage mission involved covertly stealing a flash drive from a particular room in a building, for which there was no a priori knowledge of the floor plan, and depositing an identical drive to avoid detection of the theft. The \"2010 Symposium on Indoor Flight Issues\" was held concurrently at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez during the 20th anniversary competition. The Official Rules for the 6th Mission are available at the Competition web site.\n\nThe seventh mission began in 2014 demanding more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2014. The mission involves autonomous aerial robots controlling autonomous ground robots tactually. The mission is divided into mission 7a and 7b. Mission 7a requires a single autonomous aerial robot to herd as many of the 10 autonomous ground robot targets as possible, across the green boundary line in under 10 minutes. The arena is 20m x 20m (65.62 feet x 65.62 feet) and has a green boundary line at one end, a red boundary line at the opposite end, and white sidelines. The pattern on the floor of the arena is unknown to the aerial robot designers a priori, however it is known that there is a 1m x 1m (3.28 feet x 3.28 feet) white square grid pattern overlaid upon the arena. Other than what is seen on the arena floor, there are neither walls for SLAM mapping nor GPS availability. Techniques such as optical flow or optical odometry are possible solutions to navigation within the arena.\n\nIn addition to the 10 ground robot targets, there are 4 \"tall\" robot obstacles (as much as 2m (6.56 feet in height) which circulate within the arena. Collisions with obstacle ground robots ends the run with no score. The (non obstacle) ground robot targets automatically reverse direction every 20 seconds and have up to 20° of noise applied to their trajectories at 5 second intervals. If an aerial robot touches the ground robot on top with a magnet, the ground robot will turn clockwise 45°. If the aerial robot blocks its forward motion by landing in front of it, the ground robot targets will reverse direction. Ground robot targets that feely escape the arena count against the aerial robot's team score. The autonomous aerial robots must decide which ground robots are in imminent danger of crossing any boundary but the green one, and redirect them toward the green boundary.\n\nFive of the 10 ground robot targets are green and 5 are red. Mission 7b pits the best teams from 7a against each other, one on one, to get as many of its own green ground robots across the green boundary while misdirecting the opponent's red ground robots. Similarly, the opponent is trying to get as many of its red ground robots across the red boundary while misdirecting the opponent's green ground robots.\n\nThe Official Rules for the current 7th mission are available at the Competition web site. In addition, a video derived from the August 2014 events held at the American Venue (the Georgia Institute of Technology's McAmish Pavilion) and Asia/Pacific Venue (Yantai China), explains the details of mission 7 graphically. On 28 September 2018 the overall winner of mission 7 was announced as Zhejiang University. Details can be found at the Official IARC website along with a video of the winning flight by Zhejiang University and in Beihang University press release. In all, 52 teams from 12 nations were entered as competitors for mission 7.\n\nIn 2018, the 27th year of the International Aerial Robotics Competition, the 8th mission was announced.\n\nThe Official Rules for the 8th mission are available at the Competition web site along with a video summarizing the 8th mission. Mission 8 focuses on non-electronic human-machine interaction for the first time, with four aerial robots assisting humans to complete tasks that one person cannot independently accomplish. The gist of mission 8 involves a swarm of autonomous aerial robots working with a human to achieve a task in the presence of hostile Sentry aerial robots which are autonomously trying to impede the human. The Sentry robots carry lasers (similar to those used in Laser tag) which will disable the human and end the run after a specified number of “hits”. The task is structured so that it can not be achieved by the human without the assistance of the swarm of aerial Helpers that are directed only by the human's gestures and voice commands.\n\nIn 2018, the inaugural year of mission 8, the American Venue was held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Asia/Pacific Venue was conducted at Beihang University in Beijing China.\n\nCollegiate teams participating in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the People's Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India. Teams range in size from several students, up to twenty or more. Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, but it may assist the student teams with funding and equipment.\n\nThe aerial robots vary in design from fixed wing airplanes, to conventional helicopters, to ducted fans, to airships, and beyond to bizarre hybrid creations. Because the competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior, the air vehicle itself is of less importance.\n\nTeams choosing to develop new air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries have always been the overall winners, with airships and ducted fans a close second.\n\nAerial robots must be unmanned and autonomous, and must compete based on their ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.\n\nThe International Aerial Robotics Competition was first held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (first mission, 1991–1995). Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center asked that the competition move to its location for the second mission, where it was held at the entrance to the park during 1996 and 1997. The U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility then brought the IARC to Richland WA from 1998 to 2000 for the conduct of the third mission. The fourth mission began in 2001 at the U.S. Navy's Webster Field in Maryland, but was moved to the Canada Olympic Village (Calgary, Canada) the following year because Webster Field was unsuitable. Weather, difficulty in airspace management, and extreme electromagnetic interference drove the IARC to an ideal venue where these issues could be managed: the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab, McKenna MOUT site. For the fourth mission scenarios, the existence of the uninhabited McKenna village provides the perfect venue. Due to the nature of the challenge, the fifth mission took place in an indoor location at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. The sixth mission was initiated in the coliseum on the campus of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez during August 2010, however the sixth mission was moved to Grand Forks, North Dakota beginning in 2011. A second venue was established in Beijing China beginning in 2012. This \"Asia/Pacific Venue\" serves the Asian and Australian continents while the \"American Venue\" serves the American, European, and African continents. Teams are free to enter the competition at either venue. Beginning in August 2012, the two venues conducted the sixth mission under the same set of rules. The seventh mission was begun at the McAmish Pavilion on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (American Venue) and in Yantai, Shandong Province, China (Asia/Pacific Venue) during August 2014. The 8th Mission American Venue is being held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Asia/Pacific Venue is being conducted at Beihang University in Beijing China, beginning in August of 2018.\nIARC prizes have traditionally been \"winner take all\", although during the competition's early years monetary progress awards were given to further development of the best performers. With the fourth mission it was realized that there would be no quick winners, and that several years of development would be required by each of the teams. Therefore, an incremental \"growing prize pot\" was established, to which the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation adds another US$10,000 each year. The 2008 prize level was set at a total of $80,000. Any team completing the fourth mission in under 15 minutes would receive the entire $80,000 prize, otherwise the prize would be distributed based on 2008 competitor performance most closely approaching the 15-minute mission goal. By 2008, Levels 1 through 3 of the fourth mission had been demonstrated, proving that all required aerial robotic behaviors were possible, but by the end of the 2008 event, no single team was able to sequentially and seamlessly demonstrate all behaviors in under 15 minutes. The $80,000 was therefore divided between the ten finalists: (Georgia Institute of Technology received $27,700; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University $17,700; and Embry Riddle/DeVry Calgary $12,200, with the remainder shared between the other finalists based on merit). $10,000 was awarded to a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009 which, in addition to receiving the AUVSI-sponsored prize award, also received their $1,000 application fee back under the incentive program outlined in the Official IARC Rules for 2009 which stated that any team completing the fifth mission during the first year of the mission, would receive a full rebate of their application fee. In August 2013, a team from Tsinghua University completed the entire sixth mission, thereby winning $40,000.\nThe competition creator, Robert Michelson, is past President of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI).\nThe IARC was first established with seed money for logistics and a grand prize that was backed by the Association. After the initial success and tremendous media attention garnered by the IARC, the AUVSI launched the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition a few years later in Detroit, MI. This was organized by AUVSI Board member, Jerry Lane who worked at the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command at the time. In 1998, the underwater community was represented when AUVSI and the U.S. Office of Naval Research teamed up to offer the first International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Competition which is held annually in the U.S. All of these competitions, land, sea, and air, have at their core, \"full autonomy\" as a distinctive characteristic. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation continues to support these competitions with logistics and prize money although there are numerous industry co-sponsors as well.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16928716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16928716", "title": "Kim (song)", "text": "Kim (song)\n\n\"Kim\" is a song by American rapper Eminem which appears on his 2000 album \"The Marshall Mathers LP\". The song reflects intense anger and hatred toward his then-wife Kim Mathers and features Eminem imitating her voice, and ends with him killing Kim and later burying her. \"Kim\" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on \"The Slim Shady LP\" in late 1998. Eminem wrote this song, along with \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" (where Eminem and his daughter go to the lake to dispose of Kim's dead body), at a time when he and Kim were having marital problems and Kim was preventing him from seeing his daughter Hailie. Despite its controversial graphic content, it is often highlighted as one of Eminem's most memorable songs.\n\nOn the clean version of \"The Marshall Mathers LP\", this song is replaced by a clean version of \"The Kids\" (an unedited version can be found on the CD single of \"The Way I Am\", the UK and deluxe editions of \"The Marshall Mathers LP\").\n\nSince meeting in 1989, Eminem and Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott have had an on-and-off relationship. They had a daughter together named Hailie Jade, who was born on Christmas Day, 1995. The couple married in 1999 and divorced in 2001, later re-married in 2006 and divorced that same year. \"Kim\" is the third song by Eminem about Kim, the first being \"Searchin\" from his debut album \"Infinite\" (1996) and the second being \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from the album \"Slim Shady LP\" (1999). An instrumental version of the song is played at the start of the music video of \"The Way I Am\".\n\nEminem is both emotionally unstable and aggressive throughout the entire song, as the song portrays him murdering Kim. The song begins with Eminem in Kim's home (after murdering her husband and her stepson). Eminem is talking calmly to their daughter, who is sleeping, and subsequently starts to shout verbal abuse at Kim, which remains a common element throughout the entire song. Eminem sings \"So long, bitch you did me so wrong/I don't want to go on living in this world without you\" in the hook two times. \n\nIn the second verse, the setting changes to Eminem and Kim in a car. During the verse, he shouts \"There's a four year old little boy laying dead with a slit throat in \"your\" living room!\". In the album version of the song, the words \"four\" and \"boy\" are censored, because of the Columbine High School Massacre and its reference to child murder. An uncensored, rare version of \"Kim\" was leaked onto the Internet, before the massacre and album release, which was titled \"Bitch So Wrong\", which doesn't censor the words \"four\" and \"boy\", but has bad quality and is slightly different from the album version: It doesn't have the intro and outro, smashes are not heard when he says \"This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine\", the truck's horn is different when he says \"What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?!\", and rustling is not heard in the woods when Kim is running away from Eminem. The chorus of the uncensored version is also different from the album version, with the album version echoing Eminem's voice, the choruses sound different each time in the uncensored version, but the last chorus is similar to the choruses of the album version. The song continues with Eminem driving frantically through traffic, and stopping in the woods, where Kim tries to run away, but fails. The final verse ends with Eminem slitting Kim's throat, while screaming \"Bleed, bitch! Bleed!\". The song then ends in a prolonged outro during which the listener can hear a skit called \"Mommy\", which was released on \"The Slim Shady EP\", which was placed before \"Just the Two of Us\". The skit includes sounds of a dead body being dragged through the grass and thrown into the trunk of a car. This same skit is played as the beginning of \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" (a later remastered version of \"Just the Two of Us\" from the \"Slim Shady EP\"), indicating the association between the two songs and the direct chronology of events.\n\nThe song is considered to be one of the greatest songs by Eminem. The \"Rolling Stone\" album review of \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" stated that:\n\nWhile \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that:\n\nIn 2013 \"Complex\" ranked \"Kim\" at #21 on their list of the 25 most violent rap songs of all time and at #4 on their list of the 25 most depressing rap songs.\n"}

The Oscar is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\n\nOver the years, twenty-five films have been submitted by Turkey for consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Although their 2008 submission \"Three Monkeys\" made the nine-film shortlist, no Turkish film has ever achieved an Oscar nomination. Additionally, Switzerland sent two Turkish language films to the competition, including \"Yol\" in 1982 which was a fully Turkish production by a Turkish director that had to be smuggled into Switzerland for post-production due to political considerations, and \"Journey of Hope\", a film about Turkish refugees made by a Swiss director in conjunction with European film companies. \"Journey of Hope\" was submitted in 1990 and won the 1991 Oscar representing Switzerland.

In a variation from this and inspired to do so Walt Disney's first directorial efforts, years before Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was born in 1927 and Mickey Mouse in 1928, were the live-action animated \"Alice Comedies\" cartoons, in which a young live-action girl named Alice interacted with animated cartoon characters.\n\nMany previous films combining live action with stop-motion animation using back projection, such as Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen films in the United States, and Aleksandr Ptushko, Karel Zeman and more recently Jan Švankmajer in Eastern Europe. The first feature film to do this was \"The Lost World\" (1925). In the 1935 Soviet film \"The New Gulliver\", the only character who wasn't animated was Gulliver himself.\n\nThe 1940 Warner Bros. cartoon \"You Ought to Be in Pictures\", directed by Friz Freleng, featured Warner Bros. characters interacting with live-action people. The animated sequence in the 1945 film \"Anchors Aweigh\" in which Gene Kelly dances with an animated Jerry Mouse, is one of the actor's most famous scenes.\n\nThroughout the decades, Disney experimented with mixed segments of live action and animation in several notable films, which are primarily considered live action. In \"The Three Caballeros\", released in 1945, features a scene where Donald Duck cavorts with several Latin-American dancers, plus Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen Miranda), who gives him a kiss. In 1946, \"Song of the South\" saw Uncle Remus sing \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" in an animated field, and tell the stories of Brer Rabbit through the animated sequences, with \"So Dear to My Heart\", released in 1949, improving upon this.\n\n1964's \"Mary Poppins\" is one of the best-known artistic films of this nature, with a minutes-long scene in which Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, as well as many other actors, travel to a land in which Van Dyke's character created. One of the best-known scenes was an improvised number in which Van Dyke's character dances around with penguin waiters, as Andrews watches happily. \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks,\" from 1971 features a live action and animated sequence in which Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson dance together in an underwater nightclub, while Tomlinson must bear the brunt of aggressive, anthropomorphic soccer-playing animals in the latter half.\n\nInspired by the 1974 Swedish film \"Dunderklumpen\" , Walt Disney Productions's \"Pete's Dragon\" from 1977 experimented with this and does the opposite of its predecessors, putting the animated dragon, Elliot, in a live-action setting. \n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988) by Disney and Amblin Entertainment broke new ground with its advanced special effects and \"realistic\" portrayal of the interaction of animated characters and live actors. Memorable moments include the piano duel between Donald Duck and his \"Looney Tunes\" rival Daffy Duck, Jessica Rabbit's entrance, Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse in the same scene, and Bob Hoskins handcuffed to the title character.\n\nFilmmaker and animator Ralph Bakshi combined live action and traditional animation in 1973's \"Heavy Traffic\", 1975's \"Coonskin,\" known in some places as \"Streetfight\" and 1992's \"Cool World,\" with \"Cool World\" being poorly received for its lack of story.\n\nWith the commercial and technological success of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and \"Space Jam\", a number of live-action/animated films followed, including \"Cool World\", and \"\" - though none of them have had any major commercial success equal to \"Roger Rabbit\" or \"Space Jam\".\n\nThe combination of live action and animation is very common in TV commercials and TV shows, especially those promoting products appealing to children.\n\nWith live action and traditional animated films, double-printing two negatives onto the same release print pre-digitally, while complex techniques used optical printers or aerial image animation cameras, which enabled more accurate positioning, and more realism into interaction of actors and fictional characters. Often, every frame of the live action film was traced by rotoscoping, so that the animator could add his drawing in the exact position. With the rise of computer animation, combining live action and animation became common.\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" prequels and \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, for example, include substantial amounts of animation, though this has not been critically recognized as such due to the realism of the animation. However, some critics like Roger Ebert do not consider these to be live-action/animated films, stating that \"in my mind, it isn't animation, unless it \"looks\" like animation.\"\n\n"}

Some of these onscreen pairs have become couples in real life.\n\nThe concept of love teams can be traced back to the early years of Philippine cinema in the 1920s. The tandem of Gregorio Fernandez and Mary Walter who starred in silent films in the country during the 1920s is considered as the precursor of the love team concept in Philippine cinema. Other pairings became prominent such as Rogelio dela Rosa and Carmen Rosales in the 1950s, Tirso Cruz III and Nora Aunor in the 1960s and the 1970s, Gabby Concepcion and Sharon Cuneta in the 1980s, Rico Yan and Claudine Barretto, Marvin Agustin and Jolina Magdangal in the 1990s, John Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo in the 2000s.\n\nIn the 21st century, love teams are also known by the portmanteaus of the couple's names. Becoming part of a love team in the Philippine entertainment industry can be a boost to the acting career of two people who are part of the pairing.\n\nThe two people in a love team often stars in television series and film with their characters where it is expected that their characters to be romantically attached to each other like in line with their public image as a romantic couple off-screen. There is some organized fan groups supporting love teams. However prospects of an actor or actress involved in a love team, especially the more popular pairings, to star with another actor or actress other than each other is limited.\n\nHardcore fans of love teams wishes for the pairing they support to become a \"real-life couple\". One example of this, is Gabby Concepcion and Sharon Cuneta, who eventually got married. However their marriage later got annulled.\n\nActress Solenn Heussaff after conversing with people she knows are involved in love teams, said that being in such a pairing is difficult. She remarked that the love teams may \"lose a sense of who they are\" by trying too hard to portray themselves as romantic couples both on-screen and in real life, which she says isn't good if its forced in the case of the latter. She also points out that love team fans may be limiting the career options of actors involved in a pairing \"knowingly or unknowingly\". Heussaff states if an actor or actress gets an assignment for a film or television series where they pair with an actor or actress other than each other as their love interest, \"someone get's attacked\". But she was quick to add that love teams could be beneficial and sometimes those involved in such pairing became romantic couples in reality and urged fans to respect the individuality of the actors and actresses.\n"}

On opening night at the outdoor Madison Square Garden Roof Theatre, millionaire playboy Harry K. Thaw shot and killed architect Stanford White: the otherwise undistinguished musical's run continued for some 60 performances largely on the publicity from this incident.\n\nDirected by Lionel Lawrence, \"Mamzelle Champagne\" was Maude Fulton’s Broadway debut. Viola de Costa, Eddie Fowler, Harry Short and Arthur Stanford were also in the cast. When the show was revived for four performances at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre in October 1906, the cast included May Yohe and Robert Emmett O'Connor.\n\nTheater critic and historian Burns Mantle cited a letter he received from Woolf saying “\"Mamzelle Champagne\" was my Columbia [University] Varsity Show, and was transported by a manager, Henry Pincus, to the open Madison Square Roof with a professional cast.” However, The Varsity Show’s own website disputes this “legend”, saying \"Mam’zelle\" was Woolf’s first professional show and not the one he had written as a student in the class of 1901.\n\nStanford White was known to have seduced Thaw's wife, showgirl Evelyn Nesbit. During the opening-night performance of \"Mam'zelle Champagne\", audience members noticed Thaw repeatedly glaring at White. Thaw eventually got up, crossed over to White's seat and shot him point-blank while the show onstage was in the midst of a number titled \"I Could Love a Million Girls\".

{"id": "153784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153784", "title": "Naginata", "text": "Naginata\n\nThe naginata (なぎなた, 薙刀) is one of several varieties of traditionally made Japanese blades in the form of a pole weapon. \"Naginata\" were originally used by the samurai class of feudal Japan, as well as by ashigaru (foot soldiers) and sōhei (warrior monks). The naginata is the iconic weapon of the onna-bugeisha-archetype, a type of female warrior belonging to the Japanese nobility.\n\nNaginata for fighting men and warrior monks were ō-naginata. The kind used by women was called ko-naginata. Since the \"naginata\" with its pole is heavier and much slower than the Japanese sword, the blade of the \"ko-naginata\" was smaller than the male warrior's \"ō-naginata\" in order to compensate for the lesser height and upper body strength of a woman than an armoured male samurai.\n\nA \"naginata\" consists of a wooden or metal pole with a curved single-edged blade on the end; it is similar to the Chinese guan dao or the European glaive. Similar to the katana, naginata often have a round handguard (\"tsuba\") between the blade and shaft, when mounted in a koshirae. The 30 cm to 60 cm long \"naginata\" blade is forged in the same manner as traditional Japanese swords. The blade has a long tang which is inserted in the .\n\nThe blade is removable and is secured by means of a wooden peg called that passes through a hole in both the tang and the shaft.\nThe shaft ranges from 120 cm to 240 cm in length and is oval shaped. The area of the shaft where the tang sits is the . The tachiuchi/tachiuke would be reinforced with metal rings , and/or metal sleeves and wrapped with cord . The end of the shaft has a heavy metal end cap . When not in use the blade would be covered with a .\n\nThe \"Naginata\" have descended from the earlier hoko yari. It's difficult to tell when the \"naginata\" itself first appeared. Though often claimed as being invented by the \"sōhei\" during the Nara period, physical evidence of their existence dates only from the mid-Kamakura period, and earlier literary sources are ambiguous. The earliest clear references to \"naginata\" date from 1146 in the late Heian period, with one suggesting that the weapon may have been recent. Earlier 10th through 12th century sources refer to \"long swords\" that while a common medieval term or orthography for \"naginata\", could also simply be referring to conventional swords; one source describes a \"naginata\" being drawn with the verb \"nuku\", commonly associated with swords, rather than \"hazusu\", the verb otherwise used in medieval texts for unsheathing \"naginata\".\n\nSome 11th and 12th century mentions of \"hoko\" may actually have been referring to \"naginata\". The commonly assumed association of the \"naginata\" and the \"sōhei\" is also unclear. Artwork from the late-13th and 14th centuries depict the \"sōhei\" with \"naginata\" but don't appear to place any special significance to it: the weapons appear as just part of a number of others carried by the monks, and are used by \"samurai\" and commoners as well. Depictions of \"naginata\"-armed \"sōhei\" in earlier periods were created centuries after the fact, and are likely using the \"naginata\" as a symbol to distinguish the \"sōhei\" from other warriors, rather than giving an accurate portrayal of the events.\n\nDuring the Genpei War (1180–1185), in which the Taira clan was pitted against the Minamoto clan, the \"naginata\" rose to a position of particularly high esteem, being regarded as an extremely effective weapon by warriors. Cavalry battles had become more important by this time, and the \"naginata\" proved excellent at dismounting cavalry and disabling riders. The widespread adoption of the \"naginata\" as a battlefield weapon forced the introduction of greaves as a part of Japanese armor. The rise of importance for the \"naginata\" can be seen as being mirrored by the European pike, another long pole weapon employed against cavalry. The introduction in 1543 of firearms in the form of the matchlock (\"tanegashima\") caused a great decrease in the appearance of the \"naginata\" on the battlefield. As battlefield tactics changed, the \"yari\" (spear) took the place of the \"naginata\" as the pole weapon of choice.\nDuring the Edo Period, as the \"naginata\" became less useful for men on the battlefield, it became a symbol of the social status of women. A functional \"naginata\" was often a traditional part of a \"samurai\" daughter's dowry. Although they did not typically fight as normal soldiers, women of the \"samurai\" class were expected to be capable of defending their homes while their husbands were away at war.\n\nThe \"naginata\" was considered one of the weapons most suitable for women, since it allows a woman to keep opponents at a distance, where any advantages in height, weight, and upper body strength would be lessened. An excellent example of the role of women in Japanese martial culture is Hangaku Gozen, who, famous for her \"naginata\" skills, led the garrison of 3,000 warriors stationed at Toeizakayama castle. Ten thousand Hōjō clan warriors were dispatched to take the castle, and Hangaku led her troops out of the castle, killing a significant number of the attackers before being overpowered. The \"naginata\" saw its final uses in combat in 1868, at Aizu, and in 1876, in Satsuma.\n\nDue to the influence of Westernization, after the Meiji Restoration the perceived value of martial arts, the \"naginata\" included, dropped severely. It was from this time that the focus of training became the strengthening of the will and the forging of the mind and body. During the Showa period, \"naginata\" training became a part of the public school system in 1912, and it \"remains a staple of girls’ physical education\"\n\nSince World War II, \"naginata\" has primarily been practiced as a sport with a particular emphasis on etiquette and discipline, rather than as military training.\n\nAlthough associated with considerably smaller numbers of practitioners, a number of \"koryu bujutsu\" systems (traditional martial arts) which include older and more combative forms of naginatajutsu remain existent, including Suio Ryu, Araki Ryu, Tendo Ryu, Jikishinkage ryu, Higo Koryu, Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu,Toda-ha Buko Ryu and Yoshin ryu, some of which have authorized representatives outside Japan.\n\nIn the USA, there are an estimated 200 practitioners.\n\nIn contemporary naginatajutsu, two types of practice naginata are in common use.\n\nThe \"naginata\" used in \"atarashi Naginata\", the \"shiai-yo\", has an oak shaft and a bamboo \"blade\" (\"habu\"). It is used for practice, forms competitions, and sparring. It is between 210 cm and 225 cm in length and must weigh over 650 grams. The \"blade\" is replaceable. They are often broken or damaged during sparring and can be quickly replaced, being attached to the shaft with tape.\n\nThe naginata used by \"koryū\" practitioners has an oak shaft and blade, carved from a single piece of wood, and may incorporate a disc-shaped guard (\"Tsuba\"). It is called a \"kihon-yo\".\n\nMany of the \"realistic naginata\" for sale to the public are not naginata at all. These imitations have shorter, rounded shafts, very short blades, and screw-together sections.\n\nNaginata can be used to batter, stab, or hook an opponent, but due to their relatively balanced center of mass, are often spun and turned to proscribe a large radius of reach. The curved blade provides a long cutting surface without increasing the overall length of the weapon.\n\nHistorically, the naginata was often used by foot soldiers to create space on the battlefield. They have several situational advantages over a sword. Their reach is longer, allowing the wielder to keep out of reach of his opponent. The weight of the weapon gave power to strikes and cuts, even though the weight of the weapon is usually thought of as a disadvantage. The weight at the end of the shaft (\"ishizuki\"), and the shaft itself (\"ebu\") can be used offensively and defensively.\n\nThe martial art of wielding the \"naginata\" is known as \"naginatajutsu\". Most \"naginata\" practice today is in a modernised form, a \"gendai budō\" called \"atarashii Naginata\" (\"new Naginata\"), which is organized into regional, national, and international federations, who hold competitions and award ranks. Use of the \"naginata\" is also taught within the \"Bujinkan\" and in some \"koryū\" schools such as Suio Ryu and Tendō-ryū.\n\n\"Naginata\" practitioners wear an \"uwagi\", \"obi\", and \"hakama\", similar to that worn by \"kendo\" practitioners, although the uwagi is generally white. For sparring, armor known as \"bōgu\" is worn. Bōgu for naginatajutsu adds shin guards (\"sune-ate\") and the gloves (\"kōte\") have a singulated index finger, unlike the mitten-style gloves used for \"kendo\".\n\n\n"}

The press conference includes both students from the elementary and secondary level and is usually held on the month of February. The event usually lasts for 4 to 7 days.\n\nThe journalism contest starts with the Division Schools Press Conference (DSPC), where the top three to seven in each category depending on the size of the certain region qualifies to the Regional Schools Press Conference (RSPC), and from which the top three will be chosen to represent their respective regions in the National Schools Press Conference (NSPC).\n\nIn November 1931, the Public Secondary Schools Press Association (PSSPA) had its first convention in what was then Pasig, Rizal. The PSSPA was founded by a high school principal, Ricardo Castro, and had 17 original member schools. During this first convention, writing competitions for the different sections of a school paper were held. The tradition continued year after year, as the number of member-schools increased, with different parts of Luzon as venues. After World War II, the PSSPA was reorganized and 49 member-schools participated in the National Convention held in Manila,Philippines.\n\nBy 1955, the PSSPA Convention had become the National Secondary Schools Press Conference. On January 10 and 11 of that year, 70 member-schools attended the conference at Bacolod City. The individual competitions were open to all members, while the group competitions were held according to category. Group A for the group competitions was composed of those member-schools with populations of 1,500 and above, while Group B was composed of those member-schools with populations below 1,500. At that same conference, the National Secondary Schools Press Advisers Association was organized and it then passed a resolution calling for the authorization of staff members to handle school paper funds, subject to accounting. The resolution was subsequently approved by the Bureau of Public Schools.\n\nIn 1957, a third group classification was added. Group A members were schools with over 3,000 population; Group B members had populations ranging from 1,500 to below 3,000; while Group C members had below 1,500 population. During this year, the conference was held for a longer time, enabling the delegates to take part in longer educational tours of the host locality. A year later, the group classifications were again reorganized, placing schools with over 2,000 population in Group A, those with 1,000 to 2,000 population in Group B, and those with less than 1,000 in Group C. During this year, a Public School Circular was passed authorizing the solicitations of advertisements for school papers, under certain conditions.\n\nIn 1991, Republic Act No. 7079 was passed by Congress, aiming to promote campus journalism. The 50th National Secondary Schools Press Conference was held in early 1993 at Rizal High School in Pasig, the same locality that hosted the first PSSPA Convention. The next school year, 1993-1994, elementary schools were included in the convention, causing the word \"secondary\" to be dropped and the convention to be called the \"National Schools Press Conference\".\n\nIn December 1993, the National Schools Press Conference was to be held in Koronadal, South Cotabato for the first time. However, a week before the convention, when all preparations had been made and the host schools and municipalities were awaiting the arrival of the delegates, there was a bombing incident at Isulan, Sultan Kudarat. The Secretary of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports at that time, Armand Fabella, declared this sufficient grounds to move the convention to Baguio City, prompting a storm of protest from then South Cotabato Governor Hilario de Pedro III, who had been one of the sponsors of the Campus Journalism Act when he was Representative of the 2nd District of South Cotabato, and then Representative Daisy Avance-Fuentes. This controversy caused the Southern Mindanao delegation to boycott the Baguio conference. Shortly afterwards, Ricardo Gloria replaced Fabella as Education Secretary, and in December 1994 the 52nd National Schools Press Conference was held at Koronadal National Comprehensive High School. In its 65th year, the annual NSPC was held at Koronadal City in South Cotabato.\n\nThe NSPC has been held in different locations across the country. The NSPC is scheduled annually in the middle of the month of March. Recently under \"DepEd Order 26 s. 2010,\" it was moved to the second week of April synchronizing all the culminating activities in all competitions as \"Festival of Talents\". Following is a list of past venues of the NSPC:\n\nStudents who will compete in the National Schools Press Conference attend seminars before the actual competition. Preparation for the NSPC starts at the Division Level with the Division Schools Press Conference (DSPC). The editorial members of campus papers in a division compete in English or Filipino in different categories. The top ten or top five, depending on the region, who will win for each category in each language medium are then qualified for the Regional Schools Press Conference (RSPC). The next two winners are considered alternate qualifiers. Next, the top three winners of the RSPC will advance into the National Level, again with the next top two as alternates. \n\nOn October 6, 1999, however, Education Secretary Andrew Gonzales issued \"DECS Memorandum No. 437, Series of 1999\", which stated that a contestant could participate in only two events and in only one medium provided that the two events did not conflict with each other. This was amended in 2002 with the issuance of \"DepEd Memorandum No. 4, Series of 2002\", on January 11, 2002, by Education Secretary Raul Roco. DM No. 4 provided that a pupil or student could participate in a maximum of four events but in only one medium, and that there should be seven winners for every category from every region.\n\nThe News Reporting and Desktop Publishing categories were first introduced in 2003, with a demonstration having been held at the previous year's NSPC. The DepEd memorandum for this same year states that a student may opt to participate in as many categories as he is able within the same medium provided there are no conflicts in the schedule.\n\nThe 2012 National Schools Press Conference had a focus on digital literacy and its use in campus journalism, with a collaborative publishing contest launched, involving teams of seven students making a four-page tabloid using Microsoft Publisher and Adobe InDesign.\n\nStarting on the 2016 National Schools Press Conference, a new group contest was added, the Television Broadcasting and Script Writing, wherein like its radio counterpart the participating students stimulated a live TV newscast from anchoring to production. It started as an exhibitional contest this year and will start as a formal group contest in 2017.\n\n"}

On Acting<br>\nEpilogue: A Letter to a Young Actress\n\nList of Performances<br>\nIndex\n\n[From the essay 'On Acting':]\n\nI have been acting all my adult life - and before. It has stood by me and I have stood by it. It has given me much joy and some sorrow. It has taken me to places that otherwise I would not have seen. It has given me the world and great happiness. It has brought me friends and good companionship, camaraderie and brotherliness. It has thought me self-discipline and given me the retentive eye of an observer. It has enabled me love my fellow men. It has clothed me, watered me, fed me, kept me away from a bowler and a nine-till-five desk. It has given me cars, houses and holidays, bright days and cloudy ones. It has introduced me to kings and queens, presidents and princes. It has no barriers; it has no class. Whatever your background, if it decides to embrace and take you to its heart, it will hurl you up there amongst the gods. It will change your wooden clogs overnight and replace them with glass slippers.\n\nOnce you have been to the tree and tasted the fruits, some sour, some sweet, you will never be able to leave it alone again. It will get under your nails and into your pores, it will mix with your blood, and nothing will ever take it away from you. It has its ups and downs, twists and turns, great fortune and bad luck. It has its own superstitions and its own language. It has its 'in' crowds and 'out' crowds, its jealousies and its loves. It can destroy you in all sorts of canny ways with drink, drugs, success or failure. It can change charming personalities into monsters, and big egos into even bigger ones. It can make you believe your own publicity. It can make you sit on your behind and feed on past glories. It can leave you in a pile of yesterday's press cuttings and laugh at you as you wonder what happened to your real self. It is selective and very surprising. It can make you give me everything else. It will blinker you to personal relationships and destroy marriages and families. It can turn even twins against each other. It can rape you, bugger you, bless you and succour you. Its moods change with the wind. Once you have made your decision, if you believe enough, there is positively no turning back. Above all, you must remain always open and fresh and alive to any new ideas\n\nYou must be prepared to sacrifice in order to succeed. You must set your goals high and go for them with the pugnacity of a terrier. But remember, to fall into dissipation is easy, for it is a glamorous profession, full of glorious temptations. Place a foot on the first rung and the serpents will appear beckoning with their silky tails, flattering you and begging you to bite the apple.\n\nSo many talents, good, raw and rich ones, have been battered against the walls of dissipation and left to drown. The sycophant serpents are everywhere. Because as a profession it generates glamour, the acolytes queue up to stare at, touch or, if possible entertain something that they can never be. Their admiration is genuine, but beware, actor, beware. Beware of the Greeks.\n\nAbove all, do not despair when the hand of criticism plunges into your body and claws at your soul: you must take it, accept it and smile. It is your life and your choice. And beware, look to the opposite. Do not float toward the heavens when the same patronising person places a hand on the crown of your head and breathes compliments into your vulnerable ear. Everything can change tomorrow. I suppose critics are a grim necessity. There are good ones and bad ones, and ones who simply masquerade as critics but are merely purveyors of columns of gossip, tittle-tattle signifying nothing. Poor creatures who are pushed by their pens rather than by their intellect. The good ones are essayists and of immense value to our work.\n\nI know that, if we are foolish enough to parade ourselves between spotlight and reality, we must be prepared to receive the attention of the pen, but let me plead for thought, care and sincerity, not for mere showmanship.\n\nI can no longer work in the theatre, but the thrill will never leave me. The lights and the combat. The intimacy between the audience and me during the soliloquies in Hamlet and Richard III - we were like lovers.\n\n[From Part Two:]\n\n[On \"Antony and Cleopatra\":]<br>\nIt was a purely physical relationship. Two very attractive human beings determined to do wonderful things to each other. Result... suicide. There is nothing cerebral about their love: it is pure passion, lust and enjoyment. And why not? How would you feel alone in a chamber with that lady? I don't think you'd want to discuss The Times crossword.\n\n[On Antony:]<br>\nIt's a wonderful part. But just remember, all you future Antonys, one little word of advice: Cleopatra's got you firmly by the balls.\n\n[Why Othello is such a difficult part:]<br>\nI had this fantasy, and I like to think it's probably very near the truth, that Shakespeare and Burbage went out on a binge one night, each trying to outdrink the other, the yards of ale slipping down their throats and thickening their tongues. Just before one or other slid under the alehouse table, Burbage looked at Shakespeare and said, 'I can play anything you write - anything at all'. And Shakespeare said, 'Right, I'll fix you, boy', and wrote Othello for him. I'm sure something like that must have happened.\n\n[From various other parts:]\n\nWhen I wanted a Mississippi accent for \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", I couldn't find a single soul at the American Embassy in London who could cough me up one. The nearest was a nineteen-years-old girl from Tennessee. [...] Maureen Stapleton and the director kept saying I was fine but I wondered whether it was Mississippi enough.\n"}

{"id": "25200450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25200450", "title": "Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask", "text": "Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\n\nProfessor Layton and the Miracle Mask is a puzzle adventure video game developed by Level-5. It is the fifth game in the \"Professor Layton\" series, the second in the prequel trilogy of games, and the first in the series to be developed for the Nintendo 3DS. \"Miracle Mask\" was released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in February 2011, becoming the best-selling game on the day of the system's launch. The game was later released worldwide in October 2012. \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask Plus\", an enhanced edition featuring new puzzles and added cutscenes, was released on the Nintendo eShop in Japan in February 2013.\n\nLike previous games in the series, \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\" is a puzzle adventure game split across various chapters. Players explore areas and converse with characters to help solve the mysteries that lay before them. At various points in the game, the player will encounter puzzles that need to be solved. Solving these puzzles earn Picarats, used for accessing bonus content, with more Picarats earned for solving the puzzle without any mistakes. Hint coins can also be found which can be spent to unlock hints to help players solve a puzzle if they get stuck.\n\nThere are various changes made during the transition to the Nintendo 3DS, as characters and environments are now presented in 3D graphics. Unlike the previous games, in which players interacted directly with the environment on the touch screen, players now use the touch screen to control a magnifying glass to navigate the environment displayed on the top screen. When the magnifying glass is hovered over something of interest, the player can tap the touch screen to inspect it, initiating conversation with characters or revealing a hint coin or puzzle. Certain areas can be zoomed in to reveal more areas to interact with. Puzzles are still controlled on the touch screen, though many have 3D graphics displayed on the top screen and a few also utilise the 3DS' gyroscope feature. Players are given the option to have reminders of the puzzle description temporarily appear on the bottom screen, or stick it to the top.\n\nLike the previous games before it, \"Miracle Mask\" has a set of unique minigames that are expanded upon as the player solves puzzles. 'Toy Robot' tasks the player with navigating a maze in order to reach a goal panel whilst avoiding enemies. 'One-Stop Shop' requires players to arrange items on a shelf based on their type and color in order to entice customers to buy everything on display. 'Rabbit Show' sees Luke taking care of a rabbit and training it to perform in the circus. As Luke converses and trains the rabbit, it learns new actions that must be used accordingly to follow a script in a play. In addition, there is a horse-riding minigame which sees players riding a horse, dodging barrels and collecting carrots to speed up. Midway through the game, there is a top-down adventure portion which sees a young Layton navigating an underground ruin. During this segment, Layton must solve puzzles such as pushing boulders and avoiding mummies, also digging up certain areas to reveal hint coins and hidden puzzles.\n\nAlong with the 150 puzzles found in the main game, players are also capable of connecting to Nintendo Network in order to download additional puzzles. These puzzles are made available weekly for a year following release, with seven puzzles made available each week; in all, 365 puzzles can be downloaded. Puzzle packages are downloaded automatically via the Spotpass function of the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nEighteen years prior to the story, a young Hershel Layton, who had little interest in archaeology, started to become interested thanks to his friend, Randall Ascot, who is passionate and devoted to the subject. Randall had been investigating an ancient artifact called the Mask of Chaos, which he believes comes from an ancient civilization known as the Azrans. Randall had found the mask after deciphering a code left by the Azrans, which eventually led to the Mask of Chaos. Researching into the mask, Randall tells Layton that he wants to take him on an expedition to the ancient ruins of Akbadain to search for a hidden treasure. Angela, Randall's girlfriend, is distressed by the news, as her brother died during such an expedition some years before, but Randall promises her that they'll be okay. During the expedition however, a sudden trap causes Randall to fall to his death, and Layton is left to continue the expedition alone. Although he finds a large pile of gold, the treasure they had looked for, he decides to not tell anyone of it in memory of Randall. However, Randall's butler and surrogate brother, Henry, is so distraught at having lost his best friend, and Angela the love of her life, that he spends his entire family fortune in searching for Randall, coming across both the treasure and the mask inadvertently but not finding Randall.\n\nEighteen years later, following the events of \"Last Specter\" and \"Eternal Diva\", Layton is contacted by his old friend, Angela Ledore. Since Randall's death, Angela had married Henry after her parents pressured her to marry someone. Henry and Angela had worked together, and had turned an arid desert into a thriving city in the space of eighteen years. Henry attributes his success of the city of Monte d'Or to the Mask of Chaos, which he has named as the city's symbol. However, within the last month the Mask had been stolen from Henry's office and a mysterious figure calling himself the Masked Gentleman, wearing the Mask of Chaos, has started performing various 'miracles' across Monte d'Or such as making paintings come alive and turning people into horses. Layton, Luke and Emmy all set off to Monte d'Or to investigate, and are almost immediately faced by the Masked Gentleman, who proceeds to turn a crowd of citizens into stone and creates panic in the crowd. As Layton and his friends investigates, he finds that these supposed miracles are mere tricks designed to target someone. Layton is helped by the city's police chief, Sheffield, and Scotland Yard investigators Bloom and Grosky, who all help in the investigation. After the masked gentleman appears for his fifth miracle, where he causes members of a crowd to levitate into the air and disappear, Layton's friend Dalston is arrested. Dalston is the owner of a hotel chain that rivals Henry Ledore's hotels, and the police suspect him of attempting to frame Henry. An enraged Dalston states that Angela is the Masked Gentleman, who wishes to get revenge on Henry for leaving Randall to die.\n\nThe next day, Layton and his friends witness another miracle, in which an entire fairground seemingly vanishes and reappears again within a few minutes. The police then realize that Dalston cannot be the Masked Gentleman and duly release him. Layton then begins to suspect Angela and Henry of hiding something from him due to their suspicious behaviour. Furthermore, the team are pressed to search for the Mask of Order, another Azran treasure which is said to counteract the Mask of Chaos' power, thus rendering the Masked Gentleman useless.\n\nThe next night, Layton and his company arrive at the Reunion Inn, the establishment that is said to have provided Monte d'Or with enough money to become a city. While in the Inn, the team follow a series of mysterious clues left by the Masked Gentleman which slowly reveal his identity. Furthermore, Detective Bloom is revealed to be a traitor (albeit not to Layton, Luke or Emmy) who is working for a man named Bronev, a shadowy figure that is eager to find lost Azran ruins. Layton eventually confronts the Masked Gentleman, who is revealed to be Randall. After he fell into the chasm eighteen years ago, he survived the fall by being caught in a river. However, the fall erased most of his memory, and he was cared for by a local village who he helped. Years later, he received an anonymous letter stating that he had been betrayed by a friend called Henry Ledore, who had stolen his fortune and his girlfriend Angela. Enraged, Randall agreed to work with this man to get revenge on Henry, stealing the Mask of Chaos and wreaking havoc in the city that Henry had built using Randall's money. After showing himself, Randall starts to destroy the city by flooding it with sand. However, Layton reveals that the Mask of Order is in fact two masks put together- the Masks of Order and Chaos, which he uses to unlock an underground cavern. Then, Layton and Angela solve an Azran puzzle that reveals the hidden Azran vault, lifting the town upwards to safety in the process. Randall is then overcome with shame as he realizes he has been used- Henry had not stolen Angela from Randall, but had actually organized a fake marriage with her so that they could wait for Randall's return. Furthermore, Henry had used the Akbadain treasure to send search parties for Randall and created the Reunion Inn for the countless explorers wishing to find Randall for the reward offered. The city of Monte d'Or was created because of the immeasurable success of the Reunion Inn.\n\nHowever, Layton reveals that his suspicions of Angela were not false- shortly after Layton's arrival she had been kidnapped and replaced. Angela then takes off her disguise and reveals she is in fact Jean Descole (Layton's rival). Descole had intended for Layton to find the Azran vault beneath Monte d'Or for his own, unsaid gains. Descole flees, but Randall is comforted by his friends who welcome him back. As Randall finally returns home to his friends and family, Layton and company set off on their next adventure, Descole arrives at a new mysterious pit decorated with Azran markings- the vault he had wanted all along. Despite this he is immediately confronted by Bronev and his organization Targent who attempt to capture Descole. Descole is able to flee from capture, but Bronev's men secure the vault. He then states that this, along with The Gardens of Healing from Misthallery (which Layton found in the Last Specter), The City of Harmony from Ambrosia (which Layton found in the Eternal Diva) and The Nautilus Chamber of Akbadain from Monte d'Or, would combine to form the three Azran legacies, which he plans to use for his own gains.\n\n\"Miracle Mask\" was overseen by Akihiro Hino, the CEO of Level-5, and directed by Jun Suzuki. The game's puzzles were created by Akira Tago, author of the series of puzzle books, who had also created the puzzles for the previous games in the series.\n\nThe game was first announced as a Nintendo DS title at the official launch event for \"Professor Layton and the Last Specter\", where it was scheduled for Japanese release during Q3 2010. Hino promised that \"Miracle Mask\" would bring major changes to the series' gameplay systems, and said that the trilogy was imagined with a second movie to take place after \"Miracle Mask\". Although artwork, a logo, and the setting of the game's story were given, the game was not demonstrated at the event.\n\nAfter seeing the Nintendo 3DS, Hino systematically shifted projects from other systems to it, in hopes that Level-5 would be recognized as a firm part of the image of the Nintendo 3DS system. \"Miracle Mask\" was one of these projects. Though the game was originally built in 2D, it was made to look \"pseudo-3D\" for Nintendo's E3 2010 presentation. After seeing what other publishers had produced for the system, however, Hino decided to completely remake the game in order to use the systems's unique qualities. He expressed his belief that the game would be the \"best in the series so far\", and that the game felt like \"something completely new, something no one's ever seen before\".\n\nAt a Nintendo press event later in 2010, the first trailer for \"Miracle Mask\", originally under the name \"The Mask of Miracle\", was released along with screenshots, demonstrating the graphical and gameplay overhauls that had taken place over the system's switch to Nintendo 3DS; the previous games' hand-drawn 2D sprites had been replaced by 3D models, areas of the game could now be examined in a 3D perspective, and several puzzles took advantage of the 3DS' features, including its motion sensor. Despite the game's new visual style, the appearance of the series' animated cutscenes remained intact, albeit rendered in 3D. Another trailer was released at Level-5's 2010 \"Vision\" event, revealing the Japanese voice actors, the game's ending theme, the plans for the game's puzzle downloading service, and the game's second timeline, following a younger Professor Layton in high school.\n\n\"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\" was first released in 2011 as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS within Japan. It sold 117,000 copies in its first weekend, making it the system's best-selling title upon its release. Ultimately, the title would be outsold by other Nintendo 3DS games, such as \"Super Mario 3D Land\" and \"Mario Kart 7\", to become the sixth best-selling Nintendo 3DS game in the region during 2012 at 360,000 copies. It was also the second best-selling third party title for the system, behind \"Monster Hunter Tri G\", and the twenty-sixth best-selling game of the year overall.\n\nA tentative English title for the game, \"Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle\", was provided along with an early demo at E3 2010; however, no other information was provided about its international release. In late 2011, a European trailer for \"Professor Layton and the Spectre's Call\" alluded to a fifth entry in the series being released for Nintendo 3DS in 2012; this was later confirmed in a press release, where the game received its second tentative title of \"Professor Layton 5\".\n\nIn May 2012, a trademark titled Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask (its final title) was filed by Level 5, hinting at an eventual U.S. release. Despite this, no announcements were made at E3 2012. The game was later released in Europe on October 26, 2012, in Australia on October 27, and in North America on October 28.\n\nAn updated version of the game titled \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask Plus\" was released for the Nintendo eShop in Japan in early 2013. It added new features to the original game, including more cutscenes, three save slots, and additional puzzles. It includes bonus tutorials and hints for younger players as well as all the downloadable content from the original.\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Tomohito Nishiura. Unlike the other titles in the series, no official soundtrack has been released for \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\".\n\nThe game's ending theme, entitled \"Mysterious Flower\", was composed by Yumi Matsutoya. Her 2011 album \"Road Show\" features a music video for the song animated in the style of \"Professor Layton\", adding her into cutscenes from the game.\n\nIn Japan, the game got a score of 32 out of 40 in \"Famitsu\", who praised the game's investigation mechanics but said that the puzzles did not make enough use of 3D. IGN said that the Japanese version was \"perfect for a portable system\" and said that its puzzles remained surprising and well-designed despite being the fifth entry in the series; however, they expressed disappointment at the long wait for the game's localization. Andriasang stated that, despite the changes made to it, the Japanese version still feels like a Professor Layton game.\n\nElsewhere, the game received \"favorable\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Common Sense Media gave it all five stars, saying, \"Returning fans will recognize the style of many of the game's puzzles. Some force you to carefully analyze images, others are tricky riddles, and still others involve clever application of basic math skills -- but each one is different enough from the last that boredom never sets in. Add in yet another engaging story filled with quirky personalities and several seemingly unsolvable grand mysteries, and you have a recipe for a very memorable \"Professor Layton\" adventure.\" \"National Post\" gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying that it \"entertains without violence or scares, it provides a healthy workout for your brain, and it's suitable for most ages and both genders. It will provide hours of entertainment for your son, your daughter, you, and your significant other (you'll need to take turns playing, but that's what multiple save files are for). Suffice to say we think Santa couldn't have chosen a better stocking stuffer for clever kids (or their parents).\" Digital Spy gave it four stars out of five, saying, \"Its fascinating story and well-balanced array of puzzles means \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\" is probably the best outing in the series since the ground-breaking original, and the new approach to visuals once again reminds you of the system's now forgotten selling point: its terrific 3D screen.\"\n"}
{"id": "43488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43488", "title": "Rave", "text": "Rave\n\nA rave (from the verb: \"to rave\") is an organised dance party at a nightclub, outdoor festival, warehouse, or other private property typically featuring performances by DJs, playing a seamless flow of electronic dance music. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs and digital audio from a wide range of genres, including techno, hardcore, house, drum & bass, dubstep, and post-industrial. Occasionally live performers have been known to perform, in addition to other types of performance artists such as go-go dancers and fire dancers. The music is amplified with a large, powerful sound reinforcement system, typically with large subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound. The music is often accompanied by laser light shows, projected coloured images, visual effects and fog machines.\n\nWhile some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes, some raves have grown to immense size, such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas (e.g., the Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992). Some electronic dance music festivals have features of raves, but on a larger, often commercial scale. Raves may last for a long time, with some events continuing for twenty-four hours, and lasting all through the night. Law enforcement raids and anti-rave laws have presented a challenge to the rave scene in many countries. This is due to the association of illegal drugs such as MDMA (often referred to as a \"club drug\" or \"party drug\" along with MDA), LSD, GHB, ketamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis. In addition to drugs, raves often make use of non-authorized, secret venues, such as squat parties at unoccupied homes, unused warehouses, or aircraft hangars. These concerns are often attributed to a type of moral panic surrounding rave culture.\n\nIn the late 1950s in London, England the term \"rave\" was used to describe the \"wild bohemian parties\" of the Soho beatnik set. Jazz musician Mick Mulligan, known for indulging in such excesses, had the nickname \"king of the ravers\". In 1958, Buddy Holly recorded the hit \"Rave On,\" citing the madness and frenzy of a feeling and the desire for it never to end. The word \"rave\" was later used in the burgeoning mod youth culture of the early 1960s as the way to describe any wild party in general. People who were gregarious party animals were described as \"ravers\". Pop musicians such as Steve Marriott of The Small Faces and Keith Moon of The Who were self-described \"ravers\".\nPresaging the word's subsequent 1980s association with electronic music, the word \"rave\" was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelia bands (most notably The Yardbirds, who released an album in the US called \"Having a Rave Up\"). Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general, the \"rave-up\" referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster, more heavily and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback. It was later part of the title of an electronic music performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London's Roundhouse titled the \"Million Volt Light and Sound Rave\". The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by Paul McCartney of The Beatles – the legendary \"Carnival of Light\" recording.\n\nWith the rapid change of British pop culture from the mod era of 1963–1966 to the hippie era of 1967 and beyond, the term fell out of popular usage. During the 1970s and early 1980s until its resurrection, the term was not in vogue, one notable exception being in the lyrics of the song \"Drive-In Saturday\" by David Bowie (from his 1973 album \"Aladdin Sane\") which includes the line, \"It's a crash course for the ravers.\" Its use during that era would have been perceived as a quaint or ironic use of bygone slang: part of the dated 1960s lexicon along with words such as \"groovy\".\n\nThe perception of the word \"rave\" changed again in the late 1980s when the term was revived and adopted by a new youth culture, possibly inspired by the use of the term in Jamaica.\n\nIn the mid to late 1980s, a wave of psychedelic and other electronic dance music, most notably acid house music, emerged from acid house music parties in the mid-to-late 1980s in the Chicago area in the United States. After Chicago acid house artists began experiencing overseas success, acid house quickly spread and caught on in the United Kingdom within clubs, warehouses and free-parties, first in Manchester in the mid-1980s and then later in London. In the late 1980s, the word \"rave\" was adopted to describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement. Activities were related to the party atmosphere of Ibiza, a Mediterranean island in Spain, frequented by British, Italian, Greek, Irish and German youth on vacation, who would hold raves and dance parties.\n\nBy the 1990s, genres such as acid, breakbeat hardcore, hardcore, happy hardcore, gabber, post-industrial and electronica were all being featured at raves, both large and small. There were mainstream events which attracted thousands of people (up to 25,000 instead of the 4,000 that came to earlier warehouse parties). Acid house music parties were first re-branded \"rave parties\" in the media, during the summer of 1989 by Genesis P-Orridge (Neil Andrew Megson) during a television interview; however, the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s. In 1990, raves were held \"underground\" in several cities, such as Berlin, Milan and Patras, in basements, warehouses and forests.\n\nBritish politicians responded with hostility to the emerging rave party trend. Politicians spoke out against raves and began to fine promoters who held unauthorized parties. Police crackdowns on these often unauthorized parties drove the rave scene into the countryside. The word \"rave\" somehow caught on in the UK to describe common semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations linked by the brand new M25 London orbital motorway that ringed London and the Home Counties. (It was this that gave the band Orbital their name.) These ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in London, to fields and country clubs in the countryside.\n\nPrior to the commercialization of the rave scene, when large legal venues became the norm for these events, the location of the rave was kept secret until the night of the event, usually being communicated through answering machine messages, mobile messaging, secret flyers, and websites. This level of secrecy, necessary for avoiding any interference by the police, on account of the illicit drug use, enabled the ravers to use locations they could stay in for ten hours at a time. It promoted the sense of deviance and removal from social control. In the 2000s, this level of secrecy still exists in the underground rave scene. However \"after-hours\" clubs, as well as large outdoor events, create a similar type of alternate atmosphere, but focus much more on vibrant visual effects, such as props and décor. In more recent years, large commercial events are held at the same locations year after year with similar reoccurring themes every year. Events like Electric Daisy Carnival and Tomorrowland are typically held at the same venue that holds mass numbers of people.\n\nSome raves make use of pagan symbolism. Modern raving venues attempt to immerse the raver in a fantasy-like world. Indigenous imagery and spirituality can be characteristic in the Raving ethos. In both the New Moon and Gateway collectives, \"pagan altars are set up, sacred images from primitive cultures decorate the walls, and rituals of cleansing are performed over the turntables and the dance floor\" This type of spatial strategy is an integral part of the raving experience because it sets the initial \"vibe\" in which the ravers will immerse themselves. This said \"vibe\" is a concept in the raver ethos that represents the allure and receptiveness of an environment's portrayed and or innate energy. The landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave, much like it is in pagan rituals. For example, The Numic Ghost Dancers rituals were held on specific geographical sites, considered to hold powerful natural flows of energy. These sites were later represented in the rhythmic dances, in order to achieve a greater level of connectivity.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of venues associated with the rave subculture:\nA sense of participation in a group event is among the chief appeals of rave music and dancing to pulsating beats is its immediate outlet. Raving in itself is a syllabus-free dance, whereby the movements are not predefined and the dance is performed randomly, dancers take immediate inspiration from the music, their mood and watching other people dancing. Thus, the electronic, rave and club dances refer to the street dance styles that evolved alongside electronic music culture. Such dances are street dances since they evolved alongside the underground rave and club movements, without the intervention of dance studios. These dances were originated in some 'scenes' around the world, becoming known only to ravers or clubgoers who attempt to these locations. They were originated at some point that certain moves had begun to be performed to several people at those places, creating a completely freestyle, yet still highly complex set of moves, adaptable to every dancer change and dance whatever they want based on these moves. Many rave dancing techniques suggest using your body as an extension of the music, to loosen up, and let the music flow through the body to create a unique form of movement.\n\nA common feature shared by all these dances, alongside with being originated at clubs, raves and music festivals around the world and in different years, is that when YouTube and other social media started to become popular (around 2006), these dances began to be popularized by videos of raves performing them, recording and uploading their videos. Therefore, they began to be practiced outside their places of origin, creating different 'scenes' in several countries. Furthermore, some of these dances began to evolve, and these dance 'scenes' are not totally related to the club/rave scenes they were originated. Also, the way of teaching and learning them have changed. In the past, if someone wanted to learn one of these dances, the person had to go to a club/rave, watch people dancing and try to copy them. Now, with social media, these dances are mostly taught on video tutorials and the culture spreads and grows inside those social media, like Flogger on Fotolog, Rebolation, Sensualize and Free Step on Orkut and Cutting Shapes on Instagram.\n\nDue the lack of studies dedicated to those dances, combined with poor and inaccurate information of them available on the Internet, it is hard to find reliable information.\n\nThe loose, casual and sports clothing was originally adopted by the acid house set earlier on in Ibiza, utilizing easy-to-dance-in attire from hip hop and football/soccer culture. As well as clothing there developed a range of accessories carried by many ravers including: Vicks VapoRub, which ravers find pleasant under the influence of MDMA, pacifiers to satiate the need to grind one's teeth (bruxism) caused by taking MDMA, and glow sticks which adjunct the mild psychedelia of MDMA's effect.\n\nIn the United States and other countries, rave fashion is characterized by colorful clothing and accessories, most notably \"kandi\" jewellery, that fluoresce under ultraviolet light. They contain words or phrases that are unique to the raver and they can choose to trade with each other using \"PLUR\" (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect). In European countries, this kandi culture is much less common. Most raves are illegal and take place outside or in poorly heated warehouses, so keeping warm is a priority. Dreadlocks, dyed hair and mohawks are popular, as are tattoos and piercings. Clothing is vibrant and alternative, often taking inspiration from new-age punk and grunge style. However, there is no set dress code for the illegal rave scene. Some global rave events such as Sensation adopted a strict minimalistic dress policy, either all white or black attire.\n\nSince rave culture has seen such an explosion in the US since 2010 as the rave scene is no longer illegal or underground, raves in the US are now so popular that there are many brands, retailers, and websites selling apparel, costumes, and accessories just for those who go to dress up at raves. This style of attire, along with the entire rave culture, is now spilling out into the mainstream, especially in the US. Sometimes called \"rave fashion\" or \"festival fashion,\" it now includes all kinds of accessories to create unique looks depending on the person and event.\n\nSome ravers participate in one of four light-oriented dances, called \"glowsticking\", \"glowstringing\", \"gloving\", and \"lightshows\". Of the four types of light-orientated dances, gloving in particular has evolved beyond and outside of the rave culture. Other types of light-related dancing include LED lights, flash-lights and blinking strobe lights. LEDs come in various colours with different settings.\nGloving has evolved into a separate dance form that has grown exponentially in the last couple of years. Since then the culture has extended to all ages, ranging from kids in their early teens to college students and more. The traditional Rav'n lights are limited now, but many stores have developed newer, brighter, and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colors and modes—modes include solid, stribbon, strobe, dops, hyper flash, and other variations.\n\nAmong the various elements of 1970s disco subculture that ravers drew on, in addition to basing their scene around dance music mixed by DJs, ravers also inherited the positive attitude towards using club drugs to \"enhanc[e]...the sensory experience\" of dancing to loud music. However, disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs. Whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred cocaine and the depressant/sedative Quaaludes, ravers preferred MDMA, 2C-B, amphetamine, morphine and other pills. According to the FBI, raves are one of the most popular venues where club drugs are distributed, and as such feature a prominent drug subculture. Club drugs include MDMA (more commonly known as \"ecstasy\", \"E\" or \"molly\"), 2C-B (more commonly known as \"nexus\"), amphetamine (commonly referred to as \"speed\"), morphine (commonly known as \"morphy\" or \"M\" ), GHB (commonly referred to as \"fantasy\" or \"liquid E\"), cocaine (common short name for \"coke\"), DMT and LSD (commonly referred to as \"lucy\" or \"acid\").\n\n\"Poppers\" is the street name for alkyl nitrites (the most well-known being amyl nitrite), which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects, notably the \"rush\" or \"high\" they can provide. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname \"poppers.\" The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, synthetic phenethylamines such as 2C-I, 2C-B and DOB have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with MDMA). By late 2012, derivates of the psychedelic 2C-X drugs, the NBOMes and especially 25I-NBOMe, had become common at raves in Europe. In the U.S., some law enforcement agencies have branded the subculture as a drug-centric culture, as rave attendees have been known to use drugs such as cannabis, 2CB, and DMT.\n\nGroups that have addressed alleged drug use at raves e.g. the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund (EM:DEF), The Toronto Raver Info Project (Canada), DanceSafe (USA and Canada), and Eve & Rave (Germany and Switzerland), all of which advocate harm reduction approaches. In 2005, Antonio Maria Costa, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, advocated drug testing on highways as a countermeasure against drug use at raves.\nMuch of the controversy, moral panic and law enforcement attention directed at rave culture and its association with drug use may be due to reports of drug overdoses (particularly MDMA) at raves, concerts and festivals.\n\nIn 2001 Calgary, Alberta became the first major municipality in Canada to pass a bylaw with respect to raves. The intent of the bylaw was to ensure that raves would be safe for participants, and also not unduly disruptive to adjacent neighbourhoods. The bylaw was created in consultation with representatives from the municipality, the province of Alberta, and the rave community.\n\nBy 1988, acid house was making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany and Central Europe as it had in England. In 1989 German DJs Westbam and Dr. Motte established the Ufo Club, an illegal party venue, and co-founded the Love Parade. On 9 November 1989 the Berlin Wall fell, free underground Techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin, and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established. East German DJ Paul van Dyk has remarked that the Techno-based rave scene was a major force in re-establishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period. In urbanized Germany raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations, factories, the canalization or former military properties of the cold war.\n\nIn 1991 a number of party venues closed, including Ufo, and the Berlin Techno scene centred itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: the E-Werk, the Bunker and the now legendary Tresor. In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid-infused techno began transmuting into hardcore. This emerging sound was influenced by Dutch gabber and Belgian hardcore. Other influences on the development of this style were European Electronic Body Music groups of the mid-1980s such as DAF, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb.\n\nAcross Europe, rave culture was becoming part of a new youth movement. DJs and electronic-music producers such as Westbam proclaimed the existence of a \"raving society\" and promoted electronic music as legitimate competition for rock and roll. Indeed, electronic dance music and rave subculture became mass movements. Since the mid 1990s, raves had tens of thousands of attendees, youth magazines featured styling tips, and television networks launched music magazines on House and Techno music. The annual Love Parade festivals in Berlin and later the Metropolitan Ruhr area repeatedly attracted more than one million party-goers between 1997 and 2010. Dozens of other annual technoparades took place in Germany and Central Europe at that time, the largest ones being Union Move, Generation Move, Reincarnation and Vision Parade as well as Street Parade and Lake Parade in Switzerland. Large commercial raves since the nineties include Mayday, Nature One, Time Warp, SonneMondSterne and Melt!. Beyond Berlin, further centers of the techno and rave scene of the 1990s and 2000s in Germany were Frankfurt (famous clubs were \"Omen\", \"Dorian Gray\", \"Cocoon\" and \"U60311\") and Munich (\"Ultraschall\", \"KW – Das Heizkraftwerk\", \"Natraj Temple\", \"Harry Klein\" and \"Rote Sonne\").\n\nFurther popular venues include \"Stammheim (Aufschwung Ost)\" in Kassel, \"Tunnel Club\" in Hamburg and \"Distillery\" in Leipzig. Since the late 2000s, Berlin is still called the capital of electro music and rave, and techno clubs such as Berghain, Tresor, \"Watergate\" or KitKatClub and the way to party in barely renovated venues, ruins or wooden shacks such as, among many others, Club der Visionaere, \"Wilde Renate\", \"Fiese Remise\" or \"Bar 25\", attracted international media attention. One movie that portraits this scene of the 2000s is Berlin Calling starring Paul Kalkbrenner. In the 2010s, there remains a vivid rave and techno scene throughout the country, including numerous festivals and world-class techno clubs also outside of Berlin, such as for example \"MMA Club (Mixed Munich Arts)\" in Munich, \"Institut für Zukunft\" in Leipzig or \"Robert Johnson\" in Offenbach.\n\nThe UK was finally recognized for its rave culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By 1991, organisations such as Fantazia and Raindance were holding massive legal raves in fields and warehouses around the country. The Fantazia party at Castle Donington, July 1992 was an open-air, all-night event. The Vision at Pophams airfield in August 1992 and Universe's Tribal Gathering in 1993 had a more festival feel.\n\nBy the middle of 1992, the scene was slowly changing, with local councils passing by-laws and increasing fees in an effort to prevent or discourage rave organisations from acquiring necessary licences. This meant that the days of the large one-off parties were numbered. By the mid-1990s, the scene had also fragmented into many different styles of dance music, making large parties more expensive to set up and more difficult to promote. The sound driving the big raves of the early 1990s had by the end of 1993 split into two distinct and polarising styles, the darker jungle and the faster happy hardcore. Although many ravers left the scene due to the split, promoters such as ESP Dreamscape and Helter Skelter still enjoyed widespread popularity and capacity attendances with multi-arena events catering to the various genres. Notable events of this period included ESP's outdoor Dreamscape 20 event on 9 September 1995 at Brafield aerodrome fields, Northants and Helter Skelter's Energy 97 outdoor event on 9th Aug 1997 at Turweston Aerodrome, Northants.\n\nThe illegal free party scene also reached its zenith for that time after a particularly large festival, when many individual sound systems such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, DIY, and Spiral Tribe set up near Castlemorton Common. The government acted. Under the \"Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994\", the definition of music played at a rave was given as:\n\nSections 63, 64 & 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (£1000). The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. However, some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable alcohol. In November 1994, the Zippies staged an act of electronic civil disobedience to protest against the CJB (i.e., Criminal Justice Bill).\n\nAfter 1993, the main outlet for raves in the UK were a number of licensed parties, amongst them Helter Skelter, Life at Bowlers (Trafford Park, Manchester), The Edge (formerly the Eclipse [Coventry]), The Sanctuary (Milton Keynes) and Club Kinetic. In London, itself, there were a few large clubs that staged raves on a regular basis, most notably \"The Laser Dome\", \"The Fridge\", \"The Hippodrome\", \"Club U.K.\", and \"Trade.\" \"The Laser Dome\" featured two separate dance areas, \"Hardcore\" and \"Garage\", as well as over 20 video game machines, a silent-movie screening lounge, replicas of the \"Statue of Liberty\", \"San Francisco Bridge\", and a large glass maze. In Scotland, event promoters Rezerection held large-scale events across the country.\n\nBy 1997, the popularity of weekly Superclub nights had taken over from the old Rave format, with a raft of new club-based genres sweeping in (e.g. Trance, Hard House, Speed and UK garage) alongside the more traditional House sound that had regained popularity. Clubs like Gatecrasher and Cream rose to prominence with dress codes and door policies that were the polar opposite of their rave counterparts; stories of refused entry due to not wearing the right clothing were commonplace, but seemingly did nothing to deter Superclub attendance.\n\nAmerican ravers, following their early UK & European counterparts, have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia. Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music spun by DJs, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00 am closing of clubs. It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction. Because of the legality, they had to be secretive about time and place.\n\nIn the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through into North America from English expatriates and from US DJs who would visit Europe. However, rave culture's major expansion in North America is often credited to Frankie Bones, who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England, helped organize some of the earliest American raves in the 1990s in New York City called \"Storm Raves\". Storm Raves had a consistent core audience, fostered by zines by fellow Storm DJ (and co-founder, with Adam X and Frankie Bones, of the US techno record store, Groove Records.). Heather Heart held Under One Sky. Simultaneously in NYC, events were introducing electronic dance music to this city's dance scene. Between 1992 and 1994, promotional groups sprung up across the east coast.\n\nIn the 1990s, San Diego held large raves with audiences of thousands. These festivals were held on Indian reservations and ski resorts during the summer months and were headlined by DJs such as Doc Martin, Dimitri of Deee-lite, Afrika Islam and the Hardkiss brothers from San Francisco. They helped to create the Right to Dance movement—a non violent protest held in San Diego and later in Los Angeles.\n\nFeaturing local San Diego DJs Jon Bishop, Steve Pagan, Alien Tom, Jeff Skot and Mark E. Quark performed at these events. The events used large props and themes. The fairy and pixie craze, with ravers getting fairy tattoos and wearing fairy wings to parties was associated with the region. The percussive group Crash Worship was active here.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a boom in rave culture in the San Francisco Bay Area. At first, small underground parties sprung up all over the SOMA district in vacant warehouses, loft spaces, and clubs. The no alcohol rule fueled the ecstasy-driven parties. Small underground raves were just starting out and expanding beyond SF to include the East Bay, the South Bay area including San Jose, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz beaches.\n\nIn late 1991, raves started to expand across northern California, and cities like Sacramento, Oakland, Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, San Jose). The massive parties were taking place in outdoor fields, airplane hangars and hilltops that surround the valley. San Francisco's early promoters and DJs were from the UK and Europe. Raves took place in some of the SOMA art museum event such as, 'Where the wild things are' in the museum on top of the Sony Metreon, and in the Maritime hall (1998–2002).\n\nBy the end of 1994, a new generation of ravers were attracted by the new sounds. EDM began to become popular. Raves could be found in many different kinds of venues, as opposed to just basements and warehouses. Promoters started to take notice and put together the massives of the late 1990s with many music forms under one roof for 12-hour events. 2000 saw the demise of massive raves as curfews were placed on permits handed out to promoters. Instead of all night and into the next day, parties now had to end at 2 a.m. Smaller, intimate venues continued just like they had from the start and underground raves became the norm. The death of an attendee who had taken MDMA at the Electric Daisy Carnival in 2010 put a negative spin on raves in LA and California.\n\nThrough the mid 1990s and into the 2000s the city of Seattle also shared in the tradition of West Coast rave culture. Though a smaller scene compared to San Francisco, Seattle also had many different rave crews, promoters, Djs, and fans. Candy Raver style, friendship and culture became popular in the West Coast rave scene, both in Seattle and San Francisco. At the peak of West Coast rave, Candy Raver, and massive rave popularity (1996–1999,) it was common to meet groups of ravers, promoters, and Djs who frequently travelled between Seattle and San Francisco, which spread the overall sense of West Coast rave culture and the phenomenon of West Coast \"massives\".\n\nBy 2010, raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals, but many times even bigger and more profitable. The Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas drew more than 300,000 fans over three days in the summer of 2012, making it the largest EDM music festival in North America. Ultra Music Festival in Miami drew 150,000 fans over three days in 2012 while other raves like Electric Zoo in New York, Beyond Wonderland in LA, Movement in Detroit, Electric Forest in Michigan, Spring Awakening in Chicago, and dozens more now attract hundreds of thousands of \"ravers\" every year. These new EDM-based rave events (now simply referred generically to as \"music festivals\") sell out. Festival attendance at the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) increased by 39.1%, or 90,000 attendees from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, EDC had attendance of approximately 345,000 people, a record for the festival. The average ticket for EDC cost over $300 and the event contributed $278 million to the Clark County economy in 2013. This festival takes place at a 1,000-acre complex featuring a half dozen custom built stages, enormous interactive art installations, and hundreds of EDM artists. Insomniac, a US EDM event promoter, holds yearly EDC and other EDM events.\n\nRave parties began in Australia as early as the 1980s and continued well into the late 1990s. They were mobilised versions of the 'warehouse parties', across Britain. Similar to the United States and Britain, raves in Australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes, such as warehouses, factories and carpet showrooms. In addition, suburban locations were also used: basketball gymnasiums, train stations and even circus tents were all common venues. In Sydney, common areas used for outdoor events included Sydney Park, a reclaimed garbage dump in the inner south west of the city, Cataract Park and various other natural, unused locations and bush lands. The raves placed a heavy emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural environment, thus many raves in Sydney were held outdoors, notably the 'Happy Valley' parties (1991–1994), 'Ecology' (1992) and 'Field of Dreams 4' (July 6, 1996). The mid-late 1990s saw a slight decline in rave attendance, attributed to the death of Anna Wood at a licensed inner-city Sydney venue, which was hosting a rave party known as \"Apache\". Wood had taken ecstasy and died in hospital a few days later, leading to extensive media exposure on the correlation of drug culture and its links to the rave scene in Australia.\n\nThe tradition continued in Melbourne, with 'Earthcore' parties. Raves also became less underground as they were in the 1990s, and many were held at licensed venues well into the 2000s. Despite this, rave parties of 1990s size became less common. Nonetheless, the rave scene in Australia experienced a resurgence after 2010. During this period the resurfacing of the \"Melbourne Shuffle\", a Melbourne club/rave dance style, became a YouTube trend and videos were uploaded. The rave subculture in Melbourne was strengthened with the opening of clubs such as Bass Station and Hard Candy and the rise of free party groups such as Melbourne Underground. Melbourne helped keep raving culture alive with young people.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of notable raves, particularly smaller raves that may not fit the profile of being an electronic dance music festival:\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of notable sound systems:\n\n\n\n"}

He also was a stuntman and frequently acted as silver screen gorillas using his own gorilla costumes.\n\nIn 1937, Corrigan purchased land in the Santa Susana Mountains foothills in Simi Valley and developed it into a movie ranch called \"Corriganville\". The movie ranch was used for location filming in film serials, feature films, and television shows, as well as for the performance of live western shows for tourists. Bob Hope later bought the ranch in 1966 and renamed it \"Hopetown\". It is now a Regional Park and nature preserve.\n\nCorrigan's Hollywood career began as a physical fitness instructor and physical culture trainer to the stars. In the early 1930s he did stunts and bit parts in several films, billed as Ray Benard. Many of his early roles were in ape costumes, for example, as a gorilla in \"Tarzan and His Mate\" (1934) and an \"orangopoid\" in the first \"Flash Gordon\" serial.\n\nIn 1936, Corrigan got his screen breakthrough with starring roles in two Republic serials, \"The Vigilantes Are Coming\" and in \"The Undersea Kingdom\", which evoked memories of Universal's first \"Flash Gordon\" serial. His character in \"The Undersea Kingdom\" was known as Ray \"Crash\" Corrigan, and he adopted it as his screen name.\n\nOn the basis of this, Republic signed him to their standard Term Player Contract, running from May 25, 1936 to May 24, 1938. He was cast as one of the trio in the \"Three Mesquiteers\" series of westerns, starring in 24 of the 51 \"3M\" films made by the studio. He later left Republic in 1938 over a pay dispute. Over at Monogram Pictures, Corrigan began a new series of feature westerns, \"The Range Busters\", cheap knock-offs of The Three Mesquiteers, with a series character that used his name; between 1940 and 1943, he starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series.\n\nFollowing this, his on-screen work largely returned to appearing in ape costumes, such as the roles in \"Captive Wild Woman\" (1943), \"Nabonga\" (1944), \"White Pongo\" (1945) and as a prehistoric sloth in \"Unknown Island\" (1948). The original gorilla \"mask\" seen in films like \"The Ape\" (1940) was replaced with a subtler design with a more mobile jaw. Corrigan later sold his gorilla suits in 1948 and provided training in using them to their new owner, Steve Calvert, a Ciro's bartender. Calvert stepped into Corrigan's paw prints starting with a Jungle Jim film. Despite reports to the contrary, Calvert and Corrigan never appeared together on-screen in an ape costume. Since both Corrigan and Calvert eschewed screen credit playing gorillas, their film credits are often confused; any appearance of the \"Corrigan suit\" after 1948 is by Calvert.\n\nIn 1950, he had a television show called \"Crash Corrigan's Ranch\". He also planned a television series called \"Buckskin Rangers\" with his old associate Max Terhune. His final theatrical film was playing the title role in the science fiction film \"It! The Terror from Beyond Space\", according to bio information given to visitors at the Thousand Oaks, California, \"Corrigan Steak House and Bar\" that he once owned.\n\nIn 1937, Corrigan was on a hunting trip with Clark Gable when he had an idea to purchase land in Simi Valley, California and use it as a Western ranch similar to Iverson Movie Ranch. He paid a $1,000 down payment, then a thousand dollars a month until the $11,354 price was paid. He developed this into Corriganville, a location used for many Western movies and TV shows. The location featured many different types of terrain for producers such as lakes, mountains, and caves. As opposed to merely set fronts, Corriganville contained actual buildings where film crews could live and store their equipment to save the time and expense of daily travel from studios to an outdoor location.\n\nCorrigan profited well from renting this location to film studios and from paying visitors. In 1949, Corrigan opened his ranch to the public on weekends for Western-themed entertainment. The weekend attractions included stuntmen shows throughout the day, a Cavalry fort set, an outlaw shack, a full western town with saloon, jail and hotel, live western music, Indian crafts, stagecoach rides, pony rides, and boating on the ranch's artificial lake. It was common for movie and TV personalities to appear in person for photos and autographs, attracting as many as 20,000 people on those weekends.\n\nExamples of feature films and TV shows that were filmed at Corriganville:\n\nHollywood cowboy stars who filmed there include: Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Buster Crabbe, John Wayne, Smiley Burnette, Clayton Moore, Jay Silverheels, Charles Starrett, Ken Maynard, Hoot Gibson, Bob Steele and Tex Ritter.\n\nCorriganville was eventually sold to Bob Hope in 1966, when it became \"Hopetown\". Today, what remains is known as Corriganville Park and features some of the old landmarks. Signs along a hiking trail point out the historic features.\n\nThe origin of the \"Crash\" nickname is from his football-playing days. This was verified by Corrigan himself when he was a contestant on the June 11, 1959 episode of \"You Bet Your Life\" starring Groucho Marx. When asked how he got the name \"Crash\", Corrigan told Groucho, \"When I would go to tackle somebody or instead of fighting them with my fists, I would just take off and dive at them head first and that's how I acquired the name 'Crash'.\"\n\nHis first starring role using the name professionally was in the Republic Pictures' serial \"The Undersea Kingdom\", in which his screen character was also named \"Crash Corrigan.\" The serial was created to capitalize on the popularity of Universal Pictures' \"Flash Gordon\" serials and the nickname may have been appropriated by Republic's publicity department to create a similarly named hero.\n\nFollowing his death at age 74 on August 10, 1976 from a heart attack in Brookings Harbor, Oregon, Ray \"Crash\" Corrigan was interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California. More than four decades later, his grave still remains unmarked.\n\n"}

{"id": "52831478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52831478", "title": "Scene and sequel", "text": "Scene and sequel\n\nScene and sequel are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the plot of a story. \"Scenes\" propel a story forward as the character attempts to achieve a goal. \"Sequels\" provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.\n\nThe concept of a scene in written fiction has evolved over many years. Dwight V. Swain, in \"Techniques of the Selling Writer\" (1965) defined a \"scene\" as a unit of conflict, an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.\n\nIn \"The Art of Fiction\" (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another. Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of \"scene\", and to explain its use and structure.\n\nIn addition to defining a scene, Swain described a \"sequel\" as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) dilemma, and (3) decision. Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a \"sequel\" and to explain its use and structure.\n\nRather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.\n\nSwain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that\n\n\nThe \"structural units of fiction writing\" comprise all fiction.\n\nPassages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are \"neither\" scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of \"both\" scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include \"fragments\" of scenes or sequels and passages of narration, description, or exposition. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the \"problem-solving passage\", common in mystery and detective stories.\n\nScenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a climax scene). A scene may be classified by the fiction-writing mode that dominates its presentation (as in an action scene or a dialogue scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as flashback scenes and flashforward scenes).\n\n\n"}

The film was directed by Anthony C. Ferrante with Ian Ziering, Tara Reid, Cassie Scerbo, and Mark McGrath reprising their roles from the previous installments. Also joining the cast are David Hasselhoff, Bo Derek, Ryan Newman (replacing Aubrey Peeples in the role of Claudia Shepard, from the first film), and Jack Griffo.\n\nIrish music duo Jedward wrote and performed the film's official theme song \"Oh Hell No\", and also had a brief cameo in the film.\n\nThe film premiered on Syfy in the United States on July 22, 2015.\n\nWhile sharknado fighter Fin Shepard is in Washington, D.C. to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom from the president, another sharknado strikes, devastating the nation's capital. Fin and the president work together to defeat the sharks, and the storm unexpectedly subsides. Fearing that April, who is at Universal Orlando with their daughter Claudia and her mother May, is in danger, Fin heads for Florida. On his way there, he encounters a \"fognado\", which is stopped by Nova Clarke, his former employee, who has become a hardened sharknado storm tracker, and her partner Lucas Stevens.\n\nThey stop at a military airport where they get clearance to use a fighter jet to bomb other forming sharknados. Lucas sacrifices himself to blow up a sharknado so that Nova and Fin can escape. They detonate a bomb in a sharknado over the Coke Zero Sugar 400 race. After crash landing in Orlando at the Universal Orlando Resort, they begin to search for the rest of the family. They are not able to get in touch with Claudia since she left her phone behind earlier, but April retrieves it from one of the ride managers who held on to it. Eventually, Fin and Nova reunite with April, Claudia, her new boyfriend Billy, and May who have survived the sharknado that has hit the theme park. They then rush to take cover inside the Universal Orlando globe, which rolls around admist chaotic fleeing crowds before coming to rest atop Pharos Lighthouse.\n\nRealizing that the numerous storms will soon combine into a massive sharknado wall that will destroy the entire East Coast (dubbed the \"Feast Coast\" by the media), Fin calls in a favor from his estranged father, former NASA colonel Gil Shepard, to help him with a risky plan to destroy the storm from space. Gil, Fin, April, and Nova reach Cape Canaveral where they plan to use a top-secret Space Shuttle to blow up tanks of rocket fuel in the storm. They head inside to prepare, while Claudia and Billy fend off incoming sharks by using guns. They share a kiss and begin to head back inside, but Billy is killed when a shark lands on him. While Nova clears a path, Gil, Fin, and April launch into space where they detonate the external tank, but it fails to stop the wall of sharknados. Gil deploys \"Plan B\", activating a Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative satellite laser weapon, stranding himself in space since there is not enough fuel to propel all of them back to Earth. This time, the sharknados are destroyed, but the beam causes the sharks to propel into space, attacking the shuttle. Fin fights them off using an energy-beam chainsaw; he and April are eaten by two different sharks which fall back down to Earth. Though the sharks are charred from atmospheric entry, Fin emerges from his shark unharmed and discovers that April also safely returned the same way, and that she had given birth during the descent. As the family and Nova reunite, Fin names his newborn son after his father, who has landed on the moon. April is about to recover Fin's father's badge when a Shuttle fragment apparently crushes her.\n\n\n\n\n\"Sharknado 3\" was filmed on location at Universal Orlando, São Paulo Brazil, Northern New Jersey, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C.\n\nInitially, the President was going to be played by then-businessman Donald Trump, but he later declined the role due to him preparing a real presidential campaign.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports a 36% score with an average rating of 3.9/10, based on 33 critics. The consensus reads: \"\"Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!\" bites off more than it can chew, leaving viewers with an overlong mess that isn't even bad enough to be good.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 53 out of a 100, which indicates mixed or average reviews based on 19 critics.\n\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" said the self-reference gag was beginning to yield diminishing returns. He further added that the question is whether the parent company's insatiable appetite to cash in would hasten the feeding frenzy. Don Kaplan of The New York Daily News said the movie left a fishy taste behind. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said Sharknado 3's absurdities was turned to funny levels. He also said it was shameless in certain ways, with one being product placement. Matt Fowler from IGN said the film is surprisingly awful.\n\nA tie-in one shot comic, \"Archie vs. Sharknado\", was released on July 22, 2015, by Archie Comics. Written by Ferrante and illustrated by Dan Parent, it depicts a Sharknado striking Riverdale.\n\n\"Sharknado 4\" was confirmed to follow upon \"Sharknado 3\"s premiere. The film concludes with a cliffhanger leaving open the question as to whether April is killed by falling wreckage. An ad campaign that commenced after the film promoted a Twitter campaign offering fans the chance to decide her fate with the hashtags \"#AprilLives\" or \"#AprilDies\", with the results to be revealed in \"Sharknado 4\". The fourth installment aired on July 31, 2016.\n\nA promotional trailer reveals that Ziering also makes an appearance as Fin Shepard in \"Lavalantula\", which debuted on July 25, 2015, the Saturday after \"Sharknado 3\"s Wednesday premiere. This indicates that it takes place in a shared universe. As he says he has \"shark problems right now\", this may indicate that the events of \"Lavalantula\" take place just before or concurrent with \"Sharknado 3\". Steve Guttenberg, the star of \"Lavalantula\", appears in \"Sharknado: The 4th Awakens\", reprising the role of Colton West in cameo; Michael Winslow also appears in both films, but as different characters.\n\n"}

{"id": "1580071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1580071", "title": "Société Nationale de Musique", "text": "Société Nationale de Musique\n\nThe Société Nationale de Musique was an important organisation in late 19th/early 20th century France to promote French music and to allow young composers to present their music in public. The motto was \"Ars gallica\".\n\nThe society was founded on 25 February 1871 by Romain Bussine and Camille Saint-Saëns, who shared the presidency, and early members included Alexis de Castillon, Théodore Dubois, Henri Duparc, Gabriel Fauré, César Franck, Jules Garcin, Ernest Guiraud, Jules Massenet, and Paul Taffanel. It was conceived in reaction to the tendency in French music to favour vocal and operatic music over orchestral music, and to further the cause of French music in contrast to the Germanic tradition. \"They were determined to unite in their efforts to spread the gospel of French music and to make known the works of living French composers ... According to their statutes ... their intention was to act 'in brotherly unity, with an absolute forgetfulness of self'\".\n\nThe first concert took place on 17 November 1871 and featured the Trio in B flat major by Franck, two songs by Dubois, \"Five Pieces in Ancient Style\" by Castillon, a reduction of the Violin Concerto by Garcin, an \"Improvisation\" for tenor by Massenet, and the \"Caprice héroïque\" for two pianos by Saint-Saëns. The concerts took place in the Salle Pleyel, the Salle Érard for orchestral concerts, and the church of Saint-Gervais for works with organ. Although the society had limited means, it was able to hire first-rate performers such as Sarasate, Eugène Ysaÿe, and Wanda Landowska.\n\nIn the 1880s, the society first began accepting manuscripts by non-French composers. Ernest Chausson served as secretary from 1883 until his death. Towards the end of that decade it accepted a number of composers of the rising generation, among them Debussy and Ravel.\n\nIn 1886, the society had a confrontational split over the issue of promoting foreign music, with the conservative Saint-Saëns facing off against Franck, Vincent d'Indy, and others. Franck was elected president, and both Bussine and Saint-Saëns resigned. With the death of Franck in 1890, d'Indy became president. After several hostile incidents, Ravel left the society and founded a new society called the Société de Musique Indépendente. Competition between the two societies and lack of new manuscripts led to a reduction in the activity of the society until the 1930s, when the induction of new members such as Olivier Messiaen breathed new life into it.\n\nLéon Vallas: \"César Franck\" (translated by Hubert J.

The action occurred around June 8, 2009, when the government ordered four banks to freeze over 34 million dollars in payments owed to about 27,000 poker players. According to the Poker Players Alliance, a grass-roots organization for poker players, federal prosecutors ordered Citibank, Wells Fargo and Goldwater Bank and Alliance Bank of Arizona to freeze the accounts of Allied Systems and Account Services. Allied Systems and Account Services are two of the account-management companies that Full Tilt Poker, Absolute Poker, Ultimate Bet and PokerStars use for the disbursement of funds.\n\nThe legality of online poker in the United States is uncertain. In 2006, the Security and Accountability For Every Port Act was passed in an effort to combat terrorism at United States' harbors. One of the provisions included in the act is known as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA). This provision prohibits the transfer of funds from a financial institution to an Internet gambling site, with the notable exceptions of fantasy sports, online lotteries, and horse/harness racing. The law makes exceptions for games of skill as opposed to games of luck; thus, opponents of the measure argue, it should not apply to poker. Numerous studies have shown that poker is, in fact, a game of skill. The very existence of thousands of players who were consistent winners proves that.\n\nThe law, opponents argue, does not address transfer of money to individuals nor does it make online gambling illegal. The only state that has a law explicitly banning online poker is Washington. The federal government holds that playing online is a violation of the Act. Arlo Devlin-Brown, the assistant U.S. attorney for the SDNY, says that the U.S. government can seize the funds \"because they constitute property involved in money laundering transactions and illegal gambling offenses.\" In seizing the money, the federal government did not cite the UIGEA but rather the 1961 law \"The Wire Act and Illegal Gambling Business Act.\" According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank \"dedicated to free enterprise and limited government\", the Justice Department has taken the stance that online wagering is prohibited by the Act, \"despite the fact that the courts have repeatedly smacked down any attempt to apply the federal Wire Act ... to non-sport related Internet gambling.\"\n\nNelson Rose, a law professor who specializes in gambling law at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, California, said that SDNY's action was \"very aggressive, and I think it's a gamble on the part of the prosecutors.\" Professor Rose indicated that it was unclear as to what law would allow for the seizure of money from individuals as compared to the companies involved. Previous government actions focused on sports betting, not poker and that according to Rose, many courts and legal authorities believe poker is different from sports betting because poker involves a transfer of money between individuals, while sports betting is between an individual and online casino.\n\nAccount Services lawyer Jeff Ifrah said that the government \"has never seized an account that belongs to players who are engaged in what [Ifrah] would contend is a lawful act of playing peer-to-peer poker online.\"\n\nAfter the funds were seized all of the affected poker sites reimbursed the players the money that was seized. According to one PokerStars player, the site gave him an additional 10 percent credit. Professor Rose indicated that because the poker sites are reimbursing the players, that the legality of the actions of the Southern District may never be tested. Since the sites are making the player whole, they may not have standing to challenge the Southern District. \"Payment processors won't want to show up in court in the U.S. and, even if you could find a player,\" Rose said, \"would they be willing to testify under oath?\"\n\nImmediately after the seizure, the Poker Players Alliance issued a statement. In the statement, the PPA alleges that \"in at least two cases\" the seizure of funds was done without first obtaining the proper warrants. The statement states that the action was taken despite the fact that \"no federal or state court has ever found a payment processor or a player accessing an Internet poker site to have violated the federal laws alleged by the Southern District in this case.\"\n\nThe timing of the Southern District's actions has been the subject of considerable discussion. The CEI noted that the timing occurred at a time where, \"regulators had finally begun to think about internet gambling as a legitimate activity that citizens have the right to engage in.\" They also noted that new legislation proposed by Barney Frank to legalize and regulate online poker \"seems likely to pass.\" Rose mentioned other theories related to the timing. According to one theory, the National Football League, an opponent of expanding internet gambling, pressured the Southern District to retaliate in light of Frank's proposal. Another theory states that the Southern District performed the raid to ensure that Frank's bill would pass. Rose explains that California law enforcement agencies raided a retirement home bingo game shortly before a vote to raise people's awareness of the issue. As the seizure occurred at a time where poker players might be seeking to participate in the World Series of Poker, Ifrah hypothesized that the raid was timed to coincide with the 2009 World Series of Poker. Finally, Rose speculates that the DOJ may have seized the accounts as a money grab on the belief that nobody would fight the seizure in court. \"It's a tremendous gamble,\" Rose said, \"on the part of the U.S. Department of Justice to go after players and even more of a gamble to go after poker players.\"\n\n"}

A thrust has the benefit of greater intimacy between performers and the audience than a proscenium, while retaining the utility of a backstage area. Entrances onto a thrust are most readily made from backstage, although some theatres provide for performers to enter through the audience using vomitory entrances. A theatre in the round, exposed on all sides to the audience, is without a backstage and relies entirely on entrances in the auditorium or from under the stage.\n\nAs with an arena, the audience in a thrust stage theatre may view the stage from three or more sides. Because the audience can view the performance from a variety of perspectives, it is usual for the blocking, props and scenery to receive thorough consideration to ensure that no perspective is blocked from view. A high backed chair, for instance, when placed stage right, could create a blind spot in the stage left action.\n\nThe thrust stage is the earliest stage type in western theatre, first appearing in Greek theatres, and its arrangement was continued by the pageant wagon. As pageant wagons evolved into Elizabethan theatre, many of that era's works, including those of Shakespeare, were performed on theatre with an open thrust stage, such as those of the Globe Theatre.\nThe thrust stage concept was generally out of use for centuries, and was resurrected in 1953 by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival of Canada. Their Festival Theatre was originally under a tent, until a permanent thrust stage theatre facility was constructed in 1957. Since that time dozens of other thrust stage venues have been built using the concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33671478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33671478", "title": "We Found Love (music video)", "text": "We Found Love (music video)\n\nThe music video for Barbadian singer Rihanna's 2011 single \"We Found Love\" was directed by Melina Matsoukas. It was filmed on September 26–28, 2011, in the New Lodge area of Belfast and Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland. People driving around the location of the set informed BBC that traffic in the area was congested as drivers wanted to see the singer. The video premiered on October 19, 2011, and was made available to download digitally three days later on October 22. As of November 2018, the video has amassed over 820 million views on YouTube.\n\nThe video begins with a monologue given by fashion model Agyness Deyn. Scenes of Rihanna with her romantic interest (Dudley O'Shaughnessy) in both love and hate scenarios intersperse, as they experience mounting difficulties in their relationship. After enduring the overwhelming effects of recreational drugs and physical violence, she finds her boyfriend unconscious on the floor of his apartment, and leaves him, having had enough of the relationship. Images of the song's producer and featured artist Calvin Harris appear in outdoor DJ scenes, while the video has regular references to popular culture, such as themes of films and content of other singers' videos.\n\nMany critics noted that the video resembled a short film, and compared it to the films \"Trainspotting\" and \"Requiem for a Dream\". Some critics also compared the thematic content to those of Rihanna's videos for \"S&M\" and \"Man Down\". Despite that, the video caused much controversy among activist groups. Christian youth pastor Brandon Ward, John Colonnello and the Ulster Cancer Foundation criticized the video for Rihanna's portrayal of her character having sex while under the influence of illegal drugs and smoking heavily. Consequently, the video was banned from being shown before 10 pm on French television. It won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video and MTV's VMA for Video of the Year. The video further managed to peak at number one on the Polish Top Airplay TV Chart and the Romanian TV Airplay Chart.\n\nThe music video for \"We Found Love\" was shot on September 26–28, 2011, in County Down, Northern Ireland. It was filmed in a field in the town of Bangor, County Down, ahead of Rihanna's embarkment on the European leg of the Loud Tour (2011), and the New Lodge area of North Belfast. It was directed by Melina Matsoukas, who had previously directed the videos for \"Rude Boy\" (2010), and the controversial \"S&M\" (2011). During the filming, people driving around the location of the set informed the BBC that traffic in the area was congested as drivers tried to see the singer. Pictures showing Rihanna wearing a red bandana top, long flannel shirt, and \"dirty denim\", similar to the clothing she wore for the song's artwork, were leaked onto the internet the same day. She filmed scenes while wearing a bikini with the pattern of the US flag, and a denim vest and ripped jeans. The owner of the field, farmer and North Down Borough Council Democratic Unionist Party councillor Alan Graham, expressed distaste after seeing Rihanna topless on his field, saying: \"When the filming did become to my mind unacceptable I requested the filming to stop ... it became apparent to me that the situation was becoming inappropriate and I requested them to stop and they did\". On September 28, 2011, the shoot location was moved to a closed set in Titanic Quarter, Belfast where both photographers and fans were barred from watching the singer.\n\nExtras for the shoot were not told what was expected of them until the last minute, in order to keep the content of the video as secret as possible. Regarding the video's content, Rihanna posted a message on Twitter that read: \"I really can't stop thinking about this video we just shot! EASILY the BEST video I've done thus far!\" Rihanna elaborated on the concept of the video: \"We've never done a video like this before. This is probably one of the deepest videos I've ever done ... it's all about love and love being like a drug, you definitely get that from this.\" The male love interest in the video is Dudley O'Shaughnessy, a model and former boxer. Upon the release of the video, Matsoukas explained the content of the video in an interview with MTV:\n\nWe love, obviously, to do provocative imagery ... we always try to definitely push the limits ... I think because, in the end, it's not really at all about domestic violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.\n\nThe director went on to explain the content with regard to Rihanna's domestic violence case against former boyfriend Chris Brown in February 2009, saying that it is not a reenactment of what happened between Rihanna and Brown, but rather that Rihanna is acting in the video. Matsoukas said:\n\n[The song's] totally rave-y ... and that's the feeling, just music rushing over you, and then I started thinking about drugs and addiction and love and how that's an addiction ... we've all lived the ups and downs of being in a toxic relationship. It's really about the obstacles of trying to let it go, but at the same time how great it makes you feel, so it's hard to let it go. Again, it goes back to a story that we all can relate to ... It's not Rihanna's story; it's her story in the video, and she's acting. But everybody's [as well]. Obviously, there's a lot of comparisons to her real life, and that's not at all the intention. It's just that I guess people naturally go there because art imitates life, and it's a story we all relate to and we've all experienced. Like, it's based on my life; it's based on her life; it's based on your life, like, everybody.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork Media, Matsoukas said that she was surprised with the professional standard of Rihanna's acting. The inspiration for Rihanna acting in the video came from when Matsoukas saw the clip for \"Man Down\" in April 2011; the director stated that she was taken aback at how Rihanna realistically re-enacted a rape scenario. Matsoukas described the process for choosing O'Shaughnessy as the male love interest, stating that Rihanna had asked her to find a man she could \"fake fuck\" while filming. The director said that she telephoned a boxer her friend had told her about, and asked him to make a tape of himself using the description of how the male love interest should act. When asked if any of the video was improvised, Matsoukas revealed that she would create a scenario and then it was left to Rihanna and O'Shaughnessy to elaborate upon what the director had given them. Matsoukas jokingly said that the scene in which O'Shaughnessy draws a tattoo on Rihanna's buttock cheek was not part of the video's treatment, and that O'Shaughnessy improvised it. Upon the video's release, multiple media outlets and music critics compared the content of the video to a reenactment of Rihanna and Brown's physical altercation. When asked about this, Matsoukas clarified that the video was not linked to Brown in any circumstance, and said, \"[O'Shaughnessy] doesn't even really look like Chris Brown to me.\"\n\nThe video begins with a monologue by fashion model Agyness Deyn about love and heartbreak:\nDuring the narration, Rihanna and her lover are depicted in both love and hate scenarios. Before the song begins to play, lightning bolts are projected onto a wall in which Rihanna stands in front of. She and her lover are depicted as enamored with each other, and enjoying activities such as fairground rides and eating in fast food restaurants. During the chorus, images of drugs, pills, and dilated pupils are shown, while brief scenes of Rihanna and her boyfriend preparing to have sex are shown.\n\nThe chorus continues and the video cuts to a scene in which Rihanna and other people dance at an outside rave; Calvin Harris features as the DJ. As the second chorus begins, Rihanna and her boyfriend are happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing each other in a shopping cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. However, they begin arguing in a car. The video then shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. They eventually begin to physically abuse one another. During the final chorus, Rihanna is seen vomiting streamers; she is also seen unconscious on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. After finding the boyfriend unconscious on the floor of his apartment, Rihanna decides she has had enough of the relationship and leaves him. The video ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.\n\nThe video for \"We Found Love\" premiered on the website Whosay.com on October 19, 2011. Critics were divided on their opinions of the video; some praised its cinematic feel and others criticized the glorification of drug abuse. Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the production of the video, noting its cinematic feel and that it shows the \"ins and outs [and] ups and downs\" of love. Coplan compared the video to the film \"Blue Valentine\" due to its sexualized content and a narrative that consists of a couple in a turbulent relationship. Erika Ramirez of \"Billboard\" magazine called the video artful and poignant, and noted that it shows \"neon colors, explicit sex, bathtub embraces and painful arguments of the couple's world\". Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented that although the song is upbeat and carefree, the video represents the antithesis, depicting \"a dark look at love and substance abuse\". Vena, like Coplan, noted that the song's video has a cinematic feel, calling it a \"mini-movie\". She compared the video to the films \"Trainspotting\" and \"Requiem for a Dream\", with regard to its opening monologue, which Vena thought foreshadowed the video.\n\nMatthew Perpetua of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"the footage looks like a remake of \"Trainspotting\", and, [\"We Found Love\"] matches its thumping rave beat to footage that often looks like a remake of \"Trainspotting\"\". Amanda Dobbins of \"New York\" magazine was more critical of the video; she criticized Rihanna's undressing in a farmer's field as \"the least of its provocations\" and listed the activities the couple partake in: \"smoking, drinking, dancing on fast-food tables, dancing at raves, heavy petting, stealing groceries, drunk wheelies, and bathing while fully clothed [and] candy-colored drugs\". Dobbins noted that the list of illicit and frowned upon activities may aggravate parents and committees because of the explicit nature of the video, which caused controversy for Rihanna in her videos for \"S&M\" and \"Man Down\". Charlotte Cowles of the same publication commented that the voice-over provided by Deyn at the start of the video sounded \"incredibly depressing\".\n\nLeah Greenblatt of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the video as \"a \"Trainspotting\"-meets-\"Drugstore Cowboy\" portrait of wasted youth and finding love in an apparently very pharmaceutical place\". Greenblatt continued her review in a more negative manner, asking if it \"paint[s] a too-glamorous portrait of crazy, stupid love for her young fans? Or is it [Rihanna]'s prerogative to push the boundaries of dilated pupils, couch sex, and how many cigarettes two people can conceivably smoke simultaneously?\" Jamie Lewis of the \"International Business Times\" noted that the video is likely to cause controversy among sections of the public due to the \"multitude of illicit and illegal acts\", and condemned the activities that the singer appeared to be partaking in, writing, \"Rihanna can be seen swallowing unmarked pills, smoking what looks like marijuana, publicly stripping, stealing goods and vandalising\". Lewis also wrote that Rihanna had received mixed reactions from her fans via her Twitter and Facebook feeds.\n\nThe video was included on many lists of the best music videos of 2011. Out of 50 videos, \"We Found Love\" ranked at number 21 on \"NME\"s Best Music Videos of 2011. A reviewer for \"NME\" called it, \"an artful mini-movie of a promo, an ode to crazy, youthful love.\" It ranked at number 12 out of 25 on Slant Magazine's Top 2011 Music Videos. A reviewer for Slant Magazine praised Matsoukas' directorial skills, writing, \"Melina Matsoukas's video projects (literally and figuratively) the fleeting rush of both young love and drugs—and the often fatal cocktail that's produced when the two are combined.\" The video was included on \"The Guardian\"s 2011 list, entitled \"The best pop videos of 2011\". As of January 2015, \"Billboard\" named the video as the second best music video of the 2010s (so far). The video received three MTV Video Music Award nominations, including Best Pop Video, and won the award for Video of the Year. The video received the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 55th Grammy Awards which was held on February 10, 2013 at the Staples Center, Los Angeles.\n\nIn the UK, The Rape Crisis Centre, an organization that helps victims of sexual abuse and sexual violence, criticized the video. Eileen Kelly, a representative of the group, stated that the video sends \"out an inappropriate message\" and told \"The Daily Star\" that the clip \"is a disgrace. It sends the message that she is an object to be possessed by men, which is disturbingly what we see in real violence cases\". The video was also criticized by Brandon Ward, a youth pastor of Oasis Christian Center in Staten Island, New York, for \"damaging the moral and self-worth of young impressionable teens.\" Ward wrote how he thought the video affects females' sense of self-worth:\n\nThe real issue is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred ... if girls and women find their identity and self-worth in the approval of people, they will do whatever it takes to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made ... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.\n\nJohn Colonnello, a youth pastor from Athens, Alabama, criticized Rihanna's failure as a role model for young girls and women who look up to her. Colonello said that Rihanna is promoting the importance of one's physical appearance, and unhealthy sex: \"the message should be that it's about who you are on the inside and your character. That you should be honest, trustworthy, faithful, kind, loving, compassionate and more.\" The video is the third by Rihanna in 2011 to receive a negative reaction from organizations; \"S&M\" was banned from eleven countries due to its explicit sexual content, while \"Man Down\" attracted media attention when the Parents Television Council (PTC) criticized Rihanna for depicting a \"cold, calculated execution of murder\" in the video and for portraying a scenario of rape. On November 23, 2011, the music video for \"We Found Love\" was banned from broadcast before 10 pm in France, owing to its violent, dangerous, and sexually suggestive nature. Ulster Cancer Foundation, an anti-smoking organization, condemned Rihanna for smoking in the music video. Doreen Reegan, a spokesperson for the organization, commented on the singer's decision to include smoking as part of her promotional image, saying:\n\nThree-quarters of adult smokers start the habit as teenagers, which is why it is so irresponsible of Rihanna to influence her young fan base in this way ... After so much hype around the filming of the video it was very disappointing to see Rihanna so blatantly smoking throughout it ... Artists such as Rihanna are held in high esteem and regarded as role models by millions of young people.\n\nAfter the release of the video, critics commented on the resemblance between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of \"New York\" magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of \"Billboard\" magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of \"Spin\" provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing \"The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps\". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, \"The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts ... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good.\" In conclusion, Goodman commented that the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: \"during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?\"\n\nThe video also received comparisons to Spears' \"Criminal\", which was released two days before \"We Found Love\", on October 17, 2011. Critics noted that both videos were filmed in the United Kingdom and caused controversy there, both contain scenes of sex, violence, and crime, and both featured \"bad boy\" stereotypes and evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph of PopDust noted that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, regardless of whether they have moved on from past situations, because the discussion about them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears nor Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to—their videos are much more effective than anything the singers could reveal in an interview. Rae Alexandra of the \"SF Weekly\" wrote that both videos feature an anti-British sentiment and that the villains in the video, Rihanna's boyfriend and Spears' policemen, are British, whereas Spears' savior in her video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to film their grittiest videos in a country with a lower crime rate than the United States. According to her, the videos continue with a tradition of xenophobic portrayals of British people as villains by American film and video directors.\n\nThe video for \"We Found Love\" references popular culture in the form of films. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, its main themes are sex, drugs, and violence, which feature heavily in works by independent filmmaker Gregg Araki. Many of Araki's films, including \"Totally Fucked Up\" (1993), \"The Doom Generation\" (1995) and \"Nowhere\" (1997), depict scenes of a sexual nature, drug abuse and violence as part of their narratives. \"We Found Love\"s use of vibrant colors and imagery is reminiscent of Oliver Stone's 1994 film \"Natural Born Killers\", which depicts two murderers, Mickey and Mallory, on a killing spree in the southwest of the United States. The film incorporates \"nightmarish-colors\" and rear wall projected imagery, similar to that shown in \"We Found Love\". Critics noted that the music video features visual effects that resembled those in Darren Aronofskys film \"Requiem for a Dream\" (2000), which incorporates a close-up shot of a dilated pupil; this effect was used many times in \"We Found Loves video.\n\nElements of the music video for \"We Found Love\" have been compared to the works of Britney Spears, Eminem and Madonna. The scene in which Rihanna and O'Shaughnessy blow marijuana exhalations into each other's mouths is stylistically reminiscent of the cover artwork on English musician Tricky's 2001 album \"Blowback\". Rihanna's video was compared to the video for Spears' song \"Everytime\" (2004). Critics noted that Rihanna lay in a bathtub and submerged her head under the water, which can be interpreted as a suicide attempt. In \"Everytime\", Spears is shown as a successful singer constantly bothered by the media and paparazzi about her turbulent relationship with her boyfriend. In \"Everytime\"s video, Spears drowns in a bathtub as a result of a concussion. Rihanna's video also bears resemblances to that for Eminem and Rihanna's \"Love the Way You Lie\" (2010); both contain lyrical and visual content about a doomed relationship and scenes of graphic violence and substance abuse. Like \"We Found Love\", \"Love the Way You Lie\" displays scenes of a couple in various stages of undress and intimacy. \"We Found Love\"s video includes stylistic references to Madonna's video for \"Ray of Light\" (1998). James Montgomery of MTV News noted that \"Ray of Light\"s video features \"a whole lot of high-speed, time-lapse shots taken in cities around the world\", the same technique used for the drug scenes in \"We Found Love\".\n\n"}
