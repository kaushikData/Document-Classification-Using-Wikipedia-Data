Stephen Peace and John DeBello, and directed by John DeBello based upon an original idea by Costa Dillon. The screenplay was written by Dillon, Peace, and DeBello. The film is a spoof of B movies. Made on a budget less than US$100,000, the story involves tomatoes becoming sentient by unknown means and revolting against humanity. \n\nThe success of the film led to three sequels, all co-written by the same three writers and directed by DeBello.\n\nThe film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film \"The Birds\" (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a precredits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance with which she is covered is not blood, but tomato juice.\n\nA series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occurs (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of \"Jaws\"). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that no credible threat exists, the President puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes, led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Adolf Hitler; scuba diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.\n\nSmith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \"pass the ketchup.\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the President sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency Mind Makers, where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys, including a bumper sticker with \"STP\" for \"Stop Tomato Program\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \"whip inflation now\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \"WIN\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s. A human is revealed to be also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him, but misses. A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor, who sends Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter, he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon, but loses him.\n\nGretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the West Coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon, walking among the rubble, sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon, but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died, and he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin in a \"slow car chase\" that has since been copied by other comedies. Dixon is eventually knocked out by his own car. Awakening, Dixon finds himself captured by Richardson. Though he did not create the killer tomatoes, he has discovered how to control them and plans to do so once civilization has collapsed - leaving him in control. He is about to reveal his secret of control to Dixon when Finletter charges in and runs him through with his sword. Dixon, picking up some strewn records, realizes that he has seen the tomatoes retreat at the sound of the song \"Puberty Love\", but had not put two and two together until now. He orders Finletter to gather all remaining people and bring them to the stadium. Finletter remarks that \"only crazy people\" are left in the nearly deserted city, resulting in a motley assortment of people in costumes facing the attacking tomatoes at the stadium.\n\nThe tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. \"Puberty Love\" is played over the loudspeaker, causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild, meanwhile, is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs, hence cannot hear the music. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to \"Puberty Love\". He professes his love to her, in song. The film ends with a carrot that rises from the soil and says \"All right, you guys. They're gone now.\"\n\n\nThe film also contains the first screen appearance of Dana Ashbrook, then aged 10 or 11, as Boy on Boat (uncredited).\n\nThe finished film contains footage of a real helicopter crash. In a scene showing law enforcement officers firing their weapons to ward off tomatoes in a field, a $60,000 Hiller Aircraft UH-12E that had been rented for the production was supposed to have landed in the tomato patch behind the officers, but during the landing, its tail rotor struck the ground, causing the craft to spin out of control near the ground, roll over, and burst into flames. The helicopter pilot escaped without serious injury. The crash was caught on film as the cameras were rolling at the time. The crash was later worked into the film.\n\nThe theme song, written by DeBello, describes the tomatoes' rampages through the world, describing that they have killed a man named Herman Farbage while he was taking out the garbage, that the mayor is on vacation to get out of stopping them, that they have scared off the National Guard, and that they have even eaten the narrator's sister. This theme song is used in different variations over the course of the series, here simply sounding like the score of an old monster movie with lyrics and a more catchy tune. All other music was written by Gordon Goodwin and Paul Sundfor with lyrics by Dillon, DeBello, and Peace.\n\nThe song \"Puberty Love\" was sung by the then-teenaged Matt Cameron, who later became the drummer for Soundgarden and since 1998 has been the drummer for Pearl Jam.\n\nThe film received negative reviews and has become a cult film.\n\n\"Variety\" wrote that the film \"isn't even worthy of sarcasm.\"\n\nA number of sequels and other spin-off material have been done in various media as a result of this movie. They include three movie sequels:\n\n\nThe sequel \"Return of the Killer Tomatoes\" picks up the story 10 years later. The film is notable for the casting of George Clooney in one of his first film roles.\nAmerican composer and orchestrator Gordon Goodwin, one of the original composers for the film, later wrote an Emmy-nominated, big-band piece inspired by the music for this film, to be played with his jazz ensemble Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band. \n\n\nIn 2008, a remake was announced. Kent Nichols and Douglas Sarine, creators of \"Ask a Ninja\", were developing the project. This was to be Nichols' directorial debut. M. Dal Walton III was co-producing along with Emmett/Furla Films. In 2011, John DeBello said that the \"Ask a Ninja\" creators were no longer involved. In July 2018, Steve Peace and Costa Dillon announced a new sequel at the San Diego Comic Book Convention. Dustin Ferguson is rumored to be directing the new installment.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52065517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52065517", "title": "Battlerite", "text": "Battlerite\n\nBattlerite is a free-to-play team-based action game based on multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) gameplay developed and published by Stunlock Studios. The game is considered a spiritual successor to \"Bloodline Champions\" and is created by the same developers. An early access version of the game was released in September 2016, selling over 440,000 copies within three months, and was officially released on November 7, 2017.\n\nIn May 2018, the developers announced the development of a new free-to-play game mode based on the battle royale genre planned to be released in the summer of the same year. In August 2018, the developers announced that the game mode would no longer be free and instead would be released as a standalone game planned to be released by the end of September of the same year.\n\nBattlerite consists of two teams, with two or three players each, battling against each other. Before the game begins, each player chooses a unique playable character called a Champion with unique offensive, defensive, and movement abilities. Defeating every player on the enemy team wins the round for your team, and winning three rounds wins your team the game. Rounds have a timer of around two minutes, and when the timer runs out a Sudden Death boundary appears which gradually forces players into a small area in the center of the map. Games may be played on one of several maps, each favoring different strategies.\n\nUnlike traditional MOBA games, the goal of the game is not to destroy towers or other base structures. Additionally, players do not kill neutral units to gain resources, and therefore players cannot buy items or other resources in the game to augment their character's stats or abilities. This leads to an action-focused gameplay with in short matches compared to the longer strategy-focused games common in the genre.\n\n\"Battlerite\" received mainly favorable reviews from critics; on aggregate review website Metacritic the game attains an overall score of 85 out of 100..\n\nPC Gamer gave the game a score of 89%, praising the game's pace, free-to-play model, and simplicity compared to other games in its genre. Similarly, IGN's Ian Nowakowski gave Battlerite a score of 8.2/10. While criticizing the randomized progression rewards as \"lackluster,\" Nowakowski concludes \"Battlerite strikes true where it counts, and that’s in the arena. The teamfighting hits hard at the core of what makes competitive gaming so engaging hour after hour.\"\n\nBattlerite quickly rose in popularity upon launch. Two weeks after the game launched on Steam's Early Access, Stunlock Studios claimed they had already amassed 200,000 players, despite the fact that at the time the game was pay-to-play. As of right now, Battlerite has a small player base. According to SteamCharts, in 2017 player count peaked in November with 44,850 players in that month; as of 2018 the average monthly peak has decreased to less than 4,000.\n\nPC Gamer included Battlerite in its list of the best free games on the Steam platform.\n"}

He organised the travelling group, and in October 1971, they departed on their tour. The group travelled around New Zealand in a very distinctive red bus, concluding in January 1973 at the first large outdoor music festival in New Zealand, The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival before heading up the eastern seaboard of Australia and performing at the 1973 Aquarius Festival at the Northern Rivers NSW hippie town of Nimbin.\n\nThe group lived in a commune for many years. Three families, including Bruno Lawrence's and Geoff Murphy's, lived together. The group came to the attention of those in the New Zealand film industry and were at times employed to create work for TVNZ. The group were labeled as hippies during this time and were looked down upon by some in the industry despite the quality and nature of their work. \nThroughout the years that Blerta traveled the line up changed, over time members included Lawrence, Fane Flaws, Beaver, Geoff Murphy, Tony Barry, Ian Watkin, Mick Liber as well as many others, of which some had previously worked with Bruno in bands and others joined along the way. The original line up was Bruno Lawrence, Corben Simpson, Kemp Turirangi, Geoff Murphy, Alan Moon, Tony Littlejohn, Beaver, Eric Foley, and Chris Seresin. The great adventure and experience of Blerta finished in 1975 when the troupe went out with one last tour.\n\nAlthough Bruno Lawrence and Geoff Murphy were friends for many years the two had a falling out five years prior to Bruno Lawrence's death. The two never reconciled and Murphy was absent from Lawrence's funeral.\n\n"}

{"id": "43354333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43354333", "title": "Cannabis and time perception", "text": "Cannabis and time perception\n\nThe effect of cannabis on time perception has been studied with inconclusive results. Studies show consistently throughout the literature that most cannabis users self-report the experience of a slowed perception of time. In the laboratory, researchers have confirmed the effect of cannabis on the perception of time in both humans and animals. Studies have sought to explain how cannabis changes the internal clock. Matthew et al. (1998) looked at the cerebellum, positing a relationship between cerebellar blood flow and the distortion of time perception.\n\nReports of the effects of cannabis on time perception can be found first in arts and literature, and then in medical reports and studies. Notable discussions of the effects occur in \"Le Club des Hachichin\" (1846), a work by French poet Théophile Gautier, and in \"Les Paradis Artificiels\" (1860), a work by Charles Baudelaire. French physician Jacques-Joseph Moreau studied the effects of cannabis with the help of Gautier and other artists who experimented with hashish in the Club des Hashischins. Moreau published his findings in \"Hashish and Mental Illness: Psychological Studies\" (1846), noting that hashish caused \"errors of time and space\" and \"time dragging\".\n\nLater, in 1958, South African physician Frances Ames studied the effects of cannabis extract, noting the \"disordered time perception\" experienced by her subjects where \"brief periods seemed immensely long\". American poet Allen Ginsberg's \"First Manifesto to End the Bringdown\" (1966) noted that \"the vast majority all over the world who have smoked the several breaths necessary to feel the effect, adjust to the strangely familiar sensation of Time slow-down.\" American physician Jerome Groopman of Harvard Medical School, reported that the \"perception of time is altered, generally with perceived time faster than clock time\" in people who have ingested cannabis. Multiple review studies have confirmed these reports.\n\nMost notably, cannabis has had a long association among musicians and the music industry. Musicians and audiences who use cannabis often report the primary subjective effects as a distortion of time perception, which acts to augment both musical performance and music appreciation. Contrary to the effects produced by stimulant use, cannabis use is reported to give the performer or listener a subjective perception of time expansion, resulting in the overestimation of the passage of time. Dosage and method of ingestion may lessen or accentuate this effect. This subjective effect of time expansion is responsible for most of the anecdotal accounts in the literature. The effects of cannabis on musicians and those who listen to music are the subject of research in social pharmacology and music therapy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7907849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7907849", "title": "Community media", "text": "Community media\n\nCommunity media are any form of media that function in service of or by a community. It is the rise of all kinds of alternative, oppositional, participatory and collaborative media practices that have developed in the journalistic context of ‘community media,’ ‘we media,’ ‘citizens media,’ ‘grassroot journalism’ or any radical alternative to on and offline mainstream journalistic practices . In other words, it is having access to or creating local alternatives to mainstream broadcasting , like local community newspapers, radio stations, or magazines. Community Media aids in the process of building citizenship and raising social awareness. “Participation” and “access” are a large aspect in the rise of community media. Those who create media are being encouraged to involve themselves in providing a platform for others to express views. Community media is often given parameters when being defined by groups, but often challenges these boundaries with its broad yet narrow structure. \nCommunity media are generally defined as a distinct sector of the media for their independence, base in civil society and provision of a social service as opposed to seeking profits. They serve as a third sector of the media apart from private and public media and are important in giving communities a platform to express their concerns for local issues, engage in democratic debate and deliver a reliable access to information. However, there is no consensus on a definition as each region displays unique forms of community media.\n\nCommunity media can take all the forms of other conventional media, such as print, radio, television, Web-based and mixed media.\n\nCommunity radio is particularly widespread around the world with radio stations being founded to inform their listeners on issues important to the community.\n\nGrassroots media is focused more specifically on media making by and for the local community that it serves making the discussion more narrow and precise. It is essentially a subset focusing on small scale media projects which aim to bring different visions and perspectives to the \"codes\" ,that are so easily embedded in the social psyche.\n\nDespite the social service they provide through their focus on local issues, community media often face a number of challenges, including unfavourable regulation, censorship, unfair licensing processes, inequitable access to the frequency spectrum, lack of formal recognition, low funding, lack of skilled journalists and media professionals, and competition from private and state broadcasters.\n\nThe first Public-access television station in the United States considered to be community media was set up in 1968 in Dale City, Virginia. It was managed by the city's Junior Chamber of Commerce and ran programming for two years without advertising. It closed due to lack of financing, equipment, and infrastructure. Another early example of community media is found in the counter-culture video collectives of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nVideofreex, Video Free America, and Global Village used new technologies to the benefit of community interests. In addition, the Raindance Corporation founded by Michael Shamberg, Paul Ryan, and others became known as \"guerrilla television.\" The premise of guerrilla television was to non-violently blaze a new trail for the creation of media as an alternative to broadcast television. This initial activity was made possible by Sony's introduction of the video Porta-Pak.\n\nCommunity media in the US does have some lobbying efforts. One of these is the Alliance for Community Media, which “works to protect the interests of [communitymedia centers]”. They do not provide technical training for running multimedia operations rather, they work to support these centers through advocacy and education about what community media is. A major resource for those seeking access to community media in the United States is the Community Media Database. The Community Media Database acts as a directory for the community media companies located around the United States. Here, users can use the interactive map to find community media access in their area, as well as other resources on organizations whose focus is to advance the cause of community media within the country. The Alliance for Community Media also represents local community groups, public schools, religious institutions, colleges and universities, government officials, second language communities, and national institutions (NASA, the US Department ofEducation, the US Army).To become a single member of the alliance one must pay an fee of $200. This fee is for those who work for the cause of Community Media and the ACM (e.g. staff, government officials, board directors). Supporters can pay a fee of only $50 and get membership to the regional group, single access to the ACM listserv, and discounted rates to ACM and Regional conferences and educational events. Examples of people who would get the supporter members are volunteers, students, and retirees. However anyone can sign up to get updates and newsletters from the ACM for free. An example of Community Media can be found in Washington, D.C., with a focus on the fight to gain statehood for D.C. One site for community media include the DCi Reporter which is an online website reporting D.C. area news and statehood news. Another is the public access, DCTV which has a wide variety of programming for D.C. residents, and also reports on D.C. statehood news. \n\nThe Benton Foundation is a non-profit organization founded by Charles Benton in 1981 to ensure that media “serves the public interest and enhances democracy”. The foundation seeks to raise awareness and accessibility to community within the United States. They also have a strong focus on ensuring that media contentis responsive and centralized to local communities.\n\nCanada also has a central role in the development of community media and is by many considered the birthplace of community broadcasting. In the 1960s, the National Film Board of Canada set up a project called Challenge for Change which was a series of documentary films addressing socio-economic issues. Once again Sony's Porta-Pak proved revolutionary in Canada as well. In 1968, filmmakers Bonny Klein and Dorothy He`naut persuaded Challenge for Change to take on more local community issues. During the same year they trained members of the St. Jacques Citizens' Committee in video production. The committee went into the Montreal slums and captured interview footage with poor people and then presented the video in public meetings for discussion.\n\nThe history of community radio dates back to amateur radio organizations that formed in 1906. From a historical perspective, the seminal example of community radio is Lewis Hill's Pacifica Radio. KPFA in Berkeley, California began broadcasting in 1949 after acquiring an FCC license for FM spectrum. This first Pacifica station was funded through listener support and philanthropic foundations. Pacifica's mandate, that Hill expressed as \"to engage in any activity that shall contribute to the lasting understanding between nations and between the individuals of all nations, races, creeds, and colors,\" has served to frame the community media movement through its historical and technological development.\n\nCommunity media in China serves as a tool for the propaganda department to promote its ideologies. It is a strictly government operated media includes television, radio and newspaper. This refers to the unique historical condition (Tiananmen Square Protests) of a wealthy and powerful Communist Party-governed state that lacks democracy. The Communist Party governs everything and everyone, and answers to thing but itself. It stands above the law. WeChat has all the features of Facebook Messenger, the usefulness of Venmo and Paypal. Users can post Moments on their walls, order taxi service or movie tickets, and in general utilize the app not just for communication but for daily services. Anything that is posted on or is sent out to friends on WeChat are being monitored by the Chinese government.\n\n“Sina weibo” is like a Chinese microblog. There are almost 540 million people are users of Sina weibo. It is a stage for people to post their comments, pictures, videos, articles and advertisements. Now, there are many celebrities using this stage to post advertisement and get more attention from people, not only the Chinese celebrities are using Sina weibo, there are some Korean, Hollywood celebrities are communicating with their followers through this special community media. Anyone can register an account and it has to be verified by the real ID. But people do not have to use their real information after resisting, and they are free to talk about their own life but if there are some information that against the political policy, then it will be deleted. \n\nCommunity media are widely recognized by governments, international development agencies, and civil society organizations alike as key agents of participatory development. Their reach and practices are a unique way of reaching and involving people. This is particularly true of community radio, the most prevalent of all community media, which is a vital alternative both to state owned and commercial private radio. Community radio‘s affordability and reach make it a powerful agent of social change.\n\nRecognition of community radio as a legitimate and key element in development efforts and the potential to empower marginalized and disenfranchised communities, has pushed a number of countries to introduce laws and regulations that acknowledge community radios as a distinct media sector. In those countries an enabling environment for community radios has been created.\n\nDespite these advances, challenges persist at global and regional level and in their joint 2010 statement the four international special UN mandated rapporteurs on freedom of expression (*) expressed their concerns at the lack of specific legal recognition of the community broadcasting sector in licensing systems which are based on criteria that are appropriate to this sector as well as the failure to reserve adequate frequencies for community broadcasters or to establish appropriate funding support mechanism .\n\nThe Ministry of Information Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh has declared Community Radio Installation, Broadcast and Operation Policy 2008, which was the citizens’ expectation since the year 1998. Accordingly in April, 2010, Ministry of Information has approved 14 Community Radio Stations to operate for the first time in the country.\n\nAfter the approval of license Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has allocated frequency and then the Community Radio stations started broadcasting from 2011.\n\nNow 14 Community Radio Stations are on-air in the country, aiming to ensure empowerment and right to information for the rural community. They are broadcasting altogether 120 hours program per day on information, education, local entertainment and development motivation activities. Around 536 Youth Women & Youth are now working with those Stations throughout the country as rural broadcasters\n\nThese programs are quite supportive to the activities reflected in 6th 5-year plan of Government of Bangladesh, UN World Summit on the Information Society (UN WSIS) Action Plan, and UN Millennium Development Goals (UN MDGs) and UN Convention Against Corruption (UN CAC)\n\nThe success of the 1st batch of Community Radio stations has earned appreciation from all levels because of their commendable success. For that we give our thanks to those initiating organizations.\n\nWe are also giving thanks to the Ministry of Information that it is because of their good intention and sincere efforts which made possible a full-fledged community radio policy, the only one in South East Asia. India has got only a Guideline to operate Community Radio stations, while Nepal does not have any of this kind. In 2012 Ministry of Information has declared National Strategy for Community Radio to support implementation of Community Radio Installation, broadcast and Operation Policy.\n\nBangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication is promoting the advocacy with the government in relations to community radio with other organizations since its emergence from 2000. BNNRC has been addressing the community radio and community TV access issue for over a decade, helping to bridge the information gap of rural Bangladesh.\n\nThe reality of today is that the bondage between the community people and local-level community radio stations are getting strengthened day-by-day. Community Radio has now become their part of life. Community Radio becomes the instrument for the livelihood battle of the rural people.\n\nBangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication established the Community Media News Agency (CMNA), Community Media Academy (CMA) and Monthly Community Media to share development news & building capacity for the Community Media sector in Bangladesh.\n\nWe have now started advocacy with the Government of Bangladesh to open up Community Television for Development. We hope that, community television will come into being within a short time in Bangladesh.\n\nIn this context the present status of community radio stations regarding social, economic and institutional sustainability can be pointed as below:\n\nSocial Sustainability:\ni. Management Committee formed at 14 Community Radio station level\nii. Advisory Committee formed for each station that included UNO and Additional District Commissioner\niii. 2115 Listeners Clubs formed at CR Station level\niv. The present number of CR listeners is around 46,47,000\nv. People of 67 Upazila under 13 districts now listen Community Radio Programs\n\nSustainability at Govt. level: \ni. Ministry of Information declared Community Radio Installation, broadcast and operation Policy 2008.\nii. Ministry of Information prepared and declared Community Radio Strategy 2012\niii. Digital Bangladesh Strategy Paper-prepared by the Prime Minister’s Office\niv. Charter of Chang 2008\nInstitutional Sustainability \ni.

Formulation and Implementation of Development Advertisement Policy \nv. Sharing allocation of local and national budget/s.\nvi. Community Radio Development Fund creation and operation.\n\nPotentials of Community Radio in Bangladesh\na. Community Radio has created scope for the poor and marginalized community to raise their own voice; it becomes the voice for the voiceless. This neo-media outlets opened scope to establish their rights of Information and communication in social, political, cultural and environmental arena.\n\nb. Scope widened for poverty reduction and sustainable development because of the rights to raise voice of the community and accessibility to knowledge and information.\n\nc. Scope opened for exchange of dialogue between local elected representatives, govt. and NGO professionals for the sake of establishing good governance.\n\nd. Direct linkage established between the community and the main sectors reflected in MDGs and 6th 5-year plan.\n\ne. Scope created for Social debate, inclusion and preservation of cultural diversity by ensuring the inclusion of the marginalized community.\n\nf. Community Radio is now able to play more active role in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) due to establishment of effective linkage between the govt. departments and local/rural community.\n\nAlready the Community radio programs have been widely accepted among the local community.14 community radio stations presently covers more than 4.6 million listeners. This journey was not a bed of roses, we are to cross ups and downs-everyday we are to face newer challenges.\n\nThe Community Radios are becoming an active ground for organizing dialogues at rural level. These dialogues will help the rural mass to find out their own voice and ensure leverage their free opinion in respect of social, economic, political, cultural and environmental issues\n\nCommunity television and radio in Europe arose \"from criticism of a monopolistic public service system that was considered out of touch\". The experimental period of community media expression in Europe began in the 1970s after North American Public-access television was underway. It was therefore seen as a model but also understood that the media environments were structurally different.\n\nA powerful community media example external to both North America and Europe is the Bolivian Miners' Radio of the 1940s. The station was established by the local miner's union and became an important tool for communication, resistance, and educational and cultural expression.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, several catholic groups across Latin America drawing inspiration from liberation theology, formed their own community media projects from Patagonia to the Rio Grande. They explored several diverse technologies including theater, dance, puppets, mural paint, loudspeakers in their alternative media projects. One of the key figures in this media restructuring process was the Catholic Bishop Juan Luis Ysern and his communication project Radio Estrella Del Mar(REM), located on the archipelago of Chiloe in Southern Chile. REM was first conceived as a medium that serves the communities in the region of Chiloe. Started during the period of Pinochet dictatorship, REM produced several radio shows and news features and still continues to broadcast locally produced programmes by the communities 24 hours a day. The current director of REM, Miguel Millar says: \n\n\"The ultimate goal of the project is to ensure that both the administration of the radio and most of the programming stay under the control of the community.\" \n\nUNESCO released the Community Media Sustainability Policy Series to help community broadcasters overcome the obstacles they face in establishing and sustaining their operations. This series presents the following recommendations put forward by stakeholders and participants at an international seminar for Community Media Sustainability: Strengthening Policies and Funding event held by UNESCO in 2015 to promote a healthy policy environment:\n\n\"Definition of community broadcasting\": community broadcasters should be defined by their independent nature, community governance and focus on issues of local concern.\n\n\"Formal recognition\": community broadcasters should be considered separate from private and state media in a country’s laws and given the same protection afforded to other media.\n\n\"Licensing\": a country should ensure that licensing procedures are fair and transparent, as well as less demanding than the process for commercial media.\n\n\"Spectrum\": a minimum percentage of the broadcasting spectrum should be reserved for community media use.\n\n\"Provision of public funding\": countries should ensure that a continued source of funding is provided for community broadcasters to apply for to increase their sustainability.\n\n\"Access to Private Funding and Support\": community broadcasters should be allowed the right to utilize private sources of funding, such as income through advertising.\n\n\"Digital provisions\": countries should ensure that community media can access and afford opportunities in the digital space.\n\nMinorities are typically underrepresented in community media in the United States, according to a 2015 study by the American Society of News Editors and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Florida International University. Genia Stevens has stated that by \"creating a space where minority communities have the tools to spread their message to a larger audience, community media provides a platform that allows authentic relationships to develop, grow and thrive\". \n\nMinorities of all ages can benefit from engaging in community media. The skills to create their own media, through video, photo and audio recording can be made available for those wishing to directly engage and provide their community with media. When it comes to engagement, there can be those who engage and follow the community media, and also those who learn the necessary skills to produce community media. These skills can be learned by different minority groups and this education can provide numerous opportunities.\n\n\n\n"}

The series was created and is managed by energy drinks company Red Bull. It is similar to ski cross and snowboard cross, except with ice skates on an ice track, instead of skis or snowboards on a snow track.\n\nCompetitors, having advanced from one of the tryouts in the prior months, race in heats of four skaters, with the top two advancing from each heat. Racers, typically ice hockey players (however, the seven times single event winner Jasper Felder was a bandy player, who in that sport represented USA, while in ice cross dowhill represented Sweden), outfitted as such, speed down the course’s turns, berms, and jumps.\n\nFrom 2010 onwards a points system was introduced. After the season, the skater with the most points is crowned the world champion. Points are awarded to the top 100 racers. Points are awarded starting with 1000 for the winner, after that 800, 600, 500 and decreasing to 0.5 for place 100.\n\nFor the 2015 season, the Riders Cup events were instituted. The events were designed to make the sport more accessible to more skaters. For these events, skaters can earn up to 25% of the points that the main events are awarded, with percentages decreasing with each placing. Meaning that the winner receives 250 points, which is 25% of the main event 1000 points and it decreases to 1% of the main event points for the 64th finisher, who receives 2.5 points. Any placings 65th and beyond do not score any points.\n\nAs well, a new wrinkle was added to the overall championship called the \"throw out\" rule. If a competitor competes in all of the stops, up to a maximum of 12 events in future years, the lowest main event score and the lowest Riders Cup score will be thrown out. This will give the skater an adjusted score for the overall championship. Thus, meaning that it is in the skater's best interest to compete in all events.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10464816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10464816", "title": "Cuban folk music", "text": "Cuban folk music\n\nCuban folk music includes a variety of traditional folk music of Cuba, and has been influenced by the Spanish and the African culture as well as the remaining indigenous population of the Caribbean.\n\nDuring the 1960s, a methodological organization was consistently applied to the Cuban popular music; and that methodology, called of the \"generic complexes\" was mainly based on the works of Cuban musicologist Argeliers León. In his book Del canto y el tiempo, León divided the study of Cuban popular music in several sections presented in the following order: \"Música yoruba\", \"Música bantú\", \"Música abakuá\", \"Música guajira\", \"El son\", \"La rumba\", \"La guaracha\", \"La canción y el bolero\", \"Música instrumental\", \"De la contradanza al danzón, al chachachá\" and \"Hacia el presente, en el presente\".\n\nDr. Olavo Alén says about the \"generic complex system\": \"In his book Música Folklórica Cubana as well as in his opus masterpiece Del canto y el tiempo, he (León) shows us a panoramic view of our music departing fundamentally from the description of the original genres of Cuba. But those divisions proposed by Argeliers didn't pretend to be as rigorous as a scientific organization that would be in compliance with the classificatory principles of coherence, exclusivity, exhaustivity and most importantly, dychotomy.\"\n\nAccording to the Cuban popular music \"Generic complex theory\", Cuban folk music is classified as follows:\n\n\nThe \"Generic complex theory\" has been refuted since long time ago by renowned musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, which explains in his article titled \"About the Generic Complexes and other matters\":\n\nAccording to Cuban composer and musicographist Armando Rodríguez Ruidíaz:\n\nFrom the elaboration and fusion process of the first Spanish song-dances with sesquiáltera rhythm that arrived in Cuba, such as the Sarabanda and Chacona from the 16th century, three main lines of generic evolution originated, which may be classified as follows:\n\n1 – The \"song-dances\", which include in chronological order: the Punto cubano and Zapateo, The Cuban Guaracha, the Rural Rumba, and the Urban Rumba, the popular conga, the son, the mambo, the songo and the timba.\n2 – The \"dance-songs\", comprised by genres such as the Cuban Contradanza and Danza, the Danzón, the Danzonete, the Danzón-mambo and the Cha-cha-chá (music).\n\n3 – The \"songs\", composed of the Habanera, the Cuban Bolero, the Guajira, the Clave, the Criolla, the Tango-congo, the Salon Conga, the Pregón, and other hybrid genres such as the Guaracha-Son, the Guajira-Son, the Bolero-Son, the Lamento-Son, the Criolla-Bolero, the Bolero-Danzón, the Canción-Habanera and the Canción-Bolero.\n\nAccording to its encyclopedic definition, the term folk music (that derives from the German word \"folk\" or people in English) serves to designate the music spontaneously created and preserved by the people of a country, in contrast with the terms commercial and classical music, which are related to works generated by trained specialists.\n\nIn the case of Cuban music, some of its most popular musical genres may be considered within the boundaries of the previous definition. The first Cuban popular music genres that emerged to the public awareness at the beginning of the 19th century, known as Punto cubano and Zapateo, were created by peasants without any formal musical education; as well as the popular styles of Rumba Urbana or \"de cajón\" (wooden boxes) and the Cuban Carnival Conga (music).\n\nAlso the Cuban Guaracha was considered to be a product of the common people from Havana, in a similar way as the Rural Rumbas and other ancestors of the Son cubano (such as Changüí from Guantánamo and the Sucu-sucu in Isla de Pinos) were considered to be. The Son cubano itself was born from a synthesis of different popular styles such as the Rumba Urbana and Rumba Rural, and performed until the 1930s by amateur musicians.\n\nAnother Cuban folk music style emerged between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th in the poor neighborhoods of Havana. It was called Clave upon the name of the instrument utilized to accompany it, the Cuban Claves. This style was sung by popular choirs mostly integrated by colored people, called \"Coros de Clave\", and its rhythm was the vertical hemiola, also utilized in the ternary Cuban Contradanza.\n\nCuba also has produced a wealth of folk musical instruments. Among the most important ones we should mention the Claves, the Bongo drum and the Conga, derived from original African instruments; as well as the Tres, a descendant of the Spanish Laúd. There are also others less well known folk instruments such as the Tingo-Talango or Tumbandera (Ground bow), the Botija and the Marímbula, a sort of African Mbira.\n\nSome well known Cuban folk music artists are: Punto singer Celina González, trovadores Sindo Garay and María Teresa Vera as well as soneros Ignacio Piñeiro, Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz Telles (Compay Segundo), Ibrahim Ferrer and Rubén Gonzalez.\n\n"}
{"id": "20057465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20057465", "title": "Dracula 2: The Last Sanctuary", "text": "Dracula 2: The Last Sanctuary\n\nDracula 2: The Last Sanctuary (originally released as Dracula: The Last Sanctuary) is a 2000 point-and-click adventure video game developed by Wanadoo and jointly published by Index+, France Telecom Multimedia, Canal+ Multimedia and Cryo Interactive. Originally released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS, it was ported to the PlayStation in 2002. In 2012, a slightly modified version developed and published by Microïds was released for iOS and OS X, and, in 2013, for Android. In 2014, the remade iOS/OS X/Android version was made available on Steam.\n\nThe game is a direct sequel to \"\", which itself is an unofficial sequel to Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\"; set seven years after the end of the novel, Jonathan Harker finds that he must once again do battle with the evil Count Dracula in an effort to save his wife, Mina. A third game, with an unrelated storyline, followed in 2008, \"\". A loose sequel to \"Path of the Dragon\" was released in a two-part form in 2013; \"\" and \"\".\n\n\"Dracula: The Last Sanctuary\" was most widely reviewed for the PC, where it received mixed reviews, with critics praising the graphics, but criticising the nature of some of the puzzles. By 2007, the game and its predecessor had reached combined global sales above 1 million units.\n\n\"Dracula: The Last Sanctuary\" is a first-person point-and-click adventure game, which employs an \"empty\" HUD; the player's inventory is accessible through a button press, whilst another button press will bring the player to a screen with options to save their game, quit their game, or load a previously saved game. As such, the entire screen depicts only direct gameplay.\n\nThe game uses a basic point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the game world. Within each static screen, the player is free to look around 360 degrees. As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), an arrow within a red circle (access temporarily blocked) a hand (the player can take the object), a magnifying glass (an area which can be examined in more detail), a backwards arrow (the player can move backwards from an area with which they have examined via the magnifying glass), a cog (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction with the object), a cog with a hand (the player can operate the object without using an inventory item), an object within a red circle (use of the item temporarily prohibited).\n\nThe most often encountered symbol in the game is the cog. When the player encounters this symbol, they must enter their inventory and select an item. If it is the correct item to operate the object, the item will appear in a green circle, replacing the cog icon. If it is the incorrect item, the cog icon will remain.\nThe game introduces two new elements not found in \"Dracula: Resurrection\"; rudimentary combat and combining inventory items. Combat mode replaces the cursor with a reticle, and occurs infrequently, involving either a revolver or a crossbow. It is usually (but not always) timed, and often requires the player to perform a particular action, such as hitting the enemy in a specific spot to achieve victory. If they fail to do so within the designated time, the player will die. In relation to combining inventory items, unlike in the first game, the inventory screen is divided into two - a full circle, and a small semi-circle on the outer edge of the screen. Items placed within the semi-circle cannot be used directly in the game itself, but must be combined by the player with items placed within the full circle. For example, the player's gun is in the full circle, but their bullets are placed within the semi circle.\n\nThe 2012 iOS version adds several new features to the game, such as an optional help feature (which highlights interactive zones on each screen), a \"quick inventory\" (which allows the player to hold one item and access it without having to enter the inventory screen), an autosave feature, and a \"Compass Look\" feature (which utilises the gyroscopic-based iDevice accelerometer controls to mimic looking around in the 360 degree environment).\n\nThe game opens with the final scene from \"Dracula: Resurrection\"; Jonathan Harker (voiced by David Gasman) rescuing his wife Mina (Gay Marshall) from Dracula's castle and vowing to defeat the Count upon returning to London. Harker has come to realise Dracula called Mina to Transylvania precisely so Harker would follow her. Upon arriving in the Borgo Pass, Dracula knew Harker would uncover the Dragon Ring, which Dracula himself could not do as it had been placed under the protection of Saint George. Harker then brought the ring to the castle just as Dracula had planned. Once Harker arrived in the castle, Dracula had instructed his brides to kill him and take the ring, but Harker had been able to rescue Mina and escape, with the ring still in his possession.\n\nAs the game begins, Harker has left the Dragon Ring with Dr. Seward (Paul Barrett), and has gone to Dracula's former London home, Carfax Abbey, to search for clues. Inside, he is attacked by several bat-like humanoids. He manages to destroy them, and heads to Seward's insane asylum. Seward tells Harker that Dracula has purchased a cinema in London called The Styx. He also informs him that his research has led him to conclude part of the Dragon Ring is missing - a diamond at its centre which is said to counteract the evil of the outer ring. In an effort to determine how to proceed against Dracula, Seward puts Mina under hypnosis and she describes the nearby Highgate Cemetery. Harker heads to the cemetery, where he see Dracula entering a secret tomb. He attempts to follow, but a light is omitted from some nearby stone gargoyles, and he is knocked out.\n\nHe wakes up the next day and heads back to the asylum to find Mina and Seward have been taken by Dracula. In Seward's safe, he finds the Dragon Ring and correspondence between Seward and a colleague, who had found a 15th-century book which details the rivalry between Vlad Tepes and his younger brother Radu. When their father, Dracul, died, he left the Dragon Ring to Radu on the advice of his magician, Dorko. Tepes was furious and locked Radu in his castle, banished Dorko to the dungeons, and split the ring in two, hiding the diamond and keeping the outer ring for himself. Tepes then had a heretical monk, Thadeus, build a \"Last Sanctuary\" deep within the castle, to which he could retreat in times of crisis. For safe keeping, Harker gives the Dragon Ring to Hopkins (Steve Gadler), a patient in the asylum who was under the influence of Dracula, but who has fallen in love with Mina, and is willing to help Harker save her.\n\nHarker heads to The Styx, but is gassed. He awakens in Dracula's bedroom in Transylvania. Dracula (Allan Wenger) tells him he will spare his life if Harker reveals where the Dragon Ring is, but Harker refuses. Dracula leaves, promising Harker a slow death. Shortly thereafter, Hopkins arrives and releases Harker. When he leaves the room, he realises he is still in The Styx; the room was a set made to look like Dracula's room. As he explores, he encounters Seward, who is turning into a vampire. Seward tells Harker he must destroy Carfax, whilst he himself will destroy The Styx, leaving Dracula nowhere to hide in London. Harker leaves, and Seward blows up The Styx, killing himself before he turns into a vampire.\n\nHarker sets fire to Carfax and heads to Highgate, where he finds a note from Hopkins telling him how to access Dracula's tomb. With the note is the Dragon Ring. Harker enters the tomb and encounters Dracula, who tells him he is returning to Transylvania with Mina. Harker gives chase, using the mines to enter the castle. Underneath the castle, he finds an ancient prison in which he finds Radu's diamond. In the dungeons, he once again encounters Dorko (Gay Marshall), who tells him her previous betrayal of him failed to earn her Dracula's trust. He shows her the diamond, and she tells him she can reassemble the Dragon Ring, but before she does so she is stabbed by one of Dracula's brides. As she dies, she tells Harker he must restore the ring and defeat Dracula. Harker works his way through the traps in the castle, eventually taking a cable car to Dracula's keep.\n\nUpon arriving, a gypsy attacks Harker, but Hopkins appears and sacrifices himself to save him. As he dies, Hopkins gives Harker the key to the Last Sanctuary. Harker explores further, killing Dracula's remaining gypsies, and eventually entering the sanctuary itself, but he is taken prisoner by Dracula's brides. They bring him to Dracula, who tells him Mina is now his forever. Harker appeals to Mina, reminding her they are married in the eyes of God, but she says she cannot remember. He shows her their wedding ring, and she regains her memories. A furious Dracula says both she and Harker must die, but Harker combines Radu's diamond with the Dragon Ring, and Dracula is engulfed in light as the castle begins to crumble. Dracula's brides are crushed by falling debris, and Dracula himself is killed when he is impaled by a statue of Saint George. As the castle ceases collapsing, Harker embraces Mina.\n\nThe PC version of the game received \"mixed or average reviews,\" and holds an aggregate score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on fourteen reviews. In North America, its computer version sold 67,776 retail units during 2001, and 21,204 in the first six months of 2002. According to Microïds, the combined global sales of \"Dracula 2\" and its predecessor, \"Dracula: Resurrection\", surpassed 1 million copies by June 2007.\n\nAdventure Classic Gaming's Zack Howe scored the game 4 out of 5, praising the graphics; \"As with its predecessor, pre-rendered graphics are solely used for cutscenes and are truly a sight to behold. [...] All of the 3D characters are amazingly detailed. Their faces are expressive and their eyes subtly capture the different personalities.\" Although he was critical of the \"pixel-hunting\" nature of some of the puzzles, he concluded \"\"Dracula: The Last Sanctuary\" is definitely a much better game than \"Dracula: Resurrection.\" I recommend this game to any adventure fan without reservation. The excellent production values and thoughtful gameplay makes this game a worthy sequel for the series.\"\n\nIGN's Steve Butts scored it 7.8 out of 10. He too praised the graphics, saying \"Just using flat backgrounds, the game renders the illusion of a full 3D environment better than any game I've seen yet. Even better, the game looked (and ran) just as well on a simple 333MHz with a Voodoo2 as it did on a 600MHz with a Voodoo 5.\" He too was somewhat critical of some of the puzzles, but concluded \"Although some of the situations are kind of a stretch, the story is well done and interesting in its own right. Hell, even the parts that threaten your suspension of disbelief are kind of cool.\"\n\nAdventure Gamers' Christina Gmiterko scored it 3 out of 5, praising the graphics and calling them \"its strongest selling point.\" However, she was critical of the core gameplay; \"I spent a lot of the game waving my cursor across the screen to find a hot spot where an inventory item needed to be used. Once I found it I would just try combining every inventory item I had with the obstacle at hand until I found the one that worked because more often than not it wasn't reasonably obvious what item you should be using or why you should be using it. By the time I reached the end I felt like I had seen the inventory screen almost as much as I had the actual game.\"\n\nGameSpot's Ron Dulin scored it 5.5 out of 10. He criticised the game for having \"huge lapses in logic, no atmosphere, and very little in the way of respect for Bram Stoker's original story.\" He was critical of the lack of horror in the game; \"\"Dracula: The Last Sanctuary\" doesn't even manage to maintain a slightly creepy atmosphere. The opening would lead you to believe otherwise, because of its creepy music that sets the stage for a terrifying adventure. Unfortunately, this music is all but absent from the game afterward. The voice acting doesn't help: The confused-sounding actors ham it up like they're auditioning for a part in Mark Borchardt's \"Coven\".\" He concluded \"The puzzles will be enough for those who are content with being limited to the challenge of finding a way past locked doors and blocked passageways. But great games transcend their genre's limitations, while good games work within them. Mediocre games, like \"Dracula: The Last Sanctuary\", only serve to remind us of why such things are limitations in the first place.\"\n"}

Newcomer Sanya Lopez is Danaya, the youngest of the sisters and the keeper of the earth gem, played by Diana Zubiri in the original series. Lopez stated that having been compared to the original series was a big challenge for her, but in a positive way. Glaiza de Castro is the keeper of the gem of fire, Pirena, originally played by Sunshine Dizon.

In an interview with Manila Times, Richards said, \"...11 years ago. I remember I watched the show with my family and I was so mesmerized with all the special effects. [...]When I learned that GMA was doing a ‘requel’ of Encantadia, I was really wishing to be a part of the show. That’s why when they told me that I have a role in the series, I was so happy...\".\n\nEncantadia's costume designer is Francis Libiran, a world-renowned and critically acclaimed designer in the Philippines who did an extensive research to come up with the designs. According to Libiran, his team brainstormed together with Encantadia's production team and watched old clips of Encantadia in YouTube to conceptualized the character's fashion sense. The gowns of the sang'gres and Ynang Reyna is more edgy and fashionable compared to the ruggedness/cocky-themed costumes in 2005. Each gown depicts the powers and personalities of each sang'gre while showing one thing that they have in common- \"Royal\". The colors of their gowns match the colors of the gems that the Sang’gres are guarding. Just like in the original series, they wore elegant gowns when they were not in a battle. He further stated, \"A normal gown usually takes us two months to create but since we had to consider the time, we assigned a dedicated team of craftsmen to produce the outfits in just 15 days.\" According to the cast, they went on a strict diet and fitness trainings to secure their shape suited for their exquisite gowns. The cast first appeared in costumes during \"ToyCon 2016 Poplife Fan Xperience\" at the SMX Convention Center, Pasay City on June 10, 2016.\n\nAccording to a review by CNN Philippines, \"Encantadia\" lived up to its long-gestating hype. The introduction and the narration was a big step-up for the show compared to the first one. It further stated that the new iteration looks better than the original and paces itself well in terms of narrative and plot. CNN was also impressed with the fight scenes giving impressions that are being done on a grander scale. They also stated that the scenes have depth and CG backgrounds are rendered beautifully and looks a lot slicker and a whole lot darker, looking like something from the PC version of which they expressed as a huge improvement after over a decade. Anthea Reyes of WheninManila.com was also impressed of the series stating: \"...all of our childish fantasies have returned to primetime television and it’s come back bigger, better, and infinitely more awesome...\" She also stated that \"the writing team is using this opportunity to the fullest to solidify the myth, the plot holes, and the motivations of everything. The writers of the show were able to place meaning in an aesthetic choice made from way before and further enrich the story.\" She also noted that the details of characters costume, to the clarified presence of the nomadic soldiers post Sappiro-Hathoria war, up until the background music used per every shot were all world class. FHM Philippines also made a review of the show and states that the creators of the show made an effort to make a living and breathing world and they succeeded. They also imposed that even though it was heavily inspired by Hollywood fantasy movies, it has the FIlipino flavor adding its own twist. They also pointed out that one of the shows strengths is that it has its own unique story. FHM further stated that: \"...Like the original that came 11 years before it, Encantadia gives audiences something new to watch when it comes to primetime programming. Finally, something to cleanse our palate from all the drama and romantic programs that we've grown accustomed to.\"\n\nA review by \"Philippine Entertainment Portal\" stated that the show’s director of photography and cameramen were impressive for utilizing different creative camera angles and techniques as it contributed to the intensity and excitement in the scene. They also gave positive feedback to its musical scoring stating that \"...One of the factors that contributed to Encantadia 2005’s success is its musical scoring, in fact, it was even commended in the Asian Television Awards for Best Original Music Score. This requel did not disappoint when it comes to this aspect. The musical scorer seemed to compose different pieces suited to each kingdom since each had its own theme[...]the modernized, upbeat version of \"Tadhana\" also inensified the fight scenes.\"\n\nBecause of the good ratings and the success of the show, \"Encantadia\" is slated or expected to have another season. This was hinted on few scenes in its finale showing Cassiopea's twin, who lives in the ice kingdom in the far northern part of Encantadia, seems to pose a threat to diwatas.

{"id": "2602119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2602119", "title": "Famous Players", "text": "Famous Players\n\nFamous Players was a Canadian-based film exhibitor and cable television service provider. Famous Players operated numerous movie theatre locations in Canada from British Columbia to Newfoundland and Labrador. The company was owned by Viacom Canada but was sold to Onex Corporation-owned Cineplex Galaxy LP in 2005.\n\nFamous Players Canadian Corporation dates back to the early days of Famous Players Film Company (later Paramount Pictures), founded in 1912, as its earliest predecessor, though that company did not have any operations in Canada until 1920, when it bought Nathan Nathanson's Paramount Theatre chain, which Nathanson had established four years earlier. Nathanson, along with being the 5th richest person in the world, became the first president of the resulting entity, Famous Players Canadian Corporation Limited. In 1923, Famous Players bought out rival Allen Theatres, acquiring many buildings in the process . The Famous Players Theatres chain was always strongly linked with Paramount, and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Paramount Communications at the time that firm was acquired by Viacom in 1994. Some of the most high-profile and popular theatres in the Famous Players chain were the Imperial and the Uptown in Toronto; and the Capitol, Orpheum, Stanley, and Strand in Vancouver.\n\nOriginally began with 13 theatres located in Ontario and British Columbia, the company quickly expanded its holdings to 100 by the end of 1926. Until the 1950s, the company continued to build its operations in the movie theatre sector.\n\nIn 1952, however, Famous Players began to invest in the new technology. First, the company purchased the rights to a coinbox system that connected to television sets. A year later, it purchased its first broadcasting assets, CKCO-TV in Kitchener, Ontario and CFCM-TV in Québec City.\n\nAt the end of the 1950s, the company acquired the first of many cable TV companies it would come to own, thus adding control over the distribution of its TV product. As the industry grew, starting in the mid-1960s, so did the assets of Famous Players in this segment. In 1971, the company sold off the majority of its shareholdings in its movie theatre and other non-TV-related entertainment holdings to Gulf + Western Canada and subsequently changed its name to Canadian Cablesystems Limited, reflecting the new focus of its operations. Canadian Cablesystems was the owner and operator of Metro Cable, which served parts of Metro Toronto, as well as a minority shareholder in several other cable companies, until it was purchased by Rogers Cablesystems Ltd. (founded by Ted Rogers) in 1978.\n\nMost famously, Famous Players Theatres allowed the lease on a property containing the entrance of one of its flagship Toronto locations, the Imperial Six, to lapse in 1986. Cineplex immediately took over the lease, denying Famous Players Theatres access to the portion of the property that they already owned outright. Famous Players eventually sold its property to Cineplex Odeon Cinemas, on the condition it never again be used to show filmed entertainment. Cineplex's live-theatre division renovated the theatre; renamed the Pantages Theatre, it hosted \"The Phantom of the Opera\" for ten years. The theatre was renamed the Canon in 2001 and then again in 2011 as the Ed Mirvish Theatre, which it is currently known, in honour of the popular businessman and ironically Mr. Drabinsky's main competitor in live theatre in Toronto.\n\nFamous Players expanded throughout the 1990s. Under chairman John Bailey, Famous Players re-built its infrastructure from 1997 to 2003 with new \"megaplex\" theatre brands featuring stadium seating, such as SilverCity and Coliseum, with food courts and video games. Around that time, AMC Theatres entered the Canadian market, and most of the traditional ties between the existing chains and the major studios began to unwind, putting all three chains in full-on competition in several major markets.\n\nThe company once operated a number of drive-in theatres, but most have been closed and replaced with modern theatres. Until 2004, it operated theatres in the Maritimes, none of which were branded-concept theatres; these were sold to the region's dominant exhibitor, Empire Theatres.\n\nIn June 2005, Viacom announced it would sell Famous Players to Cineplex Galaxy, controlled by Onex Corporation for $500 million (about US$397 million). This deal was completed on July 22, 2005. To satisfy antitrust concerns, on August 22, 2005 the group announced the sale of 27 locations in Ontario and western Canada to Empire Theatres.\n\nPrior to merging with Cineplex, Famous Players operated five theatre brands: Famous Players, SilverCity, Coliseum, Colossus and Paramount. Of these, Cineplex only preserved the first two brands. The Coliseum and Colossus theatres sold to Cineplex were renamed to Cineplex Cinemas, though the unique features of the original brands were preserved. Similarly, Paramount theatres now use the Scotiabank Theatre brand since 2007.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U.S. 340 (1998), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that if there is to be an award of statutory damages in a copyright infringement case, then the opposing party has the right to demand a jury trial.\n\nC. Elvin Feltner, Jr., and the corporation he owns, Krypton International Corporation, operate 3 television stations which ran various television shows licensed from Columbia Pictures, including \"Who's the Boss?\", \"Silver Spoons\", \"Hart to Hart\", and \"T. J. Hooker\". After becoming delinquent in royalty payments, and being unable to resolve the impasse over the debt owed, Columbia revoked their license to run the shows. The stations kept running them anyway. Columbia sued Feltner, Krypton and some subsidiaries and executives of the corporation. The trial court found the infringement to be wilful, and denied Feltner's request for a jury trial on statutory damages. The court found every broadcast of every episode run on every television station to be a separate infringement, awarded the statutory maximum of $20,000 for each of the 440 acts, for a total of $8,800,000 in damages.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the award.\n\nThe Supreme Court examined the statute in an attempt to resolve the issue without reaching constitutional issues. It found that there is no provision in the statute for a jury trial on the issue of statutory damages, therefore it must look at whether the law triggers the provisions of the requirement for trial by jury required by the Seventh Amendment. The question then being, were statutory damages in the form of a trial in a court of law, or a trial in a court of equity; if a court of law, then trial by jury may be demanded; if a court of equity, then trial by jury is not available unless provided for by statute. Upon examining long historical practice in copyright infringement cases, it decided that damages in a copyright case have historically been tried as a court of law, and not as a court of equity. Thus, the defendant Feltner was entitled to a jury trial on the issue of the amount of statutory damages.\n\nThe judgment was reversed and remanded back to the trial court.\n\nAfter remand and the jury trial ordered by the Supreme Court, the jury awarded $72,000 in statutory damages for each of the 440 works infringed, for a total award of $31.68 million – over three and a half times the damages awarded by the Judge at the prior bench trial. On his appeal from the $31.68 million jury award to the Ninth Circuit, Feltner argued that the Supreme Court’s rulings (that the Copyright Act provided that statutory damages be awarded by Judges and the Seventh Amendment required that juries award those damaged) rendered statutory damages unconstitutional and void. The Ninth Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed the $31.68 million jury award. Feltner’s petition to the Supreme Court to hear the case for a second time was unsuccessful, leaving the $31.68 million award intact.\n\n"}

The line is spoken by Rhett Butler (Gable), as his last words to Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh), in response to her tearful question: \"Where shall I go? What shall I do?\" Scarlett clings to the hope that she can win him back. This line is also partially spoken by Rhett Butler in Margaret Mitchell's novel \"Gone with the Wind\", published in 1936, from which the film is derived.\n\nThe line demonstrates that Rhett has finally given up on Scarlett and their tumultuous relationship. After more than a decade of fruitlessly seeking her love, he no longer cares what happens to her.\n\nThis quotation was voted the number one movie line of all time by the American Film Institute in 2005.\n\nPrior to the film's release, censors objected to the use of the word \"damn\" in the film, a word that had been prohibited by the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code, beginning in July 1934. However, before 1930 the word \"damn\" had been relatively common in films. In the silent era, John Gilbert even shouted \"Goddamn you!\" to the enemy during battle in \"The Big Parade\" (1925). The Production Code was ratified on March 31, 1930, and was effective for motion pictures whose filming began afterward. Thus, talkies that used \"damn\" include \"Glorifying the American Girl\" (1929), \"Flight\" (1929), \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\" (1929), \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), \"The Big Trail\" (1930), \"The Dawn Patrol\" (1930), \"The Green Goddess\" (1930) and \"Dracula\" (1931). Although legend persists that the Hays Office fined producer David O. Selznick $5,000 for using the word \"damn\", in fact the MPPDA board passed an amendment to the Production Code a month and a half before the film's release, on November 1, 1939, that allowed use of the words \"hell\" or \"damn\" when their use \"shall be essential and required for portrayal, in proper historical context, of any scene or dialogue based upon historical fact or folklore...or a quotation from a literary work, provided that no such use shall be permitted which is intrinsically objectionable or offends good taste\". With that amendment, the Production Code Administration had no further objection to Rhett's closing line. It is actually the second use of \"damn\" in the film. The term \"damn Yankees\" is heard in the parlor scene at Twelve Oaks.\n\n"}

To celebrate, project organizers held mega events in Kenya, Portugal, Italy, Poland and more.\n\nGood Deeds Day and Ruach Tova are part of The Ted Arison Family Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Arison Group.\n\nIn 2011, international companies Shikun & Binui and Bank Hapoalim were among the first international participants in Good Deeds Day outside of Israel. As of 2016, Good Deeds Day is celebrated in 75 countries worldwide, and has collaborated with major cities such as Rome, São Paulo, Kaohsiung City, and New York City to create special events. In the Good Deeds Day event at Herald Square, New York City, actor and activist Adrian Grenier supported the day by speaking at the event:\nPope Francis endorsed the day in his Sunday sermon prior to Good Deeds Day 2015 in Rome and said:\nIn 2016 Good Deeds Day collaborated with Brazil based volunteering center Atados on a nationwide activation. Together they reached 10,000 volunteers around the country, and 40 cities across Brazil including major cities like Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, and São Paulo.\n\nIn Latin America, major Good Deeds Day events took place in Panama, Costa Rica, Brazil, Peru, and 16 other countries in the region.\n\nIn Taiwan, Good Deeds Day collaborated with TAVE (Taiwan Association for Volunteer Effort) to create major citywide activities in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan in 2016. Taiwan’s Vice President, Chen Chien-jen, and Kaohsiung’s Mayor, Chen Chu, were among the government officials honoring the day in 2016. Taoyuan City also hosted citywide activities, arranged by Taoyuan City Volunteer Service Association and other partnering organizations.\n\nOne of the biggest collaborations in Europe include SPES (Associazione Promozione e Solidarietà) in Italy, who organized a major Good Deeds Day event in Rome in 2016. Good Deeds Day invited runners in the Rome Marathon to join the “Roma Fun Run” and visit the Good Deeds Day fair of non-profits at the finish line.\n\nGood Deeds Day (Hebrew: יום מעשים טובים) first began in Israel in 2007 with 7,000 participants and grew to 1,500,000 in 2016. Local municipalities, companies, and nonprofit organizations all around the country participate by organizing special activities in their communities, renovating or painting buildings, building community gardens, and volunteering in many other ways for populations in need. Cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem also host special Good Deeds Day events that are open to the public, such as the 2016 “Counselor’s Boulevard” that took place on Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv. Professionals gave free counseling sessions to passersby. Other public events include the 2015 Good Deeds Day nonprofit Fair at Rabin Square, Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon, which included hair donation stands, dog adoption area, and a give-and-take market.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Good Deeds Day became international in 2011.\n\nGood Deeds Day received the George W.

Maar (1921–1992), known as \"The Sultan of Balloons\", was one of the pioneers in balloon twisting. He appeared for over a decade on episodes of the long running Bozo's Circus. While the origins of balloon twisting is impossible to prove, Emmy Award winning producer/director Joseph Maar has provided evidence that his father, Henry, may be the founder of balloon twisting. Larry Moss calls Joseph Maar's evidence \"compelling\" but warns that if Joseph Maar is correct then the history of balloon twisting would have to be rewritten. For example, the 1975 book by \"Jolly the Clown\" Petri credits \"Herman Bonnert from Pennsylvania at a magician's convention in 1939\" as being the first balloontwister.\n\nJoseph Maar is the three time Emmy Award Winning Coordinating Director formerly with ESPN who worked on several shows including \"Sports Center\", \"Sports Century\", \"Pardon the Interruption\", \"Around the Horn\" and many other shows. He is also a client of some of the largest ballooning stores in the country. His story of his father has been picked up by several sources as the story of the origins of Balloon Twisting.\n\nAccording to Joseph Maar, his father had pleurisy as a child and spent several years at a TB Sanitorium in Milwaukee. To develop his lungs, the facility had Henry blow up balloons. In the 1930s Henry became a vaudeville magician. While preparing for a show in 1938 or 1939, Joseph writes, \"he came back to the car to get the rest of his magic tricks only to find the vehicle had been broken into and everything was gone.\" With his magic tricks stolen, Maar went on stage and performed a show consisting primarily of balloon twisting. \"Afterward, the agents went nuts and told him to forget the magic and to start doing the balloons. That <nowiki>[Henry Maar's agents said]</nowiki>'everyone's doing regular magic tricks but no one is doing the balloon tricks.'\"\n\nHenry spent the next ten years performing under the stage name of \"Johnny Ford\" and entertaining GI's with the USO. After World War II an agent offered Maar twice his rate to wear a clown suit while performing his act. Joseph Maar states \"that was the advent of a clown doing balloons.\" From the late 50s to mid-70s, Joseph and a 1968 article from the Waukegan Sun-Times cites that his father was a regular on \"Bozo's Circus\" and other children's shows. Two of these episodes reside with BalloonHQ and in IMDb he is listed in the credits of the March 16, 1977 episode of \"Bozo's Circus.\"\n\nJoseph Maar also credits his father with inventing 'face painting.' According to Joseph, his father would sometimes have trouble with his makeup during long summertime events. To cover his own need to touch up his clown make up, he would invite kids up on stage where Henry Maar would \"make them up\" like a clown.\n\nWhile Joseph Maar's story has been accepted as \"compelling,\" it is not viewed as conclusive. Other twisters have been credited with being the originator of balloon twisting. They include:\n\n"}

Its name is derived from the initials of the Institute of Radio Engineers.\n\nA value of 100 IRE was originally defined to be the range from blanking level to peak white in a video signal. A value of 0 IRE corresponds to the voltage value of the signal during the blanking period. The sync pulse is normally 40 IRE below this 0 IRE value, so the total range covered from peak to trough of an all white signal would be 140 IRE. \n\nNote that video signals use the \"IRE\" unit instead of DC voltages to describe levels and amplitudes. Based on a standard 1 V NTSC composite-video signal that swings from -286 mV (sync tip) to +714 mV (peak video), a 140 IRE peak-to-peak convention has been established. One NTSC IRE unit is 7.14mV, where -40 IRE is equivalent to -286 mV, and +100 IRE is equivalent to +714 mV. Note that 0 IRE is equivalent to 0 V. The Black Level is equivalent to 53.57 mV (7.5 IRE)\n\nThe PAL video signal is slightly different in that it swings from -300 mV to +700 mV, instead. Thus, one PAL IRE unit is 7mV, where -43 IRE is equivalent to -300 mV at the sync tip, and +100 IRE is equivalent to +700 mV at the peak video level. Black level is the same as the blanking level 0 mv (0 IRE) \n\nThe reason IRE is a relative measurement (percent) is because a video signal may be any amplitude. This unit is used in the ITU-R BT.470 which defines PAL, NTSC and SECAM.\n"}

The story alternates with transcripts of tapes between a \"subject\" and Brint. The subject receives psychotherapy and is interrogated by Brint.\n\nAs the book continues, it is revealed that Adam is the subject, who was formerly Paul Delmonte of a small New York town. His father, \"David Farmer\", was a newspaper reporter who was enrolled in the Witness Protection Program (WPP). The family moved to Monument and escaped several close calls with their identities, but the parents are killed in the penultimate chapter in a car collision. Adam/Paul survives, and is taken to a government mental asylum. The last chapter implies that WPP agents killed the family, and reveals that Paul is regularly interrogated on the topic. Each time, Paul is unable to handle his realizations of his past and embarks on his delusion bike ride across the ground of the facility. At the end of the last tape, Brint recommends authorization to kill Adam.\n\n\nThis quote is the last verse from \"The Farmer In The Dell\", a song that Adam sings during the book:\n\n\"The cheese stands alone\n\"The cheese stands alone\n\"Heigh-ho, the merry-o\n\"The cheese stands alone\nHe sings many of these songs throughout the novel. The song contains several characters, each taking someone with them when the farmer leaves, yet the cheese has nobody.\n\nAdam believes that he is the cheese. He is alone in the world, his mother dead and his father missing, and he lives in a hospital. He thinks that he is not wanted anymore. Also, as in other works by Cormier, there is a dual meaning to the title. The words \"I am the cheese\" may also represent Adam's feelings of entrapment: he is the bait used to lure his parents to their murders.\n\nAnother point is that his father had taught him the song, possibly in a way to reinforce the new name, 'Farmer', they had adopted.\n\nThe 1975 novel \"I Am the Cheese\" began Cormier's experimentation with first-person, present-tense narration. When Cormier sent the manuscript to the publisher of his previous novel, \"The Chocolate War\", he was confused and depressed, convinced that he was alienating his new young adult audience because of the complex and ambiguous story. However, \"I Am the Cheese\" proved to be a success.\n\n\"I Am the Cheese\" was named to five annual book lists according to the publisher description of the 20th anniversary edition. It won the 1997 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity.\n\n\"I Am the Cheese\" was released as a movie in 1983, directed by Robert Jiras and starring Robert MacNaughton, Hope Lange, Don Murray, Lee Richardson, Cynthia Nixon and Robert Wagner.

{"id": "25806331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25806331", "title": "List of professional sports", "text": "List of professional sports\n\nThis is a list of professional sports – that is, sports (and, more broadly, non-sport games subject to organized competition) that support one or more systems of professional sports players, sportspeople by \"occupation\". Such sports also have a vibrant community of amateur players, from whom the best rise to become professionals.\n\nRugby football in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s, and over time, a unique code of football known as Canadian football developed. Both the Canadian Football League (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and Football Canada, the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1882 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (later reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union). In 1909, the Grey Cup was donated by the then Governor General of Canada Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU (the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and found they had less and less in common with the amateur leagues, and consequently in 1956 formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council. In 1958, the CFC left the CRU altogether and was renamed the Canadian Football League. By this time, teams from the amateur Ontario Rugby Football Union had stopped challenging for the Grey Cup, and ever since, it has been exclusively awarded to CFL teams. Since 1965, university teams have competed for the Vanier Cup.\n\nUnlike other sports, Australian rules football has not resisted becoming a professional sport.\n\nAlthough the sport began as amateur competition, the Australian Football League is an elite professional league and has been for nearly 80 years since its initial formation as the Victorian Football Association and then the Victorian Football League in 1897. The league changed its name to the Australian Football League (AFL) in 1990 amid the increasing professionalism and national expansion of the game.\n\nBandy is played professionally in Russia, Sweden, and Kazakhstan.\n\nThe game was invented in the United States in the 1890s, in Springfield, Massachusetts. The first professional basketball leagues emerged in the 1920s in the United States. Prominent among these were the American Basketball League, which formed in 1925, and the National Basketball League, which was launched in 1937 by General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear as a way to improve their national profile. In 1946 the Basketball Association of America was founded by the owners of major sports arenas, particularly the Madison Square Garden. The BAA later merged with the NBL in 1949 to become the National Basketball Association, the preeminent league in the world with 29 teams in the United States and one in Canada. The American Basketball Association, founded in 1967, subsequently joined the NBA in the 1976 ABA-NBA merger.\n\nThe second-oldest professional basketball league in the world is the Philippine Basketball Association. The PBA was long considered to be the best league in Asia, but the Chinese Basketball Association has grown tremendously in recent years. The league was born on April 9, 1975 at the Araneta Coliseum, Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines.\n\nOutside of the NBA, the top professional leagues in the world are those of FIBA Europe. According to the official league rankings produced by Euroleague Basketball, the body that conducts the continent-wide Euroleague, the top five national domestic leagues on the continent (from 1 to 5) are those Liga ACB (Spain), the Russian Professional Basketball League, the Greek Basket League, Lega Basket Serie A (Italy), and the Turkish Basketball League.\n\nEuropean basketball is also characterized by its long established and well-developed transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague, which features top clubs from as many as 18 different domestic leagues. Two other continental club competitions, the ULEB Eurocup and EuroChallenge, are also conducted annually. Europe also has transnational regional leagues, such as the Liga ABA (Adriatic League, formerly Yugoslavian League), and Baltic Basketball League (originally limited to the Baltic states, now also including Kazakhstan).\n\nNotable figures in professional bowling would include Walter Ray Williams, Jr., Chris Barnes and Rafael \"Paeng\" Nepomuceno.\n\nCricket at the highest level has developed into a fully professional international sport from which leading players can earn a large income. However professionalism has a long history in English cricket. The first professionals had appeared by the first half of the eighteenth century, when heavy gambling on the game encouraged wealthy patrons to draft the best players into their teams. They would often offer these players full-time employment as gardeners or gamekeepers on their estates. In the second half of the century, the famous Hambledon Club paid its players match fees.\n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century William Clarke's All-England Eleven was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs.\n\nIn the early 21st century cricket is as lucrative as some other sports, and domestic cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the English cricket team earn several hundred thousand pounds a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the Australian cricket team or the Indian cricket team who make most of their income from endorsement contracts.\n\n\nProfessional darts players perform in the Professional Darts Corporation or the World Darts Federation.\n\nPro gamers compete in many leagues and tournaments throughout the world.\n\nIt is played with two teams, while 5 skaters and 1 goalie are allowed on the ice at a time. In NHL rules, the periods are 20 minutes long. There are three periods.\n\nThe 64-member governing body is the International Ice Hockey Federation, (IIHF). Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. North America's National Hockey League is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic hockey.\n\nIce hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage.\n\nThere are early representations and reports of hockey-type games being played on ice in the Netherlands, and reports from Canada from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at McGill University, Montreal in 1875 and, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams.\n\nLacrosse is played mainly in North America, however, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have small lacrosse leagues. It has also expanded into both Europe and Asia, with the latter forming the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union (APLU) in May 2012. The United States currently has two top-level professional lacrosse leagues in operation, Major League Lacrosse and the National Lacrosse League.\n\nRugby league came into existence due to the very issue of professionalism. Rugby football split into 'union' and 'league' over the issue of payment to player. Rugby league favoured payments and has thus been a professional sport since its beginnings in 1895, when 22 clubs based in northern England split from the more amateur-minded Rugby Football Union. The officially amateur RFU had previously brought charges of professionalism against some clubs for their use of \"broken time\" payments to compensate players for missing work due to matches or injuries received whilst playing. On August 29, 1895 in a meeting at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, the clubs decided to break away and form the Northern Rugby Union, which later would become the Rugby Football League. The rules of rugby league were gradually changed so that now it and rugby union are distinctly different games, however rugby union has since turned professional as well. On 17 December 1967 the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league were played.\n\nRugby union continued with its amateur ideals past the schism between union and league and throughout much of the 20th century. This position changed in 1995. The threat of big payments from professional rugby league clubs in countries where rugby league had a significant following was becoming too great. A committee conclusion decided that the only way to end this threat, the hypocrisy of Shamateurism and keep control of rugby union was to make the sport professional. On August 26, 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an \"open\" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.\n\nThe PBR is different from the classic rodeo as it consists of only bull riding. It was founded in 1992 because a group of bull riders decided that their sport should be separated from the classic rodeo and could, as it was easily the most popular event. Riders and bulls are judged on a 50-point scale. Riders are only given a score if they stay on for the mandatory 8 seconds, while bull scores are given regardless of what the rider does.\n\nSee \"American Ultimate Disc League\" and \"Major League Ultimate\"\n\n"}

The revue sets songs cut from Sondheim's better-known musicals, as well as songs from his then-unproduced musical \"Saturday Night\" to a dialogue-free plot about the relationship between two lonely New York single people, who are in emotional conflict during an evening in their separate one-room apartments. Despite knowing of the other's existence, they never get up the courage to talk to each other, though they imagine what such an encounter might be like. \nThe musical originally was staged by the off-off-Broadway Production Company. It opened on October 29, 1980 and closed December 28, 1980. It re-opened March 12, 1981 at the off-Broadway Actor's Playhouse, where it ran for 96 performances. Directed by Rene and choreographed by Don Johanson, it starred Craig Lucas and Suzanne Henry. On June 7, 1982 the musical opened at the King's Head Theatre, London, directed by Robert Cushman and choreographed by Dennis Grimaldi. The revue has been performed in US regional theaters such as GroundWorks Theatre, Nashville, Tennessee in March 2009 and the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park, Cincinnati, Ohio, in May 2009.\n\nIn late 1998 actor Steve Gideon proposed a revival of the work with the casting of a male same-sex couple to play the leads. He approached Stephen Sondheim with the idea and was given permission. The new version of the work debuted at the Celebration Theatre in Hollywood, CA in 1999.\n\nA version of the main title with Harry Nilsson singing can be found on bootlegs.\n\nIn 2008, \"Marry Me a Little\" was performed in South Africa in a production starring David Fick opposite Talia Egelhof and then Nathan Fredericks in two successive runs of the show at the Intimate Theatre in Cape Town from 28 June - 5 July. The production was directed by Jacqui Kowen, with musical direction by Victor Tichart.\n\nIn 2012, the Off-Broadway Keen Company presented a new version of \"Marry Me a Little\" starring Jason Tam and Lauren Molina. This production included several new songs and a new concept. The production was directed by Jonathan Silverstein and started previews September 11, 2012, opening October 2, 2012 at the Clurman Theatre at Theatre Row. Both Stephen Sondheim and Craig Lucas were involved in the project.\n\nIn January, 2013, The New Repertory Theatre in Watertown, Massachusetts, under the direction of Ilyse Robbins, received permission to do a gender-neutral staging of \"Marry Me a Little\", using four actors—two women and two men—and two pianists. The action here takes place in four apartments in Manhattan, with varying pairing up on songs as man and woman, woman and woman, and man and man (this latter pairing effectively used especially in the lyrics of \"So Many People\" from \"Saturday Night\"). At the end of the performance the four actors do meet for a closing finale.\n\nIn March, 2014, a Canadian production of \"Marry Me a Little\" opened at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto, directed by Adam Brazier and starring Elodie Gillett and Adrian Marchuk. The production showed the two characters living together in a relationship that eventually comes to an end.\n\nFrom June 29 to August 10, 2014, a British production opened at the St James Theatre in London, directed by Hannah Chissick, under the musical direction of David Randall, and starring Simon Bailey and Laura Pitt-Pulford. The critically acclaimed, sell-out production went on to get another week at the St James Theatre's Studio from October 6 to October 11, 2014.\n\nFrom January 28 to February 13, 2017, the show will be presented at The Gallery Players directed by Barrie Gelles and starring Jesse Manocherian, Alyson Leigh Rosenfeld, Adrian Rifat, Paul Williams, Cassandra Dupler and Laura Cetti. A first for this show, there will be three rotating casts performing each weekend: one duo is male and female, one is an all-male duo, and one is an all-female duo.\n\n\n\nInternational website\n"}

She studied for a short time at the Guildhall School of Music. During her first marriage, from which she took the name by which she is generally known, she gave birth to two children, Alan \"Beo\" Urquhart and Stella. Her first husband died in the Boer War in 1900.\n\nFourteen years later, Campbell became the second wife of George Cornwallis-West, a writer and soldier previously married to Jennie Jerome, the mother of Sir Winston Churchill. Notwithstanding her second marriage she continued to use the stage name \"Mrs Patrick Campbell\".\n\nBeatrice Tanner made her professional stage debut in 1888 at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool, four years after her marriage to Patrick Campbell. In March 1890, she appeared in London at the Adelphi, where she afterward played again in 1891–93. She became successful after starring in Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's play, \"The Second Mrs Tanqueray\", in 1893, at St. James's Theatre where she also appeared in 1894 in \"The Masqueraders\". As Kate Cloud in \"John-a-Dreams\", produced by Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1894, she had another success, and again as Agnes in \"The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith\" at the Garrick (1895).\n\nAmong her other performances were those in \"Fédora\" (1895), \"Little Eyolf\" (1896), and her notable performances with Forbes-Robertson at the Lyceum in London's West End in the rôles of Juliet in \"Romeo and Juliet\", Ophelia in \"Hamlet\", and Lady Macbeth (1895–98) in \"Macbeth\". Once established as a major star, Campbell assisted in the early careers of some noted actors, such as Gerald Du Maurier and George Arliss.\n\nIn 1900, \"Mrs Pat\", having become her own Manager/Director, made her debut performance on Broadway in New York City in \"Heimat\" by Hermann Sudermann, a marked success. Subsequent appearances in New York and on tour in the US established her as a major theatrical presence there. Campbell would regularly perform on the New York stage until 1933. Other performances included roles in \"The Joy of Living\" (1902), \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" (1904; as Melisande to the Pelleas of her friend Sarah Bernhardt), \"Hedda Gabler\" (1907), \"Electra\" (1908), \"The Thunderbolt\" (1908), and \"Bella Donna\" (1911).\n\nIn 1914, she played Eliza Doolittle in the original West End production of \"Pygmalion\" which George Bernard Shaw had expressly written for her. Although forty-nine years old when she originated the role opposite the Henry Higgins of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, she triumphed and took the play to New York and on tour in 1915 with the much younger Philip Merivale playing Higgins. She successfully played Eliza again in a 1920 London revival of the play.\n\nA couple of \"Mrs Pat\"'s later significant performances were as the title role in the 1922 West End production of Henrik Ibsen's play \"Hedda Gabler\" and Mrs. Alving in the \"Ibsen Centennial\" (1928) staging of \"Ghosts\" (with John Gielgud as her son Oswald). Her last major stage role was in the Broadway production of Ivor Novello's play \"A Party\" where she portrayed the cigar-smoking, pekinese wielding actress \"Mrs. MacDonald\" – a clear takeoff on her own well known persona – and made off with the best reviews. In her later years, Campbell made notable appearances in films, including \"One More River\" (1934), \"Riptide\" (1934), and \"Crime and Punishment\" (1935). Her tendency, however, to reject roles that could have vitally helped her career in later years caused Alexander Woollcott to declare \"...she was like a sinking ship firing on the rescuers\".\n\nIn the late 1890s Campbell first became aware of George Bernard Shaw – the famous and feared dramatic critic for \"The Saturday Review\" – who lavishly praised her better performances and thoroughly criticised her lesser efforts. Shaw had already used her as inspiration for some of his plays before their first meeting in 1897 when he unsuccessfully tried to persuade \"Mrs Pat\" to play the role of Judith Anderson in the first production of his play \"The Devil's Disciple\". Not until 1912, when they began negotiations for the London production of \"Pygmalion\", did Shaw develop an infatuation for \"Mrs Pat\" that resulted in a passionate, yet unconsummated, love affair of mutual fascination and a legendary exchange of letters. It was Campbell who broke off the relationship although Shaw was about to direct her in \"Pygmalion\". They remained friends in spite of the break-up and her subsequent marriage to George Cornwallis-West, but Shaw never again allowed her to originate any of the roles he had written with her in mind (e.g. Hesione Hushabye (\"Heartbreak House\"), the Serpent (\"Back to Methuselah\"), etc.). When Anthony Asquith was preparing to produce the 1938 film of \"Pygmalion\", Shaw suggested Campbell for the role of Mrs Higgins but she declined.\n\nIn later years, Shaw refused to allow the impoverished Campbell to publish or sell any of their letters except in heavily edited form, for fear of upsetting his wife Charlotte Payne-Townshend and the possible harm that the letters might cause to his public image. Most of the letters were not published until 1952, two years after Shaw's death.\n\nCampbell was infamous for her sharp wit. Her best-known remark, uttered upon hearing about a male homosexual relationship, was \"My dear, I don't care what they do, so long as they don't do it in the street and frighten the horses,\" although this remark has been attributed to others as well. \n\nAt a dinner in the United States, she was seated next to a scientist who talked incessantly to her about ants. \"They even have their own police force and army\", he enthused. \"No navy?\" she replied.\n\nCampbell died on 9 April 1940 in Pau, France, aged 75, of pneumonia. Her death was one of the few deaths of a personal nature that George Bernard Shaw ever noted in his personal diaries.\n\nA note book belonging to Campbell is housed at the University of Birmingham Special Collections Department. Several collections of Campbell's correspondence, including her letters to Shaw (MS Thr 372.1), are part of the Harvard Theatre Collection at Houghton Library, Harvard University. A number of her letters and her annotated script for Chester Bailey Fernald's \"The Moonlight Blossom\" are in the theatre manuscripts collection of the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin. The Ransom Center's collection of Shaw papers includes letters from Campbell, and the library includes a number of Shaw's published works from Campbell's private library.\n\nHer father John Tanner (1829–1895), a descendant of Thomas Tanner, Bishop of St Asaph, was a Consul and merchant who \"managed to get through two large fortunes\", in part through losses in the Indian Mutiny.\n\nHer mother, Louisa Joanna Romanini, was one of the eight daughters of Angelo Romanini of Brescia and Rosa née Polinelli of Milan. Angelo had joined the Carbonari and, as a result, had to leave Italy. He and his family travelled over Eastern Europe aided by a \"firman\" from the Sultan of Turkey. Six of his eight daughters, all under eighteen, married Englishmen.\n\nHer first husband Patrick Campbell (1855–1900) was the son of Patrick McMicken Campbell (1826–1896), a banker who was the Chief Manager of the Oriental Bank Corporation, and his first wife Montgomerie Anne née Kerr (1836–1869). After her death he married her cousin, Alicia Anne Kerr.\n\nPatrick and Beatrice first met at a card party at the house of Mrs Gifford in Dulwich and eloped within four months to marry at St Helen, Bishopsgate. Patrick's health was poor and in 1887 he was ordered by his doctor to take a sea voyage. He was to stay away for six and a half years in Australia and then Mashonaland. He found some work but never sent enough back for Beatrice and the children to live on. When he returned in 1893, she saw that \"his health and energies were undermined by fever, failure, and the most bitter disappointments\", whereas she was by then a successful actress. In mid-March 1900, Patrick returned to South Africa to join Lord Chesham's Yeomanry. He was killed in a charge at Boshof on 5 April, the same action in which Colonel George de Villebois-Mareuil died.\n\nTheir son Alan Urquhart 'Beo' Campbell (1885–1917) became a Naval Cadet in 1898 at HMS \"Britannia\" and was about to take his naval entrance exams when his father died in 1900. He left the navy that year and went to Oxford and later worked as an actor. In 1908, on tour with his mother he met Helen Parker Bull (1885–1981). They married in 1909 in Quincy, Illinois, and divorced in 1915. He re-joined the RNVR at the outbreak of war and became a Lieutenant Commander, being awarded the Military Cross and bar. On 30 December 1917 he was killed by a shell while serving in the Royal Naval Division at La Vacquerie on the Cambrai front.\n\nTheir daughter Stella (1886-1975) also joined her mother on stage, and toured with her in the USA, but \"made up her mind to marry a man [Beatrice] scarcely knew, who had lived in Africa for many years\". Stella left for Kenya in early 1911 to marry \nMervyn Worcester Howard Beech (1881–1923).\n\nIn 1909, Campbell produced \"His Borrowed Plumes\" by Lady Randolph Churchill, whose husband, George Cornwallis-West, was \"seriously attracted to me\". They married on 6 April 1914, the day after the decree absolute of his divorce.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It existed from 1823 to 1929 between Derry Street and Paxton Street along Spring Creek. The park contained two roller coasters, the Coaster Flyer and the Jack Rabbit.\n\nPaxtang Park was leased to the East Harrisburg Street Electric Railway Company on July 19, 1893, for a ten-year term. Plans included constructing a fence surrounding the property, though the park would remain free entry, a pavilion to hold several hundred people, new shaded areas, benches, and a \"gravity railroad\" (or scenic railway) for the following season. The gravity railroad was not installed in 1894, nor was it ever operational; it wasn't until 1905 that the park added its first roller coaster - Coaster Flyer. This was a Figure 8 roller coaster and operated from 1905 until 1922. \n\nIn 1922, the railroad company announced they would not renew the lease on the grounds of Paxtang Park for a fourth lease - they had renewed twice before in 1903 and 1913. They were no longer able to afford the costs of operating the park, so they announced 1922 would be the final season of Paxtang Park.

It originated from \"sangaku,\" a form of entertainment reminiscent of the modern-day circus, consisting mostly of acrobatics, juggling, and pantomime, sometimes combined with drum dancing. It came from China to Japan in the 8th century and there mingled with indigenous traditions, particularly the harvest celebrations of dengaku. In the 11th century, the form began to favor comic sketches while other elements faded away. By the late 12th century, the term \"sarugaku\" had come to include comic dialogues based on word play (toben), improvised comic party dances (\"ranbu\"), short plays involving several actors, and musical arrangements based on courtesan traditions. During the 13th century, there was increased standardization of words, gestures, musical arrangements, and program combinations; as well as the adoption of the guild (\"za\") system to which all present-day Noh schools can be traced. \"Kyōgen\" also developed from sarugaku. \nOf particular significance is the development of sarugaku troupes in Yamato around Nara and Kyoto during the Kamakura and early Muromachi periods. In particular, the sarugaku Noh troupe Yuzaki, led by Kan'ami, performed in 1374 before the young \"shōgun\" Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. The success of this one performance and the resultant shogunal patronage lifted the artform permanently out of the mists of its plebeian past. From then, the term sarugaku gave way to the current nomenclature, Noh.\n\nThe Japanese term \"Sarugaku\" is also used in other contexts to refer to a job or profession that seems to debase the employee or to treat him or her as a source of entertainment rather than as a professional.\n\nAccording to William Scott Wilson, Saragaku translates to \"monkey music\", is an ancient form of drama, and is the predecessor to Noh. Takuan Sōhō states as fact that \"the emperor's recitation is given like Sarugaku\".\n\n"}
{"id": "29324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29324", "title": "Signal processing", "text": "Signal processing\n\nSignal processing is a subfield of mathematics, information and electrical engineering that concerns the analysis, synthesis, and modification of signals, which are broadly defined as functions conveying \"information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon\", such as sound, images, and biological measurements. For example, signal processing techniques are used to improve signal transmission fidelity, storage efficiency, and subjective quality, and to emphasize or detect components of interest in a measured signal.\n\nAccording to Alan V. Oppenheim and Ronald W. Schafer, the principles of signal processing can be found in the classical numerical analysis techniques of the 17th century. Oppenheim and Schafer further state that the digital refinement of these techniques can be found in the digital control systems of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nAnalog signal processing is for signals that have not been digitized, as in legacy radio, telephone, radar, and television systems. This involves linear electronic circuits as well as non-linear ones. The former are, for instance, passive filters, active filters, additive mixers, integrators and delay lines. Non-linear circuits include compandors, multiplicators (frequency mixers and voltage-controlled amplifiers), voltage-controlled filters, voltage-controlled oscillators and phase-locked loops.\n\nContinuous-time signal processing is for signals that vary with the change of continuous domain(without considering some individual interrupted points).\n\nThe methods of signal processing include time domain, frequency domain, and complex frequency domain. This technology mainly discusses the modeling of linear time-invariant continuous system, integral of the system's zero-state response, setting up system function and the continuous time filtering of deterministic signals\n\nDiscrete-time signal processing is for sampled signals, defined only at discrete points in time, and as such are quantized in time, but not in magnitude.\n\n\"Analog discrete-time signal processing\" is a technology based on electronic devices such as sample and hold circuits, analog time-division multiplexers, analog delay lines and analog feedback shift registers. This technology was a predecessor of digital signal processing (see below), and is still used in advanced processing of gigahertz signals.\n\nThe concept of discrete-time signal processing also refers to a theoretical discipline that establishes a mathematical basis for digital signal processing, without taking quantization error into consideration.\n\nDigital signal processing is the processing of digitized discrete-time sampled signals. Processing is done by general-purpose computers or by digital circuits such as ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays or specialized digital signal processors (DSP chips). Typical arithmetical operations include fixed-point and floating-point, real-valued and complex-valued, multiplication and addition. Other typical operations supported by the hardware are circular buffers and lookup tables. Examples of algorithms are the Fast Fourier transform (FFT), finite impulse response (FIR) filter, Infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, and adaptive filters such as the Wiener and Kalman filters.\n\nNonlinear signal processing involves the analysis and processing of signals produced from nonlinear systems and can be in the time, frequency, or spatio-temporal domains. Nonlinear systems can produce highly complex behaviors including bifurcations, chaos, harmonics, and subharmonics which cannot be produced or analyzed using linear methods.\n\nStatistical signal processing is an approach which treats signals as stochastic processes, utilizing their statistical properties to perform signal processing tasks. Statistical techniques are widely used in signal processing applications. For example, one can model the probability distribution of noise incurred when photographing an image, and construct techniques based on this model to reduce the noise in the resulting image.\n\n\nIn communication systems, signal processing may occur at:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59029795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59029795", "title": "Video manipulation", "text": "Video manipulation\n\nVideo manipulation is a new variant of media manipulation that targets digital video using a combination of traditional video processing and video editing techniques and auxiliary methods from artificial intelligence like face recognition. In typical video manipulation, the facial structure, body movements, and voice of the subject are replicated in order to create a fabricated recording of the subject. The applications of these methods range from educational videos to videos aimed at (mass) manipulation and propaganda, a straightforward extension of the long-standing possibilities of photo manipulation. This form of computer-generated misinformation has contributed to fake news, and there have been instances when this technology was used during political campaigns.\n\nThe proof-of-principle software \"Face2Face\" was developed at Stanford University. Such advanced video manipulation must be ranked alongside and beyond previous examples of deep fakes.\n\nThe concept of manipulating video can be traced back as far as the 1950s, when the 2 inch Quadruplex tape used in videotape recorders would be manually cut and spliced. After being coated with ferrofluid, the two ends of tape that were to be joined were painted with a mixture of iron filings and carbon tetrachloride, a toxic and carcinogenic compound to make the tracks in the tape visible when viewed through a microscope so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task\n\nAs the video cassette recorder developed in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the ability to record over an existing magnetic tape became possible. This led to the concept of overlaying specific parts of film to give the illusion of one consistently recorded video, which is the first identifiable instance of video manipulation.\n\nIn 1985, Quantel released The Harry, the first all-digital video editing and effects compositing system. It recorded and applied effects to a maximum of 80 seconds of 8-bit uncompressed digital video. A few years later, in 1991, Adobe released its first version of Premiere for the Mac, a program that has since become an industry standard for editing and is now commonly used for video manipulation. In 1999, Apple released Final Cut Pro, which competed with Adobe Premiere and was used in the production major films such as \"The Rules of Attraction\" and \"No Country for Old Men\".\n\nFace detection became a major research subject in the early 2000s that has continued to be studied in the present. In 2017, an amateur coder named “DeepFakes” was altering pornography videos by digitally substituting the faces of celebrities for those in the original videos. The word deepfake has become a generic noun for the use of algorithms and facial-mapping technology to manipulate videos.\n\nOn the consumer side, popular video manipulation programs FaceApp and Faceswap, developed from similar technology, have become increasingly sophisticated.\n\nComputer applications are becoming more advance in terms of being able to generate fake audio and video content that look real. A video published by researchers depicts how video and audio manipulation works using facial recognition. Though video manipulation could be thought of as piecing together different video clips, the types of video manipulation extend further than that. For example, an actor can sit in front of a camera moving his face. The computer then generates the same facial movement in real time on an existing video of Barack Obama. When the actor shakes his head, Obama also shakes his head, and the same happens when the actor speaks. Not only does this create fake content, but it masks the content as even more authentic than other types of fake news, as video and audio were once the most reliable types of media for many people.\n\nOne of the most dangerous parts of video manipulation include the concept of politics; campaign videos are being manipulated to pose a threat to other nations. Dartmouth University computer science professor Hany Farid commented on video manipulation and its dangers. Farid said that actors could generate videos of Trump claiming to launch nuclear weapons. These fabricated videos could be shared on social media before the mistake can be fixed, possibly resulting in war. Despite the presence of manipulated video and audio, research teams are working to combat the issue. Prof. Christian Theobalt, a member of a team working on the technology at the Max-Planck-Institute for informatics in Germany, states that researchers have created forensic methods to detect fakes.\n\nWith fake news becoming increasingly prominent in popular culture and with rapid advancements of audio and video manipulation technology, the public is increasingly encountering fake news that is supported by deceptive videos. In terms of types of fake news, the potential to be classified is ever-expanding, but include five main types — satire or parody, selective reporting, sloppy journalism, clickbait, and conspiracies. Though the five main types of fake news are prominent globally, one of the most destructive types of fake news lies within all five types and is video and audio manipulation. Video and audio manipulation are defined as a new variant of media manipulation which targets digital video using a combination of traditional video processing and video editing techniques with auxiliary methods from artificial intelligence like face recognition. The results range from artistic videos produced for aesthetic effects to videos aimed at (mass) manipulation and propaganda, a straightforward extension of the long-standing possibilities of photo manipulation.\n"}

The couple performed as The Atlas and Vulcana Group of Society Athletes.\n\nKate Williams was born to a popular local preacher, and worked at a tannery in Abergavenny. She met William Roberts at the local women's gymnasium he ran in 1890, when she was fifteen. They fell in love; in spite of Roberts already having a wife and family, they left town together and were never parted for the rest of their lives.\n\nWilliams's first professional appearance was as a replacement act at a fete hosted by Roberts in Pontypool, Wales. They began to be billed together as Atlas and Vulcana from the time of their first appearances in London in 1892. In 1903, Vulcana and Atlas were engaged by Harry Rickards and toured Australia.\n\nAtlas, a true showman of his times, greatly exaggerated his own and Vulcana's lifting capacities, and most of his published boasts have been dismissed. On more than one occasion, he was challenged to his face and shown to be using weights lighter than he claimed. At these times, Vulcana's reputation suffered alongside his, although her authenticated accomplishments were genuinely remarkable for a woman of her era.\n\nVulcana reached the height of her popularity in France, impressing the Halterophile Club de France with her feats of strength, which earned her a medal from the \"Father of French Bodybuilding\", Professor Edmond Desbonnet and a picture on the cover of \"La Santé par les Sports\". She was honored with over one hundred medals throughout her career.\n\nHer best-authenticated feats were bent press with her right hand of at least 124½ lb (56.5 kg), with some authorities accepting a press of 145 lb (66 kg), and an overhead lift with a 56 lb (25 kg) weight in each hand.\n\nShe freed a wagon stuck in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London in October 1901 by lifting it before astonished witnesses.\n\nAuthorities believe Vulcana reached the peak of her strength in about 1910. On 29 May 1913 at Haggar's Theatre in Llanelly, she lifted a challenge bell that rival strongwoman Athelda failed to raise after twenty-five minutes of trying.\n\nA woman publicly displaying strength was sufficient to generate \"succès de scandale\", as publicity stunts were then called, and Vulcana was no stranger to the art of aggrandizing tales of her exploits. However, some of the stories about her are based on genuine incidents of heroism on her part:\n\n\n\nVulcana and Atlas moved permanently to London in the 1920s, and retired from performance in 1932.\n\nVulcana was hit by a car in London in 1939, and was conscious when she heard her own death pronounced. She suffered brain damage, but partially recovered, and briefly outlived Atlas and her youngest daughter, both of whom also died in 1946.\n\nVulcana and Atlas never married one another, and they billed themselves as brother and sister throughout their careers. They did however have six children together, William, Hedley, Augustus, Arthur, Nora, and Mona (1900 – 1946). No scandal erupted, as their secret was not discovered during their lifetimes.\n\nVulcana did not want her children left with relatives or in orphanages, and insisted on raising them herself. Thus, all of her children performed with the Society Athletes as soon as they were old enough.\n\nNora Roberts would go on to appear in the film \"Things to Come\" (1936).\n\nThe Vulcana Women's Circus, based in Brisbane, Australia, is named after her.\n\n"}
