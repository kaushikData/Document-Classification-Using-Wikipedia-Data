The major plot device is a time loop or time bounce.\n\nKurtwood Smith plays Myron Castleman, an everyman stuck in a loop that forces him to constantly relive the same hour of his life over and over, being the only person aware of this. During one loop, he discovers that a scientist named Nathan Rosenbluth has predicted an event that matches his experience. Castleman calls him and explains what is going on, however, Rosenbluth is highly skeptical of his claims. Over the next loops, Myron struggles to get into contact with Rosenbluth again, and in the process becomes frustrated to the point of screaming at his secretary and throwing his suitcase into traffic. Eventually, he does manage to talk to Rosenbluth, who initially dismisses Myron as crazy until Myron describes the transition as the scientist had predicted (including the phrase \"Consciousness is an independent variable,\" which is central to Rosenbluth's theories). The professor sadly informs Castleman that there is nothing that can be done, causing Myron to become hysterical and shoot himself. There is a brief pause until Myron finds himself back at the beginning of the loop, realizing that he is trapped for eternity.\n\nThis version has not been released on DVD or VHS in the United States, but it is available on DVD in the UK, collected on a DVD with other short films.\n\n\n"}

It was directed by the Hughes Brothers, the filmmakers behind \"Menace II Society\" and \"Dead Presidents\". \nThe documentary consists of first person interviews of people involved in the pimping lifestyle (\"the game\"). The interviews are separated by short clips from 1970s blaxploitation films such as \"Willie Dynamite\", \"The Mack\", and \"Dolemite\".\n\nThe first portion of the documentary focuses on pimps working illegally. The illegal pimps that are interviewed are from all over the United States, e.g., Charm from Hawaii, Fillmore Slim from San Francisco, and Payroll from Las Vegas. These pimps, and many others discuss their theories on the history of prostitution. The pimps go on to talk about their philosophy on pimping, and how they live their daily life.\n\nThe film also discusses the legal sector of prostitution. Dennis Hof, the owner of the Bunny Ranch in Nevada, is interviewed. He feels that Nevada is much smarter than the other states because they have imposed the proper health and background checks on prostitution, instead of trying to suppress prostitution by making it illegal.\n\nThe majority of the documentary glorifies the pimping lifestyle. The pimps and prostitutes interviewed mainly discuss the perks of the lifestyle. They talk about the money they have made, and the expensive suits and cars they were able to buy. However, near the end of the film, the interviews involve prostitutes that have died from the lifestyle as well as pimps who have retired and hold straight jobs or those who are now in jail.\n\n\nA 2009 HBO drama based on \"American Pimp\" that planned to examine the world of prostitution in Oakland, California came under fire from then Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums and other city officials before filming had begun. The planned show, called \"Gentlemen of Leisure\" would have focused on a pimp in his 40s and his attempts to get out of the business.\n\nDellums worried about the impact \"Gentlemen of Leisure\" would have had on Oakland's image. \"It is the mayor's view that this project goes against our vision of Oakland as a 'model city' and does a disservice to residents and visitors alike,\" Dellums' Chief of Staff, David Chai, said. \"While the mayor understands that there are certain benefits to having a major film project in our city, he is not willing to support this project at this time. The people of Oakland have come too far to have our city's name trampled upon in the name of entertainment.\"\n\n\n"}

The bedroom farce is perhaps the most common form of farce.\n\nThe most famous bedroom farceur is probably Georges Feydeau, whose collections of coincidences, slamming doors, and ridiculous dialogue delighted Paris in the 1890s and are now considered forerunners to the Theatre of the Absurd. The Viennese playwright Arthur Schnitzler took bedroom farce to its highest dramatic level in his \"La Ronde\", which in ten bedroom scenes connect the highest and lowest of Vienna.\n\nSome of the English Aldwych farces by Ben Travers which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s have aspects of \"bedroom farce\", e.g. \"A Cuckoo in the Nest\" or \"Rookery Nook\". However, in each case the sharing of a bedroom or house turns out to have an innocent explanation.\n\nIn modern times, Woody Allen's \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" (1982) presents aspects of the bedroom farce. Michael Frayn's 1977 play \"Donkeys' Years\" is a classic bedroom farce; Frayn parodied the genre in his 1982 play \"Noises Off\" via its play-within-the-play, \"Nothing On.\" Alan Ayckbourn's play, entitled \"Bedroom Farce\", looks at the lives of three couples seen in their own bedrooms, the stage being split into three sets for this purpose. There is much humour in the play, although few if any of the usual conventions of farce are observed.\n\n\"Boeing Boeing\" is a classic French farce for the stage by Marc Camoletti. Utilizing most of the conventions of bedroom farce's canon, it concerns a Parisian bachelor playboy with three international air stewardess fiancées he secretly keeps in careful rotation, until their flight schedules change and he, along with his provincial friend and sassy maid, must keep them from finding out about each other. Luckily they have enough doors in the apartment to keep the girls unwittingly flitting about for two hours.\n\nAmerican three-camera situation comedy, an extension of proscenium stage tradition, often includes elements of farce, specifically in several episodes of \"Three's Company\", the \"Woody's Wedding\" episode of \"Cheers\", \"The Ski Lodge\" episode of \"Frasier\", and the \"Love Car Displacement\" episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\".\n\nBrian Rix performed many bedroom farces at the Garrick theatre in London, many of which were broadcast by the BBC.\n\n"}
{"id": "9216123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9216123", "title": "Celtic Kings: Rage of War", "text": "Celtic Kings: Rage of War\n\nCeltic Kings: Rage of War is a game developed by Haemimont Games. It is set during the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar.\n\nIn Italy and Spain, the game is titled as \"Imperivm: La guerra gallica\" and \"Imperivm: La Guerra de las Galias\".\n\nCeltic Kings takes place in ancient Roman times, during the years that Julius Caesar was the military leader of the Roman Empire. There are three main modes: Adventure, single player (a classic RTS Skirmish mode), and multiplayer. Adventure mode includes a tutorial and the main story. In both campaigns, you control a hero named Larax. In the main story, he loses his wife in a Teutonic raid. In grief, he swears vengeance, and gives his body and soul to Kathubodua, the Goddess of War, to enable him to achieve his revenge.\n\nThis game uses both role-playing and real-time strategy elements. Units are controlled in a standard RTS fashion. Most units have the ability to gain levels. This is done either through fighting, training(to a certain limit, usually level 12), or, in the case of the priest/druid, learning from units with more experience (levels) . In adventure mode, the player will constantly move between maps, which are all greatly varying in landscape and objectives. For dialogue, it is in the form of text, where the player has a choice of what to say.\n\nThere are two main factions, the Romans, and the Gauls. These two factions are diverse from each other, in terms of gameplay. Their units are different, with the superior Roman technology, while the Gauls depend on their numbers. There is a third, non-playable faction, the Teutons, a nomadic people who live in tents throughout the map. If non-allied units get too close to the tent, the Teutons will engage them in combat. These tents can be captured by killing all the Teutons within proximity of the tent.\n\nThere are two main resources in gameplay: food and gold. Food is mainly produced from villages or can sometimes be bought or captured. Food is an important resource for keeping units alive, since they can starve, thus losing health, and weakening them in battle. Gold comes mainly from taxing the people of your cities, though it can also be captured or borrowed (with a significant interest rate). It is used to produce and upgrade your units. Unlike a traditional RTS, the player's resources are not \"global\". Mules and supply ships are used to transport resources between cities.\n\nStructures cannot be constructed, neither can they be destroyed, They can only be captured. This is much easier with a catapult, an immobile artillery unit built by up to ten military units to demolish enemy defenses. This job is also possible with archers, but less effective. All structures have a loyalty rating, which gradually decreases if enemy military units are ordered to capture it. If the rating reaches zero, than the structure surrenders to the conqueror's side.\n\nThere are hero units in the game, which are considerably more powerful than normal units. Heroes can attach units to themselves, giving them the ability to march in formation. The hero's experience is shared between the units under his/her command, making them stronger. Heroes can also recover artifacts from various temples located throughout the map, giving them special, albeit limited abilities such as healing friendly units and increased prowess in battle.\n\n\"Celtic Kings\" became a hit in Spain, with sales above 100,000 units in the region by 2003. By 2006, it sold over 1 million copies in Spain, Italy, and Latin America alone.\n\nThe game was well received by critics. IGN gave the game a rating of 8.2/10, GameSpot gave it a rating of 8.4/10, while Gamespy rated the game a 4.5/5. Gone Gold gave the game a score of 87/100, and Games Domain gave 4.5/5. The game was praised for its success in mixing the elements of RTS and RPG. Some criticisms include the somewhat overblown soundtrack and the voice acting.\n\n"}

It is currently French manuscript 844 of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. It is known by various sigla, depending on which of its contents are the focus of study: it is troubadour manuscript W, trouvère manuscript M, and motet manuscript R.\n\nThe manuscript contains more than 600 songs composed for the most part between the late twelfth and early thirteenth century. Some were written by famous troubadours and trouvères as Guiot de Dijon or Richard de Fournival, but others are anonymous. It contains as an addendum a booklet of songs by King Theobald I of Navarre, sometimes known as manuscript Mt. Around 85% of its material is French, while only 61 songs are by troubadours. Of these, 51 have music.\n\nThe songbook has close associations with the Principality of the Morea and was most likely created as a gift for William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea by Charles of Anjou, the King of Naples and William's father-in-law. By around 1270, it was in Charles's possession. Today, the state of conservation of the collection is bad. Eighteen pages have are missing and several decorative initials have been cut out, but it is remains a major testimony of medieval music.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6417406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6417406", "title": "Cue mark", "text": "Cue mark\n\nA cue mark, also known as a cue dot, a changeover cue or simply a cue is a visual indicator used with motion picture film prints, usually placed on the right-hand upper corner of a frame of the film. Cue dots are also used as a visual form of signalling on television broadcasts.\n\nA pair of cue marks is used to signal the projectionist that a particular reel of a movie is ending, as most movies presented on film come to theaters on several reels of film lasting about 14 to 20 minutes each (the positive print rolls, themselves, are either 1,000 feet or, more commonly 2,000 feet, nominally 11.11 or 22.22 minutes, maximum, with more commonly an editorial maximum of 10 or 20 minutes). The marks appear in the last seconds of each reel; the first mark, known as the motor cue, is placed about 8 seconds before the end of the picture section of the reel. The second mark, known as the changeover cue, is placed about 1 second before the end. Each mark lasts for precisely 4 frames (0.17 seconds).\n\nCoded Anti-Piracy is a different kind of mark, used for watermarking to detect and prevent copyright infringement.\n\nThe exact placement of cues varies somewhat from lab to lab.\n\nAccording to SMPTE-301 (Theatre Projection Leader), there shall be 4 frames of motor cue, followed by 172 frames of picture, followed by 4 frames of changeover cue, followed by 18 frames of picture. That puts the motor cue at frames 198–195 from the end of the picture section of the reel (12.34 to 12.15 feet; or 12-foot-6-frames through 12-foot-3-frames), and the changeover cue at frames 21–19 from the end (1.31 to 1.18 feet; or 1-foot-5-frames through 1-foot-3-frames). As of January 2005, most domestic United States release prints follow this standard.\n\nAccording to SMPTE-55 (SMPTE Universal leader), there shall be 4 frames of motor cue, followed by 168 frames of picture, followed by 4 frames of changeover cue, followed by 24 frames of picture. That puts the motor cue at frames 200–197 (12.47 to 12.28 feet; or 12-foot-8-frames to 12-foot-5-frames) from the end of the picture section of the reel, and the changeover cue at frames 28–25 (1.75 to 1.56 feet; or 1-foot-12-frames to 1-foot-9-frames) from the end. Prior to January 2005, domestic United States release prints printed by Deluxe Laboratories (about half of domestic first-run major releases) followed this standard.\n\nMost cue marks appear as either a black circle (if the physical hole is punched out on the negative used to make the projection print of the film), or a white circle (if the mark is made by punching a hole or scraping the emulsion on the positive film print). They will also appear as an oval if the print is projected through an anamorphic lens.\n\nIn order to make these marks appear clearer to the projectionist, the punched film is most often \"inked\" after punching by application of India ink, or a similar ink. The sample frames at the right have very fine inking. In the days of three-strip Technicolor, and successive exposure Technicolor cartoons, where separate silver images were available, it was not uncommon to apply two punches, one being larger and circular and the other being smaller and \"serrated\", with these being done in contrasting colors.\n\nMost projection booths in movie theaters in the past (and in some older theaters and studio screening rooms today) were equipped with two projectors side-by-side to project reels of film alternating between the two projectors. The cue mark was originally designed for such a setup.\n\nIn such a system, the projectionist had a projector running the currently-playing reel (the outgoing projector) and a second incoming projector with the next reel to play, with each projector switching roles with each changeover. The projectionist would start the incoming projector with the changeover douser (shutter) closed as the first mark (the motor cue) appeared; the second projector would be threaded with the incoming reel parked 8 seconds of countdown ahead of the start of the picture section. The second mark (changeover cue) would alert the projectionist that the changeover was imminent, and one full second after the mark he would trigger a solenoid that would open the incoming projector and another solenoid that would close the outgoing projector. The audio would be switched at this time as well; the audio for a particular film frame appears 20 frames (about 15\") before the image, and so all film prints carry the first two to three feet of audio of the reel they precede at their tail, called a sound pullup (digital systems use different offsets before or after the image, which a computer corrects for). Film prints could be prepped by a projectionist with automatic changeover cues, which were small metallic appliqués which could be applied to a print at the first cue mark. Readers attached to the projector would read the marks and execute the changeover sequence automatically, as long as the incoming reel was threaded properly on the second projector.\n\nHowever, most modern movie film projection systems have the film loaded on a very large horizontally-oriented platter (often colloquially known as a \"cakestand\"), in which all the reels of a movie are spliced together into one large contiguous wind of film filling the platter. Studios and preservation libraries that allow their archival or other rare prints to be exhibited typically demand that a twin projection system still be used so that their prints are not cut up for assembly.\n\nSuch newer platter-based projectors would eliminate the need for cue marks, but the marks are still present on modern-day motion picture projection prints, mainly for older theaters and studio screening rooms still using 2-projector setups, and also to aid the projectionist in identifying reel ends during the splicing together of the reels onto a platter in newer theaters.\n\nIn past years, certainly up to the late 1960s, cue marks were applied to the composited camera original negative, but no longer. Cue marks are now applied to the printing internegative, only, and these marks appear to be black, because the mark is made on a negative image, suitable for release print making, only. However, for many films, particularly those for which Academy consideration is anticipated, a special kind of film print, known variously as a \"Showprint\" (a trademark) or an \"EK\" (a generic name, after Eastman Kodak), is indeed made directly from the composited camera original negative. In these cases, the cue marks are manually applied to the finished film prints, and these marks appear to be white, because the mark is made on a positive image suitable for direct projection. A typical print run of such \"Showprints\" or \"EKs\" might be about five prints, with one being intended for a Los Angeles engagement (required by the Academy for its consideration), possibly one for a New York engagement, possibly one for the producer, possibly one for the distributor, and one for archival purposes.\n\nIn television, a similar idea is used to signal to a control room that a transition of some sort is about to occur on the broadcast (such as a commercial break). The most common type of television cue dot is the IBA style, used around the world, which consists of a small square in the top right corner of the screen, with black and white moving stripes. The other is a proprietary system used principally by the BBC (who do not air commercials). This version is a static square in the top left corner with a white-black-white pattern.\nIn the early days of television, some stations used a puncher or a scriber on film prints. This was seldom accurate and not all stations used the same five second / one second pattern. Viewers were often treated to distortion just before station breaks in any film that had been around a while. Although the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers attempted to standardize television cues, its efforts went largely unheeded. Indeed, the wide variety of telecine projectors (Eastman Kodak 250 on the high-end and RCA TP-16 on the low-end, for 16mm, and RCA TP-35 on the high-end and General Precision 35 on the low-end, for 35mm) significantly prevented any such standardization.\n\nIn the past few decades, the cue dot was used extensively on the ITV and Channel 4 television networks in the United Kingdom as a commercial break was approaching. This was for the benefit of the regional playout centres who would need to play in commercials for their region. Automation and playout servers led to this being phased out and it is now used only for some live presentations, especially those with regional opt-outs or variable ad breaks. The cue dot appears about 1 minute before the break and disappears 5 seconds before the break starts. ITV use a spinning black-and-white ticker in the corner of the screen. In recent years, ITV has reduced to using the cue dot during coverage of sporting events (e.g. football matches), and any other programmes that are being broadcast live.\n\nThe BBC's main purpose of cue dots was to cue the following programme, either from a studio or from an outside broadcast.\n\nImprovements in talkback and Presfax means that cue dots are rarely used now by the BBC. The prevalence of digital television and the accompanying delays means that the use of cue dots to communicate with outside broadcast units is obsolete.\n\nCue dots do have some other uses: presentation may be asked to \"flash your dots\" by an outside broadcast unit so they can confirm that their off-air check feed is the correct one, particularly when they are working on a regional basis. The dots are also used during coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championships to warn other broadcasters that the BBC feed will be cutting to an interview intended for the UK audience only, so they should be ready to go to something else.\n\n"}

Moore has said the premise of \"Echo\" is a woman living in today's America who is dealing with a sudden unbelievable change to her daily life.\n\nAfter being announced on November 19, 2007, the first issue was released on March 5, 2008. \"Echo\" ran for 30 issues, published on a roughly monthly basis, and concluding in June 2011, with periodic collections of five issues each. Following the series conclusion, a single collection of the entire series was published.\n\nIn 2009, the film rights for \"Echo\" were purchased by producer Lloyd Levin. The movie was initially expected to begin production in late 2011.\n\nIn 2017, Moore said \"Echo\" is set in the same fictional universe as his other works, \"Strangers in Paradise\", \"Rachel Rising\", and \"Motor Girl\" and that the characters may return in the 2018 book \"Strangers in Paradise XXV\".\n\nWhile taking photographs in the desert, Julie Martin witnesses the explosion of a battle suit and its pilot, the end result of a live munitions exercise. The suit, now reduced to small pellets, rains down on Julie and her pick-up truck. The pellets are heavy, landing with significant force and adhere to both Julie and her truck. Julie returns home, still covered in pellets, and listens to a voice mail from her husband, who is insisting she sign divorce papers. Julie attempts to remove the pellets that have stuck to her, only to have the pellets spread and bond to a portion of her body.\n\nJulie decides to seek medical attention to have the metallic substance removed from her body. When she opens the door to her truck more of the pellets bond to her skin. Julie's shoulders and chest are almost completely covered by the metallic substance at this point, and the substance now bears an unknown symbol. When a doctor touches the substance it reacts by removing his fingernail, whereas Julie feels no more than a tingling and some slight warmth. The doctor believes the situation to be a horrible prank, and refuses to treat Julie. Meanwhile, the developers of the battle suit (HeNRI) have confirmed Julie's presence at the scene of the explosion and dispatch a young woman known as Ivy (despite objections from the military) to locate Julie.\n\nJulie is aided by Dillon Murphy, a park ranger who was the boyfriend of Annie, the previous owner of the suit. Ivy eventually teams with Julie and Dillon to help them escape and to stop Dr. Foster of HeNRI, who plans to use the alloy to power a black hole device.\n\nDuring her long run from the military, Julie discovers several things about her metallic plate. It seems bonded to her nervous system, tapping into her emotional state to achieve several powers, including, but not limited to, a powerful healing ability able to repair physical damage on her body and the ones of people to whom Julie is able to feel a strong empathic bond, or activate lightning to protect her from harm when she's scared or angered. Furthermore, the previous owner of the suit, Annie Trotter, seems to have somehow imprinted her personality in the metal, echoing at times in Julie's mind. The alloy also enhances Julie's physical form, making her noticeably taller and more powerful. Prolonged direct contact by Julie with Ivy also causes Ivy to decrease in physical age to her young teens.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody, \"El cóndor pasa\", was legally registered on May 3, 1933, by The Edward B. Marks Music Corporation with the United States' Library of Congress under the number 9643. This zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts. The eponymous piece, performed during the zarzuela's parade scene, has no lyrics. In July 2013, the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El Cóndor Pasa (cultural association) re-edited the original script, which had been lost for some time, as a CD containing the dialogues and seven musical pieces. The music from the original score was reconstructed by musicologist Luis Salazar Mejía, with the collaboration of musicians Daniel Dorival and Claude Ferrier, and it was performed on November 14, 15 and 16, 2013, at the Teatro UNI in Lima to commemorate the masterpiece's first centenary. All of the work done to recover and re-release the zarzuela (including the CD) was possible thanks to the efforts of musicologist Luis Salazar Mejía and cultural promoter Mario Cerrón Fetta (members of the above-mentioned cultural association), and was carried out without any public financial support.\n\nThe zarzuela's famous eponymous melody is considered the second national anthem of Peru. It is based on the traditional Andean music of Peru, which was declared an element of National Cultural Heritage in 2004. There are probably more than 400 versions of the piece by artists from around the world, at least 300 of which have lyrics.\n\n\nThe story takes place in the early twentieth century in Yápac, a mining settlement in the Peruvian Andes.\n\nAct 1\n\nThe first scene begins with the Prelude. It is before dawn and Yápac's miners are heading to work. A male choir is performing a mournful song \"En la nieve de las cumbres\" (\"On the Snow of the Peaks\"). At the end of the song some miners fall behind while listening to the shepherd playing the quena (traditional flute of the Andes); they watch him disappear among the clouds that surround the peaks with admiration, and they envy his freedom. Frank is a young miner who does not accept the mine owners' abuse. \"Something tells me that life isn't this way\", Frank says, but the other miners accuse him of being ungrateful to the patrones.\n\nIn the second scene, Juanacha and Ruperto (two shepherds) enter the stage. Ruperto is playfully chasing Juanacha, whom he is about to marry. Everyone leaves the stage but Frank, who performs a melancholic yaraví (song) \"Pobre alma prisionera\" (\"Poor Captive Soul\") while he reflects on his identity, appearance, and feelings.\n\nIn the third scene, mine owners Mr. King and Mr. Cup enter the stage chatting, when they see Frank sitting on a rock outside the gallery. Mr. King questions Frank and tells him to get back inside the mine after a brief altercation. Mr. King and Mr. Cup continue their conversation after Frank leaves.\n\nDuring the fourth scene Mr. King forces the four miners to exit the gallery with gunfire. He asks briefly about their progress and sends them back in. Tension grows between Frank and Mr. King. María enters on stage out of breath, bringing liquor to Mr. King. They talk about Frank, and María tries to intercede for her son. It is revealed that Mr. King is Frank's biological father. María and King sing together \"Perdónalo, taita\" (\"Forgive Him, Father\"), and Mr. King finally agrees not to punish the boy, swayed by the passion he feels towards María. They leave together, while Higinio, María's husband, comes out of the gallery and furiously acknowledges his anger towards his bosses and plots his revenge.\n\nAct 2\n\nOutside the mine, a feast is being held in honor of Ruperto and Juanacha's wedding that is going to take place in the town. During a cachua (dance), the sky darkens; a storm will begin soon and the couple will be unable to reach the town to get married. Everyone prays to the Virgin, singing \"Dulce reina de las cumbres\" (\"Sweet Queen of the Peaks\") and miraculously the sun shines again. The couple and friends head to town, dancing (parade), except for the miners who can not leave work. It is during this scene that the tune \"El condor pasa\" is played. During the party, Mr. King has too much to drink, and cruelly abuses Higinio. When Mr. King leaves, Higinio follows him on a higher path, and pushes a boulder onto him when they reach a gorge, causing his death. A shepherd witnesses the horrible murder and tells the other miners about it. Higinio admits it all; María weeps inconsolably over the tragedy that has struck her family; and the miners fear for their lives. The other mine owner, Mr. Cup, arrives gun in hand looking for the murderer. Frank faces him, defending Higinio and his friends, and kills him. Everyone is horrified at these events. The appearance of a condor, the first one after many years, is seen as a sign of a new life of freedom and they are filled with hope. \"We are all condors\", the miners shout joyfully.\n\nThe pieces were originally written for orchestra, not for Andean instruments. The most famous parts, such as the prelude, parade, and cachua, have been adapted from the piano arrangement that Daniel Alomía Robles sold to The Edward B. Marks Music Corp., in New York, by the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El Cóndor Pasa in 1933. All of the pieces are exempt from copyright license fees due to the time elapsed since they were registered.\n\nIn 1965, American artist Paul Simon listened to the version of the parade tune performed by Los Incas in the Théâtre de l'Est Parisien (Paris). Simon asked the band permission to include a cover version of the song on an album. The band advised him that the piece belonged to Andean folklore, while the arrangement was Jorge Milchberg's (director of Los Incas). Milchberg is represented as the arrangement's co-author because he added two notes which entitled him to collect royalties. In 1970, Simon & Garfunkel covered the Los Incas' version under the name \"El Cóndor Pasa\" (\"If I Could\"), adding English lyrics written by Simon, and included it in the album \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". Daniel Alomía Robles was not listed in the credits as the piece's original composer, because it was considered an Andean folk melody. Simon was listed as the author of the lyrics; nobody was given credit for the melody. This cover achieved worldwide fame, and has itself been covered multiple times, its lyrics translated into multiple languages. Even Armando Robles Godoy, the composer's son and Peruvian filmmaker, wrote new lyrics for the song using Paul Simon's version as a reference.\n\nRenowned Argentinean guitarist and composer Eduardo Falú also adapted the song for solo guitar. Many other exceptional covers belong to Peruvian guitar players including: Raúl García Zárate, Manuelcha Prado, and Mario Orozco Cáceres. There is also a cover from the song sung by Trini López, and another cover in Chinese by Teresa Teng. There are covers by Peruvian singers including: Yma Súmac, and Roxsana and Kesia Rivera with different lyrics. Famous singers Plácido Domingo, Celia Cruz, Marc Anthony, José Feliciano, and Esther Ofarim also have their own covers of the song.\n\n\n\n"}

Created by Dylan Marron, the videos are an attempt to highlight the lack of casting and involvement of POC in Hollywood produced films, in addition to highlighting his own experiences in attempting to be cast in films as a Venezuelan American.\n\nThe reasons for such low amounts of casting of POC in films is stated by Marron to be about fear, because the \"people who finance the movies are not going to want to throw millions behind a movie of a non-famous person of color\". In addition, default casting for films, even for works or scripts with no specified races for the characters, is to choose white actors. The novel \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green is noted by Marron as a work with no races given for the characters and one that has had worldwide success in its book form, but the main cast for the film were chosen by the producing studio to be entirely white. Manohla Dargis, writing for \"The New York Times\", noted that Marron's videos show that even when POC are cast in films, they are often cast in stereotypical roles that function as tokenism for the casting quota. \"The Boston Globe\" compared Marron's videos with other statistics presented in the \"2015 Hollywood Diversity Report\", which showed that scriptwriters and directors are also rarely POC, along with lead roles in films.\n\nSeveral celebrities have praised and shared the blog with their fans, including Aziz Ansari, Junot Diaz, Kerry Washington, and Chirlane McCray. The blog was named by Tumblr as the most viral blog of 2015.\n\nMarron began producing the video cuts in June 2015 and the popularity of the blog began to increase soon after beginning the project. The idea for the blog came after Marron started a play titled \"Every Single Word\" for his theater group, called the \"New York Neo Futurists\", which involved a large number of short play pieces by different members. Marron's act consisted of him saying every line by Anjelah Johnson-Reyes in \"Enough Said\". In 2014, while re-watching the film, he realized that the writer was unable to view POC as separate from service jobs and caused him to form his act for the group. This act eventually led to his investigation of other films and the creation of his video cut blog.\n\nThe coverage of POC representation in the Harry Potter series by Marron resulted in some controversy. Some fans were upset that the videos pointed out the low representation, \"5 minutes and 40 seconds long – out of 1,207 total minutes of run-time\" and the whitewashing of the character Lavender Brown from the black actresses that had played her in the first five movies to the \"blond woman\" from the sixth movie on, when the character has a heavier involvement and lines in the plot. After doing videos on a number of popular movies and series, Marron decided to do a series of videos on every Academy Award for Best Picture winner since the first award in 1929, in chronological order so that any differences in POC casting can be seen in relation to historical time period. Marron also created a series of videos looking at all the films directed by Nancy Meyers, six films in total. He found that POC representation across all of the films only made up 0.7% of run-time and that most of the characters were not named and were presented as working service jobs.\n\nA \"Every Single Word: The Oscars\" live event was conducted by Marron on February 28, 2016 in New York City, where the words spoken by people of color during the Oscars was live cut during viewing.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> \"The films and television shows below are presented in chronological order except for those released in the same year, which are presented alphabetically:\"\n\n"}

In the original version of the scene, Han shoots Greedo dead. Later versions are edited so that Greedo attempts to fire at Han first. Director George Lucas altered the scene to give Solo more justification for acting in self-defense. Many fans and commentators oppose the change, feeling it weakens Solo's character. The controversy is referenced in the 2018 film \"\".\n\nSmuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) has jettisoned cargo belonging to crime lord Jabba the Hutt to avoid capture by an Imperial search party. As a result, Jabba offers a bounty on Solo. In the Mos Eisley cantina, bounty hounter Greedo (Paul Blake) corners Solo and forces him at gunpoint to sit. Solo tells Greedo he has the money to compensate Jabba, but Greedo demands the money for himself. Solo says he does not have the money with him and quietly readies his gun under the table. Greedo tells him that Jabba has run out of patience and that Greedo has been \"waiting for a long time\" to capture Solo. Solo replies, \"Yes, I'll bet you have.\" The scene's conclusion varies depending on the version of the film.\n\nIn the original 1977 theatrical release of the scene, the film cuts to a closeup of Greedo's face, followed quickly by flash sparks, a cloud of smoke, and the sound effect of a blaster firing. This is followed by a reverse angle of Greedo from behind, slumping over the table. In 2012, director George Lucas expressed his dissatisfaction with this climax, believing that it depicts Solo, the film's supporting protagonist, as a \"cold-blooded killer\". But Greedo had pointed a gun at Solo and bragged that he had been \"looking forward\" to seeing Solo's \"dead body\", constituting—according to at least one legal expert—a direct threat on Solo's life that would clearly warrant preemptive action on Solo's part in self-defense in the United States.\n\nIn the 1997 Special Edition rerelease of the film, a few frames are inserted in which Greedo shoots first at Solo and misses, and then Solo returns fire, killing Greedo.\n\nFor the film's 2004 DVD release, the scene was altered again, with new timing so that the shots are fired at nearly the same time and so that Solo dodges Greedo's shot. In an article titled \"The \"Star Wars\" George Lucas Doesn't Want You To See\", \"The Atlantic\" summarized that \"[i]n the original versions ... it's clear that Han Solo pulled out his gun and shot the bounty hunter Greedo. In the 1997 version, Greedo shoots first. In the 2004 version, they shoot at the same time.\"\n\nFor the 2011 Blu-ray release, the scene of Solo and Greedo firing at each other was shortened by several frames.\n\nThe change is one of the most controversial made in the 1997 Special Edition \"Star Wars\" rerelease. The primary objection to the revision is that it alters Han's initially morally ambiguous character, making his later transition from anti-hero to hero less meaningful. According to \"Variety,\" \"Fans lost their minds. It was an affront, the neutering of a badass.\" Fans have created fan edits of the original \"Star Wars\" films to redact Lucas's changes, especially the scene with Solo and Greedo.\n\nIn a 2004 interview, Lucas explained: \"To me, [the original movie] doesn't really exist anymore. ... I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.\" In a 2012 interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Lucas stated that a combination of poor-quality close-up shots and the audience's inaccurate perception of the Han Solo character was what actually caused all the confusion. Lucas explained:\n\nOne draft of the original script makes no mention of Greedo shooting at all, only Solo. In 2015, a replica of an early script for \"Star Wars\" was discovered in the archives of the University of New Brunswick library. In the script, dated March 15, 1976, Han shoots first.\n\nIn 2014, asked by fans who shot first, actor Harrison Ford replied: \"I don't know and I don't care.\" Paul Blake, who played Greedo, said in a 2016 interview with the \"New York Daily News:\" \"Of course, it said it all in the original script, we played in the scene in English and at the end of the scene, it reads, 'Han shoots the alien.' It's all it says and that's what happened. It was very painful. Blake felt that Greedo shooting and missing Solo at very short range made him appear inept, and that Greedo has more glory if he is \"just blown away\".\n\nIn a 2015 interview for \"The Washington Post,\" Lucas said:Han Solo was going to marry (Princess) Leia, and you look back and say, 'Should he be a cold-blooded killer?'\" Lucas asks. \"Because I was thinking mythologically—should he be a cowboy, should he be John Wayne? And I said, 'Yeah, he should be John Wayne.' And when you're John Wayne, you don't shoot people [first]—you let them have the first shot. It's a mythological reality that we hope our society pays attention to.\n\nIn the 2018 film \"\" Han Solo shoots antagonist Tobias Beckett mid-sentence, killing him. Writers Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan confirmed that this was a deliberate reference, and that the \"Solo\" shooting script specifies: \"There can be no question that Han shoots first.\"\n"}

The words of \"harawi\" speak of love (often unrequited), plight of ordinary peasant, privations of orphans, etc. Melodies are mainly in minor pentatonic scale.\n\nThe first recorded \"harawi\" lyrics related to the Inca era. Some of the extant songs may also have the same age. Later, \"harawi\" became the basis for the mestizo genre \"yaravi\".\n\nIn Andean villages, there is still a tradition: a man, in love with a woman, expresses his feelings for her by playing one of many well-known \"harawis\" on the flute, not far from her house.

{"id": "13869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13869", "title": "Heavy metal music", "text": "Heavy metal music\n\nHeavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. The genre's lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.\n\nIn 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe, Poison and Def Leppard. Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of heavy metal such as death metal (with bands such as Death, Possessed, and Obituary) and black metal (with bands such as Mayhem, Bathory, and Immortal) remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.\n\nHeavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. \"The New York Times\" critic Jon Pareles writes, \"In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.\" The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound. Deep Purple's Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ. In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on \"Led Zeppelin III\"; by the 1990s, in \"almost every subgenre of heavy metal\" synthesizers were used.\n\nThe electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal. The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion. For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain moderate levels gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the characteristic \"punch and grind\". Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with lots of bass frequencies. Guitar solos are \"an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar\" to the genre. Most heavy metal songs \"feature at least one guitar solo\", which is \"a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\". Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos. With rhythm guitar parts, the \"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal ... [is created by] palm muting\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion. Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.\n\nThe lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional \"frontman\" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two \"contend for dominance\" in a spirit of \"affectionate rivalry\". Heavy metal \"demands the subordination of the voice\" to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an \"explicit display of emotion\" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity. Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's \"tone of voice\" is more important than the lyrics.\n\nThe prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \"heavy\". The bass plays a \"more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock\". Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s. Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines.\n\nThe essence of heavy metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision\". Heavy metal drumming \"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\", and drummers have to develop \"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns\" used in heavy metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal and some \"mainstream metal\" bands \"all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats\".\nIn live performance, loudness—an \"onslaught of sound\", in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description—is considered vital. In his book \"Metalheads\", psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as \"the sensory equivalent of war\". Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \"All we knew was we wanted more power.\" A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how \"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact.\" Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to \"sweep the listener into the sound\" and to provide a \"shot of youthful vitality\".\n\nHeavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male until at least the mid-1980s apart from exceptions such as Girlschool. However, by the 2010s women were making more of an impact, and PopMatters' Craig Hayes argues that metal \"clearly empowers women\". In the sub-genres of symphonic and power metal, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers; bands such as Nightwish, Delain, and Within Temptation have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments.\n\nThe rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\". In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures—generally made up of 8th or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.\n\nBrief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\". By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).\n\nOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord. In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low frequency sounds are created, which add to the \"weight of the sound\" and create an effect of \"overwhelming power\". Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord, power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth, or minor sixth. Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.\n\nHeavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes. Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions. In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \"pentatonic and blues-derived features\".\n\nThe tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones—such as C to F#—was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it \"diabolus in musica\"—\"the devil in music\".\n\nHeavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts. According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\". In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized.\n\nRobert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \"assemblage of disparate musical styles known ... as 'classical music has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days. Also that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.\"\n\nIn an article written for \"Grove Music Online\", Walser stated that the \"1980s brought on ... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen\". Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that \"If done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together. Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.\"\n\nAlthough a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices—classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition. As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, \"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions'. An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music'.\"\n\nAccording to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath, and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music\". They take as an example Sabbath's second album \"Paranoid\" (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma—'Paranoid' and 'Fairies Wear Boots' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory 'War Pigs' and 'Hand of Doom'.\" Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic—a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.\n\nThe thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, \"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.\" Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are \"clearly misguided\" as these critics have \"overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise\". Music critic Robert Christgau called metal \"an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat\".\n\nHeavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song \"Under the Blade\" at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery. In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song \"Suicide Solution\". A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne's song. Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen's death. In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement \"do it\" in the song Better by You, Better than Me, it was featured on the album Stained Class (1978), the song was also a Spooky Tooth cover. While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed. In 1991, UK police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an \"unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity\".\n\nIn some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values. In countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated. In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans and they were accused of \"devil worship\" and blasphemy, after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes. In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the \"band's lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive\" and blasphemous. Some people considered heavy metal music to being a leading factor for mental health disorders, and thought that heavy metal fans were more likely to suffer with a poor mental health, but study has proven that this is not true and the fans of this music have a lower or similar percentage of people suffering from poor mental health.\n\nFor many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments, and music videos.\n\nDown-the-back long hair is the \"most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion\". Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair \"symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home\", according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community \"the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general\".\n\nThe classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light colored, ripped frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets. Deena Weinstein writes, \"T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.\" In the 1980s, a range of sources, from punk and goth music to horror films, influenced metal fashion. Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.\n\nFashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, \"hair metal\"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry. Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei—which includes many nonmetal groups—emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.\n\nMany metal musicians when performing live engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The il cornuto, or devil horns, hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio while with Black Sabbath and Dio. Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 \"Love Gun\" album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.\n\nAttendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and \"extreme heterosexualist ideology\". Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture. The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home. According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which \"were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture\". Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the \"pit\" near the stage. Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump \"back into the audience\".\n\nIt has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture. While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male, and blue-collar, the group is \"tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior\". Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites. Attending live concerts in particular has been called the \"holiest of heavy metal communions.\"\n\nThe metal scene has been characterized as a \"subculture of alienation\", with its own code of authenticity. This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never \"sell out\". Deena Weinstein states that for the fans themselves, the code promotes \"opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society\".\n\nMusician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, \"Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with\" and that metal is \"outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place\". Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as \"poseurs\" \"who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity\".\n\nThe origin of the term \"heavy metal\" in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1962 novel \"The Soft Machine\" includes a character known as \"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\". Burroughs' next novel, \"Nova Express\" (1964), develops the theme, using \"heavy metal\" as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music\". Inspired by Burroughs' novels, the term was used in the title of the 1967 album \"Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids\" by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music. The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe The Byrds for their supposed \"aluminium style of context and effect\", particularly on their album \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\" (1968).\n\nMetal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in \"hippiespeak\": \"heavy\" is roughly synonymous with \"potent\" or \"profound,\" and \"metal\" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal. The word \"heavy\" in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to \"heavy music\"—typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare—were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge. Iron Butterfly's debut album, released in early 1968, was titled \"Heavy\". The first use of \"heavy metal\" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song \"Born to Be Wild\", also released that year: \"I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/And the feelin' that I'm under.\"\n\nThe first documented use of the phrase to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford. In the May 11, 1968, issue of \"Rolling Stone\", he wrote about the album \"A Long Time Comin'\" by U.S. band Electric Flag: \"Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.\" In January 1970 Lucian K. Truscott IV reviewing \"Led Zeppelin II\" for the Village Voice described the sound as \"heavy\" and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.\n\nOther early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic Mike Saunders. In the November 12, 1970 issue of \"Rolling Stone\", he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: \"\"Safe as Yesterday Is,\" their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs ... and one monumental pile of refuse\". He described the band's latest, self-titled release as \"more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap\".\n\nIn a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's \"Kingdom Come\" in the May 1971 \"Creem\", Saunders wrote, \"Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book\". \"Creem\" critic Lester Bangs is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Through the decade, \"heavy metal\" was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown. In 1979, lead \"New York Times\" popular music critic John Rockwell described what he called \"heavy-metal rock\" as \"brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs\", and, in a different article, as \"a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers\".\n\nCoined by Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, \"downer rock\" was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and Bloodrock. \"Classic Rock\" magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of Quaaludes and the drinking of wine. Later the term would be replaced by \"heavy metal\".\n\nEarlier on, as \"heavy metal\" emerged partially from the heavy psychedelic rock scene, also known as acid rock, \"acid rock\" was often used interchangeably with \"heavy metal\" and \"hard rock\". Musicologist Steve Waksman stated that \"the distinction between acid rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can at some point never be more than tenuous\", while percussionist John Beck defined \"acid rock\" as synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal.\n\nApart from \"acid rock\", the terms \"heavy metal\" and \"hard rock\" have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous. For example, the 1983 \"Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll\" includes this passage: \"known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies\".\n\nHeavy metal's quintessential guitar style, built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to early 1950s Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a \"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\" on records such as James Cotton's \"\" (1954); the late 1950s instrumentals of Link Wray, particularly \"Rumble\" (1958); the early 1960s surf rock of Dick Dale, including \"Let's Go Trippin'\" (1961) and \"Misirlou\" (1962); and The Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie\" (1963) which made it a garage rock standard.\n\nHowever, the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s. American blues music was a major influence on the early British rockers of the era. Bands like The Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds developed blues rock by recording covers of classic blues songs, often speeding up the tempos. As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands—and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn—developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound. The Kinks played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit \"You Really Got Me\".\n\nIn addition to The Kinks' Dave Davies, other guitarists such as The Who's Pete Townshend and The Yardbirds' Jeff Beck were experimenting with feedback. Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar. Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's \"bigger-louder-wall-of-Marshalls\" approach was seminal.\n\nThe combination of blues rock with psychedelic rock and acid rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal. The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as \"acid rock\" was particularly influential on heavy metal; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock, or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted guitar-centered sound. Acid rock has been described as psychedelic rock at its \"rawest and most intense,\" emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia. American acid rock garage bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators epitomized the frenetic, heavier, darker and more psychotic sound of acid rock, a sound characterized by droning guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion, while the 13th Floor Elevators' sound in particular featured yelping vocals and \"occasionally demented\" lyrics. Frank Hoffman notes that: \"Psychedelia was sometimes referred to as 'acid rock'. The latter label was applied to a pounding, hard rock variant that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage-punk movement. ... When rock began turning back to softer, roots-oriented sounds in late 1968, acid-rock bands mutated into heavy metal acts.\"\n\nOne of the most influential bands in forging the merger of psychedelic rock and acid rock with the blues rock genre was the British power trio Cream, who derived a massive, heavy sound from unison riffing between guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce, as well as Ginger Baker's double bass drumming. Their first two LPs, \"Fresh Cream\" (1966) and \"Disraeli Gears\" (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style of heavy metal. The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, \"Are You Experienced\" (1967), was also highly influential. Hendrix's virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, \"Purple Haze\", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit. Vanilla Fudge, whose first album also came out in 1967, has been called \"one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal\", and the band has been cited as an early American heavy metal group. On their self-titled debut album, Vanilla Fudge created \"loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements\" of contemporary hit songs, blowing these songs up to \"epic proportions\" and \"bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze.\"\n\nDuring the late 1960s, many psychedelic singers, such as Arthur Brown, began to create outlandish, theatrical and often macabre performances; which in itself became incredibly influential to many metal acts. The American psychedelic rock band Coven, who opened for early heavy metal influencers such as Vanilla Fudge and the Yardbirds, portrayed themselves as practitioners of witchcraft or black magic, using dark—Satanic or occult—imagery in their lyrics, album art, and live performances. Live shows consisted of elaborate, theatrical \"Satanic rites.\" Coven's 1969 debut album, \"Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls\", featured imagery of skulls, black masses, inverted crosses, and Satan worship, and both the album artwork and the band's live performances marked the first appearances in rock music of the sign of the horns, which would later become an important gesture in heavy metal culture. At the same time in England, the band Black Widow were also among the first psychedelic rock bands to use occult and Satanic imagery and lyrics, though both Black Widow and Coven's lyrical and thematic influences on heavy metal were quickly overshadowed by the darker and heavier sounds of Black Sabbath.\n\nCritics disagree over who can be thought of as the first heavy metal band. Most credit either Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both. A few commentators—mainly American—argue for other groups including Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf or Blue Cheer. Deep Purple, the third band in what is sometimes considered the \"unholy trinity\" of heavy metal (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple), despite being slightly older than Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, fluctuated between many rock styles until late 1969 when they took a heavy metal direction.\n\nIn 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, the San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a cover of Eddie Cochran's classic \"Summertime Blues\", from their debut album \"Vincebus Eruptum\", that many consider the first true heavy metal recording. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including \"Born to Be Wild\", which refers to \"heavy metal thunder\" in describing a motorcycle. In July, the Jeff Beck Group, whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record: \"Truth\" featured some of the \"most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time,\" breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers. In September, Page's new band, Led Zeppelin, made its live debut in Denmark (billed as The New Yardbirds). The Beatles' \"White Album\", released the following month, included \"Helter Skelter\", then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band. The Pretty Things' rock opera \"S.F. Sorrow\", released in December, featured \"proto heavy metal\" songs such as \"Old Man Going\" and \"I See You\". Iron Butterfly's 1968 song \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" is sometimes described as an example of the transition between acid rock and heavy metal or the turning point in which acid rock became \"heavy metal\", and both Iron Butterfly's 1968 album \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" and Blue Cheer's 1968 album \"Vincebus Eruptum\" have been described as laying the foundation of heavy metal and greatly influential in the transformation of acid rock into heavy metal.\n\nIn this counterculture period MC5, who began as part of the Detroit garage rock scene, developed a raw distorted style that has been seen as a major influence on the future sound of both heavy metal and later punk music. The Stooges also began to establish and influence a heavy metal and later punk sound, with songs such as \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\", featuring pounding and distorted heavy guitar power chord riffs. Pink Floyd released two of their heaviest and loudest songs to date; \"Ibiza Bar\" and \"The Nile Song\", which was regarded as \"one of the heaviest songs the band recorded\". King Crimson's debut album started with \"21st Century Schizoid Man,\" which was considered heavy metal by several critics.\n\nIn January 1969, Led Zeppelin's self-titled debut album was released and reached number 10 on the \"Billboard\" album chart. In July, Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, Grand Funk Railroad, played the Atlanta Pop Festival. That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by Leslie West released \"Mountain\", an album filled with heavy blues rock guitar and roaring vocals. In August, the group—now itself dubbed Mountain—played an hour-long set at the Woodstock Festival, exposing the crowd of 300,000 people to the emerging sound of heavy metal. Mountain's proto-metal or early heavy metal hit song \"Mississippi Queen\" from the album \"Climbing!\" is especially credited with paving the way for heavy metal and was one of the first heavy guitar songs to receive regular play on radio. In September 1969, the Beatles released the album \"Abbey Road\" containing the track \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" which has been credited as an early example of or influence on heavy metal or doom metal. In October 1969, British band High Tide debuted with the heavy, proto-metal album \"Sea Shanties\".\n\nLed Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer Robert Plant's dramatic, wailing vocals. Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, \"purely\" metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre. The 1970 releases by Black Sabbath (\"Black Sabbath\" and \"Paranoid\") and Deep Purple (\"In Rock\") were crucial in this regard.\nBirmingham's Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist Tony Iommi suffered before cofounding the band. Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering. The bleak, industrial, working class environment of Birmingham, a manufacturing city full of noisy factories and metalworking, has itself been credited with influencing Black Sabbath's heavy, chugging, metallic sound and the sound of heavy metal in general. Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969 vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style. In 1970, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major UK chart hits with \"Paranoid\" and \"Black Night\", respectively. That same year, two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode: Uriah Heep with \"Very 'Eavy ... Very 'Umble\" and UFO with \"UFO 1\". Bloodrock released their self-titled debut album, containing a collection of heavy guitar riffs, gruff style vocals and sadistic and macabre lyrics. The influential Budgie brought the new metal sound into a power trio context, creating some of the heaviest music of the time. The occult lyrics and imagery employed by Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep would prove particularly influential; Led Zeppelin also began foregrounding such elements with its fourth album, released in 1971. In 1973, Deep Purple released the song \"Smoke on the Water\", with the iconic riff that's usually considered as the most recognizable one in \"heavy rock\" history, as a single of the classic live album Made in Japan.\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, the trend-setting group was Grand Funk Railroad, described as \"the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring\". Other influential bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S., such as Sir Lord Baltimore (\"Kingdom Come,\" 1970), Blue Öyster Cult (\"Blue Öyster Cult\", 1972), Aerosmith (\"Aerosmith\", 1973) and Kiss (\"Kiss\", 1974). Sir Lord Baltimore's 1970 debut album and both Humble Pie's debut and self-titled third album were all among the first albums to be described in print as \"heavy metal\", with \"As Safe As Yesterday Is\" being referred to by the term \"heavy metal\" in a 1970 review in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. Various smaller bands from the U.S., U.K, and Continental Europe, including Bang, Josefus, Leaf Hound, Primeval, Hard Stuff, Truth and Janey, Dust, JPT Scare Band, Frijid Pink, Cactus, May Blitz, Captain Beyond, Toad, Granicus, Iron Claw, and Yesterday's Children, though lesser known outside of their respective scenes, proved to be greatly influential on the emerging metal movement. In Germany, Scorpions debuted with \"Lonesome Crow\" in 1972. Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's highly influential album \"Machine Head\" (1972), left the band in 1975 to form Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio, singer and bassist for blues rock band Elf and future vocalist for Black Sabbath and heavy metal band Dio. Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio would expand on the mystical and fantasy-based lyrics and themes sometimes found in heavy metal, pioneering both power metal and neoclassical metal. These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.\n\nAs described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as \"heavy metal\" or simply as \"hard rock\". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with \"High Voltage\" in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 \"Rolling Stone\" encyclopedia entry begins, \"Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC\". Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, \"Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today. ... [They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal\". The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band \"became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition\".\n\nIn certain cases, there is little debate. After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's Judas Priest, which debuted with \"Rocka Rolla\" in 1974. In Christe's description,\n\nBlack Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of Thin Lizzy, in the stagecraft of Alice Cooper, in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of Queen, and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ... Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock's sonic palette. For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself.\n\nThough Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-bluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts. While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music. Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice, but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic Robert Christgau described it as \"dull and decadent ... dim-witted, amoral exploitation.\"\n\nPunk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, disco, and more mainstream rock. With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and \"lo-fi\", do it yourself ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.\n\nMotörhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music papers such as the \"NME\" and \"Sounds\" took notice, with \"Sounds\" writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\". NWOBHM bands including Iron Maiden, Saxon, and Def Leppard re-energized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements, and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.\n\nBy 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a significant influence on metal's development. In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with the live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\".\n\nThe first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple had broken up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin broke up following drummer John Bonham's death in 1980. Black Sabbath plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition with their opening band, the Los Angeles band Van Halen. Eddie Van Halen established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era. His solo on \"Eruption\", from the band's self-titled 1978 album, is considered a milestone. Eddie Van Halen's sound even crossed over into pop music when his guitar solo was featured on the track \"Beat It\" by Michael Jackson (a U.S. number 1 in February 1983).\n\nInspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s. Based on the clubs of L.A.'s Sunset Strip, bands such as Quiet Riot, Ratt, Mötley Crüe, and W.A.S.P. were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the earlier 1970s. These acts incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of glam metal or \"hair metal\" such as Alice Cooper and Kiss. Glam metal bands were often visually distinguished by long, overworked hair styles accompanied by wardrobes which were sometimes considered cross-gender. The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior, including lyrics which involved sexual expletives and the use of narcotics.\nIn the wake of the new wave of British heavy metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough \"British Steel\" (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981—sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel. Def Leppard's videos for \"Pyromania\" (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the \"Billboard\" chart with \"Metal Health\" (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the \"heavy metal day\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S. Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including \"Kerrang!\" (in 1981) and \"Metal Hammer\" (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, \"Billboard\" declared, \"Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female\".\n\nBy the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, music television, and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.'s Warrant and acts from the East Coast like Poison and Cinderella became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, New Jersey's Bon Jovi became enormously successful with its third album, \"Slippery When Wet\" (1986). The similarly styled Swedish band Europe became international stars with \"The Final Countdown\" (1986). Its title track hit number 1 in 25 countries. In 1987, MTV launched a show, \"Headbanger's Ball\", devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as \"light metal\" or \"hair metal\".\n\nOne band that reached diverse audiences was Guns N' Roses. In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much more raw and dangerous. With the release of their chart-topping \"Appetite for Destruction\" (1987), they \"recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years\". The following year, Jane's Addiction emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with its major label debut, \"Nothing's Shocking\". Reviewing the album, \"Rolling Stone\" declared, \"as much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin\". The group was one of the first to be identified with the \"alternative metal\" trend that would come to the fore in the next decade. Meanwhile, new bands such as New York's Winger and New Jersey's Skid Row sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.\n\nMany subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash. Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.\n\nIn 1990, a review in \"Rolling Stone\" suggested retiring the term \"heavy metal\" as the genre was \"ridiculously vague\". The article stated that the term only fueled \"misperceptions of rock & roll bigots who still assume that five bands as different as Ratt, Extreme, Anthrax, Danzig and Mother Love Bone\" sound the same.\n\nThrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the new wave of British heavy metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal. The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors. Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with shredding leads. Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. Thrash has been described as a form of \"urban blight music\" and \"a palefaced cousin of rap\".\n\nThe subgenre was popularized by the \"Big Four of Thrash\": Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Three German bands, Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction, played a central role in bringing the style to Europe. Others, including San Francisco Bay Area's Testament and Exodus, New Jersey's Overkill, and Brazil's Sepultura and Sarcófago, also had a significant impact. Although thrash began as an underground movement, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands of the scene began to reach a wider audience. Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the \"Billboard\" album chart in 1986 with \"Master of Puppets\", the genre's first platinum record. Two years later, the band's \"... And Justice for All\" hit number 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax also had top 40 records on the American charts.\n\nThough less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: \"Reign in Blood\" (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar timbres, and for including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal's lyricism. Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band. Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their music played a key role in the development of extreme metal.\n\nIn the early 1990s, thrash achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream. Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the \"Billboard\" chart, as the band established international following. Megadeth's \"Countdown to Extinction\" (1992) debuted at number two, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.\n\nThrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. \"Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,\" according to MTV News. The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor. The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of blasphemy and diabolism employed by such acts. Florida's Death, San Francisco Bay Area's Possessed, and Ohio's Necrophagia are recognized as seminal bands in the style. Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name, the latter via its 1984 demo \"Death Metal\" and the song \"Death Metal\", from its 1985 debut album \"Seven Churches\" (1985). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.\n\nDeath metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore, fused with lyrics preoccupied with Z-grade slasher movie violence and Satanism. Death metal vocals are typically bleak, involving guttural \"death growls\", high-pitched screaming, the \"death rasp\", and other uncommon techniques.<ref name=\"Genre—Death Metal/Black Metal\">[ \"Genre—Death Metal/Black Metal\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved on February 27, 2007.</ref> Complementing the deep, aggressive vocal style are downtuned, heavily distorted guitars and extremely fast percussion, often with rapid double bass drumming and \"wall of sound\"–style blast beats. Frequent tempo and time signature changes and syncopation are also typical.\nDeath metal, like thrash metal, generally rejects the theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major exception to this rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.\n\nThe first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by the United Kingdom's Venom, Denmark's Mercyful Fate, Switzerland's Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, and Sweden's Bathory. By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as Mayhem and Burzum were heading a second wave. Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid tremolo picking, a dark atmosphere and intentionally lo-fi production, with ambient noise and background hiss.\n\nSatanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient paganism, promoting a return to supposed pre-Christian values. Numerous black metal bands also \"experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde\". Darkthrone drummer Fenriz explains, \"It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff. There wasn't a generic sound.\"\n\nAlthough bands such as Sarcófago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.\nBy 1992, black metal scenes had begun to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, including Germany, France, and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, the power metal scene came together largely in reaction to the harshness of death and black metal. Though a relatively underground style in North America, it enjoys wide popularity in Europe, Japan, and South America. Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that \"appeal to the listener's sense of valor and loveliness\". The prototype for the sound was established in the mid-to-late 1980s by Germany's Helloween, which combined the power riffs, melodic approach, and high-pitched, \"clean\" singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash's speed and energy, \"crystalliz[ing] the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal\".\n\nTraditional power metal bands like Sweden's HammerFall, England's DragonForce, and America's Iced Earth have a sound clearly indebted to the classic NWOBHM style. Many power metal bands such as America's Kamelot, Finnish groups Nightwish, Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, Italy's Rhapsody of Fire, and Russia's Catharsis feature a keyboard-based \"symphonic\" sound, sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers. Power metal has built a strong fanbase in Japan and South America, where bands like Brazil's Angra and Argentina's Rata Blanca are popular.\n\nClosely related to power metal is progressive metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style emerged in the United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo is among the most recognized of latter-day shredders.\n\nEmerging in the mid-1980s with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a number of its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.\n\nThe 1991 release of \"Forest of Equilibrium\", the debut album by UK band Cathedral, helped spark a new wave of doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal, with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.\n\nIn the United States, sludge metal, mixing doom and hardcore, emerged in the late 1980s—Eyehategod and Crowbar were leaders in a major Louisiana sludge scene. Early in the next decade, California's Kyuss and Sleep, inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of stoner metal, while Seattle's Earth helped develop the drone metal subgenre. The late 1990s saw new bands form such as the Los Angeles–based Goatsnake, with a classic stoner/doom sound, and Sunn O))), which crosses lines between doom, drone, and dark ambient metal—the \"New York Times\" has compared their sound to an \"Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake\".\n\nThe era of heavy metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s with the emergence of Nirvana and other grunge bands, signaling the popular breakthrough of alternative rock. Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their \"flashy and virtuosic solos\" and \"appearance-driven\" MTV orientation.\n\nGlam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge, but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie. In 1991, the band Metallica released their album \"Metallica\", also known as \"The Black Album\", which moved the band's sound out of the thrash metal genre and into standard heavy metal. The album was certified 16× Platinum by the RIAA. A few new, unambiguously metal bands had commercial success during the first half of the decade—Pantera's \"Far Beyond Driven\" topped the \"Billboard\" chart in 1994—but, \"In the dull eyes of the mainstream, metal was dead\". Some bands tried to adapt to the new musical landscape. Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative musical festival Lollapalooza founded by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell. While this prompted a backlash among some long-time fans, Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century.\n\nLike Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term \"alternative metal\". Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as Soundgarden, credited as making a \"place for heavy metal in alternative rock\", and Alice in Chains were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal, and hip hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal, and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails began incorporating metal into their industrial sound, and vice versa, respectively; and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie—also identified with alt-metal—significant, if partial, exceptions). Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented \"the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world.\"\n\nIn the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres. Dubbed \"nu metal\", bands such as Slipknot, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Korn and Disturbed incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip hop, often including DJs and rap-style vocals. The mix demonstrated that \"pancultural metal could pay off\". Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal. In 1999, \"Billboard\" noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the United States, nearly three times as many as ten years before. While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style. By early 2003, the movement's popularity was on the wane, though several nu metal acts such as Korn or Limp Bizkit retained substantial followings.\n\nMetalcore, a hybrid of extreme metal and hardcore punk, emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s decade. Through the 1980s and 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon; pioneering bands include Earth Crisis, other prominent bands include Converge, Hatebreed and Shai Hulud. By 2004, melodic metalcore—influenced as well by melodic death metal—was popular enough that Killswitch Engage's \"The End of Heartache\" and Shadows Fall's \"The War Within\" debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the \"Billboard\" album chart.\nEvolving even further from metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically complicated and progressive style brought to light by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero. Mathcore's main defining quality is the use of odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic comparability to free jazz.\n\nHeavy metal remained popular in the 2000s, particularly in continental Europe. By the new millennium Scandinavia had emerged as one of the areas producing innovative and successful bands, while Belgium, The Netherlands and especially Germany were the most significant markets. Metal music is more favorably embraced in Scandinavia and Northern Europe than other regions due to social and political openness in these regions. Established continental metal bands that placed multiple albums in the top 20 of the German charts between 2003 and 2008, including Finnish band Children of Bodom, Norwegian act Dimmu Borgir, Germany's Blind Guardian and Sweden's HammerFall.\n\nIn the 2000s, an extreme metal fusion genre known as deathcore emerged. Deathcore incorporates elements of death metal, hardcore punk and metalcore. Deathcore features characteristics such as death metal riffs, hardcore punk breakdowns, death growling, \"pig squeal\"-sounding vocals, and screaming. Deathcore bands include Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Despised Icon and Carnifex.\n\nThe term \"retro-metal\" has been used to describe bands such as Texas-based The Sword, California's High on Fire, Sweden's Witchcraft, and Australia's Wolfmother. The Sword's \"Age of Winters\" (2006) drew heavily on the work of Black Sabbath and Pentagram, Witchcraft added elements of folk rock and psychedelic rock, and Wolfmother's self-titled 2005 debut album had \"Deep Purple-ish organs\" and \"Jimmy Page-worthy chordal riffing\". Mastodon, which plays in a progressive/sludge style, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the \"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\".\n\nBy the early 2010s, metalcore was evolving to more frequently incorporate synthesizers and elements from genres beyond rock and metal. The album \"Reckless & Relentless\" by British band Asking Alexandria (which sold 31,000 copies in its first week), and The Devil Wears Prada's 2011 album \"Dead Throne\" (which sold 32,400 in its first week) reached up to number 9 and 10, respectively, on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. In 2013, British band Bring Me the Horizon released their fourth studio album Sempiternal to critical acclaim. The album debuted at number 3 on the UK Album Chart and at number 1 in Australia. The album sold 27,522 copies in the US, and charted at number 11 on the US Billboard Chart, making it their highest charting release in America until their follow-up album \"That's the Spirit\" debuted at no. 2 in 2015.\n\nAlso in the 2010s, a metal style called \"djent\" developed as a spinoff of standard progressive metal. Djent music uses rhythmic and technical complexity, heavily distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs and polyrhythms alongside virtuoso soloing. Another typical characteristic is the use of extended range seven, eight, and nine-string guitars. Djent bands include Periphery, Tesseract and Textures.\n\nThe history of women in heavy metal can be traced back as far as the 1970s when the band Vixen was formed in 1973. Another hard rock band that featured all-female members, The Runaways, would be founded in 1975. And while The Runaways may have been lost to time, two former members would rise to fame in solo careers. Those being Joan Jett and Lita Ford, who would have successful rock careers. In 1978, with the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal, the band Girlschool would be founded, who are best known for their collaboration with Motörhead in 1980 under the pseudonym Headgirl. In 1996, Finnish band Nightwish was founded and has featured women as vocalists. This would lead to more women fronting heavy metal bands such as Halestorm, Within Temptation, Arch Enemy, and Epica among others.\n\nWomen have had an important role behind the scenes, such as Gaby Hoffmann and Sharon Osbourne. In 1981, Hoffmann would help Don Dokken acquire his first record deal. Hoffmann also became the manager of Accept in 1981 and wrote songs under the pseudonym of \"Deaffy\" for many of band's studio albums. In the band's newer albums, vocalist Mark Tornillo stated that Hoffmann still had some influence in songwriting. Osbourne, the wife and manager of Ozzy Osbourne, would found the \"Ozzfest\" music festival and manage several bands, included Motörhead, Coal Chamber, The Smashing Pumpkins, Electric Light Orchestra, Lita Ford and Queen.\n\n\n"}

Spring of Trivia is the name given by Spike TV to the show , a Japanese variety show on Fuji TV.\n\n\"Trivia\" consists of a series of video segments that introduce and confirm the validity of unusual trivia. Past trivia has included exploding erasers, spiders affected by caffeine, and insects that cannot be killed. Most of the trivia on the show is sent in by viewers. A celebrity panel of five judges (ten in special episodes) evaluate each video segment and votes on how interesting it is by pushing a every time they are astonished. ( is the Japanese interjection for expressing genuine surprise, equivalent to a mix of the English interjections \"Really?\" and \"Wow!\".) The total of all \"Hey\"s collected during the presentation of the trivia (maximum of 20 per judge) is then used as the indicator for the degree of surprise of this trivia. For every \"Hey\" a piece of trivia gets, the trivia submitter receives 100 yen. Should it receive a perfect score of 100 Heys (200 in special episodes), the trivia submitter receives 100,000 yen (200,000 in special episodes). To date no piece of trivia has received 100 Heys.\n\nAt some point in the show, there is a segment called . Viewers submit hypothetical questions intended to produce answers in the form of new trivia; \"Trivia\" then \"go[es] to great lengths to answer them.\" Tamori (referred to as \"Chairman Tamori\" in the English dubbed version) evaluates the Seed of Trivia by pulling a lever. The Seed of Trivia's grade is shown as a flower. is the highest of grades. Past examples of \"Seed of Trivia\" segments have included the fastest Japanese baseball mascots, the brand of ramen containing the greatest net noodle length per package, and which form of barbecue lions prefer most.\n\nAs of 2005, there is a new segment called . This is where they take a trivia sent in by a viewer that turned out to be false and sink it in a sort of bog. Additionally, they say, \"If you use this trivia, you might be called,\" and then they always show a cute girl doing some date-like activity and saying, at the end of the segment.\n\nAt the end of the show, host Norito Yashima gives out , a brain shaped trophy that has a melon bread inside that is in the shape of a brain, to the sender of the highest rated trivia. Co-host Katsumi Takahashi gives out – a smaller version of The Golden Brain with the same shape but with no melon bread inside – to the sender of his favorite trivia (announced as \"MFT - My Favorite Trivia\"). In 2005, small color-appropriate banners were added to the awards, and in 2006, the awards began featuring a small analog clock.\n\n\"Trivia\" has been running in Japan since October 7, 2002, first as a low-budget program after midnight (with initially much more obscene and sexual trivia than afterwards). Its increasing cult status (the show obtained viewership ratings just above 5%) made Fuji TV shift the broadcast time to prime time July 2, 2003.\n\nOn November 4, 2004 Fuji TV announced that twenty six episodes of \"Trivia\" would be adapted for broadcast in the United States on the cable network Spike TV. The network began airing the slightly edited English dubbed version of the show on November 11, with the broadcast ending in May 2005. The editing included the removal of certain culturally specific trivia pieces such as those referring to Japanese history and actors. The shorter run time was made up for by adding trivia pieces from other episodes. Unlike Spike TV's other Japanese show \"MXC\", the English dialogue was mostly based on the original Japanese utterances and texts, although it was often exaggerated in a comical manner. Spike had planned to produce an American version of the show premiering in Spring 2005, but that version never materialized and the network decided against ordering more episodes of the English dub.\n\n"}

{"id": "378695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378695", "title": "Independent film", "text": "Independent film\n\nAn independent film, independent movie, indie film or indie movie is a feature film or short film that is produced outside the major film studio system, in addition to being produced and distributed by independent entertainment companies. Independent films are sometimes distinguishable by their content and style and the way in which the filmmakers' personal artistic vision is realized. Usually, but not always, independent films are made with considerably lower budgets than major studio films.\n\nGenerally, the marketing of independent films is characterized by limited release, but can also have major marketing campaigns and a wide release. Independent films are often screened at local, national, or international film festivals before distribution (theatrical or retail release). An independent film production can rival a mainstream film production if it has the necessary funding and distribution.\n\nIn 1908, the Motion Picture Patents Company or \"Edison Trust\" was formed as a trust. The Trust was a cartel that held a monopoly on film production and distribution comprising all the major film companies of the time (Edison, Biograph, Vitagraph, Essanay, Selig, Lubin, Kalem, American Star, American Pathé), the leading distributor (George Kleine) and the biggest supplier of raw film, Eastman Kodak. A number of filmmakers declined to join or were refused into the trust and came to be described as \"independent\".\n\nAt the time of the formation of the MPPC, Thomas Edison owned most of the major patents relating to motion pictures, including that for raw film. The MPPC vigorously enforced its patents, constantly bringing suits and receiving injunctions against independent filmmakers. Because of this, a number of filmmakers responded by building their own cameras and moving their operations to Hollywood, California, where the distance from Edison's home base of New Jersey made it more difficult for the MPPC to enforce its patents.\n\nThe Edison Trust was soon ended by two decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States: one in 1912, which canceled the patent on raw film, and a second in 1915, which cancelled all MPPC patents. Though these decisions succeeded at legalizing independent film, they would do little to remedy the \"de facto\" ban on small productions; the independent filmmakers who had fled to Southern California during the enforcement of the trust had already laid the groundwork for the studio system of classical Hollywood cinema.\n\nIn early 1910, director D.W. Griffith was sent by the Biograph Company to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of performers Blanche Sweet, Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore, and others. They began filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los Angeles. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to Hollywood, a little village that was friendly and positive about the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, \"In Old California\", a Biograph melodrama about California in the 1800s, while it belonged to Mexico. Biograph stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York.\n\nDuring the Edison era of the early 1900s, many Jewish immigrants had found jobs in the U.S. film industry. Under the Edison Trust, they were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of films in storefront theaters called nickelodeons. Within a few years, ambitious men like Samuel Goldwyn, Carl Laemmle, Adolph Zukor, Louis B. Mayer, and the Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. After hearing about Biograph's success in Hollywood, in 1913 many such would-be movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Edison. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the movie studio.\n\nBy establishing a new system of production, distribution, and exhibition which was independent of The Edison Trust in New York, these studios opened up new horizons for cinema in the United States. The Hollywood oligopoly replaced the Edison monopoly. Within this new system, a pecking order was soon established which left little room for any newcomers. By the mid-1930s, at the top were the five major studios, 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Warner Bros. Then came three smaller companies, Columbia Pictures, United Artists, and Universal Studios. Finally there was \"Poverty Row\", a catch all term used to encompass any other smaller studio that managed to fight their way up into the increasingly exclusive movie business.\n\nWhile the small studios that made up Poverty Row could be characterized as existing \"independently\" of any major studio, they utilized the same kind of vertically and horizontally integrated systems of business as the larger players in the game. Though the eventual breakup of the studio system and its restrictive chain-theater distribution network would leave independent movie houses eager for the kind of populist, seat-filling product of the Poverty Row studios, that same paradigm shift would also lead to the decline and ultimate disappearance of \"Poverty Row\" as a Hollywood phenomenon. While the kinds of films produced by Poverty Row studios only grew in popularity, they would eventually become increasingly available both from major production companies and from independent producers who no longer needed to rely on a studio's ability to package and release their work.\n\nThis table lists the companies active in late 1935 illustrates the categories commonly used to characterize the Hollywood system.\n\nThe studio system quickly became so powerful that some filmmakers once again sought independence. On February 5, 1919 four of the leading figures in American silent cinema (Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith) formed United Artists, the first independent studio in America. Each held a 20% stake, with the remaining 20% held by lawyer William Gibbs McAdoo. The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford, and cowboy star William S. Hart a year earlier as they were traveling around the U.S. selling Liberty bonds to help the World War I effort. Already veterans of Hollywood, the four film stars began to talk of forming their own company to better control their own work as well as their futures. They were spurred on by the actions of established Hollywood producers and distributors, who were making moves to tighten their control over their stars' salaries and creative license. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before things had formalized. When he heard about their scheme, Richard A. Rowland, head of Metro Pictures, is said to have observed, \"The inmates are taking over the asylum.\"\n\nThe four partners, with advice from McAdoo (son-in-law and former Treasury Secretary of then-President Woodrow Wilson), formed their distribution company, with Hiram Abrams as its first managing director. The original terms called for Pickford, Fairbanks, Griffith and Chaplin to independently produce five pictures each year, but by the time the company got under way in 1920–1921, feature films were becoming more expensive and more polished, and running times had settled at around ninety minutes (or eight reels). It was believed that no one, no matter how popular, could produce and star in five quality feature films a year. By 1924, Griffith had dropped out and the company was facing a crisis: either bring in others to help support a costly distribution system or concede defeat. The veteran producer Joseph Schenck was hired as president. Not only had he been producing pictures for a decade, but he brought along commitments for films starring his wife, Norma Talmadge, his sister-in-law, Constance Talmadge, and his brother-in-law, Buster Keaton. Contracts were signed with a number of independent producers, especially Samuel Goldwyn, Howard Hughes and later Alexander Korda. Schenck also formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name.\n\nStill, even with a broadening of the company, UA struggled. The coming of sound ended the careers of Pickford and Fairbanks. Chaplin, rich enough to do what he pleased, worked only occasionally. Schenck resigned in 1933 to organize a new company with Darryl F. Zanuck, Twentieth Century Pictures, which soon provided four pictures a year to UA's schedule. He was replaced as president by sales manager Al Lichtman who himself resigned after only a few months. Pickford produced a few films, and at various times Goldwyn, Korda, Walt Disney, Walter Wanger, and David O. Selznick were made \"producing partners\" (i.e., sharing in the profits), but ownership still rested with the founders. As the years passed and the dynamics of the business changed, these \"producing partners\" drifted away. Goldwyn and Disney left for RKO, Wanger for Universal Pictures, and Selznick for retirement. By the late 1940s, United Artists had virtually ceased to exist as either a producer or distributor.\n\nIn 1941, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Walt Disney, Orson Welles, Samuel Goldwyn, David O. Selznick, Alexander Korda, and Walter Wanger—many of the same people who were members of United Artists—founded the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers. Later members included William Cagney, Sol Lesser, and Hal Roach. The Society aimed to preserve the rights of independent producers in an industry overwhelmingly controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end monopolistic practices by the five major Hollywood studios which controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of films. In 1942, the SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount's United Detroit Theatres. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-run and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. It was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors alleging monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the United States Supreme Court Paramount Decision ordered the Hollywood movie studios to sell their theater chains and to eliminate certain anti-competitive practices. This effectively brought an end to the studio system of Hollywood's Golden Age. By 1958, many of the reasons for creating the SIMPP had been corrected and SIMPP closed its offices.\n\nThe efforts of the SIMPP and the advent of inexpensive portable cameras during World War II effectively made it possible for any person in America with an interest in making films to write, produce, and direct one without the aid of any major film studio. These circumstances soon resulted in a number of critically acclaimed and highly influential works, including Maya Deren's \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" in 1943, Kenneth Anger's \"Fireworks\" in 1947, and Morris Engel, Ruth Orkin and Ray Abrashkin's \"Little Fugitive\" in 1953. Filmmakers such as Ken Jacobs with little or no formal training began to experiment with new ways of making and shooting films.\n\n\"Little Fugitive\" became the first independent film to be nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the American Academy Awards. It also received Silver Lion at Venice. Both Engel and Anger's films won acclaim overseas from the burgeoning French New Wave, with \"Fireworks\" inspiring praise and an invitation to study under him in Europe from Jean Cocteau, and François Truffaut citing \"Little Fugitive\" as an essential inspiration to his seminal work, \"The 400 Blows\". As the 1950s progressed, the new low-budget paradigm of filmmaking gained increased recognition internationally, with films such as Satyajit Ray's critically acclaimed \"Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959).\n\nUnlike the films made within the studio system, these new low-budget films could afford to take risks and explore new artistic territory outside the classical Hollywood narrative. Maya Deren was soon joined in New York by a crowd of like minded avant-garde filmmakers who were interested in creating films as works of art rather than entertainment. Based upon a common belief that the \"official cinema\" was \"running out of breath\" and had become \"morally corrupt, aesthetically obsolete, thematically superficial, [and] temperamentally boring\", this new crop of independents formed The Film-Makers' Cooperative, an artist-run, non-profit organization which they would use to distribute their films through a centralized archive. Founded in 1962 by Jonas Mekas, Stan Brakhage, Shirley Clarke, Gregory Markopoulos, and others, the Cooperative provided an important outlet for many of cinema's creative luminaries in the 1960s, including Jack Smith and Andy Warhol. When he returned to America, Ken Anger would debut many of his most important works there. Mekas and Brakhage would go on to found the Anthology Film Archives in 1970, which would likewise prove essential to the development and preservation of independent films, even to this day.\n\nNot all low-budget films existed as non-commercial art ventures. The success of films like \"Little Fugitive\", which had been made with low (or sometimes non-existent) budgets encouraged a huge boom in popularity for non-studio films. Low-budget film making promised exponentially greater returns (in terms of percentages) if the film could have a successful run in the theaters. During this time, independent producer/director Roger Corman began a sweeping body of work that would become legendary for its frugality and grueling shooting schedule. Until his so-called \"retirement\" as a director in 1971 (he continued to produce films even after this date) he would produce up to seven movies a year, matching and often exceeding the five-per-year schedule that the executives at United Artists had once thought impossible.\n\nLike those of the avante-garde, the films of Roger Corman took advantage of the fact that unlike the studio system, independent films had never been bound by its self-imposed production code. Corman's example (and that of others like him) would help start a boom in independent B-movies in the 1960s, the principal aim of which was to bring in the youth market which the major studios had lost touch with. By promising sex, wanton violence, drug use, and nudity, these films hoped to draw audiences to independent theaters by offering to show them what the major studios could not. Horror and science fiction films experienced a period of tremendous growth during this time. As these tiny producers, theaters, and distributors continued to attempt to undercut one another, the B-grade shlock film soon fell to the level of the Z movie, a niche category of films with production values so low that they became a spectacle in their own right. The cult audiences these pictures attracted soon made them ideal candidates for midnight movie screenings revolving around audience participation and cosplay.\n\nIn 1968, a young filmmaker named George A. Romero shocked audiences with \"Night of the Living Dead\", a new kind of intense and unforgiving independent horror film. This film was released just after the abandonment of the production code, but before the adoption of the MPAA rating system. As such, it was the first and last film of its kind to enjoy a completely unrestricted screening, in which young children were able to witness Romero's new brand of highly realistic gore. This film would help to set the climate of independent horror for decades to come, as films like \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" (1974) and \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (1980) continued to push the envelope.\n\nWith the production code abandoned and violent and disturbing films like Romero's gaining popularity, Hollywood opted to placate the uneasy filmgoing public with the MPAA ratings system, which would place restrictions on ticket sales to young people. Unlike the production code, this rating system posed a threat to independent films in that it would affect the number of tickets they could sell and cut into the grindhouse cinema's share of the youth market. This change would further widen the divide between commercial and non-commercial films.\n\nHowever, having a film audience-classified is strictly voluntary for independents and there's no legal impediment to releasing movies on an unrated basis. However, unrated movies face obstacles in marketing because media outlets such as TV channels, newspapers and websites often place their own restrictions on movies that don't come with a built-in national rating in order to avoid presenting movies to inappropriately young audiences.\n\nFollowing the advent of television and the Paramount Case, the major studios attempted to lure audiences with spectacle. Widescreen processes and technical improvements, such as Cinemascope, stereo sound, 3-D and others, were developed in an attempt to retain the dwindling audience by giving them a larger-than-life experience. The 1950s and early 1960s saw a Hollywood dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films which benefited from these advances. This proved commercially viable during most of the 1950s. However, by the late 1960s, audience share was dwindling at an alarming rate. Several costly flops, including \"Cleopatra\" (1963) and \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1969) put severe strain on the studios. Meanwhile, in 1951, lawyers-turned-producers Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin had made a deal with the remaining stockholders of United Artists which would allow them to make an attempt to revive the company and, if the attempt was successful, buy it after five years.\n\nThe attempt was a success, and in 1955 United Artists became the first \"studio\" without an actual studio. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio, but did not own a studio lot as such. Because of this, many of their films would be shot on location. Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance or the expensive production staff which ran up costs at other studios. UA went public in 1956, and as the other mainstream studios fell into decline, UA prospered, adding relationships with the Mirisch brothers, Billy Wilder, Joseph E. Levine and others.\n\nBy the late 1950s, RKO had ceased film production, and the remaining four of big five had recognized that they did not know how to reach the youth audience. In an attempt to capture this audience, the Studios hired a host of young filmmakers (many of whom were mentored by Roger Corman) and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. Warner Brothers offered first-time producer Warren Beatty 40% of the gross on his film \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967) instead of a minimal fee. The movie had grossed over $70 million worldwide by 1973. This initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to the film school generation and began what the media dubbed \"New Hollywood.\"\n\nDennis Hopper, the American actor, made his writing and directing debut with \"Easy Rider\" (1969). Along with his producer/co-star/co-writer Peter Fonda, Hopper was responsible for one of the first completely independent film of New Hollywood. \"Easy Rider\" debuted at Cannes and garnered the \"First Film Award\" () after which it received two Oscar nominations, one for best original screenplay and one for Corman-alum Jack Nicholson's breakthrough performance in the supporting role of George Hanson, an alcoholic lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. Following on the heels of \"Easy Rider\" shortly afterwards was the revived United Artists' \"Midnight Cowboy\" (also 1969), which, like \"Easy Rider\", took numerous cues from Ken Anger and his influences in the French New Wave. It became the first and only X rated film to win the Academy Award for best picture. \"Midnight Cowboy\" also held the distinction of featuring cameo roles by many of the top Warhol superstars, who had already become symbols of the militantly anti-Hollywood climate of NYC's independent film community.\n\nWithin a month, another young Corman trainee, Francis Ford Coppola, made his debut in Spain at the Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival with \"The Rain People\" (1969), a film he had produced through his own company, American Zoetrope. Though \"The Rain People\" was largely overlooked by American audiences, Zoetrope would become a powerful force in New Hollywood. Through Zoetrope, Coppola formed a distribution agreement with studio giant Warner Bros., which he would exploit to achieve wide releases for his films without making himself subject to their control. These three films provided the major Hollywood studios with both an example to follow and a new crop of talent to draw from. Zoetrope co-founder George Lucas made his feature film debut with \"THX 1138\" (1971), also released by Zoetrope through their deal with Warner Bros., announcing himself as another major talent of New Hollywood. By the following year, two New Hollywood directors had become sufficiently established for Coppola to be offered oversight of Paramount's \"The Godfather\" (1972) and Lucas had obtained studio funding for \"American Graffiti\" (1973) from Universal. In the mid-1970s, the major Hollywood studios continued to tap these new filmmakers for both ideas and personnel, producing films such as \"Paper Moon\" (1973) and \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), all of which met with critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of New Hollywood led each of them in turn to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.\n\nWhile most members of the New Hollywood generation were, or started out as, independent filmmakers, a number of their projects were produced and released by major studios. The New Hollywood generation soon became firmly entrenched in a revived incarnation of the studio system, which financed the development, production and distribution of their films. Very few of these filmmakers ever independently financed or independently released a film of their own, or ever worked on an independently financed production during the height of the generation's influence. Seemingly independent films such as \"Taxi Driver\", \"The Last Picture Show\" and others were studio films: the scripts were based on studio pitches and subsequently paid for by the studios, the production financing was from the studio, and the marketing and distribution of the films were designed and controlled by the studio's advertising agency. Though Coppola made considerable efforts to resist the influence of the studios, opting to finance his risky 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\" himself rather than compromise with skeptical studio executives, he, and filmmakers like him, had saved the old studios from financial ruin by providing them with a new formula for success.\n\nIndeed, it was during this period that the very definition of an independent film became blurred. Though \"Midnight Cowboy\" was financed by United Artists, the company was certainly a studio. Likewise, Zoetrope was another \"independent studio\" which worked within the system to make a space for independent directors who needed funding. George Lucas would leave Zoetrope in 1971 to create his own independent studio, Lucasfilm, which would produce the blockbuster \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" franchises. In fact, the only two movies of the movement which can be described as uncompromisingly independent are \"Easy Rider\" at the beginning, and Peter Bogdanovich's \"They All Laughed\", at the end. Peter Bogdanovich bought back the rights from the studio to his 1980 film and paid for its distribution out of his own pocket, convinced that the picture was better than what the studio believed — he eventually went bankrupt because of this.\n\nIn retrospect, it can be seen that Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" (1975) and George Lucas's \"Star Wars\" (1977) marked the beginning of the end for the New Hollywood. With their unprecedented box-office successes, these movies jump-started Hollywood's blockbuster mentality, giving studios a new paradigm as to how to make money in this changing commercial landscape. The focus on high-concept premises, with greater concentration on tie-in merchandise (such as toys), spin-offs into other media (such as soundtracks), and the use of sequels (which had been made more respectable by Coppola's \"The Godfather Part II\"), all showed the studios how to make money in the new environment.\n\nOn realizing how much money could potentially be made in films, major corporations started buying up the remaining Hollywood studios, saving them from the oblivion which befell RKO in the 50s. Eventually, even RKO was revived. The corporate mentality these companies brought to the filmmaking business would slowly squeeze out the more idiosyncratic of these young filmmakers, while ensconcing the more malleable and commercially successful of them. Like the original independents who fled the Edison Trust to form old Hollywood, the young film school graduates who had fled the studios to explore on-location shooting and dynamic, neo-realist styles and structures ended up replacing the tyrants they had sought to dislodge with a more stable and all-pervasive base of power.\n\nDuring the 1970s, shifts in thematic depictions of sexuality and violence occurred in American cinema, prominently featuring heightened depictions of realistic sex and violence. Directors who wished to reach mainstream audiences of Old Hollywood quickly learned to stylize these themes to make their films appealing and attractive rather than repulsive or obscene. However, at the same time that the maverick film students of the American New Wave were developing the skills they would use to take over Hollywood, many of their peers had begun to develop their style of filmmaking in a different direction. Influenced by foreign and art house directors such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini,exploitation shockers (i.e. Joseph P. Mawra, Michael Findlay, and Henri Pachard) and avant-garde cinema, (Kenneth Anger, Maya Deren) a number of young film makers began to experiment with transgression not as a box-office draw, but as an artistic act. Directors such as John Waters and David Lynch would make a name for themselves by the early 1970s for the bizarre and often disturbing imagery which characterized their films.\n\nWhen Lynch's first feature film, \"Eraserhead\" (1977), brought Lynch to the attention of producer Mel Brooks, he soon found himself in charge of the $5 million film \"The Elephant Man\" (1980) for Paramount. Though \"Eraserhead\" was strictly an out-of-pocket, low-budget, independent film, Lynch made the transition with unprecedented grace. The film was a huge commercial success, and earned eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay nods for Lynch. It also established his place as a commercially viable, if somewhat dark and unconventional, Hollywood director. Seeing Lynch as a fellow studio convert, George Lucas, a fan of \"Eraserhead\" and now the darling of the studios, offered Lynch the opportunity to direct his next \"Star Wars\" sequel, \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983). However, Lynch had seen what had happened to Lucas and his comrades in arms after their failed attempt to do away with the studio system. He refused the opportunity, stating that he would rather work on his own projects.\n\nLynch instead chose to direct a big budget adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel \"Dune\" for Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis's De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, on the condition that the company release a second Lynch project, over which the director would have complete creative control. Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be the next \"Star Wars\", Lynch's \"Dune\" (1984) was a critical and commercial flop, grossing a mere $27.4 million domestically against a $45 million budget. De Laurentiis, furious that the film had been a commercial disaster, was then forced to produce any film Lynch desired. He offered Lynch only $6 million in order to minimize the risk if the film had failed to recoup its costs; however, the film, \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) was a resounding success. Lynch subsequently returned to independent filmmaking, and did not work with another major studio for over a decade.\n\nUnlike the former, John Waters released most of his films during his early life through his own production company, Dreamland Productions. In the early 1980s, New Line Cinema agreed to work with him on \"Polyester\" (1981). During the 1980s, Waters would become a pillar of the New York–based independent film movement known as the \"Cinema of Transgression\", a term coined by Nick Zedd in 1985 to describe a loose-knit group of like-minded New York artists using shock value and humor in their Super 8 mm films and video art. Other key players in this movement included Kembra Pfahler, Casandra Stark, Beth B, Tommy Turner, Richard Kern and Lydia Lunch. Rallying around such institutions as the Film-Makers' Cooperative and Anthology Film Archives, this new generation of independents devoted themselves to the defiance of the now-establishment New Hollywood, proposing that \"all film schools be blown up and all boring films never be made again.\"\n\nThe development of no-budget film production company ASS Studios in 2011 brought guerrilla style tactics to their filmmaking. Founded by Courtney Fathom Sell & Reverend Jen Miller, the now-defunct studio would utilize local performers and locations from the Lower East Side of New York City to create various short films which would then be screened in venues such as bars and Anthology Film Archives. Though mainly recognized for their short films, the studios' first and only feature Satan, Hold My Hand was made on a budget of just $27.00 while featuring an A-list Hollywood cast including Janeane Garofalo and was Produced by Jonathan Ames, writer and creator of the HBO series Bored to Death.\n\nIn 1978, Sterling Van Wagenen and Charles Gary Allison, with Chairperson Robert Redford, (veteran of New Hollywood and star of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\") founded the Utah/US Film Festival in an effort to attract more filmmakers to Utah and showcase what the potential of independent film could be. At the time, the main focus of the event was to present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions; however it also included a small program of new independent films. The jury of the 1978 festival was headed by Gary Allison, and included Verna Fields, Linwood Gale Dunn, Katherine Ross, Charles E. Sellier Jr., Mark Rydell, and Anthea Sylbert. In 1981, the same year that United Artists, bought out by MGM, ceased to exist as a venue for independent filmmakers, Sterling Van Wagenen left the film festival to help found the Sundance Institute with Robert Redford. In 1985, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival, which was experiencing financial difficulties. Gary Beer and Sterling Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural Sundance Film Festival which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby.\n\nIn 1991, the festival was officially renamed the \"Sundance Film Festival\", after Redford's famous role as The Sundance Kid. Through this festival the Independent Cinema movement was launched. Such notable figures as Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, David O. Russell, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, James Wan, Hal Hartley and Jim Jarmusch garnered resounding critical acclaim and unprecedented box office sales In 2005, about 15% of the U.S. domestic box office revenue was from independent studios.\n\nThe 1990s saw the rise and success of independent films not only through the film festival circuit but at the box office as well while established actors, such as Bruce Willis, John Travolta, and Tim Robbins, found success themselves both in independent films and Hollywood studio films. \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" in 1990 from New Line Cinema grossed over $100 million in the United States making it the most successful indie film in box-office history to that point. Miramax Films had a string of hits with \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\", \"My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown\", and \"Clerks\", putting Miramax and New Line Cinema in the sights of big companies looking to cash in on the success of independent studios. In 1993, Disney bought Miramax for $60 million. Turner Broadcasting, in a billion-dollar deal, acquired New Line Cinema, Fine Line Features, and Castle Rock Entertainment in 1994. The acquisitions proved to be a good move for Turner Broadcasting as New Line released \"The Mask\" and \"Dumb & Dumber\", Castle Rock released \"The Shawshank Redemption\", and Miramax released \"Pulp Fiction\", all in 1994.\n\nThe acquisitions of the smaller studios by conglomerate Hollywood was a plan in part to take over the independent film industry and at the same time start independent studios of their own. The following are all indie studios owned by conglomerate Hollywood:\n\nBy the early 2000s, Hollywood was producing three different classes of films: 1) big-budget blockbusters, 2) art films, specialty films and niche-market films produced by the conglomerate-owned indies and 3) genre and specialty films coming from true indie studios and producers. The third category comprised over half the features released in the United States and usually cost between $5 and $10 million to produce.\n\nHollywood was producing three different classes of feature films by means of three different types of producers. The superior products were the large, budget blockbusters and high-cost star vehicles marketed by the six major studio producer-distributors. Budgets on the major studios' pictures averaged $100 million, with approximately one-third of it spent on marketing because of the large release campaigns. Another class of Hollywood feature film included art films, specialty films, and other niche-market fare controlled by the conglomerates' indie subsidiaries. Budgets on these indie films averaged $40 million per release in the early 2000s, with $10 million to $15 million spent on marketing (MPA, 2006:12). The final class of film consisted of genre and specialty films administered by independent producer-distributors with only a few dozen or possibly a few hundred-release campaigns screens in select urban markets. Films like these usually cost less than $10 million, but frequently less than $5 million, with small marketing budgets that escalate if and when a particular film performs.\n\nThe Independent film industry exists globally. Many of the most prestigious film festivals are hosted in various cities around the world. The Berlin International Film Festival attracts over 130 countries, making it the largest film festival in the world. Other large events include the Toronto International Film Festival, Hong Kong International Film Festival, and the Panafrican Film and TV Festival of Ouagadougou.\n\nThe European Union, specifically through the European Cinema and VOD Initiative (ECVI), has established programs that attempt to adapt the film industry to an increasing digital demand for film on video on demand services, outside of theatrical screenings. With this program, VOD offerings are paired with traditional movie screenings. There is also more of a push from EU National governments to fund all aspects of the arts, including film. The European Commission for Culture has an Audiovisual sector, for example, whose role is most notably to help distribute and promote films and festivals across Europe. Additionally, the Commission organizes policymaking, research, and reporting on \"media literacy\" and \"digital distribution.\"\n\nIn an effort to join the growing independent film industry, the six major studios have established numerous subsidiary branches, designed to develop less commercial films that appeal to the growing art film/art house market. These include United Artists, New Line Cinema, HBO Films, Castle Rock Entertainment, Turner Entertainment, Warner Bros. Animation, TriStar Pictures, Disneynature, DreamWorks, Sony Pictures Classics, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Miramax Films, Warner Independent Pictures, Picturehouse, Paramount Classics/Paramount Vantage, Focus Features, Hollywood Pictures, Lucasfilm Ltd., Rogue Pictures, Five & Two Pictures, and Sherwood Pictures, among others.\n\nAn increasing access to widespread technologies has led to more people being able to make movies of their own, including young people and individuals from marginalized communities. These people may have little to no technical or academic training, but instead are self-titled \"filmmakers.\" Aspiring filmmakers can range from those simply with access to a smartphone or digital camera, to those who write \"spec\" scripts (to pitch to studios), actively network, and use crowdsourcing and other financing to get their films professionally produced. Oftentimes, aspiring filmmakers have other day-jobs to support themselves financially while they pitch their scripts and ideas to independent film production companies, talent agents, and wealthy investors. New York City is a major resource for people pursuing filmmaking as a career. There are universities like NYU, which is considered to have one of the best film programs in the country, second only to USC in Los Angeles.\n\nAdditionally, according to the Motion Picture Association of America, many movie and television shoots have been moving to New York City; in 2016, the city was the shooting location of 128 films, including \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\", \"The Dark Tower\", and \"The Fate of the Furious\". The economic side of filmmaking is also less of an obstacle than before, because the backing of a major studio is no longer needed to access necessary movie-funding. Crowdfunding services like Kickstarter, Pozible, and Tubestart have helped people raise thousands of dollars; enough to fund their own, low-budget productions. As a result of the falling cost of technology to make, edit and digitally distribute films, filmmaking is more widely accessible than ever before.\n\nFull-length films are often showcased at film festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival, Slamdance Film Festival, South By Southwest (SXSW) film festival, Raindance Film Festival, Telluride Film Festival, and Palm Springs Film Festival. Award winners from these exhibitions are more likely to get picked up for distribution by major film studios. Film festivals and screenings like these are just one of the options in which movies can be independently produced/released.\n\nModern independent studios (they are used to produce/release independent films and foreign-language films in America) include:\nThere are thousands of smaller production companies that produce authentic independent films yearly, in addition to these higher profile \"independent\" studios. These smaller companies look either to release their films regionally in theaters or for additional financing and resources to distribute their projects on a national scale. The direct-to-video market is not often noted as a strong outlet, nor as artistically fertile ground, but among its many entries are ambitious independent films that either failed to achieve theatrical distribution or did not seek it. As technology advances and distribution of films continues to shift more towards digital methods, the line between \"film,\" direct-to-disc productions, and feature-length videos whose main distribution channel is wholly electronic, will continue to converge.\n\nThe independent film scene's development in the 1990s and 2000s has been stimulated by a range of factors, including the development of affordable digital cinematography cameras that can rival 35 mm film quality and easy-to-use computer editing software. Until digital alternatives became available, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was a major obstacle to independent filmmakers who wanted to make their own films. In 2002, the cost of 35 mm film stock went up 23%, according to \"Variety\". With the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of digital video in the early 1990s lowered the technology barrier to movie production. The personal computer and non-linear editing system have dramatically reduced costs of post-production, while technologies such as DVD, Blu-ray Disc and online video services have simplified distribution; indeed, video streaming services have made it possible to distribute a digital version of a film to an entire country or even the world, without involving shipping or warehousing of physical DVDs or film reels. Even 3-D technology is available to low-budget, independent filmmakers now.\n\nOne of the examples of such a new indie approach to filmmaking is a documentary film \"Genghis Blues\" that has been shot by the Belic brothers on two Hi8 consumer camcorders and won the 1999 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for a Documentary. The movie had to be \"filmed out\" from interlaced digital video format to film running at traditional 24-frame per second rate, so interlacing artefacts are noticeable at times. In 2004 Panasonic released the DVX100 camcorder, which featured film-like 24-frame per second shooting rate. This gave independent filmmakers the ability to shoot video at frame rate considered standard for movies and opened the possibility of clean digital frame to film frame conversion. Several acclaimed films were made with this camera, for example Iraq in Fragments.\n\nWith new technology, such as the Arri Alexa, RED Epic, and the many new DSLRs, independent films can create footage that looks like 35mm film without the same high cost. These cameras also perform better than traditional film in low light situations. In 2008 Canon released the first DSLR camera that could shoot full HD video, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II. With the sensor larger than on a traditional camcorder, these DSLRs allow for a greater control over depth of field, great low light capabilities, and a large variety of exchangeable lenses, including lenses from old film cameras — things which independent filmmakers have been longing years.\n\nIn addition to new digital cameras, independent film makers are benefitting from the new editing software. Instead of needing a post-house to do the editing, independent film makers can now use a personal computer and cheap editing software to edit their films. Editing software available include Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, (Color Grading Software) DaVinci Resolve, and many more. There are also many free tutorials and courses available online to teach different post production skills needed to use these programs. These new technologies allow independent film makers to create films that are comparable to high-budget films.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, long an advocate of new technologies like non-linear editing and digital cameras, said in 2007 that \"cinema is escaping being controlled by the financier, and that's a wonderful thing. You don't have to go hat-in-hand to some film distributor and say, 'Please will you let me make a movie?'\"\n\nIn the 2010s, with both the increased production and waning interest of major studio sequels, more and more independent films have been at the forefront of major award wins. The upset Best Picture Oscar wins for \"Spotlight\" at the 2016 awards, and \"Moonlight\" at the 2017 awards had, and continues to have, a major impact on box office intake on major studio films in the present era, proving that the ever-growing success of independent films is not dependent on any particular format (Cinemascope-, 3-D, or large format-shot films).\n\n\n"}

It was created by Decree 3267 of 20 December 1963, which declared that from 1 April 1964 the country's public radio and television broadcasting service would be provided by Inravisión, \"a public company with financial, administrative, and legal autonomy\".\n\nAmong Inravisión's functions were to organize contracts with the \"programadoras\", the companies who produced programs and aired them on the national networks; develop and execute the plans and projects adopted by the Colombian Ministry of Communications; and offer official educational, cultural and informational services through the country's radio and television infrastructure. In 1993, it also assumed the duties of screening programs, which \"programadoras\" were required to send 72 hours in advance, for purposes of determining if the programs were suitable for viewing by minors.\n\nIn the 1990s, Inravisión was wracked by continual technical problems, which included a 30-minute nationwide outage of all three channels in June 1995, described at the time as \"the biggest rough patch in Inravisión's 41-year history\"; commercials that didn't air in correct color; signal reception deficiencies, even in major cities such as Cali; poorly calibrated cameras; leaks in the studio buildings; commercials airing for the incorrect newscast; and a 77-minute outage of all three channels in December 1995.\n\nInravisión was liquidated at the end of 2004, during the first administration (2002–2006) of President Álvaro Uribe Vélez. Contributing factors to the decision included the company's growing pension liabilities (600 billion Colombian pesos), its out-of-date technology, and the \"programadoras\" crisis, which left Canal Uno in a failed financial state and forced the state to operate Canal A as Canal Institucional. At its closure, Inravisión had 411 employees. Audiovisuales, the state \"programadora\", was also liquidated.\n\nIt was succeeded by Radio Televisión Nacional de Colombia (RTVC).\n\n\n"}

Aldrich Libbey\n\nJames Aldrich Libbey (29 February 1864 – 29 April 1925), known as J. Aldrich Libbey, was an American vaudeville performer, actor, singer and songwriter, best known for launching the song \"After the Ball\".\n\nLibbey was born and grew up in East Somerville, Massachusetts. He was noted as a boy soprano, and in 1884 had his first professional engagement at the Bijou Theatre in Boston. In 1885 he traveled to Europe, and studied in Paris — where he studied for a prize at the Conservatoire — and London, before returning to the US. He appeared in grand and comic opera, oratorios, cantatas and concerts, and was contracted to the Boston Symphony Orchestra as a soloist. He then worked for the Little Tycoon and Conreid opera companies, and with the Hallen & Hart company.\n\nBy about 1888 he was a well-known vaudeville performer, based in New York City, and known for his ability to popularize new songs. He was described as a high baritone. He married vaudeville singer Katherine Trayer around 1889; they toured together as a duo, including a visit to Australia in 1896.\n\nIn 1892 songwriter Charles K. Harris offered Libbey $500, and a share of the royalties, if he would perform Harris' song \"After the Ball\" in Libbey's show, \"A Trip to Chinatown\", which was one of the most popular touring shows of the decade. Libbey agreed, and, as he performed the song around the US, demands for the song's sheet music grew. It is estimated that, eventually, over 5 million copies of the music were sold. The immense success of the song, as performed by Libbey, is widely credited with stimulating the birth of \"Tin Pan Alley\", where commercial songwriters began to compete with each other to \"plug\" new songs in order to attract the most sales among the public. Libbey himself is described as \"one of the first... professional popularizers... who frankly abandoned an artistic career for the greater profits of the Alley.\"\n\nLibbey reputedly introduced more songs and hits than any other performer of his day, looking for what he saw as human interest stories in their words. By 1895 he set up his own publishing company in New York. His recordings included \"The Song The Soldiers Sang\" (1902), \"On a Sunday Afternoon\" (1902), and \"In the Sweet Bye and Bye\" (1903). He continued to perform in light opera, comedy and vaudeville, appearing in 1907 with Katherine Trayer in \"Playing the Ponies\". As a writer, Libbey's songs included \"You'll Want Someone To Love You When You're Old\" and \"In the Apple Blossom Time\".\nIn 1911 Libbey wrote a magazine article in \"The Player\" in support of the \"White Rats\", a labor union organization of vaudeville performers. He wrote that art was the result of labor, rather than the divine gift of genius, and that proficiently executed labor was \"art\". He became an active member of the National Vaudeville Artists.\n\nHe appeared in the minor role of Mr. Ryer in Erich von Stroheim's film classic, \"Greed\", filmed in 1923 and released the following year.\n\nHe died from heart failure in San Francisco, California, in 1925 at the age of 61.\n\n"}
{"id": "3502408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3502408", "title": "Johann Kraus", "text": "Johann Kraus\n\nJohann Kraus is a fictional character in the comic book series \"Hellboy\", created by Mike Mignola. He is featured in the comic book \"B.P.R.D.\", published by Dark Horse Comics. Kraus is a disembodied ectoplasmic spirit with psychic abilities, who inhabits a containment suit, without which his form would eventually dissipate and be lost forever. \n\nA live action version of Kraus, named Johann \"Krauss\", appears in the 2008 sequel \"\", with his voice provided by Seth MacFarlane.\n\nBorn in Stuttgart, West Germany, in 1946, Johann Kraus became aware of his psychic abilities when he was ten years old. Frustrated with his inability to help the spirits that appeared to him, he sought out spiritualists in attempts to better understand his powers. Disappointed with occultism, Kraus turned to the church, which allowed him to focus on the spirits themselves rather than the occultist's focus on study and academia. In 1971, he opened an office in Munich, where he became a well-respected medium before relocating to Heidelberg.\n\nIn early 2002, Kraus was the only survivor of a seance affected by a mystical disaster. His ectoplasmic form survived when his body was incinerated, and knowing he would dissipate without a physical body, he sought out the best paranormal minds on the planet for help: the B.P.R.D. At first, he was sustained inside a transparent tank apparatus developed by the B.P.R.D. for other purposes; eventually the technology was sized down into his distinctive containment suit. Kate Corrigan has said of him that, \"He's not dead. He just doesn't have a body anymore.\"\n\nAfter the loss of Hellboy, Kraus was hired to replenish the Bureau's pool of \"enhanced talents\". Kraus soon proved an invaluable member of the team. His psychic abilities are better than ever due to his condition (similar to a musician who has lost his eyesight). Where once he could speak with the dead, now he can give them temporary physical form. Johann is also an accomplished scholar in occult lore and, since he no longer requires sleep, works constantly. It was largely he who researched and organized the mountains of files culled from the sub-basement of the Bureau's new base in the Colorado mountains, resulting in the revelation that Ben Daimio's grandmother had been a Nazi occult war criminal. There was tension between the two for some time after this. Their sometimes difficult relationship was perhaps not helped by the death of Roger the homunculus, who Johann had been closer to than perhaps anyone else, owing at least partly to Daimio's actions.\n\nWhen the Bureau came into possession of two giant vat-grown bodies awaiting a soul in the aftermath of the \"Garden of Souls\" storyline, Johann took possession of one of these. Overcome by giddy euphoria at finally having regained life, at being able to taste and touch once more, Johann let himself be seduced by the pleasures of the flesh. He all but abandoned his work and commitments to the Bureau to indulge his vices. This proved to be the worst possible time for such a lapse, as the halls of the Bureau came under attack by two separate monsters, one of them the were-jaguar form of Captain Ben Daimio. Johann returned in the nick of time, saving the lives of Kate and Abe, but was himself savagely killed.\n\nCondemned to his ectoplasmic half-life once more, Johann began pursuing a private obsession with Ben Daimio, trying to track down his living relatives and hiding the ceremonial dagger that is supposedly the only weapon that can destroy him in his were-jaguar form. In 2009, Johann returned to his beloved Munich for the first time since his 2002 accident during \"The Warning\", only to see it destroyed and its inhabitants killed by a subterranean robot army, a blow from which he has found it hard to recover.\n\nJohann has developed a brotherly relationship with zombie Iosif Nichayko, the director of Russia's \"Special Sciences Service\" who also lives confined to a containment suit. After a successful mission, Iosif gifted Johann an altered form of his own more advanced containment suit to Johann's delight. By Johann's own admission, his new suit has changed his life as it feels like a body - so much so that he once even fell asleep and dreamed for the first time since his \"accident\".\n\nJohann dies when he sacrifices himself to destroy the Ogdru Jahad that landed on Earth.\n\nKraus possesses the ability to both communicate with spirits and grant them temporary physical forms to allow them to talk with non-mediums.\n\nKraus has limited body possession powers, which enable him to take possession of any form lacking a soul. He has temporarily inhabited the corpses of humans, a dog, and a moose, using them as last-minute containers for his vulnerable form.\n\nIt was once believed that Johann was vulnerable to psychic attack and his ectoplasm could be taken over by stronger spirits, but it was discovered that he is immune to possession and can take dominance over malevolent spirits - even an Ogdru Hem.\n\nThe only protection Johann has from dissipation is his B.P.R.D.-built containment suit; once the suit is breached, he must find a new container for his essence or he will cease to exist.\n\nJohann Kraus appeared in the 2008 film \"\". In the film his name is spelled \"Johann Krauss\". His character's movements were supplied by British actors John Alexander and James Dodd, and his voice was performed by Seth MacFarlane. Thomas Kretschmann was previously cast for the voice, but was replaced.\n\nKrauss is head of the B.P.R.D.'s Ectoplasmic Research division in Washington, D.C., and is sent to the Bureau's headquarters to take command of the team, after Hellboy embarrasses the Bureau and the government by revealing himself to the public.\n\nThe cause of his condition is not explained, but he hints that it was connected with the loss of the woman he loved - a fiancée or a wife, whose ring he still carries around with him. He said that his containment suit was designed by the B.P.R.D.'s former head, Trevor Bruttenholm. According to the film commentary, Guillermo del Toro stated that, in the planned story for the third \"Hellboy\" film, Krauss would also have some history with the character of Nazi scientist Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.\n\nKrauss immediately strikes Abe Sapien and Tom Manning as knowledgeable and efficient, while Hellboy dislikes him, possibly because he feels overshadowed, and possibly because, as Hellboy himself says, Johann's name \"\"sounds German... I don't like Germans\".\n\nKrauss is punctilious, strait-laced, and scrupulously \"by-the-book\"\". In the commentary, Guillermo del Toro said that he used the character to express his idea of the perfect bureaucrat: lacking a face, body, or any individual identity. This is a departure from the comics version, where Krauss is portrayed as quite compassionate and feeling, often playing an avuncular role towards the rest of the team.\n\nBoth the comic and film version of Johann can leave their containment suit at will, though it is uncertain how long he can do so without dissipating; once freed from his suit, his ectoplasmic form can physically manipulate objects (as demonstrated when he gives Hellboy a sound thrashing in the B.P.R.D. locker room with a set of locker doors), or can be used for teleplasty (from the Greek τηλε \"far\" + πλαστειν \"to mold or form\"; the word ectoplasm derives from the same root), enabling him to temporarily reanimate dead creatures and possess mechanical objects or living things. He uses this talent to great effect near the film's climax, when he takes over one of the Golden Army's soldiers and uses it to fight the others.\n\nOutside his containment suit, he appears as a roughly humanoid shape in whispy, ghostly form.\n\nWhen Liz Sherman and Abe decide to disobey orders and take the dying Hellboy to Prince Nuada, Krauss initially forbids them to, but reconsiders, remembering his own lost love. Deciding to support the renegades, he helps Liz and Abe steal the Bureau's plane to find the Prince, participates in the battle against the Golden Army, and quits the B.P.R.D. along with his new comrades.\n\nOn a commentary on the \"Hellboy II\" DVD, director Guillermo del Toro states that Johann's helmet design was an unused idea for Master Chief in the unreleased \"Halo\" movie.\n"}

It refers to the position of a penis as it relates to pathology on an x-ray of a pelvis. When the penis (visible on the x-ray as a shadow) points towards the same side as a unilateral medical condition such as a broken bone, this is considered a \"positive John Thomas sign\", and if the shadow points to the other side, it is a \"negative John Thomas sign.\"\n\nStudies have shown that the \"sign\" is no better than chance at identifying the location of a hip fracture. In those cases where the John Thomas sign is positive, it has been proposed that a person with a displaced hip fracture may try to lie on the injured side to immobilize the fracture and reduce pain; the penis then inclines toward the downward (injured) side.\n"}

The Lyceum TV, Dimensia, and Colortrak 2000 models all basically had the same chassis (a woodgrain veneer, or black laminate for some Dimensias, and fabric covered speakers on the sides of the cabinet).\n\nMany Colortrak 2000, Lyceum, and Dimensia TVs came packaged with a very large remote control, the Digital Command Center. There are several different versions of the Digital Command Center, but a main feature was that it could control an array of selected RCA components, all with the one remote – a universal remote only for RCA products, so to speak.

Frann is best known for her role as Bob Newhart's wife, Joanna Loudon, on the CBS sitcom \"Newhart\", which aired from 1982 to 1990.\n\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, Frann was a child model and appeared in commercials for a local television station while she attended Nerinx Hall High School. At the age of 18, she was voted Missouri's \"Junior Miss\". She went on to win the 1961 national title of America's Junior Miss and earned a college scholarship to study drama at Northwestern University. As America's Junior Miss, she starred in a Jam Handy educational film (\"Prom: It's a Pleasure\") extolling the etiquette and fun of the high school prom. While attending Northwestern, Frann worked as a weather reporter for the NBC station in St. Louis. After a year, she dropped out of Northwestern and moved to Chicago where she co-hosted a morning show on an ABC affiliate. While working as a host, Frann worked in local theatre productions and began working in television and films. In 1964, Frann made her television debut in an episode of the \"Kraft Suspense Theatre\". That same year, she appeared in the television movie \"Nightmare in Chicago\", starring Carroll O'Connor. In 1966, Frann made her film debut in the low budget musical drama \"Nashville Rebel\", starring Waylon Jennings.\n\nAfter receiving an offer to host another morning show, Frann realized she wanted to pursue a career as an actress rather than a broadcaster. In 1968, she moved to Los Angeles where she stayed with her best friend, actress Joan Van Ark. Shortly after her arrival, Frann won a role on the NBC crime drama series \"My Friend Tony\". After winning the role, Frann's agent told her that he felt she should change her name to something more appealing. Frann adopted the stage name \"Jennifer Douglas,\" a name she picked from the phone book. After \"My Friend Tony\" was canceled after one season, Frann returned to using the name \"Mary Frann\" (which she had gone by since high school) as her professional name.\n\nFor the next five years, Frann continued to work in television and also worked in theatre in Los Angeles and New York. In 1974, she landed the role of Amanda Howard on the daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\". She would remain on the show until 1979. While on the series, Frann also made guest appearances on \"Quincy, M.E.\", \"The Rockford Files\", \"Fantasy Island\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and \"WKRP in Cincinnati\". In 1978, Frann was nearly cast as Sue Ellen Ewing on the CBS prime-time drama \"Dallas\". Producers later decided to cast actress Linda Gray. In 1982, she starred on the short-lived series \"King's Crossing\" with Linda Hamilton. That series was canceled after one season due to low ratings. Later that year, she landed her most memorable role as Joanna Loudon, the wife of Vermont inn owner Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart), in the sitcom \"Newhart\". The series, which aired from October 1982, to September 1990, was a hit with audiences and was nominated for 25 Emmys and five Golden Globes. Shortly after filming the series finale, Frann was cast as \"Clementine Duke\" in the miniseries \"Lucky/Chances\". The series was based on two of Jackie Collins' novels, \"Lucky\" and \"Chances\". The role was a dramatic departure from Frann's work on \"Newhart\" and surprised audiences. She later told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"I thought it would be outrageous, flamboyant, glamorous. I wanted to remind people that I was capable of playing many different roles.\"\n\nDuring the run of \"Newhart\", Frann continued acting in various projects. In 1985, she co-starred in the TV movie \"Gidget's Summer Reunion\", and in 1988, she appeared in \"Dance 'til Dawn\" with Alyssa Milano, Christina Applegate and Kelsey Grammer. Frann also co-hosted the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants of 1986 and 1987, and acted as hostess for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rose Parade.\n\nHer last acting role came in the series \"\". Due to the sporadic airing of the series, the episode she was in, \"The Curse of Hampton Manor,\" aired two years after her death.\n\nFrann was married once, in 1973, to T.J. Escott. They separated in 1982, divorced the following year, and had no children. On September 23, 1998, Frann died in her sleep at her home in Beverly Hills, California. Her body was discovered by her \npublicist and her longtime partner Jonathan Cookman Jr. An autopsy later determined that she died of a heart attack and also suffered from an undiagnosed scarring of the heart muscle tissue. Her remains are interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. At the time of her death, she was in a long-term relationship with Cookman.\n\nFrann was active as a volunteer fund-raiser and was involved with charitable works. She was a member of the Celebrity Action Council, a volunteer group of celebrity women who served the women's outreach of the Los Angeles Mission, for seven years. The night before her death, she had attended a meeting at the Mission.\n\n"}
{"id": "6301509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6301509", "title": "Military mascot", "text": "Military mascot\n\nMilitary mascot refers to a pet animal maintained by a military unit as a mascot for ceremonial purposes or as an emblem of that unit.\n\nIt may also be referred to as a \"ceremonial pet\" or \"regimental mascot\".\n\nIt differs from a military animal in that it is not employed for use directly in warfare as a weapon or for transport.\n\nThe custom of adopting mascots originated from troops bringing a pet to war, adopting one at the place they were stationed at or being presented a pet as a gift. Some regimental mascots, such as those of most British infantry regiments, represent their home counties' history.\n\nRegiments of the British Army have long been prone to adopt members of the animal world as their mascots: dogs, goats and ponies are just a few that have graced ceremonial parades. When the custom of having regimental mascots first started is not clear; the earliest record is that of a goat belonging to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in the 1775 American War of Independence. Some mascots in the British Army are indicative of the recruiting area of a regiment, such as the Derbyshire Ram, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Irish Wolfhounds and Welsh Goats.\n\nBritish Army mascots are classified as either regimental pets or regimental mascots. The former are unofficial mascots since they are not recognized by the Army, while the latter are official mascots, having been recognized by the Army. Official British Army mascots are entitled to the services of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, as well as quartering and food at public expense. It costs the Army roughly £40,000 a year for the upkeep of official mascots. There are also mascots whose upkeep are borne by the regiment or unit itself. They are unofficial mascots which are properly referred to as regimental pets.\n\nThe Army is keen in preserving the distinction between pets kept by the soldiers and official mascots of the regiments. The case for official mascot recognition is presented before the Army Honours and Distinction Committee. By getting an official status, the mascot will receive a regimental number, assume a proper rank, with prospects of promotion and get its fair share of Army rations. There are three rules set down in 1953 that need to be hurdled to get official mascot status. First, the regiment must comply with the welfare guidelines issued by the Army Veterinary Corps to ensure that the mascot is properly fed and housed. Second, the regiment's Commanding Officer must give approval before the case goes to the Army Honours and Distinctions Committee. Third, the Committee will consider whether the mascot is \"appropriate\", can take an active part in army life, including ceremonial occasions, and have a symbolic and historic connection with the regiment.\n\nA total of seventeen ceremonial pets are kept by eleven Army regiments, but only ten are recognized as official regimental mascots by the Army. It is a privilege jealously guarded by those who have it. So far, the animals that have made the grade of official regimental mascot are the horse, pony, wolfhound, goat, ram and antelope.\n\n\nOn the 26th of February 2016, Her Majesty The Queen graciously accepted the recommendation of the Army Honours and Distinctions Committee that 1st The Queen’s Dragoon Guards be allowed to keep a mascot. A Welsh Mountain Pony was selected to reflect the Regiment’s Welsh heritage.\n\nThe Mascot's full title is 16851959 Tpr Emrys Forlan Jones. His number embodies the years of formation for the Queen's Bays and King's Dragoon Guards and the year they were amalgamated to form the QDG in 1959. Emrys is a name steeped in Welsh history and mythology. Forlan is the name of the Stud who donated the mascot to the Regiment. Jones is a very common surname in the QDG so is always accompanied by the last three numbers of the soldiers service number. Because of this, Emrys can also be known as Tpr Jones 959.\n\nEmrys is Bay coloured as was the tradition of the QDG’s antecedent Regiment, The Queen’s Bays. The Mascot is accompanied by a handler, known as the ‘Farrier Major'. He is identified by a unique rank insignia for the Regiment; four inverted chevrons, an inverted horseshoe and crown.\n\nEmrys and the Farrier Major live and train at Robertson Barracks in Norfolk.\n\n\nThe present mascot of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards is named Talavera. He is an official regimental mascot and has his own rank and ration book. His predecessor, named Ramillies, was presented to the Regiment by their Colonel-in-Chief, Her Majesty The Queen at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in 1987 and assumed his duties in 1989. Ramillies is a very large horse, standing over 18 hands high. After participating in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in August 2002, he was sent to retirement and died in November 2002.\n\n\nDrum horses are used by British cavalry units in ceremonials as part of their regimental bands. As their name suggests, these horses carry two kettle drums, plus a rider. Because the drums are made of solid silver, a drum horse must be big and powerful to carry this great weight. The drum horse's main role is to stand still on parades.\n\nThe tradition of the drum horse dates back to the mid-eighteenth century. By command of King George II, the two silver kettle drums captured at sword's point by the King's Own Regiment of Dragoons, later the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, from the French at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743 are to be carried by a drum horse ridden by a Sergeant Kettle Drummer on ceremonial occasions - a custom still observed by the Queen's Royal Hussars which have always had drum horses. They are a very special and central part of the Regiment. They play centre stage during ceremonial occasions as the Drum Horse for the cavalrymen.\n\nThe present drum horse is officially named Alamein after one of the Regiment's battle honours. He was also given by soldiers of the Regiment the nickname, Dudley which is after the West Midlands town where many of their troops are recruited. Dudley was given to the Regiment in March 2008. The five-year-old Irish Grey gelding was reared at Abergavenny's Triley Fields Equestrian Centre in Monmouthshire. He is still young and wary but is already part of the soldiers' affections even before he has gotten to know everybody. Dudley is fairly massive, around 19 hands high (approximately 190 cm) and has very big hooves. He is kept at the Paderborn Equestrian Centre which is close to the regimental barracks. The predecessor drum horse, named Winston, which was presented by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother died in 2006. A drum horse remains the regimental mascot for life. An earlier Drum Horse mascot named Peninsula, a gray Clydesdale, was also presented by HM The Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1988.\n\nThe soldier who looks after Dudley is known as Horse's Groom. He is the one responsible for turning Dudley from being just a very large animal into a drum horse. He exercises Dudley by taking him for a couple of walks around the yard as the drum horse gets to be ridden only on parades. The Horse's Groom assists the rider with tacking up and getting the horse ready for parades. The drum horse has an unusual steering mechanism. Normally, horses' reins are steered with the hands. Drum horses' reins are steered with a rider's feet.\n\n\nThe first pony mascot within The Parachute Regiment dates back to 1950 when Lt. Ben C. Arkle presented the 1st Battalion with a Black New Forest pony called Pegasus I. The 2nd Battalion were next to have a mascot when they purchased a black gelding in 1954 which was called Bruneval I. In August 1954, the 3rd Battalion also purchased their mascot, a White Welsh pony stallion and called him Coed Coch Samswn. The three pony mascots were to parade together for the first time on 15 April 1955 during a visit by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh to Rushmoor Arena.\n\nIt was only in June 1955, after a request by the Regimental Council to the War Office, that permission was granted to the regiment to have pony mascots.\n\nAt the conference of Commanding Officers on 11 November 1965, it was agreed that the battalions should no longer have their own pony mascots. The main reasons were the rising costs of looking after them, finding suitable accommodation and handlers. It was also impractical for the mascots to accompany battalions overseas as they moved by air. The decision was endorsed by the Regimental Council on 12 November 1965. All battalion mascots had found new homes outside the Regiment by 1966. Pegasus I of I Para and Coed Cock Samswn of III Para were taken by the East Riding branch of the Parachute Regimental Association (PRA). Bruneval II was sold to the Juniors Leaders Regiment RCT Taunton.\n\nPte. Ringway, a Skewbald Miniature Shetland Stallion then became the official Regimental Mascot. He was presented to the Regiment by the PRA in 1962 and was looked after by the Junior Parachute Company at Depot PARA, except when it was required with a battalion abroad. He progressed through the ranks. Following a successful performance at the Allied Forces Parade in 1975, while in Berlin with 1 PARA, he was promoted to Sergeant. The German Press and National TV were invited to the barracks to see him march into the Sergeants Mess by the Band and Drums and given his new Sergeants coat by the Commanding Officer. On being taken into the Mess, the Regimental Sgt. Major read him the Mess rules. The Mayor of Spandau sent him his congratulations and a bag of carrots, while an elderly lady sent twenty Deutschmarks to buy food. He died while still with 1 PARA in Berlin in 1975. Obituary notices were placed in the Times and Telegraph newspapers.\n\nAfter the death of Sgt. Ringway, records from the Airborne Assault Archive tend to show that there was some discussion whether the Regiment should continue to have a mascot. However, in February 1977, Sgt. Tex Banwell presented the regiment a Shetland pony which was named Pegasus II (or Peggy to the soldiers). He was flown out to Berlin on a Hercules to join 2 PARA. During the Queen's Birthday Parade in 1977, he collapsed from sun stroke but recovered. He was promoted to Lance Corporal in 1978 after being inspected by the Colonel-in-Chief, the Prince of Wales. In 1979, he was destroyed following a leg injury.\n\nOn 5 May 1980, the next Shetland pony mascot, Pte. Pegasus III, was donated to the Regiment by Mr. Peter Heims as a replacement to Lance Corporal Pegasus II. Pte. Pegasus III came to the Regiment aged 5 years old, having been rescued from a life of neglect and mistreatment. On 13 May 1980, he was inspected on parade by the Colonel-in-Chief. Following his steadiness on parade on Airborne Forces Day in 1980 and participation in the parade of the Royal Wedding, he was promoted in July 1981 to Lance Corporal. This was followed by promotions to Corporal in March 1983 and Sergeant in January 1990. Not all public duties went according to plan. During an appearance in 1991 at the Savoy Hotel, he fell asleep while on public duty. Then on the occasion of the Queen Mother's Birthday Parade, he attended a call of nature while on parade.\n\nIn July 1985, because of concerns over the health of Sgt. Pegasus III, it was decided to acquire a second pony as a stable companion, to be trained ready to take over. The new pony, a three-year-old brown Shetland pony named Dodger, was presented to the Regiment by Mrs. Mary Dipley of Stroud, Kent in July 1986. In his younger years Dodger was described as having a \"frisky temperament\" that frustrated the efforts of the Pony Major to train him for ceremonial duties. On the 50th Anniversary of the Parachute Regiment in July 1992, Dodger was renamed \"Falkland\", as tradition only allows the use of a battle honour as a name ten years after the event.\n\nMeanwhile, the health of Sgt. Pegasus III recovered and he was soon on parade for the Paras. Sgt. Pegasus also participated in the wedding ceremony of Sgt. Soane, his Pony Major, in 1990.\n\nIn November 2001, the mascots were moved from Aldershot to Colchester to co-locate with the new RHQ and the Regimental Band.\n\nThe present mascots are Lance Corporal Pegasus IV and Falkland I. The predecessor mascot, Sgt Pegasus III, retired in November 1998 while one of the present mascots, Falkland I is retiring soon. He is still fit and well but the Regiment has decided that it is time for him to end his military service since he will be 26 years old in January 2009. Falkland was offered a retirement home by Rosie Gibson (who was formally married to CO 1 Para Brig Paul Gibson) at Shetland Pony Club in Cobham Surrey. Still healthy in 2015 he is popular with child visitors and took part in the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War parade where he led the veterans, led by the son of former Co 1 Para Dick Trigger. Falkland was also the guest of honour at the 2014 Remembrance Calvacade in Albury Surrey to remember the War Horses lost in WW1. Falkland also attends community fetes raising money for Combat Stress.\n\nThe Regiment is now looking for a black Shetland pony, preferably a gelding, and under 6 years old, as replacement for Falkland I. They are looking for the right type of pony. The new Shetland mascot needs to be placid and good at marching up and down. It also needs to be capable of standing still for prolonged periods of time. And it must be good with children and the public since they get so much attention. The pony mascots are extremely well cared for and have a home for life.\n\nThe pony mascots travel round the country (United Kingdom), leading parades and marching in front of veterans and the Regiment. They also travel to local shows to greet their public and even as far as France and the Netherlands each year for the military anniversaries. In winter, it is quieter for the ponies, but they are regularly exercised and lunged.\n\n\nThere have been three Shetland pony mascots in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, all called Cruachan (IV). The pony and his mate are looked after by a \"Pony Major\" whose duties include their welfare and leading Cruachan during his many appearances at Highland games, fairs, military parades and annual Edinburgh Tattoo. The first, Cruachan I (1929 - 1939), formally became the Regimental Mascot in 1929 when he was presented to the 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders by Her Royal Highness Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. The third Cruachan retired in 2012 and will be replaced by the fourth. After the Scottish regiments merged to become constituent battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, Cruachan was adopted as the regimental mascot. The current mascot is Cruachan IV.\n\nIn July 1928, HRH Princess Louise, Colonel-in-Chief of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, visited the 1st Battalion at Shorncliffe. Before leaving, Her Royal Highness intimated that she wants to make some presentation to the Battalion to mark her visit and asked what the Officers and Men would like. It was suggested that if she presented the Battalion with a mascot, such as a Shetland pony, they would constantly be reminded of their Colonel-in-Chief. Princess Louise was delighted with the suggestion, and a few days after her return to London, she wrote saying that she had already seen the Shetland pony which she will propose to give to the Battalion. The Shetland was the smallest pony in Lady Hunloke's herd and because of this was known as \"Tom Thumb\". In accepting the gift, it was suggested that the Battalion rename the pony with a more imposing name. With Lady Hunloke's approval, the Battalion named him Cruachan after Ben Cruachan, an iconic mountain in the regiment's namesake lieutenancy of Argyll and Bute. Rather appropriately it was also the battle cry of the Clan Campbell, of which the Duke of Argyll was Chief.\n\nCruachan I was led by a drummer boy during parades, as it was some years before a Pony Major was appointed. Cruachan's spirit was well known to the soldiers of the Battalion. He was able to do a number of tricks on request, such as standing on an upturned bucket to \"give a paw\", if offered sugar and rearing up on his hind legs. However, his playfulness also extended to kicking unwary passers-by and escaping from his stable. Occasionally, he could be seen running around camp with a number of soldiers in pursuit. Cruachan I was regimental mascot until he retired in 1939 when the Battalion went on active service in Palestine. He was put out to grass at a farm near Oxford, where he died on 11 April 1942 at the age of 17.\n\nThe next regimental mascot was Cruachan II (1952 - 1979), whose full name was Cruachan of Braes of Greenock. He was a dark-brown Shetland pony, standing 9 hands high. He was born on 14 April 1950. His sire was Bergastor of Transy (1360) and his dam was Pamina OF Transy (4667). He was bred by the wife of Lt. Colonel Roger G. Hyde, an officer in the Regiment, at the Braes of Greenock in Callander.\n\nCruachan II was presented to the regiment by Mrs. Roger G. Hyde on 17 August 1952 at Princes Street Station in Edinburgh when the 1st Battalion returned to the United Kingdom from service in Hong Kong and Korea. His first parade was eight days later when he led the Battalion down Princes Street. Enormous crowds lined the streets to watch the parade, and although it was his first appearance, Cruachan was very well behaved. He immediately caught the imagination of the public and was always in demand for events such as the Edinburgh Military Tattoo and the Horse of the Year Show. Cruachan became infamous for his stubborn temperament and fondness for beer, particularly Guinness. He bit the glove of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II who was inspecting the Argylls on parade; the Queen who was very fond of horses went over to pat him and he bit the flowers she was holding. On more than one occasion he was \"punished\" for drunk behaviour while on duty by being locked up in the stables with his pony major. Cruachan II held the rank of Lance Corporal. He retired from active duty to a farm in Oxfordshire in 1979 after serving the regiment for 27 years and died at age thirty-five on 2 September 1985.\n\nThe last regimental mascot of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders as an independent regiment was Cruachan III who was presented to the regiment in October 1995 when he was six years old. Cruachan was purchased by private subscription of the serving soldiers and officers of the regiment. He is a black Shetland pony stallion, standing 9.1 hands high and comes from the Regimental area, Alloa. His sire was Harviestown Phyllapine (3003), a Reserve Champion at the Highland Show, and his dam was Harviestown Sylemma (13874).\nOn ceremonial occasions, Cruachan is dressed in a green tartan saddlecloth which is bordered with yellow and embroidered on both sides with the Royal Regiment of Scotland badge and cipher in gold and silver thread. On the saddlecloth is a stripe of a Lance Corporal and five medals: Northern Ireland, Iraq, Bosnia, The Queen's Jubilee and an Accumulative Service Medal. He wears an in-hand bridle with a red and white diced headband and a snaffle bit, and over his saddlecloth, he wears a black leather roller and crupper. His first public appearance was in a parade with the 1st Battalion on Balaklava Day at a Drumhead Service held on the Battalion Square before the Director of Infantry on 25 October 1995. On 2 July 2011, Her Majesty The Queen accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh presented the new colours of six of the seven battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland in Holyrood Park in Edinburgh. On this historic day during the Presentation of the Colours Parade, Cruachan III marched in front of all six battalions of the Regiment\nCruachan III was promoted to Lance Corporal from Private in 2001. He was reclassified as a battalion mascot in 2006 as the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was amalgamated with five other Scottish regiments to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The Argylls became the 5th Battalion of this new large regiment on 28 March 2006. Cruachan was reinstated as a regimental mascot when he was adopted as mascot of the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2009. He used to live near Sterling, Scotland with a stable companion Shetland pony named Islay. They now live in Redford Barracks, Edinburgh, Scotland. In 2011, he celebrated his 22nd birthday. He made his final public appearance at the 2012 Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and retired.\n\n\nIn 1970, an Irish Wolfhound, named Brian Boru I, was presented as mascot by a Major Hayes, an officer in the Royal Irish Rangers, on his retirement. Brian Boru became the mascot of the Royal Irish Regiment when it was formed in 1992 with the amalgamation of the Royal Irish Rangers and the Ulster Defence Regiment.\n\nThe name Brian Boru was to be used for all succeeding mascots, with just the addition of a Roman numeral to denote succession. The present mascot is Brian Boru IX whose wolfhound name is Finn. He was recruited in April 2011 when he was a twelve-week-old puppy. He was born on 8 January 2011 when the Regiment was in theatre in Afghanistan. His predecessor, Brian Boru VIII also called by his wolfhound name, Merlin, died of a heart attack on 16 December 2010 at age 6. The regimental mascot is based in Tern Hill near Market Drayton.\n\n\nThe Regimental Mascot is an Irish Wolfhound. The first mascot was presented to the Irish Guards in 1902 by the members of the Irish Wolfhound Club, who hoped the publicity would increase the breed's popularity with the public. It was named Brian Boru, after one of Ireland's legendary chieftains and given the nickname Paddy. There have been 14 more since, all named after Irish High Kings or legendary chieftains. The mascot is a firm favourite of both the Regiment and the public. It leads the battalion on all major parades. The present regimental mascot is named Conmael. He made his debut at the Trooping the Colour on 13 June 2009. The predecessor mascot, Fergal, was killed in an automobile accident while being exercised away from the barracks in 2007.\n\nOn 26 July 1961, the wolfhound mascot was admitted to the select group of official Army mascots entitling him to the services of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, as well as quartering and food at public expense. Originally, the mascot was in the care of a drummer boy, but is now looked after by one of the regiment's drummers and his family. However, new mascots spend their first six months at the home of the Regimental Adjutant so they can be gradually introduced to regimental life.\n\nThe Irish Guards are the only Guards regiment permitted to have their mascot lead them on parade. During the Trooping the Colour, however, the mascot marches only from the Royal Artillery Barracks to as far as Horse Guards Parade. He then falls out and does not participate in the trooping itself. The mascot has never been dressed up on parades but there are certain occasions that the wearing of a cape is acceptable. In principle, it is intended that the red linen cape should only be worn by the mascot on State or special occasions. It is worn when tunics are worn and the Drum Major is wearing State Dress. It may also be worn on special occasions as directed by the 1st Battalion Adjutant or the Regimental Adjutant. When greatcoats are worn and the Drum Major wears State Dress, the mascot wears a blue-grey cape. However, the overriding influence is the weather because the animal is never allowed to be distressed by the heat on parade.\n\nThe mascots of the Irish Guards from 1902 to present are Brian Boru (1902–1910), Leitrim Boy (1910–1917), Doran (1917–1924), Cruachan (1924–1929), Pat (1951–1953), Shaun (1960–1967), Fionn (1967–1976), Cormac (1976–1985), Connor (1985–1992), Malachy (1992–1994), Cuchulain (1995–2000) Aengus (2000–2003), Donnchadh (2003–2005), Fergal (2006–2007) Conmael, (2009–2012) and Domhnall (2013–present).\n\nThe tradition of goat mascots in the military dates back 200 years, from at least 1775. The history of the regimental goat dates back to the American War of Independence in 1775 when a wild goat wandered onto a battlefield in Boston, and ended up leading the Welsh regimental Colours off the battlefield at the end of the Battle of Bunker Hill. Since then a goat has served with the Battalion. In 1884, Queen Victoria presented the regiment, then called the Royal Welch Fusiliers, with a Kashmir goat from her royal herd, and a tradition was started. The British Monarchy has presented an unbroken series of Kashmir goats to the Royal Welch Fusiliers from the Crown's own royal herd. The royal goat herd was originally obtained from Mohammad Shah Qajar, Shah of Persia from 1834 to 1848, when he presented them to Queen Victoria as a gift in 1837 upon her accession to the throne.\n\nAll the goats are called William (anglicised version of Gwylim) Windsor or Billy for short. Their primary duty is to march at the head of the battalion on all ceremonial event. The present goat mascot, Fusilier William Windsor, was chosen from a herd of goats living on the Great Orme in Llandudno on 13 June 2009. After his selection, months of work followed to get him used to his fellow soldiers and to make him learn what is expected of him. As the goat progressed, he was taught to get used to sounds and noises coming from marching soldiers.\n\nThe predecessor mascot, Lance Corporal William Windsor, a Kashmir goat from the royal herd at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire, was presented to the Regiment by Queen Elizabeth II in 2001. Following eight years of distinguished military service, he retired on 20 May 2009 due to his age. As he left Dale Barracks, Chester for the last time, hundreds of soldiers from the Battalion lined the route from his pen to the trailer to say farewell and thank you for his many years of good service. He was led into the trailer by the battalion's Goat Major in full ceremonial dress that included a silver headdress which was a gift from the Queen in 1955. He was taken to Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire where he is spending his honourable retirement. Zoo keepers say he is having an easy life at the Children's Farm.\n\nThe goat is more than a mascot. It is a full member of the battalion and in the days gone by, when it was a 1,000-strong unit, it was 999 men plus the goat. As a soldier, the goat can move up the ranks. It starts as a Fusilier and if it is well behaved and does well on parades, quite often it is promoted to Lance Corporal, a non-commissioned officer rank. As a full member of the battalion, he is accorded the full status and privileges of the rank. These include membership in the Corporals' Mess and the right to be saluted by his subordinates. The goat mascot that retired on 20 May 2009 was a Lance Corporal.\n\nThere are perks to the job of regimental mascot. Billy gets a two-a-day cigarette ration (He eats them, as traditionally, the tobacco is thought to be good for the goat.) and Guinness to drink when he is older \"to keep the iron up\".\n\nThe Regimental goat mascot was first mentioned in 1775. It was officially known as \"His Majesty's Goat\". During the Crimean War in 1855, the story goes that on one particularly cold night, a Private Gwilym Jenkins was on sentry duty. To keep himself warm, he placed a kid goat inside his greatcoat. However, Jenkins fell asleep. Fortunately, goats have very good hearing and the kid goat bleated when it heard movements of the enemy. Pte Jenkins was awakened by the agitated bleating of the kid goat and espied an advancing Russian patrol. He was able to warn the forward picket and the enemy was driven off. From then on, every time the 41st (Welsh) Regiment of Foot, a predecessor of the Royal Regiment of Wales, went into battle, a goat led the way as good luck.\n\nAfter the Crimean War, a review at Aldershot on 29 July 1856 by Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, of regiments that had returned from the Crimea was held. One of the regiments present was the 41st (Welsh) Regiment of Foot, which brought along their Russian goat mascot. On that occasion, the Queen learned of the goat mascot tradition of the Regiment, to which she promised that upon the death of the present mascot, she will replace it with one from the Royal Herd in Great Windsor Park. In 1862, the first official goat from the royal herd at Windsor was presented to the Regiment and a tradition was started. The goat is officially recorded on the battalion ration roll as Gwylim Jenkins, but he is called by his nickname, Taffy. He is also officially recorded as the regimental goat.\n\nThe present battalion mascot is Taffy V who holds the rank of Lance Corporal. He lives in Lucknow Barracks in Tidworth, Wiltshire. Replacements for the goat mascot are traditionally selected from the royal herd kept at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire and are always named Taffy plus a Roman numeral to show succession. The soldier who looks after the goat is known as the Goat Major, who actually has the rank of a Corporal.\n\nThe present battalion mascot is a Kashmir white goat, named Shenkin III, which was selected from the Queen's own herd of Royal Windsor Whites, on the Great Orme in Llandudno, North Wales on 8 September 2009. He is a direct descendant of the original mascot given to the 3rd Royal Welsh Regiment by Queen Victoria after the Crimean War. Shenkin III is residing at the Maindy Barracks in Cardiff.\n\nThe predecessor goat mascot, Lance Corporal Shenkin II, died of old age at the Maindy Barracks on 14 July 2009. He has been the battalion mascot since September 1997. The Queen sent her private condolences following Shenkin's death and Buckingham Palace gave permission for the regiment to pick out a successor. Plans were also discussed for a memorial at Maindy Barracks. LCpl Shenkin II first began service at age 18 months and served for the next 12 years. During his long service, Shenkin II met the Queen, visited Prince Charles Gloucestershire home, Highgrove and had been to 10 Downing Street where he was tethered in the rear garden. He replaced Shenkin I, who died on the same day that Princess Diana died.\n\nThe name Shenkin is the Welsh pronunciation of Jenkins. The first Shenkin was actually named Sospan before 1994.\n\nDuring the Zulu War, the first known and adopted mascot name was Gwilym Jenkins. It was named by the Royal Welsh Fusilliers for rationing purposes. Because putting a 'GOAT' down for rations would not happen, the name Gwilym was given to the goat in order to obtain his rations. Brecon war museum in South Wales records \"Gwilyn Jenkins one Bail of Hay\".\n\n\nPrivate Derby, a Swaledale ram, is the official mascot of the Mercian Regiment. He was the mascot of the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment which inherited Private Derby from a predecessor regiment, the Sherwood Foresters and which in turn inherited him from The 95th Derbyshire Regiment. Private Derby became the mascot of the Mercian Regiment when it was formed on 1 September 2007 with the amalgamation of the Worchestershire and Sherwood Foresters with the Staffordshire and Cheshire regiments. The ram mascot is a central part of the Regiment's history and tradition and its association with the home counties of its predecessor regiments. It is a symbol of pride for the Regiment and is extremely popular with the public when it makes appearances.\n\nThe first Private Derby was adopted as a mascot in 1858 by the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot at the siege and capture of Kotah during the Indian Mutiny Campaign (1857–58). The Commanding Officer whilst on one of his forays within the town, noticed a fine fighting ram tethered in a temple yard. He directed Private Sullivan of the Number 1 Company to take the ram into his possession.The ram was named Private Derby and has marched nearly 3,000 miles with the soldiers of the Regiment through central India before it died in 1863. Since then, there has followed a succession of fine rams, each of which has inherited the official title of Private Derby followed by his succession number. The earlier replacement rams were acquired by the Regiment from whichever part of the world they were serving in at the time. However, since 1912 it has become the tradition for the Duke of Devonshire to select a Swaledale Ram from his Chatsworth Park flock and present it to the Regiment. It is a tradition the Duke is proud to hold, in recognition of the close association between the Regiment and the Dukes of Devonshire, whose ancestral seat is in the county of Derbyshire. However, there was a temporary departure from tradition in 1924 when the successor ram, Derby XIV, was presented to the Regiment instead by His Highness Sir Umeo Singh Bahador GCB GLSI GCIE The Mohorac of Kotah.\n\nThe Army recognizes each Private Derby as a soldier and has his own regimental number and documentation. He has been held on the official strength of the Regiment since the first Private Derby. He is paid 3.75 pounds per day. In addition, he is also on the ration strength and draws his own rations like any other soldier. Private Derby even has a leave card and takes an annual holiday at Chatsworth during the mating season. He may even get a promotion if he behaves.\n\nThe only record of a medal being presented to a Regimental Mascot was when Private Derby I of the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment was awarded the Indian Service Medal with a clasp 'Central India' together with the rest of the Battalion on parade at Poona in 1862. He also fought 33 battles against other rams and was undefeated.\n\nWhen on parade, Private Derby wears a coat of scarlet with Lincoln green and gold facings, the whole emblazoned with the Regiment's main Battle Honours. Also on his coat is to be found a replica of his India Mutiny Medal. In addition, he now wears the General Service Medal 1962 with the clasp Northern Ireland as he has been stationed there several times over the years. On his forehead is to be found a silver plate suitably embossed with the Regimental Cap Badge. A pair of silver protectors are fitted on the tips of his horns to protect the clothing of persons near him such as his handlers and visitors, of which he receives a great number each time he appears in public.\n\nPrivate Derby has two handlers from the Drums Platoon whose duty is to look after him at all times. The senior handler is called the \"Ram Major\" whilst the other one is the \"Ram Orderly\". They escort Private Derby when he is on parade by standing, one on each side of the goat and leading or controlling him with two white ornamental ropes that are attached to a leather collar. It is the responsibility of the Ram Major to prepare Private Derby for all parades and the other appearances which he makes.\n\nThe predecessor ram, Private Derby XXVIII, died on 10 September 2008 of unknown cause at age four. He died in his residence at the barracks in Chilwell, Nottingham. He started his military service as a mascot in 2005. Private Derby, one of only nine mascots recognized by the Army, represented the Regiment on ceremonial duties for the past three years. The year that he died was the 150th anniversary of the ram mascot.\n\nThe present mascot, Derby XXIX, was selected by the Duke of Devonshire from his Chatsworth Park estate in Derbyshire in September 2008 and was formally handed over to the Regiment during a ceremony at Chatsworth House on 15 January 2009. The head shepherd at Chatsworth House handed over the new Pte Derby to the regimental secretary of the Mercian Regiment. He is now residing at Chetwynd Barracks, Chilwell, Nottinghamshire. He is an excellent ram, both big and strong albeit with a pleasant nature and most importantly, handles well on parade. He was promoted to Lance Corporal during a Crimean War commemoration ceremony at the Nottingham Castle in April 2011.\n\n\nThe tradition of antelope mascots dates back 140 years, when the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, a predecessor regiment, adopted a live antelope as mascot when it was stationed in India in 1871. It was an Indian black buck antelope named Billy which was also the name given to its successors for many years. Subsequently, the names Charlie and Bobby have also been used. The custom stems from the Royal Warwickshire Regiment's 'ancient badge' of an Antelope, authorised to be displayed on colours and appointments in 1747, but traditionally held to date from the regiment's service in Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. When the four fusilier regiments merged to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the antelope was adopted as the mascot of the new regiment.\n\nThe second Billy was presented to the 1st Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment about the time of the Delhi Durbar of 1877 by a well-known Maharajah. It came home with the battalion in 1880 and died in Ireland in 1888. There were two sources of supply of these animals, the battalion serving in India usually received them as gifts from the Maharajahs, while the home battalion was given theirs by the London Zoo.\n\nIn 1963, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was converted to a fusilier regiment. Then on 23 April 1968 the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers was amalgamated with three other fusilier regiments to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, where the tradition of antelope mascot was carried on.\n\nTwo men are chosen from amongst the battalion drummers to be in charge of the antelope, a Buck Leader and an Assistant Buck Leader. When on parade, these two men held white cords attached to the buck's white collar which had a large silver badge on it. On the antelope's back was a coat of royal blue on which was emblazoned the regimental badge. The horns were tipped with silver cones.\n\nThough amenable to discipline, the antelopes have been known to have a mind of their own. At a military review in Aldershot, the then mascot, Bobby II, chose to lay down as he was being led past King George V and proceeded to nibble the grass, thus halting the parade. On another occasion, the drum-major made the mistake of walking in front of the mascot at a Tattoo performance, and paid for his error with a sore behind and ripped trousers. Bobby III who was a corporal proved to be more cunning. On a church parade at Tidworth, he developed a limp. At first, he would be removed from the parade and returned to his pen where he would quickly recover. After three Sundays of limping and quick recovery, it was decided to ignore him and press on. After a quarter of a mile, the limp stopped and never re-occurred.\n\nOne of the antelope mascots in the long line of successors all named Bobby was recognized at the Tower of London on 24 June 1997 with a Long Service and Good Conduct Medal for fifteen years of loyal service to the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. This Bobby was born at the London Zoo in 1982 and joined the regiment at the age of one month. Normal life expectancy for antelopes is about nine years but Bobby has butted his way to fifteen. He was promoted corporal on his 13th birthday. He normally lives in Coventry with one of the Fusiliers' Territorial Army battalions but came to London for the presentation outside the Fusiliers' regimental headquarters in the Tower.\n\nThe antelope mascot in the year 2000 also named Bobby was sent to the Tower of London, the Fusiliers' regimental headquarters when the 2nd Battalion went on a tour of Germany. His stay there was extended when foot-and-mouth disease restrictions prevented him from returning to the 2nd Battalion's barracks. He was due to return to the Battalion's barracks in April 2001 but stayed in the Tower of London for 15 months.\n\nThe present mascot is named Bobby and holds the rank of Corporal. He attends all major parades held by the Regiment. He lives with the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in St. George Barracks, North Luffenham, Ruthland in Leicestershire. His pen is a converted tennis court with plenty of grass to graze. His regular diet is horse nuts and is partial to biscuits. He likes hour-long walks.\n\n\nThe mascot tradition in the regiments of Staffordshire stretches back to the 19th Century. In 1882, the South Staffordshire Regiment was ordered to march with Lord Wolseley to relieve General Gordon who was besieged in Khartoum. They entrained at Cairo with their Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Boxer. Startled by the sudden noise of the train's engine when it departed, Boxer leapt from the moving train and was seen lying, either unconscious or dead, at the side of the railroad tracks. A few days later, when the Regiment encamped at Assiut awaiting orders for the final phase of their march, a very thin and bedraggled dog staggered into their camp and collapsed. It was Boxer, who like a true soldier, walked for over 200 miles along the railway tracks in the scorching desert to rejoin his regiment. This feat marked the start of the tradition of having a Bull Terrier as a regimental mascot.\n\nIn 1949, after years of being the best battalion in recruitment of new soldiers in the Territorial Army, the 6th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment was presented with a pure white Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The Battalion adopted the bull terrier as their mascot and named it Watchman I. On 25 May 1949, the 6th North Staffords sent a Company-size group (some 120 men) along with its mascot and Corps of Drums and Fifes to the Royal Tournament, which was held that year in Olympia. Watchman I showed little interest in the occasion until the Band and Drums struck up. At which point, he raised his head and marched proudly to the thunderous applause of an appreciative audience which had immediately taken him to their heart. Over the next decade, Watchman I participated in every parade the Battalion took part. He was presented to Her Majesty The Queen on her visit to Burton-on-Trent on 28 March 1957. Watchman I died in 1959 and was laid to rest in the lawn opposite the Town Hall in King Edward Place in Burton-upon-Trent.\n\nSuch was the tradition, interest and good feeling of the people of Burton towards this most popular mascot that in September 1960 Watchman II was presented to the Battalion by the town at a civic parade. Like his predecessor, he was to march at the head of the Battalion throughout the next six years of his life. He was presented to Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of the Presentation of New Colours to the 6th North Staffords at Molineaux in the early 1960s. His last parade was the Honorary Colonels Parade held at St Martins Camp in 1966. The following year the County TA Regiments were reformed and Watchman II went into retirement until his death in 1974, at the age of fourteen. He was laid to rest alongside his predecessor Watchman I.\n\nThe tradition started up again in 1988 in the 3rd (V) Battalion The Staffordshire Regiment. It was felt that the time-honoured tradition of having a mascot should continue. Consequently, a search was made to find a dog with a suitable pedigree and bearing to do justice to the Battalion and County. As an indication of the depth of feeling within the County for the mascot, the people of Burton presented the Battalion with Watchman III in 1988. He reached the rank of sergeant and served until his death in 1998. He was interred alongside his two predecessors. In 2006, special memorials were unveiled in the town for the three former mascots.\n\nThe successor mascot, Watchman IV, was presented to the Staffordshire Regiment as a puppy in August 1998 by the Friends of the Regiment. He has been the mascot since 1999 and has reached the rank of Colour Sergeant, which is equal in status to his handler.\n\nWatchman IV not only paraded with the Staffordshire Regiment but also with the newly formed West Midlands Regiment. He has appeared at remembrance day parades in London and once at a remembrance service outside Westminster Abbey where he met the Queen. He again met the Queen when Stafford celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2006. He participated in the Tercentenary Celebration in 2005. Watchman attracts attention such as when his handler took him for a walk through the streets of London. A coach full of tourists pulled up and leapt off the vehicle to photograph him.\n\nWatchman IV was carried forward when the Battalion joined the Mercian Regiment on 1 September 2007 and became the mascot of the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment. He retired on 4 October 2009 after 10 years of military service. He was replaced by a young Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Watchman V, in a ceremony at the battalion's museum in Whittington on 5 October 2010.\n\nThe present mascot is linked to 4 Mercian (V) and the Staffordshire Regimental Association, but lives at the home of the soldier who looks after him. He was made a Lance Corporal at a ceremony at the National Brewery Museum in Burton-upon-Trent on 8 September 2011. He as promoted to Coporal at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum in 2013. He was promoted to Sergeant in 2015, forming a central part of Tamworth's St George's Day celebrations in the grounds of Tamworth Castle.\n\nWatchman is classified as a regimental pet as he is not recognised by the Army. Since he is an unofficial battalion mascot, his upkeep is paid for by the Staffordshire Regimental Association, not by the government. Following the removal of 3rd Battalion (the Stafford's) from the Mercian Regiment, Watchman now marches with the Staffordshire Regimental Association.\n\n\nThe locals presented two ferrets to the 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment when it was on duty in Northern Ireland. They were adopted as regimental pets and named after the battalion's battle honours, Imphal and Quebec. These ferrets are classified as regimental pets since they are not recognized by the Army. They are unofficial battalion mascots.\n\nSeaman Jenna was the canine mascot on USS Vandegrift (FFG-48) for five years while the ship was forward deployed to 7th Fleet. Acquired as a rescue dog by the ship after a home port shift in 1998, she was a morale booster for a crew far from home and families. She improved morale every day, bringing a sense of home and making her shipmates feel different than the other sailors in the Navy. She created a bond amongst the crew that still exists today.\n\nSince 1922, the United States Marine Corps has used Bulldogs as its mascots.\n\nU.S. Marine Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler introduced the first Marine mascot, named \"Pvt Jiggs,\" who lived at Marine Barracks, Quantico. He quickly rose in the ranks to Sergeant Major. He was the first in a series of bulldog mascots.\n\nThe current mascot is the 16th in a series of mascots named \"Chesty\" in honor of famed Marine Lieutenant General Lewis B. \"Chesty\" Puller Jr. This dog lives at the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., where he appears in weekly parades.\n\nMarine units across the Corps have mascots, usually bulldogs, the most famous of which represent the enlisted training installations. An English bulldog named Legend represents Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and LCpl. Belleau Wood represents Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.\n\nThere are several unofficial mascots in the Army, but only three official mascots. Two mules represent West Point. A Borzoi (previously called Russian Wolfhound) represents the 27th Infantry Regiment \"Wolfhounds\".\n\nThe 27th Infantry Regiment based in Schofield Barracks, HI is represented by the Russian Wolfhound. During the Russian Civil War, the 27th Infantry served in the American Expeditionary Force sent to Siberia in 1918. This campaign has become an integral part of unit's history. The tenacious pursuit tactics of the regiment won the respect of the Bolsheviks, who gave them the name \"Wolfhounds.\" This emblem continues to serve as the symbol of the 27th Infantry Regiment. Their current mascot is Kolchak XVI.\n\nThe French-Canadian Royal 22e Régiment (Van Doos), headquartered at the Citadel in Quebec City, has a goat named \"Batise\" as its mascot.\n\n1st Battalion - Septimus, a Shetland pony.\n5th Battalion - Quintus, a Sumatran tiger.\n6th Battalion - Ridgeliegh Blue, a blue heeler.\n2nd Cavalry Regiment - Courage, a wedge-tailed eagle.\n\n1st Aviation Regiment - Penny Alert, a Peregrine Falcon.\n\nRoyal Australian Engineers\n\n2nd Combat Engineer Regiment - Driver, an Australian Terrier\n\nThe New Zealand Army has had a practice of bringing regimental pets since World War I and personnel have continued doing so through most conflicts the army has taken part in such as the Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Vietnam War and more recently in Afghanistan. The last surviving veteran of Gallipoli is in fact a tortoise brought back from that battle.\n\nThe Norwegian His Majesty The King's Guard has a penguin called Sir Nils Olav as an official mascot.\n\nThe mascot of the Spanish Legion is a goat. It usually appears at parades, wearing a Legion cap and accompanied by a Legionnaire, alongside the legion's marker guard (gastadores) at parades and ceremonies, leading the marching troops.\n\nThe mascot of the Sri Lanka Light Infantry is a Kandula the elephant.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10423650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10423650", "title": "Narrative art", "text": "Narrative art\n\nNarrative art is art that tells a story, either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. Some of the earliest evidence of human art suggests that people told stories with pictures. \n\nAlthough there are some common features to all narrative art, different cultures have developed idiosyncratic ways to discern narrative action from pictures. Prior to the advent of literacy most narrative art was done in a simultaneous narrative style with very little overarching organization. Once literacy developed in different parts of the world pictures began to be organized along register lines, like lines on a page, that helped define the direction of the narrative. This method of linking scenes together led to other ways of telling stories in the 20th century, namely the newspaper, comic strips and comic books.\n\nIn painting in traditional Western art since the Renaissance, the concept of history painting covers most narrative scenes.\n\nThough it requires sophisticated conventions to make the narrative clear, narrative art occurs very early in the history of art. A number of reliefs in the European Bronze Age Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin show monscenic narratives of hunting or battle, the former sometimes indicating the movements of hunter or prey with indications of their tracks in a way similar to modern diagrammatic illustrations. One of the earliest works of Ancient Egyptian art is the Narmer Palette relief in the Louvre Museum, which shows a victory of King Narmer (c. 31st century BC) in several scenes.\n\nNarrative art was employed extensively in the Neo-Assyrian Period. Most significantly, the walls of the major Assyrian royal palaces (the Northwest Palace of Assurnasirpal II at Nimrud, the Central Palace of Tiglath-Pileser III at Nimrud, the Palace of Sargon II at Khorsabad, the Southwest Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh, and the North Palace of Assurbanipal at Nineveh) were lined orthostats sculpted in low relief with scenes depicting the activitives of the king (hunting, battle, and ritual). Sometimes, scenes were also depicted on glazed bricks or wall paintings (e.g. at Til Barsip). Bronze bands decorating the doors of Assyrian temples and palaces were also sometimes decorated with scenes of the king's activities in narrative style. The most famous of these are the \"Balawat Gates\" commissioned by Shalmaneser III for his palace at Balawat (ancient Imgur-Enlil); additional fragmentary bronze gate bands dating to Assurnasirpal II have been found at Balawat, and very poorly preserved fragments from other sites, such as Khorsabad, Nimrud, Assur, and Tell Hadad.\n\nThe lives of Jesus and Buddha, the founders of new religions, their followers, and in the case of Buddha also the former lives, were to provide new subject-matter for narrative art, as did elements of older religions such as the Labours of Hercules. Trajan's Column is an exceptional example of Imperial Roman narrative art. In Christian art the Life of Christ in art and Life of the Virgin supplied the most common subjects, based around the incidents celebrated in the major feasts of the church calendar, but the lives of saints gave many others. \n\nBook illustrations are found from ancient times in several cultures, and are very often narrative in nature. There appear to have been some lavishly illustrated books in Western Late Antiquity, no doubt belonging to wealthy collectors, including both classic literary texts (Vergilius Vaticanus and Vergilius Romanus) and biblical texts; the Quedlinburg Itala fragment seems to have had between two and four images facing every text page, and to have been more densely illustrated than any subsequent biblical text in an illuminated manuscript.\n\nNarratives occur in a space and unfold in time. In narrative art, the artist chooses how to portray the story, represent the space, and how to shape time within the artwork. Narrative art can be categorized into various types, also known as modes or styles. A piece of artwork is not limited to only one type of narrative. An artwork may have a narrative type as a whole, as well as portions of the artwork itself that depict separate types of narratives. Several of these types are covered below. A depicted action in itself can suggest a scene or setting:\n\nYou can imagine the Trojan War taking place at Troy without having to depict the actual city of Troy. You can show Achilles dragging Hector’s body around the city of Troy without having to depict the walls of the city. Nonetheless, the idea that each action is limited to a specific place can still pertain, because the Trojan War did take place at Troy and Achilles did drag Hector’s body around the city.\n\nA simultaneous narrative is a type of narrative that has very little visually discernible organization to those who are not acquainted with its purpose. It can focus on geometric or abstract designs as well as the placement or arrangement of items within the artwork. Simultaneous narratives concentrate on repeatable patterns and redundant systems with a focus on dualities. The interpretation of a simultaneous narrative is dependent on the reason for its creation or its creator because this would convey who would be able to interpret it as it was meant to be.\n\nThis type of narrative is common in cultures that are oral in nature rather than literate. This is because simultaneous narratives require human agency in order to be understood as originally intended. This is common in illiterate societies because of a lack of ways to transpire information from one generation to another without a written language. Thus simple patterns and dualities are used because they can be easily remembered and referenced to by those for whom the piece of art is meant.\n\nA monoscenic narrative is a type of narrative that represents a single scene. There is no repetition of characters and there is only one action taking place. The scene is one that is easily identifiable in context of the narrative and is of significant importance.\n\nUnder this definition, most art that is usually not considered a narrative would fit under the monoscenic narrative type. Narrative art is art that tells a story, either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. This in retrospect makes a good portion of art narrative art. Landscapes and portraits however do not meet the criteria of the definition provided, though they might be, depending on the artist’s intention.\n\nExekias was an ancient Greek vase-painter and potter. A good portion of his vase work included scenes from Greek mythology. He was known for his ability to capture the most critical points of a story and illustrate them into one simple scene. The amphora portraying Achilles killing Penthesilea is such an example.\n\nThis monoscenic narrative illustrated on this amphora exemplifies a vital part of the Trojan saga. It is the moment in which Achilles and Penthesilea fall in love. In the heat of battle, Achilles battles Penthesilea and with a fatal blow, causes her helmet to be pushed back. When their eyes meet, it is said that they fall in love. This is ruined by Achilles’ inability to control his bloodlust. Due to this tragedy, Achilles refuses to fight and from this many consequences arise that eventually could be linked to his demise.\n\nA line of development of narrative art begins with William Hogarth, the English painter. His monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in a narrative were taken up in the 19th century by other British painters. The Victorian terms applied to this style were \"subject painting\" or \"anecdotic\" painting.\n\nA continuous narrative is a type of narrative that illustrates multiple scenes of a narrative within a single frame. Multiple actions and scenes are portrayed in a single visual field without any dividers. The sequence of events within the narrative is defined through the reuse of the main character or characters. It emphasizes the change in movement and state of the repeating characters as indicators of scene or phase changes in the narrative.\n\nThe Column of Trajan depicts one event: the Dacian Wars. This continuous narrative can be broken down into a series of events. These events flow from one scene to another without any physical indicators such as vertical lines. Because of how the narrative is read, from standing in front of the column, it seems to ebb right to left and then left to right which is common in continuous narratives.\n\nThe narrative becomes rather hard to read as the column gets higher. Research suggests that the column was originally planned to be read while walking a circular staircase around the column itself . The story then would not ebb and continue on in a sequential manner.\n\nThe 'Bayeux Tapestry' (a misnomer as it is really an embroidery not a tapestry) tells the story of the Norman invasion of England in 1066. The theme of the Bayeux Tapestry is treason and deception. The narrative reflects a partisan Norman view of the events of the conquest of England. Though the tapestry seems to be framed because it is separated by registers, horizontal lines, it is still a continuous narrative. Registers are needed in order to separate a story to fit within a certain area. If cut up and placed next to each other, a continuous narrative would exist. A continuous narrative does not have any separation between scenes and actions.\n\nA synoptic narrative depicts a single scene in which a character or characters are portrayed multiple times within a frame to convey that multiple actions are taking place. This causes the sequence of events to be unclear within the narrative. Synoptic narratives typically provide visual cues that convey the sequence, but still might be difficult to decipher for those unfamiliar with the story.\n\nAn instance of a synoptic narrative is one represented in a medallion from the stupa at Amaravati. It, like many synoptic narratives, can be difficult to interpret. The medallion is meant to present the reader with the story of Buddha’s previous birth as the elephant Chaddanta. The center of the medallion has only decorative carving, which is a visual cue on how the medallion is meant to be interpreted; which is in a circular pattern. Other than that subtle visual cue the artist leaves very little indication of the order.\nThe medallion can be separated into 3 episodes:\n\nA panoramic narrative is a narrative that depicts multiple scenes and actions without the repetition of characters. Actions may be in a sequence or represent simultaneous actions during an event.\n\nThe Siphnian Treasury at Delphi has four marble friezes, one for each cardinal direction. These four friezes depict panoramic narratives through the use of carvings of the marble. The north frieze is an illustration of a battle between the Olympic gods and the giants. In the far left two giants attack Zeus in his chariot, who is no longer visible due to deterioration. Hera is seen finishing off a giant to the right of Zeus with Athena behind her (further right) fighting two giants. To the right of Athena is her brother Ares who is fighting two other giants with one already dead at his feet. There are multiple narratives taking place with each combatant in varying scenes. The dead giant at Ares' feet was downed by Athena but Ares is depicted as moving forward in the narrative by stepping over the corpse.\n\nA progressive narrative portrays a single scene in which characters do not repeat. However, multiple actions are taking place in order to convey a passing of time in the narrative. A progressive narrative is not to be interpreted as a group of simultaneous events but rather a sequence that is dependent on its location. Actions displayed by characters in the narratives compact present and future action into a single image.\n\nA sequential narrative is very much like a continuous narrative with one major difference. A sequential narrative focuses on enframement to develop temporal progression. Each scene and action is represented within its frame as a unit. Each frame is a particular scene during a particular moment. A sequential narrative is the type of narrative generally used in comics and manga.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1716070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1716070", "title": "Original English-language manga", "text": "Original English-language manga\n\nAn original English-language manga or OEL manga is a comic book or graphic novel originally published in English. The term \"international manga\", as used by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, encompasses all foreign comics which draw inspiration from the \"form of presentation and expression\" found in Japanese manga.\n\nAs early as 1993, Japan-owned Viz Media issued a line of American manga. Shortened to \"Amerimanga\", it is thought to be the earliest colloquial name for these types of works. Other variations on OEL manga, such as western manga, world manga, global manga, manga-influenced comics, neo-manga, and nissei comi can occasionally be heard as substitute names, but the term OEL manga is most commonly used today. OEL manga gradually became more widely used, even if usually incorrectly, because it was a more inclusive, global term that included works produced by all English-speakers encompassing works originating in countries such as Canada, Australia, and United Kingdom as well as in the United States. Anime News Network columnist Carlo Santos made the first recorded use of the term on April 28, 2005 on his personal blog, and others began using it on forums and spreading the popularity of the phrase. By October 2005, publishing industry journal Publishers Weekly was also making use of the term, but manga publishers have yet to use it in official advertisements or press releases.\n\nHowever the original parent loan word, manga, is still used by publishers such as Tokyopop, Harper Collins, and various small presses as a blanket term for all of their bound graphic novels—without reference to origin or location of its creator(s). The significance of the word, however, has mutated outside Japan as a reference to comics originally published in Japan, regardless of style or language. Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines the word manga as meaning \"a Japanese comic or graphic novel\", reflecting the change of the meaning this word has had once used outside Japan.\n\nBecause the word \"manga\"—being a Japanese loanword in English use—means comics initially published in Japan, there have been attempts to find more appropriate terms for the growing number of publications of manga created by non-Japanese authors. Beside the term “OEL Manga”, there is also the term “manga-influenced comics” (MIC) in use. For example, Megatokyo, which was scheduled to be published by the largest manga producer Kodansha, is still referenced as a \"manga-influenced comic\".\n\nAnime and manga news site Anime News Network currently uses the term \"world manga\", coined by Jason DeAngelis of Seven Seas Entertainment, to describe these works in their column entitled Right-Turn Only. In May 2006, Tokyopop officially changed the name of their line of non-Japanese manga to \"global manga\", considering it a more respectful and accurate term than Amerimanga with its negative connotations of being a sub-par quality of work in comparison to Japanese manga; however, the Tokyopop books themselves, whether they come from Japan, Korea, or some other country, all say manga on them and are shelved in the manga section of the major bookstore chains such as Borders and Barnes & Noble alongside Japanese manga, Korean manhwa, Chinese manhua, French la nouvelle manga, and American graphic novels of similar size and dimensions. It is understood, however, that manga does not act as a loanword when used in the original Japanese language and therefore it only takes its original meaning of, simply, comics.\n\nBriefly before its closing, American manga publisher Studio Ironcat published a magazine series called \"AmeriManga\" from 2002–2003. A few of the titles in the compilation have since moved on to be published in other formats by other companies, most notably TOKYOPOP.\n\nOther similar magazines are still in publication today, including EigoManga's \"Sakura Pakk\" and \"RumblePakk\" titles; Purrsia Press's \"Mangatron\"; \"Mangazine\"; and \"Shōjo\". International magazines of the same type include Britain's \"MangaMover\" and \"Sweatdrop\"; the Australian publication \"Kiseki\"; and the Canadian magazine \"Kitsune\".\n\nTokyopop was formerly the world's largest publisher of manga-inspired comics written in the English language, and used to publish over two dozen titles. From 2002-2011, the company actively promoted new writers via its popular \"Rising Stars of Manga\" annual competition and collection. Several winners from the competition eventually published their own books under the Tokyopop imprint.\n\nIn a 2006 deal with HarperCollins, the company announced the expansion of its distribution and new adaptation projects based on American prose novels. It was indicated that Tokyopop plans to produce over 100 new comics over the next two years.\n\nKodansha is one of the largest publishers in Japan. Through International Manga Contests held bi-annually, the company seeks within the talent pool outside Japan. According to Eijiro Shimada, editor-in-chief of Morning Two and deputy editor-in-chief of Morning, some readers in Japan seek interest in manga produced in other parts of the world.\n\nIn May 2004, Kodansha formed a partnership with Del Rey Books called Del Rey Manga to publish many of their books in English in the United States. Some of the more popular titles published by Del Rey Manga include Negima! Magister Negi Magi by Ken Akamatsu and by Clamp.\n\nIn July 2007, Kodansha has announced that it will publish a Japanese language edition of Megatokyo in 2008. Furthermore, within September 2008, the company announced plans to expand publishing beyond Japan and into the United States via the Kodansha USA holding company.\n\nSeven Seas Entertainment has published many Original English-Language manga and manga-inspired webcomics, such as \"Amazing Agent Luna\", \"Aoi House\", and \"Hollow Fields\".\n\neigoMANGA publishes two Original English-Language manga anthology comic books and several graphic novel series. Sakura Pakk is a shōjo-based anthology graphic novel while Rumble Pak is their shōnen-based comic book series. eigoMANGA means \"English Comics\" in Japanese and they market themselves as OEL manga publishers.\n\nAntarctic Press most notedly publishes the extremely long-running Gold Digger and Ninja High School comic books, with heavy inspiration from manga in terms of art and high-paced imaginative action/humour storytelling style, but also hosts newer works like Neotopia. These are consistently collected into pocket-sized paperback format. Where the original comics appeared in color, Antarctic Press also publishes the collected manga in color as well.\n\nAccording to Lillian Diaz-Przybyl, an editor at Tokyopop, their best selling OEL manga sells about half as well as their best selling Japanese-origin manga.\n\nThe trade magazine \"ICv2 Guide to Manga\" lists the top 25 and top 50 best-selling manga based on sales data obtained from bookstores and comics shops across the United States. The table below shows those OEL manga that reached the top 25 or top 50 sales status in 2007 and 2008 with their sales ranks and ICv2 references. \"ICv2\"s editors write that titles not released during the time period shown tend to drop down or off the list, while titles released during the same time period tend to rise.\n\n"}

The fifth movement has been described as \"a mini-piano concerto, in the style of, but even more Hollywood-like than, Addinsell's \"Warsaw Concerto\" of 1941.\" This movement describes the attack on the Krasnaya Gorka fort outside St. Petersburg. Through mistranslation, the movement is sometimes known as \"The Attack on Beautiful Gorky\". The music historian Marina Frolova-Walker comments that \"it is indeed memorable music, although barely recognizable as Shostakovich and not even very appropriate to the on-screen action.\"\n\nThe film was made in praise of Joseph Stalin, who was portrayed (inaccurately) as having played a leading role in the events of the Russian Civil War around St. Petersburg in 1919. In February 1953 Shostakovich's score for the film was being considered for a Stalin Prize, but he sought to withdraw the nomination. In any event Stalin's death in March 1953 meant that the prize awards were cancelled. Shostakovich himself had a low estimate of the film: according to Solomon Volkov, he commented that Stalin \"liked watching \"Unforgettable 1919\", where he rides by on the footboard of an armoured train with a sabre in his hand. This fantastic picture, naturally, had nothing to do with reality\".\n\nThe suite prepared by Atovmyan was first recorded by Melodiya in 1956 (omitting the fifth and sixth sections), with Alexander Gauk as conductor.\n\n"}
