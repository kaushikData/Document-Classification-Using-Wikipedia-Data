{"id": "638452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=638452", "title": "Age of Empires II", "text": "Age of Empires II\n\nAge of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, it is the second game in the \"Age of Empires\" series. An expansion, \"\", was released in 2000.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" is set in the Middle Ages and contains thirteen playable civilizations. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional single-player game modes, and multiplayer is supported. Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor, development of \"The Age of Kings\" took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release \"\" in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in \"Age of Empires\", but noted on release that some problems remained.\n\nReception of \"The Age of Kings\" was highly positive. The significant number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay improvements. Some reviewers, however, were critical of the presentation of units—they were seen as bland and uninteresting—while others considered \"The Age of Kings\" to be too similar to its predecessor, \"Age of Empires\". Three months after its release, two million copies of \"The Age of Kings\" had been shipped, and it topped sales charts in seven countries. The game won multiple awards and is today considered a classic of its type, having had a significant impact on future games in its genre. Both the original \"Age of Empires II\" and the expansion pack were later released as \"The Gold Edition\".\n\nIn April 2013, \"Age of Empires II: HD Edition\" was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows operating systems. The \"HD Edition\" includes both the original game and the expansion \"The Conquerors\", as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays. It also supports user-generated content through the Steam Workshop and multiplayer games provided through the Steam servers. Three expansions have been released for the \"HD Edition\": \"\" in 2013, \"The African Kingdoms\" in 2015, and \"Rise of the Rajas\" in 2016.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" focuses on building towns, gathering resources, creating armies and ultimately conquering opponents by destroying their units and buildings. Players conquer rival towns and empires as they advance one of 13 civilizations through four \"Ages\": the Dark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle Age (being the High Middle Ages), and the Imperial Age, reminiscent of the Renaissance—a 1000-year timeframe. Advancing to a new Age unlocks new units, structures, and technologies, but players must first build certain buildings from their current age and then pay a sum of resources (typically food and gold).\n\nCivilian units, called \"villagers\", are used to gather resources; they are either male or female—gender does not affect their abilities. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things; for example, players can research better armour for infantry units. The game offers four types of resources: food, wood, gold, and stone. Food is obtained by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and shore fishing and fishing from boats. Wood is gathered by chopping down trees. Gold is obtained from either gold mines, trade or collecting relics in a monastery, and stone is collected from stone mines. Villagers require checkpoints, typically depository buildings (town center, mining camp, mill, and lumber yard), where they can store gathered resources.\n\nEach civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold is added to the stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.\n\nThere are five campaigns in \"The Age of Kings\", containing historically based scenarios such as Genghis Khan's invasion of Eurasia, Barbarossa's Crusade, or Saladin's defence of the Holy Land. In the Joan of Arc and William Wallace campaigns, the player can control a unit based on its namesake; in others, players take orders from guiding spirits representative of the army's commander.\n\nAdditional game modes are available to the player in \"The Age of Kings\". One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for a certain amount of time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.\n\nEvery player has a limit to the number of units they can create—a population limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 and 200 in intervals of 25, is based on the number of houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. \"The Age of Kings\" introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" also includes five types of military units: infantry, archers, cavalry, siege weaponry, and naval units. Certain types of infantry, archers, and cavalry are \"counter units\" with special defenses against other types of units. The three human classes of military generally follow a rock-paper-scissors model. For example, infantry are generally powerful against buildings but weak against cavalry, thus the infantry counter units—spearmen and pikemen—have attack bonuses against cavalry.\n\nEach Civilization in \"The Age of Kings\" has one or two special units that are exclusive to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics. Relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all the relics in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.\n\nPlayers choose to play as one of 13 civilizations split into four architectural styles—Western European, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and East Asian—that determine building appearance in-game. The civilizations have varying strengths and weaknesses with regards to economics, technology, and battle, and each has access to one or more different, very powerful \"Unique Units\". Additionally, each civilization provides an individual team bonus in team games. To add variety, each civilization has a set of sound bites in its native language that are uttered by units when selected or instructed to perform a task.\n\nThe buildings in \"The Age of Kings\" are split into the economic and military buildings categories. Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic, military or unit-based efficiency, as well as provide resources for the player.\n\nThe most important economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, all types of resources can be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.\n\nMilitary buildings include unit-producing buildings such as barracks, archery ranges, stables, and castles, as well as defensive buildings such as walls and towers. Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other attributes. Castles are a key offensive and defensive building as they can build trebuchets, train the civilization's \"unique unit/s\", and fire a hail of arrows at enemy units within range, with garrisoned units firing extra arrows. Castles can only be built after a player has reached the Castle Age, although in some game options, players begin with an already-built castle as early as the Dark Age.\n\nAfter advancing to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building a Wonder triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's Wonder is in the shape of a landmark unique to that historical culture—the Temple of Heaven for the Chinese, for example, or Notre Dame for the Franks.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" originally shipped with five extensive campaigns: William Wallace (Celts), Joan of Arc (Franks), Saladin (Saracens), Genghis Khan (Mongols) and Barbarossa (Teutons). The campaigns are sorted numerically to distinguish difficulty—The William Wallace Campaign being the easiest, and Barbarossa being the most challenging.\n\nWilliam Wallace\n\nThe Campaign of William Wallace acts as a tutorial campaign, much like the original \"Age of Empires\" game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which in this Campaign is presented as the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander Edward Longshanks.\n\nJoan of Arc\n\nJoan of Arc puts the player in command of the battered, bloodied and demoralised French during the Hundred Years War against England. At the beginning of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—Joan of Arc intends to save France by the command of God. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the Siege of Orleans earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned Dauphin Charles VII by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan of Arc. At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the Loire Campaign where the entire English and Burgundian forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan of Arc.\n\nHowever, the crowned Charles VII's advisors convince the King not to send the promised reinforcements to Joan at the pivotal Siege of Paris. Joan of Arc retreats to the Castle at Compiègne where the English and Burgundian troops lay siege. Trapped outside the safety of the Castle, Joan is captured by the Burgundians, trailed by the English as a heretic, and burned at the stake. The final campaign mission, the Battle of Castillon, has one of Joan's most trusted Lieutenants muster a huge force of vengeful French troops, and utterly destroy the English and Burgundian forces around and in Castillon, ending the Hundred Years' War and expelling the English from France, spare Calais.\n\nSaladin\n\nThis campaign takes places years after the events that led to the First Crusade and capture of Jerusalem. Saladin (who the player acts as throughout this campaign) is first tasked with establishing himself in Egypt and removing the Crusaders there, in order to become Sultan of Egypt. A villainous Crusader by the name of Reynald de Chatillon has continuously violated the fragile peace between the Crusaders and the Saracens, causing great concern to Saladin. Raids by Crusaders in the Red Sea are eventually suppressed by the Saracens. At the Battle of Hattin, the Saracens win a decisive victory over the combined strength of the Knights Templar, Knights Hospitallers, Jerusalem and the English Crusaders, capture Reynold de Chatillon (who is the only prisoner executed by Saladin personally) and obtain a piece of the True Cross as an important relic.\n\nWith the strength of the Crusaders now heavily reduced since Hattin, Saladin launches the Siege of Jerusalem to free it from Crusader control. However, the Saracens must take great care not to destroy the Monasteries within the holy city, and must also deal with Templar and Hospitaller encampments that flank the city. The Siege is successful, the Holy Land now once again in Saracen control, spare the Crusader states of Tiberias, Tyre and Ascalon, but are subsequently captured by Saladin. When the Pope is informed of the Crusader defeat in the Middle East, the Third Crusade is launched, threatening to undo Saladin's conquest. The final mission tasks the player with defending a heavily fortified Citadel from constant Crusader attacks, most notably King Richard of England, as well as constructing the Great Mosque of Samarra, the unique Wonder building available to the Saracens in game.\n\nGenghis Khan\n\nThe Genghis Khan concentrates on the rise of the divided, constantly warring tribes of Mongolia into the mighty, fearsome Mongol Empire. Early missions of the campaign concentrate on uniting the several steppe tribes whilst also dealing with the 'Kara-Khitai', sworn enemies of Genghis Khan. With the other tribes either united or destroyed, Genghis now sets his eyes on world domination. The vast riches of the Khwaremia domain in Persia would be the obvious choice, but despite a pledge of support to the Mongols, the technologically superior Chinese Kingdoms have refused, thereby setting another example where Genghis directs his next campaign. With the entirety of China now under Mongolian rule, the Mongol horde now has the technology capable of knocking down the fortifications of Persia, and beyond.\n\nThe following conquests of Khwarezmia and the Russian Principalities, the latter by Subutai leaves Europe as the last continent yet to be conquered. However, Genghis Khan who is now 80 years old, dies before the conquest can be complete. His son, Ogatai, promises to continue the war, marking Poland as the first target. The Mongols, using numerical superiority alone, are able to defeat the mounted Knights of Poland, Bohemia as well as the several German Duchies that rally to Poland's support. The final mission of the Genghis Khan campaign focuses on Pax Mongolica, the term used to describe the height of power enjoyed by the Mongolian Empire. The last major power in Eastern Europe, Hungary, is all that stands in the way of Mongolia's further incursions into Europe.\n\nBarbarossa\n\nThis campaign focuses on the expansion of the Holy Roman Empire by integrating the squabbling German duchies under the rule of Frederick Barbarossa, the first Holy Roman Emperor. The first campaign missions sees the player establishing Barbarossa's dominance over the Central European powers of Austria, Saxony, Bavaria, Bohemia, and Burgundy, as well as Swabia by collecting relics. Although having established dominance, Barbarossa still finds rivals to challenge his Empire's power in the form of Poland, as well as Henry the Lion, a respected ally of Barbarossa. Henry is spared his life and titles as long as he promises to fully declare allegiance to Barbarossa.\n\nWith Central Europe now under the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his attention to Italy, namely Milan and the Pope. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged the power of the Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him. Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into exile whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The Third Crusade begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile Constantinople and Anatolia, which is crawling with Seljuk Turks. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by the weight of his armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfill his wishes.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" supports multiplayer over the Internet, or via a local area network (LAN). Up to eight players can take part in one game, with all of the single player game modes available. The MSN Gaming Zone supported the game until the service closed on June 19, 2006. After that, various multiplayer gaming services such as GameRanger support it. Since April 2013, Steam supports in-game multiplayer for HD resolution requiring an internet connection.\n\nPrior to the completion of \"Age of Empires\", Ensemble Studios had signed a contract with Microsoft for a sequel. The design team chose to set \"The Age of Kings\" in the Middle Ages as a logical progression from the ancient era setting of \"Age of Empires\". The design team was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game's design too similar. Nonetheless, they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played \"Age of Empires\". \"The Age of Kings\"s design team intended to complete the game within a year by using code from the original and reusing the Genie game engine. Several months into the process they found they would not be able to complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created \"\", an easily developed expansion pack of \"Age of Empires\", as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998. To help meet the next year's deadline, additional programmers, artists, and designers were employed. To overcome another significant objection to \"Age of Empires\"—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the game engine's movement system.\n\nThe original \"Age of Empires\" had been criticized for its artificial intelligence (AI). Because the original AI did not \"cheat\" by attributing itself extra resources or using other techniques the human player could not, it was easier to defeat than in many other real-time strategy games. For \"The Age of Kings\", Ensemble Studios attempted to develop a more powerful AI system that did not compromise by cheating. Industry veteran Mario Grimani led Ensemble Studios in the creation of the new system. \"The Age of Kings\" saw the introduction of a triggers system for its scenario editor. The triggers allow messages to be displayed, or actions to take place, based on pre-set criteria or \"events\". The scenario editor was also improved by the new AI system. The AI and trigger systems interacted regularly in the single player campaigns.\n\nThe team was less successful in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following the release of \"Age of Empires\" that there was still no process by which patches could be issued. Extensive cheating in multiplayer games of \"Age of Empires\" came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for \"The Age of Kings\". On release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.\n\nEnsemble Studios developed a new terrain system for \"The Age of Kings\", with 3D presentation capabilities that were vastly superior to those of \"Age of Empires\". Pritchard noted an improvement in the team's artistic abilities following their work on the past two games, and he is noted as saying that \"\"AoK\" became a showcase for their improved talent\". However, he complained about the lack of an art asset management tool, while other departments gained new tools and automated procedures to assist in design and play testing.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"The Age of Kings\" was directed by Stephen Rippy, who has since taken that role for all games in the \"Age of Empires\" series. Music for the game was split into two categories. For \"in game\" music, Rippy's team took musical elements from a variety of cultures and combined them to create a mixed sound. \"Pre-game\" music was designed to be unique to the civilization in question. Campaigns based on historical figures would include \"a theme that will at least be rooted in [the character's] culture\".\n\nA demo of \"The Age of Kings\" was released on October 16, 1999. It featured the learning campaign, a sample of a random map game, and the ability to play via the MSN Gaming Zone. Much to Ensemble Studios' disappointment, numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked. These were picked up by warez sites, and sold illegally throughout the Pacific Rim; warez versions of the game were even sold outside Microsoft's offices in South Korea.\n\nIn 2012, Hidden Path Entertainment began working on a high-definition remake of \"Age of Empires II\", an effort spearheaded by Matt Pritchard, an original Ensemble lead programmer. On March 7, 2013, its release was announced, branded as \"Age of Empires II: HD Edition\". It has improved graphics, widescreen support and new multiplayer options through Steam. It was released on April 9, 2013, and there was a pre-order available on April 5.\n\nOn August 21, 2017 at Gamescom, Microsoft announced a remaster titled \"Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition\" is in development.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" received \"universal acclaim\", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nAccording to Eurogamer's Geoff Richards, \"the list of new features and improvements over the original game is over a page long\". \"GamePro\"s review similarly focused on \"new additions to the genre itself\" which it argued made \"The Age of Kings\" outstanding. These included the idle unit button and town bell. GameSpy's Carlos Salgado was appreciative of other features; he praised the ability to create individual profiles for different players and to customize hotkeys. Meanwhile, IGN appreciated the new abilities given to the villager unit—the review stated villagers \"now play an important role not only in the collection of resources, but also in town defense and even in combat.\"\n\nAllGame's Michael L. House enjoyed the use of sound bites in civilizations' native languages, which he said was \"very influential in developing an era-enhancing atmosphere\". Eurogamer said this feature \"gives [villagers] a personality, rather than the standard 'Acknowledged' grunt of military RTS games\", also stating that the use of female villagers provided a good variety. Game Revolution's review explained that by being set in a more recent epoch of human history, \"The Age of Kings\" was able to \"add character to an otherwise impersonal style of gameplay\". \"Computer and Video Games\" approved of \"The Age of Kings\" use of shorter, more focused campaigns, compared to its predecessor, while Game Revolution noted that even in slower sections of the campaign, the historical narrative helped maintain player interest. GameSpot said that with the screen full of units, \"you can begin to imagine how their historical equivalents once prospered\", while GameSpy said \"The Age of Kings\" presents \"realism rarely seen in the RTS genre\". IGN staff argued that while the strengths and weaknesses attributed to different civilizations made the game more realistic, the fact that they were still mostly the same prevented \"The Age of Kings\" from \"delivering the same battlefield impact of \"StarCraft\" or \"\"\".\n\nHouse also praised the gameplay interface, which he said \"couldn't be simpler\", as well as the advanced grouping and path-finding systems. Nash Werner of \"GamePro\" said that the formation tools were wonderful, and complained only that they could not be assigned to naval units. \"Computer and Video Games\" generally agreed, stating that \"the controls are very user-friendly and well explained\". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin wrote that despite the game's improved graphics, \"there's nothing foreign about its appearance\" and that most game features will be \"immediately recognizable if you've played a real-time strategy game before\". \"PC Zone\" agreed, but in a negative sense—it argued that \"The Age of Kings\" \"is essentially an update of a two-year-old game\".\n\nRichards was surprised by the quality of \"The Age of Kings\" graphics, considering they were all bitmapped. However, AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. It also called the sound of \"The Age of Kings\" as a negative, but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game's overall quality. IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland, but that overall the graphics added \"an amazing amount of detail to the actual game\". IGN's main criticism was for the in-game speech used in campaigns; it rhetorically asked \"why can't they just find a Frenchman to do a French accent?\" Alex Constantides of \"Computer and Video Games\" rated the graphics highly, saying that some in-game buildings are \"so grand you'll even feel guilty about burning them to the ground\". Werner agreed; \"the most noticeable graphical advancements\", he wrote, were \"the sheer size and scale of things\". Game Revolution stated \"\"AOE2\" is the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now\".\n\nIn January 2000, three months after its release, Microsoft announced that they had shipped two million copies of \"The Age of Kings\". The game topped sales charts in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, and South Korea. It would spend the next two and a half years on top 20 sales lists. \"The Age of Kings\" was top selling game in October 1999, and the fourth highest selling game in 1999. In North America, it sold 442,318 units and earned $19.56 million from January through October 2000, according to PC Data. It received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" won GameSpot's Strategy Game of the Year in 1999, and was a nominee for Game of the Year. GamePower also named it Strategy Game of the Year, while \"PC Gamer\" and \"Computer Gaming World\" gave it Editor's Choice awards. The editors of \"PC Gamer US\" named it their 1999 \"Best Real-Time Strategy Game\", and wrote that it \"takes everything we know about the real-time strategy genre and polishes it, and polishes it, and then polishes it some more.\" \"The Age of Kings\" won Strategy Game of the Year and Computer Game of the Year at the 2000 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards. It was also nominated for Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering. IGN ranked \"The Age of Kings\" the 53rd best game of all time in 2005, and the 10th best PC game of all time in 2007. GameFAQs users placed it 56th in a poll of the best games ever.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" was highly influential on its genre. \"\", a 2001 game by LucasArts, shared \"The Age of Kings\" game engine, and was heavily influenced by its mechanics. \"Empire Earth\"s design was also similar to that of \"The Age of Kings\"; GameSpot said it \"borrows most of that game's controls, interface features, and even some of its keyboard shortcuts\". Rick Goodman, designer of \"Age of Empires\" and \"The Rise of Rome\", designed \"Empire Earth\". GameSpot's Scott Osborne argued that the gameplay of \"\" was heavily based on \"The Age of Kings\".\n\n\"Age of Empires II: HD Edition\" received mixed reviews with aggregate review website Metacritic assigning a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics. Critics agreed that the \"HD Edition\" changed very little from the original game. Daniel Starkey of Destructoid added that the reluctance to change the game features encourages \"a much more aggressive, and obsessive style of play\". He highlights the fact that many of the problems of trying to run the original game on a modern computer are gone, and calls its compatibility with Steam's Workshop \"an amazing bonus\".\n\nPaul Dean of Eurogamer was less forgiving; although he agreed that the Workshop compatibility was a good addition and praised the players in the online community as \"remarkably calm and friendly\", he thought that the game should have been updated more, citing its \"boring campaign\" and poorly-aged gameplay mechanics: \"It just doesn't play very well, and its flaws are more blatant than ever before\". Underscoring his criticisms of the lack of significant changes to the game, he described it as \"a mouldy time-capsule that will likely mar your memories of the original\".\n\nA PlayStation 2 port was released by Konami in 2001, and a NDS spinoff, \"\" was released in 2006.\n\nAn expansion for \"The Age of Kings\", \"\", was released in 2000. It introduced numerous new game features, including unique technologies for each civilization, and five new civilizations. Two of these, the Aztecs and the Mayans, represent the New World and have new distinctive architectural style. Other new civilizations are the Spanish, Huns, and Koreans.\n\nThe third historical game in the series, \"Age of Empires III\", was released in 2005. The game portrayed the European colonization of the Americas. Aside from one significant feature, the home city, the game's design was similar to that of its predecessor.\n\nThe multiplayer-only \"Age of Empires Online\" was released in 2012. While the game was freely accessible, it featured premium content which could either be earned through gameplay or purchased, enabling the player to use higher-tier equipment and new game modes. Active development of the game ended on January 1, 2014, when executive producer Kevin Perry stated that adding new content was \"no longer cost effective,\" and announced that the game would be moving from \"development phase\" to its \"support phase\". The game servers were subsequently shut down on July 1, 2014.\n\nIn August 2013 an expansion pack was announced for \"Age of Empires II HD\", entitled \"The Forgotten\". It is based on the fan-made expansion, \"The Forgotten Empires\". \"The Forgotten\" introduces five new civilizations: the Italians, Indians, Slavs, Magyars, and the Incas. It includes new maps, campaigns, units, a new game mode, an increase of population limit from 200 to 500 and numerous balance and gameplay adjustments.\n\nA second expansion pack for \"Age of Empires II HD\" was announced on April 9, 2015, and released on November 5. \"The African Kingdoms\" introduces four new civilizations: the Berbers, Ethiopians, Malians, and the Portuguese. It includes new maps, campaigns (Sundjata, Francisco de Almeida, Yodit, and Tariq ibn Ziyad), and units, a new game mode, and numerous balance and gameplay adjustments.\n\n\"Rise of the Rajas\" was released December 19, 2016. It is set in Southeast Asia, and adds four civilizations (Burmese, Malay, Khmer, and Vietnamese; each with its own fully voice-acted campaign: Bayinnaung, Suryavarman I, Gajah Mada, and Lê Lợi) as well as a new map type with environments, units, improved AI and more.\n\nGajah Mada\n\nThe campaign starts with a mission explaining the origins of the Majapahit Empire, wherein Raden Wijaya leads the Javanese to victory against the Mongols, the Singhasari, and the Kediri. Gajah Mada proper then appears on the scene to rescue King Jayanegara from the city of Trowulan, which is surrounded by rebels. However, Jayanegara is dissolute and is soon assassinated. His sister, Tribhuwana, takes power and appoints Gajah Mada as her prime minister. Gajah Mada then swears his famous Sumpah Palapa oath to unify Nusantara, whereupon he will not eat any food containing spices until the whole Indonesian archipelago is unified. The Majapahit empire then proceeds to expand settlements to the islands of Bali, Sulawesi, and Borneo, and has conflicts with the Sunda, Dhamasraya, and Temasek. The queen regent then abdicates to let her now-matured son, Hayam Wuruk, ascend the throne, and the Majapahit Empire then expands to the east by destroying the Docks of Makassar, Kutai, and Luwu. The sole group which remains are the Sunda, and Gajah Mada manipulates them into a trap by arranging for a marriage between his king and a Sunda princess. Whereas the Sunda believe that the marriage will result in an alliance, Gajah Mada has written into the contract that via the marriage, the Sunda will submit to Majapahit rule, unbeknownst to Hayam Wuruk. The result is the Pasunda Bubat Massacre, wherein all the Sunda princes are killed and Hayam Wuruk's bride commits suicide out of grief. Gajah Mada is then summoned to the king and exiled for his actions.\n\nSuryavarman I\n\nSuryavarman starts by launching a campaign against and killing King Udayadityavarman I in the city of Angkor. Following the successful crushing of a rebellion led by Jayaviravarman, who is killed in the battle, Suryavarman sends an envoy through hostile territory to the Chola, offering lavish gifts in exchange for an alliance against the Tambralinga. The Chola and Khmer then launch a two-pronged attack against the Tambralinga and the thalassocracy of Srivijaya. After defeating these two powers, Suryavarman then deals with domestic threats from the Dai Viet, Cham, Indrapura, and Lavo, which have sought to take advantage of the king's distraction with foreign conquests.\n\nBayinnaung\n\n1538 AD: Bayinnaung starts out as the loyal follower of King Tabinshweti. Together, they march against the Hanthawaddy who harbor the Mon king, Takayupti, and capture the city of Prome, in spite of the raids led by the Shan. 1543 AD: At this time, Bayinnaung assists the king in the conquest of Ava by the killing of its king, Hkonmaing, and fending off opposition by the Shan and the Rakhine. They must amass a sufficient sum of gold in order for Tabinshweti to be crowned in the religious city of Pagan. 1550 AD: Tabinshweti encounters a Portuguese merchant who leads him into alcoholic habits, leading to Bayinnaung acquiring increased authority as first minister. Tabinshweti is ultimately killed on orders of Smim Sawhtut, and Bayinnaung must avenge his death by putting down the rebellions led by the possible pretenders, including Smim Sawhtut in his stronghold of Pegu, Rakkate, Thado Dhamma Yaza, and Smim Htaw. 1563 AD: Bayinnaung, now Cakkavati and King of the Toungoo Empire, seeks to expand eastward by bringing relics to the neighboring kingdoms to show his devotion. He faces the Ayutthaya, led by King Chakkraphat, Bayinnaung's vassal Lan Na, and Lan Xang along the way, in addition to various nats. 1580 AD: Bayinnaung ends the campaign by entering into a meditative state as his sons Nanda and Thinga Dathta lead the conquest of the Rakhine city of Mrauk U, and lead him to the four Buddhist temples in the region.\n\nLê Lợi\n\nLê Lợi is the leader of an uprising against the Ming Empire. The campaign starts in 1418, where Lê Lợi is leading a guerrilla band in destroying all the Ming towers in the Vietnamese villages, with the help of the Trịnh and Nguyễn families. He then defends a fort in Chí Linh with the help of Lê Lai, who disguises himself as Lê Lợi and sallies forth to lead a suicidal frontal assault upon the enemy, giving his life so that Lê Lợi and his troops can escape, once they have destroyed the towers to the east. Lê Lợi then advances upon Hanoi and succeeds in capturing the city. Afterwards, he marches towards the Ming capital of Nghệ An, but finds himself on the way there obliged to deal with a fortress garrisoned by Cam Banh, a vassal of the Chinese. The Chinese send in their veteran general, Wang Tong, to relieve the fortress, but he is too late to stop Lê Lợi from capturing it. Lê Lợi then splits his forces into three groups: Dinh De to lead the cavalry upon Đông Đô to keep Wang Tong occupied, Le Trien to move north to intercept the Chinese reinforcements under Liu Sheng, and Luu Nhan Chu and Bui Bi to Nghệ An. Miraculously, this triple plan works, prompting the Ming to accept a peace deal. However, the local Vietnamese vassals of the Ming will not accept this, prompting a final showdown with Wang Tong. Peace is finally concluded, and Dai Viet is allowed to exist as a tributary state of the Ming.\n"}

{"id": "29568421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29568421", "title": "Day of Dialogue", "text": "Day of Dialogue\n\nIn the United States of America, the Day of Dialogue is an annual student-focused event that challenges homosexuality. Its organizer, the Christian conservative group Focus on the Family, describes it as creating \"a safe place for public school students to exercise their religious freedoms and express their deeply held Christian beliefs in a loving and respectful manner.\" It was previously known as the Day of Truth and was founded by the Alliance Defense Fund in 2005 in opposition to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network's Day of Silence which protests the harassment of LGBT students.\n\nThe \"Day of Truth\" event was first organized in 2005, primarily through the efforts of the Alliance Defense Fund, with the endorsement of several major conservative and anti-LGBT organizations, including the Christian ministry group Focus on the Family and the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. According to the Alliance Defense Fund, the event was established in order to \"counter the promotion of the homosexual agenda and express an opposing viewpoint from a Christian perspective.\" In 2009 the ADF-sponsored \"Day of Truth\" website stated that the event gave students \"an opportunity to speak the Truth in love and have an honest conversation about homosexuality\", and encouraged participating students to wear T-shirts and pass out cards with the following message:\"I'm speaking the Truth to break the silence. True tolerance means that people with differing — even opposing — viewpoints can freely exchange ideas and respectfully listen to each other. It's time for an honest conversation about homosexuality. There's freedom to change if you want to. Let’s talk.\"\nADF claims that students who have attempted to speak against same-sex relationships and behavior have been censored or, in some cases, punished for their actions under campus hate-speech rules, such as Tyler Chase Harper, a high school student whose bigotry sparked the first Day of Truth. Harper was suspended for wearing a T-shirt that read \"Be Ashamed\" and \"Our School Embraced What God Has Condemned,\" and on the back read, \"Homosexuality is Shameful\" and \"Romans 1:27.\" The Alliance Defense Fund filed an unsuccessful federal lawsuit against school officials on behalf of Harper, claiming his religious freedoms were violated. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that the case was moot because Harper had already graduated, declined to further consider it, and ordered the lower court to vacate their decision against Harper, leaving future matters open for litigation as though the previous trial had never occurred.\nAccording to ADF, over 1,100 students in 350 schools participated in the first Day of Truth, in 2005. \nThe second Day of Truth was held on April 27, 2006, with nearly 3,000 students from more than 800 schools participating, according to ADF statistics. In February, ADF alleged that various unnamed bloggers opposed to the Day of Truth had attempted to undermine the event by swamping the Day of Truth web site with requests for brochures. \n\nAccording to ADF, more than 7,000 students participated in the third Day of Truth, which was held on April 19, 2007. \nIn one of several Day of Truth-related legal actions, ADF filed a federal lawsuit in 2006 on behalf of a student who they claim was prevented by his school from participating in the event, despite allowing the Day of Silence. ADF reached a settlement with the student's North Carolina high school in 2007, allowing the student to participate in Day of Truth.\n\nKevin Jennings of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) has described the event as \"a publicity stunt cooked up by a conservative organization with a political agenda; it’s an effort by adults to manipulate some kids.\" In response, Mike Johnson of ADF contends that “We wouldn’t have come up with the Day of Truth if Christian kids hadn’t been silenced in the first place. . . . The public school is part of the free market of ideas — if the other side is going to advance their point of view, it’s only fair for the Christian perspective to present their view, too.\"\n\nADF announced that beginning in 2009, it passed on its leadership role in the Day of Truth to an ex-gay organization, Exodus International, which had already participated in running the event. On October 6, 2010, Exodus International said it would no longer be supporting or leading the Day of Truth since it had become too divisive and confrontational.\n\nOn November 6, 2010, Focus on the Family announced it had acquired the Day of Truth event and was renaming it to the Day of Dialogue. Focus on the Family said it would maintain the event's goal of \"encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about God's design for sexuality.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1580252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1580252", "title": "Direct response television", "text": "Direct response television\n\nDirect response television (DRTV) is any television advertising that asks consumers to respond directly to the company — usually either by calling an toll-free telephone number, sending an SMS message, or by visiting a web site. This is a form of direct response marketing.\n\nThere are two types of direct response television, short form, and long form. Short form is any DRTV commercial that is two minutes or less in length. Long form direct response is any television commercial longer than two minutes. This was the accepted term for an infomercial from 1984 until \"infomercial\" came into vogue in 1988. The most common time period available for purchase as \"long form\" infomercial media is 28 minutes, 30 seconds in length. Long form is used for products that need to educate the consumer to create awareness and typically have a higher price. A relatively small amount or media time may be purchased in lengths less than 30 minutes but more than 2 minutes. Five minutes is the most commonly available time of these lengths.\n\nDirect response television campaigns are commonly managed by specialist Direct Response or DRTV agencies with a full range of strategic, creative, production, media, and campaign services. They may also be managed by media buying agencies who specialize in direct response. In either case, these agencies purchase two types of air-time in two ways. The first is to purchase off of a station or broadcast network's rate-card for time. The second is to purchase remnant airtime, which is time that stations were not able to sell, and need to fill quickly or cheaply to avoid broadcasting dead-air. This is cheaper for agencies, but they have less control over when their commercials will run. As DRTV has gained presence outside of its start in the United States, local agencies have developed in many countries.\n\nTo qualify as DRTV, the advertising must ask the consumer to contact the advertiser directly by phone, by text message, or via the web. In the early days of DRTV, this was nearly always to purchase the product. Over time, a wide range of consumer actions have become used. And, many consumers watch the advertising but choose to purchase at retail without ever contacting the company. Typically for every unit sold on TV, anywhere from 3 to as high as 15 units might be sold at retail depending on retail distribution.\n\nWhen it first appeared, DRTV was used to market goods and services directly from the manufacturer or wholesaler to the consumer, bypassing retail. Over time, it has also become used as a more general advertising medium and is now used by a wide range of companies --- often to support retail distribution. Non-profit organizations also benefit from DRTV by making a direct appeal to viewers to make a donation.\n\nMany types of companies use DRTV. Marketing companies who specialize in DRTV continue to use the format to offer product exclusively sold through TV. Many of these items find their way to retail shelves once their television campaign has ended or has matured. For example, the Dirt Devil Broom Vac was only available on TV for three months before retail launch. Mass merchant retailers often have \"as seen on TV\" sections in their stores.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, many brand manufacturers began to use DRTV as a part of their advertising mix. In these cases, most products featured on DRTV are also available at retail. The DRTV campaigns ask for direct consumer action either to purchase the product or to obtain a coupon which they can use at the retail store. Companies who have used DRTV for these purposes include DuPont (Teflon), Hamilton-Beach, Space Bag, Rubbermaid, P&G, Toyota, Philips Consumer Electronics, Bissell, Evinrude, and Sears (Craftsman brand).\n\nDRTV has also become a commonly used advertising medium for insurance companies, mortgage companies, cell phone providers, credit card companies, and a host of other services. Companies using this approach include Blue Shield, AAA Insurance (CSAA), Bank of America, Citibank Credit Cards, DirecTV, Dish Network, and many more.\n\nLead generation has become a large segment of many DRTV campaigns. Typically these campaigns collect leads and close the sale at a later date via direct mail, email, or phone specialists. Other uses of DRTV include branding via hybrid campaigns, whereas you create awareness of the product and drive retail sales with no firm response goal. This is sometimes called Brand Response TV, (BRTV).\n\nThere are numerous DRTV advertising agencies that specialize in short form and long form direct response advertising.\n\n•Atomic Direct is a DRTV specialist which has pioneered campaigns which maximize the combination of direct and retail sales driven by DRTV and created campaigns for Kobalt Tools (Lowe's), AAA of California, Rubbermaid, the Mission Towel, and DuPont. Atomic has extensive experience in the categories of home, hardware, and automotive.\n\n•Media Reactions is a DRTV specialist focusing on media-buying for non-profit organizations. It augments traditional ad agency's abilities by adding tracking metrics that integrate web and call-center data with FCC run-times to determine which ads are responsible for producing results over which response channel. Success stories include the Wounded Warrior Project\n\n•212 Degrees Fahrenheit - A full service DRTV advertising agency that has created campaigns for MetLife, Trikke, BuyBelize.com, USAA Insurance, Experian, Travelocity, and AIG\n\n•Canella Response - A media buying agency responsible for such DRTV success stories as CarMd, Hip Hop Abs, Jillian Michaels Body Revolution and Topsy Turvy.\n\n•Eicoff - Eicoff is a large, prominent DRTV agency that has created campaigns for Lumber Liquidators, Tommie Copper, Quicken Loans and 800-Pet-Meds.\n\n• - Crescendo is a full service Direct Response advertising agency that has created highly successful DRTV campaigns for large and emerging brands such as Covidien/Medtronic (Barrx Procedure), AARP, Kelly Moore Paints, HearUSA , Accuray CyberKnife and many more.\n\n• Icon Media Direct - Founded by direct response industry veteran, Nancy Lazkani, Icon Media Direct is one of the Top Women-Owned businesses in Greater Los Angeles, ranking #1 among ad agencies. Icon Media Direct manages campaigns for top brands in their categories like OxiClean, Proactiv, Nutrisystem, zulily and more.\n\n•Lockard & Wechsler Direct is a full-service, fully integrated direct marketing agency with over $450 million in annual billings and a wide range of satisfied clients. The agency was founded in 1967 by *** Wechsler\n\n•The DRTV Centre (Direct Response Television Centre) is one of the leading UK advertising agencies specialising in direct response television. The company writes and produces DRTV scripts and purchases TV airtime on the many hundreds of UK commercial TV channels.\n\n\nSeveral award programs recognize excellence in DRTV advertising. Awards are sponsored by the Electronic Retailing Association (ERA) who honor both short-form and long-form DRTV advertising at their annual Moxie Awards Gala in conjunction with the ERA D2C Convention. Annually the Jordan-Whitney Greensheet offers a range of DRTV recognition awards. And even general advertising and production award shows, like the Telly's, WorldFest and Davey's, include categories for long form TV Infomercial and DRTV work. For short-form television direct marketing, the DMA (Direct Marketing Association) recognizes program excellence via the A. Eicoff Broadcast Innovation Award, named for DRTV pioneer and DMA Hall of fame member, Alvin Eicoff.\n\nMany advertisements during the Super Bowl have been DRTV ads and encouraged direct response via websites and 800 numbers. These include ads for web services ranging from Cars.Com to Pets.com and Monster.com. The eTrade advertisement shown during the 2008 Super Bowl featured both an 800 number and a website for response In 2000, Netpliance aired a 30-second advertisement driving phone calls to 1-800-iopener or Netpliance.com in Super Bowl XXXIV. Anticipating high response they obtained additional web hosting services in order to support direct response web traffic from the advertisement. During the 2009 Super Bowl XLIII, Cash 4 Gold ran a national advertisement during the Super Bowl. This was erroneously reported to be the first DRTV ad in Super Bowl history.\n\n"}
{"id": "1224756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1224756", "title": "Dolphinarium", "text": "Dolphinarium\n\nA dolphinarium is an aquarium for dolphins. The dolphins are usually kept in a large pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.\n\nWhile cetaceans have been held in captivity since the 1860s, the first commercial dolphinarium was opened only in 1938. Their popularity increased rapidly until the 1960s. Since the 1970s, increasing concern for animal welfare led to stricter regulation, which in several countries ultimately resulted in the closure of some dolphinariums. Despite this trend, dolphinariums are still widespread in Europe, Japan and North America.\n\nThe most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the bottlenose dolphin, as it is relatively easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity. While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries. Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades, many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse.\n\nThough cetaceans have been held in captivity in both North America and Europe since the by 1860—Boston Aquarial Gardens in 1859 and pairs of Beluga Whales in Barnum's American Museum in New York City museum— dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in 1938 in St. Augustine, Florida. It was here that it was discovered that dolphins could be trained to perform tricks. Recognizing the success of Marine Studios, more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment. In the 1960s, keeping dolphins in zoos and aquariums for entertainment purposes increased in popularity after the 1963 \"Flipper\" movie and subsequent \"Flipper\" television series. In 1966, the first dolphin was exported to Europe. In these early days, dolphinariums could grow quickly due to a lack of legislation and lack of concern for animal welfare.\n\nNew legislation, most notably the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States, combined with a more critical view on animal welfare, forced many dolphinariums around the world to close. A prominent example is the United Kingdom; in the early 1970s there were at least 36 dolphinariums and traveling dolphin shows, however, the last dolphinarium closed its doors in 1993. The last dolphinarium in Hungary was closed in 1992. In 2005 both Chile and Costa Rica prohibited keeping cetaceans captive. However, around 60 dolphinariums currently exist across Europe, of which 34 are within the EU. Japan, Mexico and the United States are also home to a relatively large number of dolphinariums.\n\nMany varied designs exist, but basic dolphinarium design for public performances often consists of stands for the public around a semi-circular pool, sometimes with glass walls which allow underwater viewing, and a platform in the middle from which the trainers direct and present the show.\n\nThe water in the pools has to be constantly filtered to keep it clean for the dolphins and the spectators, and the temperature and composition of the water has to be controlled to match the conditions dolphins experience in the wild. In the absence of a common international regulation, guidelines regarding the minimum size of the pools vary between countries. To give an indication of pool sizes, the \"European Association for Aquatic Mammals\" recommends that a pool for five dolphins should have a surface area of plus an additional for every additional animal, have a depth of and have a water volume of at least with an additional for every additional animal. If two of these three conditions are met, and the third is not more than 10% below standard, the EAAM considers the pool size to be acceptable.\n\nVarious species of dolphins are kept in captivity as well as several other small whale species such as Harbour Porpoises, Finless Porpoises and Belugas, though in those cases the word dolphinarium may not be fitting as these are not true dolphins. Bottlenose Dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Orcas are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of Orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 captive orcas being held in aquaria as of 2012. Of all Orcas kept in captivity, the majority are located in the various SeaWorld parks in the United States. Other species kept in captivity are Spotted Dolphins, False Killer Whales, Pilot Whales and Common Dolphins, Commerson's Dolphins, as well as Rough-toothed Dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the Bottlenose Dolphin. There are also fewer than ten Amazon River Dolphins, Risso's Dolphins, or Tucuxi in captivity. There are few to almost no Spinner Dolphins in captivity at the time. Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins known as Wolphins are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which are a cross between a Bottlenose Dolphin and a False Killer Whale. Also two Common/Bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at Discovery Cove and the other SeaWorld San Diego.\n\nIn the early days, many Bottlenose dolphins were wild-caught off the coast of Florida. Though the Marine Mammal Protection Act, established in 1972, allows an exception for the collection of dolphins for public display and research purposes when a permit is obtained, Bottlenose dolphins have not been captured in American waters since 1989. In most Western countries, breeding programs have been set up to provide the dolphinariums with new animals. To achieve a sufficient birth rate and to prevent inbreeding, artificial insemination (AI) is occasionally used. The use of AI also allows dolphinariums to increase the genetic diversity of their population without having to bring in any dolphins from other facilities.\n\nThe trade of dolphins is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (also known as the Washington Convention or CITES). Endangered dolphin species are included in CITES’ Appendix I, in which case trade is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Species considered not to be threatened with extinction are included in Appendix II, in which case trade “must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival”. Most cetacean species traded for display in captivity to the public or for use in swimming with dolphins and other interaction programs are listed on Appendix II.\n\nHowever, live dolphins trade still continues. A live Bottlenose Dolphin is estimated to be worth between a few thousand to several tens of thousands of US dollars, depending on age, condition and prior training. Captures are reported to be on the rise in the South Pacific and the Caribbean, Cuba has also been an exporter of dolphins in recent years, this being organized by the \"Acuario Nacional de Cuba\". In recent years, the Solomon Islands have also allowed the collection and export of dolphins for public display facilities. A 2005 law banned the export of dolphins, however, this ban was seemingly overturned in 2007 when some 28 dolphins were shipped to Dubai. Some, mainly Japanese, dolphinariums obtain their dolphins from local drive hunts, though several other countries in Asia also import dolphins from Japan. Several American dolphinariums had also done so. This practice was halted in 1993, when the US National Marine Fisheries Service refused a permit for Marine World Africa USA to import four False Killer Whales caught in a Japanese drive hunt.\n\nMany animal welfare groups such as the World Animal Protection consider keeping dolphins in captivity to be a form of animal abuse. The main arguments are that dolphins do not have enough freedom of movement in pools, regardless of pool size, (in the wild, dolphins swim hundreds of miles every day) and do not get enough stimulation. Dolphins often show repetitive behavior in captivity and sometimes become aggressive towards other animals or people. In some cases, the behavior of dolphins in captivity also results in their own death.\n\nThe lifespan of dolphins in captivity is another subject of debate. Research has shown that Orcas indeed have a much lower survival rate in captivity; however, there is no significant difference between wild and captive survival rates for Bottlenose dolphins. This does not, however, reflect a global state of affairs: for example, Bottlenose dolphins in captive facilities in Jamaica suffer from extremely high mortality rates.\n\nSome scientists suggest that the \"unusually high\" intelligence of dolphins means that they should be recognized as \"non-human persons\". In 2013, the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests prohibited the captivity of dolphins on these grounds, finding it \"morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purpose\".\n\nIn 2015, the House of Commons of Canada passed Bill S-203, \"Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act\", and sent it to the Senate of Canada. Two facilities would be affected, Marineland of Canada and the Vancouver Aquarium. In 2018, Progressive Conservatives in the Senate were accused of using procedural obstruction to keep the bill from moving to a vote. In June 2018, such senators added amendments intended to exclude Marineland and the Vancouver Aquarium from being covered by the bill. After three years, the eventual outcome was not yet known in October 2018.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1097026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1097026", "title": "Emily Litella", "text": "Emily Litella\n\nEmily Litella is a fictional character created and performed by comedian Gilda Radner in a series of appearances on \"Saturday Night Live\". Based on a person in her early life, Emily Litella is a popular character in Radner's comedy repertoire.\n\nEmily Litella is an elderly woman with a hearing problem who appeared 26 times on \"SNL's\" \"Weekend Update\" op-ed segment in the late 1970s. Attired in a frumpy dress, sweater and Lisa Loopner glasses, Litella was introduced with professional dignity by the news anchors, who could sometimes be seen cringing slightly in anticipation of the malapropisms they knew would follow. These sketches were, in part, a parody of the Fairness Doctrine, which at the time required broadcasters in the United States to present opposing viewpoints on public issues. \n\nLitella would peer through her reading glasses and, in the character's high-pitched, warbly voice, would read a prepared statement in opposition to an editorial that the TV station had supposedly broadcast. Litella would become increasingly agitated as her statement progressed. Midway in her commentary, it became apparent to the anchor, and the audience, that Litella had misheard or misunderstood the subject of the editorial to which she was responding. A typical example: \n\nThe news anchor would interrupt Litella to point out her error, along the lines, \"That's \"death\" penalty, Ms. Litella, not \"deaf\" ... \"death\".\" Litella would wrinkle her nose, say something like, \"Oh, that's very different,\" then meekly turn to the camera and say, smiling, \"Never mind!\" \n\nOther misheard topics to which Litella responded included \"saving Soviet jewelry\" [Jewry], \"endangered feces\" [species], \"violins on television\" [violence], \"presidential erections\" (elections) and \"flea erections\" (free elections), \"conserving natural racehorses\" <nowiki>[</nowiki>natural resources<nowiki>]</nowiki>, \"firing the handicapped\" [hiring], and \"making Puerto Rico a steak\" [state]. About the last of these topics, she complained, \"Next thing you know, they'll want a baked potato with sour cream!\"\n\nWhen Litella played against news anchor Chevy Chase (whom she often called \"Cheddar Cheese\"), he would be somewhat sympathetic to her. But when Jane Curtin took over the anchor role, she would scold Litella, \"Every week you come on and you get it wrong,\" to which Litella would reply, \"Bitch!\"\n\nRadner based Litella on her childhood nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, known as \"Dibby\", who was allegedly hard of hearing.\nThe running gag \"Never mind\" became a lighthearted catchphrase of the era.\n\nIn her first appearance on \"SNL\", the character of Emily Litella was an author who appeared as an interview subject on a show called \"Looks At Books\". Though she had the same wavery voice and somewhat frumpy wardrobe as she would in later episodes, Litella did not appear to have a hearing problem in this appearance. All subsequent \"SNL\" appearances by Litella were at the newsdesk, and featured the by-now much more familiar \"editorial reply\" iteration of the character.\n\nOutside of \"Saturday Night Live\", Radner played the character briefly on \"The Muppet Show\". At the top of that episode, Miss Litella is discovered backstage by stage manager Scooter, where she is vociferously complaining about the indignity of her appearing in something so silly as \"The Muffin Show\", whereupon Scooter gently persuades Miss Litella that she would be appearing on \"The Muppet Show\", not \"The Muffin Show\". After hearing this reassurance, she withdraws her objection, and meekly apologizes to Scooter by saying, \"Never mind.\"\n\nThe character also appeared in Radner's 1979 one-woman off-Broadway show, \"Gilda Live\", in which Litella took a job as a substitute teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant, replacing a teacher who had been a victim of a stabbing by one of his students, which put him in the hospital.\n\nMiss Litella further cautioned her new students to be very careful where they put their toes, as the regular teacher's \"stubbing\" was the third such \"stubbing\", as Miss Litella put it, at the school that week alone; and that the \"stubbings\" must be pretty serious, in order to have put their teacher in hospital indefinitely. \n\nA similar character, Anthony Crispino (played by Bobby Moynihan), made his first appearance on a \"Weekend Update\" in Season 37, and became a recurring character.\n\n\n"}

Spending money on entertainment was out of the question for most people. The United States put the nation back to work, including artists and entertainers in its assistance programs. The entertainers, in turn, provided cheap or free amusements for people, which allowed them to forget about their troubles for a while.\n\nMany films still highly cherished today were created during the 1920s. During that period, Walt Disney, the pioneer animator, produced films Americans loved to see. One of his best known animations was the tale of the \"Three Little Pigs\", originally produced in 1933. This is another of his that became a part of American culture. Half a century later, his productions are still famous and frequently viewed by children and adults. Many flicks were created during this time, including, \"42nd Street\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", and \"Gone With the Wind\".\n\nComedies were popular films in the 1930s. A good laugh eased the mind and brought joy in a time of adversity. Towards the late 1930s, films that showed how America was fighting against the Great Depression became popular as well.\n\nListening to radio broadcasting became a source of nearly free entertainment for millions of Americans. The radio stations had a little bit of everything for all ages, young and old. One of the most common radio shows for young children was \"Little Orphan Annie\". The show is about an adventurous young girl who had an equally adventurous dog named Sandy. Together, Annie and Sandy would try to solve mysteries. The show was so loved by children that they soon began to purchase small items of merchandise such as pins of Annie. Later, an actual film was released to the public. Adults listened to newscasts, radio theater, the Grand Ole Opry, soap operas, and sermons as well.\n"}
{"id": "403307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=403307", "title": "Eve Online", "text": "Eve Online\n\nEve Online (stylised EVE Online) is a space-based, persistent world massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CCP Games. Players of \"Eve Online\" can participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player). The game contains a total of 7,800 star systems that can be visited by players.\n\nThe game is renowned for its scale and complexity with regards to player interactions in its single, shared game world, players engage in unscripted economic competition, warfare, and political schemes with other players. The Bloodbath of B-R5RB, a battle involving thousands of players in a single star system, took 21 hours and was recognized as one of the largest and most expensive battles in gaming history. \"Eve Online\" was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art with a video including the historical events and accomplishments of the playerbase.\n\n\"Eve Online\" was released in North America and Europe in May 2003. It was published from May to December 2003 by Simon & Schuster Interactive, after which CCP purchased the rights and began to self-publish via a digital distribution scheme. On January 22, 2008, it was announced that \"Eve Online\" would be distributed via Steam. On March 10, 2009, the game was again made available in boxed form in stores, released by Atari, Inc. In February 2013, \"Eve Online\" reached over 500,000 subscribers. On November 11, 2016, \"Eve Online\" added a limited free-to-play version.\n\nSet more than 21,000 years in the future, the background story of \"Eve Online\" explains that humanity, having used up most of Earth's resources through centuries of explosive population growth, began colonizing the rest of the Milky Way. As on Earth, this expansion also led to competition and fighting over available resources, but everything changed with the discovery of a natural wormhole leading to an unexplored galaxy subsequently dubbed \"New Eden.\" Dozens of colonies were founded, and a structure, a gate of sorts (which bears the inscription \"EVE\" on the New Eden side), was built to stabilize the wormhole that linked the colonies of New Eden with the rest of human civilization. However, when the wormhole unexpectedly collapsed, it destroyed the gate as well as the connection between the colonies of New Eden and the Milky Way. Cut off from the rest of humanity and supplies from Earth, the colonies of New Eden were left starving and disconnected from one another; many died out entirely. Over the millennia the descendants of the surviving colonists managed to rebuild their own societies, but by this time the memories and knowledge of humanity's origins, of Earth and the Milky Way galaxy, as well as the history of the settling of New Eden, was lost; what little information that survived transmission over the generations was misunderstood, lost in translation, and/or consigned to mythology. Five major distinct societies rose to prominence from the surviving colonies, each growing into interstellar spaceflight-capable civilizations. The states based around these societies make up the five major factions in \"Eve Online\": the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, the Gallente Federation, the Minmatar Republic and the Jove Directorate.\n\nThe Amarr, a militantly theocratic empire, was the first of the playable races to rediscover faster-than-light travel. In terms of physical proximity, the space occupied by this society is physically nearest to the demolished EVE gate. Armed with this new technology and the strength of their faith in their god, the Amarr expanded their empire by conquering and enslaving several races, including the Minmatar race, who had only just begun colonizing other planets. Generations later, after the intense culture shock of encountering the Gallente Federation, and in the wake of a disastrous attempted invasion of Jovian space, many Minmatar took the opportunity to rebel and successfully overthrew their enslavers, forming their own government. However, much of their population remain enslaved by the Amarr, and some, having adopted the Amarrian religion and sided with their masters during the revolution, were released from bondage and incorporated into the Empire as commoners in the Ammatar Mandate. The free Minmatar Republic, taking as inspiration the ideals and practices of the Gallente Federation, is presently a strong military and economic power actively seeking the emancipation of their brethren and all other slaves.\n\nThe Gallente and the Caldari homeworlds are situated in the same star system. The Gallente homeworld was originally settled by descendants of the French colonists of Tau Ceti; Caldari Prime on the other hand was purchased by a multinational megacorporation that began to terraform it. The terraforming of Caldari Prime was incomplete at the time of the EVE wormhole's collapse, however, and the planet remained environmentally inhospitable for millennia. The Gallente restored themselves to a high-functioning technological society some hundred years before the Caldari, building the first lastingly democratic republic of New Eden in the form of the Gallente Federation. Originally the Caldari composed a member race within the Federation, but cultural animosity between the two peoples spiralled into a war during which the Caldari seceded from the Federation to found their own Caldari State. The war lasted 93 years, with neither nation able to overwhelm the other. The planet Caldari Prime was initially retained by the Gallente Federation during the war, and did not become part of the new Caldari State. Much more recently, however, a Caldari offensive managed to recapture their lost homeworld, a fact which is viewed with abhorrence by the Gallente, who see the presence of a significant Caldari fleet about the planet as a mass hostage taking.\n\nBoth the Gallente Federation and Caldari State are economically- and trade-oriented nations. However, the Gallente favour liberal economic policies, encourage individual entrepreneurship and social democracy, and maintain a progressive approach to social welfare, whereas the Caldari State is organised as a form of statist corporatocracy; the Caldari State itself is owned by and operated on behalf of a few trust-like megaconglomerates. The Gallente Federation's official policies regarding multiculturalism and encouragement of diversity attracts many immigrants to Gallente space; a third of all ethnic Minmatars reside as citizens there. As the Caldari did not share this enthusiasm for diversity with the Gallente, the Caldari State at the time of its formation found itself at a relative population deficit compared to its Gallente adversary; rather than encourage massive immigration to and diversity within the State, this population shortage was rectified by a Statewide programme of artificial reproduction, producing a generation of so-called 'Tube Children' raised by the Caldari State apparatus to enlarge the labour pools available to the megacorporations that ruled the State.\n\nThe Jovians (a non-playable race) were also descended from colonists. Unlike the other races of \"Eve Online\", they maintained a relatively high-functioning technological society after the collapse of the EVE wormhole and did not need to spend millennia recapitulating ancient societal developments as the others did, and while the other four major races were still grounded, Jovian history saw two major periods of spacefaring empire. They expanded outward and eventually turned to genetic engineering in order to mold themselves into a species more suited for deep-space life and long-range interstellar exploration. Genetic experimentation/manipulation was not without its drawbacks, however: by the time period in which players enter the Eve Online universe, the millennia of human genetic manipulation has rendered the Jovians barely recognizable as human; more critically, the Jovian manipulation of their genetics has resulted in the eventually-fatal \"Jovian Disease,\" an inherited psychological disorder which, despite the best efforts of the Jovians to reverse it, has affected every individual of the Jovian race and thus crippled their civilization. Having experienced a catastrophic population decline (the Jovian societal structure is believed to be barely maintained by their immensely-advanced technological systems), the Jovians have effectively retreated to inhabit a region of space inaccessible to outsiders.\n\nIn addition to different backgrounds and histories, each of the races have characteristic philosophies of starship design. Minmatar ships tend to be quite fast but fragile, and rely on their high speed and maneuverability to evade the tracking systems of heavier weapons, while themselves using projectile weapons such as artillery or autocannons, more sophisticated kin to today's munitions technology. Amarr ships are ponderous, densely armored, and pack batteries of powerful laser-based energy weaponry. Gallente ships are sleek and designed to favor armor plating; they specialize in deploying fleets of robotic drones while mounting hybrid weapons that operate using superconducting magnets to accelerate mass toward targets at great speed (see Railgun). Finally, Caldari ships are typically poorly armored and not particularly fast but utilize powerful energy shields, and make extensive use of torpedo/missile launchers and hybrid guns, favoring engagement at extreme ranges. However, there are exceptions to these general rules in each race.\n\nPlayers start the game by either selecting a previously created character or by creating a new one. Each \"Eve Online\" account allows for up to three characters. When a player creates a new character, they start by choosing one of the four playable races – Amarr, Gallente, Minmatar, or Caldari. Each race is further divided into three bloodlines that give characters different pre-defined appearances, which can be finely tuned by the player.\n\nUnlike many other MMOs, where there are numerous copies of the game universe intended to run at once (i.e., servers), \"Eve Online\" is functionally a single-universe game. There are technically four copies of the universe running: the main server \"Tranquility\", the Chinese-based \"Serenity\", the \"event\" test server \"Duality\" that is a semi-public test server, and the test server \"Singularity\" (also \"Sisi\") which is a general, public test server. A new test server was announced called \"Buckingham\" to replace \"Singularity\" as the main EVE Online test server while \"Singularity\" was used for Dust 514/EVE Online joint testing. As DUST 514 is no longer active, \"Singularity\" is now the main test server again and \"Buckingham\" is a closed test server for the CCP developers.\n\nThe playing environment in \"Eve Online\" consists of more than 5000 star systems, as well as 2500 randomly accessible wormhole systems, taking place in 23341 C.E. Systems are classified by their Security Status, on a decimal scale from −1.0 to 1.0. These systems are categorized into three groups, each determining the response from CONCORD (Consolidated Co-operation and Relations Command) NPC law enforcement units. Star systems classed as 0.5–1.0 security are considered \"high security\" and any unauthorized/unprovoked attack by a character on another character anywhere in the system will result in the appearance of law enforcement. These units will attack and destroy the aggressor, and are designed to reinforce in such strength that they will always win an engagement. However, CONCORD is not preventative, but punitive, meaning there is a short window between beginning an attack and getting destroyed where a player (or group of) can destroy another player's ship. Systems classified as 0.1–0.4 are considered \"low security\", where CONCORD law enforcement units will not destroy aggressors, but do monitor unprovoked acts of aggression and have automated sentry guns in some locations. Unprovoked attacks will flag the aggressor as a free target for other players, and attacks within sight of sentry guns will cause them to fire on the aggressor. Systems classified 0.0 to −1.0 are called \"zero space\" or \"null sec\", and feature no law enforcement; individual systems, or groups of systems, may be controlled by player alliances, up to the creation of player-owned empires reaching across entire \"regions\" (an aggregate group of star systems). Wormhole systems are accessible only by wormholes that randomly appear and disappear, and are also lawless space, showing as −1.0. However, player-run corporations cannot claim sovereignty in wormhole systems. Star systems contain different types of celestial objects, making them more or less suitable for different kinds of operations. Typically, players find asteroid fields, planets, stations, stargates, and moons in a system. Many of the game's most profitable income sources are found in dangerous null or low security systems, giving players incentive to engage in high-risk, high-reward activities in which they must survive the possible harassment of other players who may also enter the system.\n\nThe game's primary mode of play is flying around in space ships. Players can dock at stations, where they are safe and can use station services such as repairing, refitting, and the regional market. All space combat takes place in real time at sub-light speeds from around 100 m/s to in excess of 8000 m/s, depending on ship size and setup. While players can manually control their ships as in space combat simulators such as \"Wing Commander\" or \"\" following the release of the Rhea expansion on December 9, 2014, most opt instead to give commands such as Orbit, Approach or Align to their flight computer, which does its best to comply. Weapon aiming, however, cannot be done manually; instead, the player locks on to an opponent and orders their weapons to fire, and the result is determined through calculations based on factors such as range, velocity, weapon tracking, and a degree of randomness.\n\nTravel across distances longer than hundreds of kilometers is done primarily with the ship's Warp Drive, which every ship and escape pod has, though the player may \"slow boat\" across distances, traveling without warp drive. The player issues a command to warp to an object, which must be greater than 150 km away and in the same star system, and, after an alignment maneuver, their ship will enter warp. After between a few seconds to several minutes, depending on ship speed and warp distance, the ship will arrive at the selected destination. A ship's warp drive can be temporarily disabled by warp disruption weapons, which is an essential part of combat to prevent a target from escaping.\n\nFor most ships, travel between star systems is only possible by using structures called \"Stargates\". Each stargate is linked to a partner stargate in another system; most star systems have more than two stargates, forming a network through which players travel. While travel within a star system by warp drive is relatively free-form, the need to use stargates to travel between systems makes them focal points for combat.\n\nCapital ships may travel either by stargate or by using jump drives, which require another ship to create a \"Cynosural Field\" which the capital ship can then jump to. While this allows the capital ship to travel instantaneously, it requires a trusted second party (or an alternate account) to create the beacon. Jump drives also consume fuel (in contrast to stargates, which require nothing), drain the ship of its capacitor, leaving it nearly defenseless until it is recharged, and incur \"jump fatigue\", which prevents the pilot from jumping for progressively longer periods of time after each consecutive jump. Titans are also capable of allowing other ships to instantaneously travel by creating temporary bridges to cynosural fields. Black Ops battleships can create similar, but undetectable, bridges capable of transporting only specific ship types such as Stealth Bombers.\n\nPlayer-run corporations that claim sovereignty over two null sec systems within range of each other can also set up a jump bridge at a player owned starbase (POS) that is in orbit of a moon. Jump bridges allow instantaneous travel to the other system's jump bridge, at the cost of using fuel (requiring supply by the owning corporation) scaled to the mass of ships that use them. This also leads to the accumulation of jump fatigue.\n\nUnlike other massively multiplayer online games, player characters in \"Eve Online\" advance continuously over time by training skills, a passive process that occurs in real world time so that the learning process continues even if the player is not logged in. The skill training queue allows up to 50 skills to be scheduled, with up to a 10-year total training schedule. Before the November 4, 2014 \"Phoebe\" release, the skill training queue allowed skills to be scheduled to start training only up to 24 hours in the future. Some skills require other prerequisite skills to be trained to a certain level to be trained, and some skills require more time to train than others; for example, the skill to fly a Titan-class spaceship takes 8 times as long to train as the skill to fly a frigate ship, with a significant number of prerequisite skills.\n\nUntil the Odyssey expansion, it was not possible to train more than one character per account at the same time. Odyssey introduced \"Dual Character Training\", which allows players to expend a PLEX (see accounts and subscriptions) in order to allow that account to train a second character for 30 days, equivalent to paying for a 30-day subscription on another account to train a single character. Odyssey 1.2 introduced the more generalized \"Multiple Character Training\" which allows players to expend yet another PLEX to activate this feature for a third character on the account.\n\nThe in-game economy in \"Eve Online\" is an open economy that is largely player-driven. Non-player character (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players to learn new skills and blueprints to manufacture ships and modules. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods. Some Trade Goods are only for trade between NPC merchants while others have a functional use and are not good for trade with NPCs. The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture almost all of the ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy. The in-game currency is ISK (Interstellar Kredits), which is also the currency code of the Icelandic króna, the real-world currency of Iceland, where the \"Eve Online\" development studio is located.\n\nThe amount of money or materials in the universe is not fixed and, as such, the economy operates under supply and demand. Market manipulation is possible on a large scale, particular examples being ramping and bear raids. CCP does not issue refunds on in-game purchases. Hence, there is always the risk of certain types of confidence tricks or other scams. The economy is balanced by the automatic introduction of extra materials in underpopulated areas. This encourages a more even spread of players.\n\nThe game provides support for the trading of in-game resources, including graphs of item price history, with Donchian Channel and daily average price. Some player characters operate primarily as traders, generating profits through buying, selling, and transporting goods. Others operate primarily as producers, obtaining components or raw materials and transforming them, sometimes on massive scales, into useful items such as weapons, ships, ammunition, items, or various technologies in demand by other players. Some less combat-oriented players operate as miners or salvagers, collecting and processing ores used in manufacturing or collecting salvage materials to make into items, respectively. Finally, some characters operate as mercenaries or pirates, being paid primarily to be battle-ready and either to attack or defend other profitable enterprises.\n\nUnlike some games such as \"Second Life\", in-game currency is not freely convertible with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as the Pilot License Extension (PLEX), a token worth 30 days of game time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell the items on the in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited. The developers' reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to fall under the same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP would rather not place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both to the difficulty of regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or Ponzi schemes if they wish to do so.\n\nCommentators have attempted to estimate the value of \"Eve Online\" entities in real-world currency based on the current value of PLEX. One such conversion valued a fleet-ready titan (the most powerful ship in the game) at US$7,600, though estimates vary. Generally, no player expends such amounts of real-world currency to acquire such sums of in-game wealth, opting instead to do activities in-game that net high amounts of profit.\n\nIn 2007, CCP was the first game developer to hire an economist, Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, to oversee \"Eve\"s in-game economy. Guðmundsson was previously dean of the faculty of business and science at the University of Akureyri. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson would leave CCP in 2014 to the position of Rector at the University of Akureyri in July 2014.\n\nDue to the game's focus on freedom, consequence, and autonomy, many behaviours that are considered griefing in most MMOs are allowed in \"Eve\". This includes stealing from other players, extortion, and causing other players to be killed by large groups of NPCs.\n\nOnly malicious, prolonged and concentrated harassment where no material gain is involved and a few other actions are considered to be illicit griefing by the game's developers. Escaping retribution by CONCORD, the NPC space police force that punishes criminal activity in higher security solar systems, for criminal actions is also forbidden, as CONCORD is intentionally designed by game mechanics to be unstoppable.\n\nShips in \"Eve Online\" are organized into classes, from tiny frigates only a few dozen meters long to gigantic capital ships up to 17 kilometers long (as large as whole cities). Ships fill different roles and vary in size, speed, hull strength and firepower; smaller ships are generally faster and capable of disabling their targets but lack the damage output necessary to destroy larger ships, while capital ships do very high amounts of damage but have difficulty in striking smaller, mobile targets. Each of the four races has their own unique ship design preferences and varied strengths and weaknesses, although all races have ships that are meant for the same basic roles and are balanced for play against each other. This means that there is no \"best ship\" in \"Eve Online\". According to their preferred style of play, the player might want their characters to fly a ship with a huge cargo hold, one that is suited for mining, one that has a powerful array of weapons, or a ship that moves quickly through space; but the fluid, ever-changing nature of \"Eve Online\" means that no ship will be perfect at all of these tasks, nor is there any guarantee that the \"best ship for the job\" today will continue to be the best ship tomorrow.\n\nFurthermore, unlike many online games, \"Eve\" does not feature racial bonuses; that is, characters of different races do not gain intrinsic advantages for flying ships designed by their own race. While a character will begin with more advanced skills in his own race's ships, a character of another race can reach the same proficiency through training. Thus, players are encouraged to use starships that meet their preferred style of play, and the game does not place incentives for playing as one race over another. However, the ships of different races receive unique bonuses to certain things.\n\nShips in \"Eve Online\" come in four size classes. Small starships include frigates (small, mobile ships good for disruption and harassment) and destroyers (slightly larger and more offensively oriented than frigates). Medium starships include cruisers (multipurpose ships with many possible roles) and battlecruisers (heavier, more combat-oriented cruisers). Battleships (heavily armed and armoured dedicated combat ships) make up the large size class. Extra-large (or capital-class) starships include carriers (offensive oriented ships that can launch wings of fighters to attack targets at extreme range), dreadnoughts (dedicated siege ships for attacking structures and other capitals), force auxiliary ships (dedicated support ships exceptional at repairing other ships), supercarriers (larger versions of carriers focused more on damage to capital class ships and powerful fleet disruption capabilities) and titans (supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to other capital ships, or have other powerful battle-affecting capabilities).\n\nEach spaceship within the \"Eve Online\" universe has a different set of characteristics and can be fitted with different combinations of modules subject to their fitting requirements. Ships have a wide variety of characteristics, including power grid, CPU, capacitor size and recharge rate, energy shields, armor, maximum velocity, agility, locking range and maximum number of lockable targets. A ship's systems also receive bonuses depending on the level of various skills of the ship's pilot. These bonuses usually correspond to the role the ship has been designed for, and thus vary widely. For instance, the Caldari \"Caracal\" cruiser has a bonus to the rate of fire of certain missile launcher types, while the Gallente \"Vexor\" cruiser has a bonus to the damage and hitpoints of certain types of combat drones.\n\nOne important characteristic of a ship is the slots it has available for modules. Slots and modules come in three variants: high-, mid-, and low-power. Examples of high slot modules include weapons such as turrets and missile launchers, cloaking devices, tractor beams, and other tools for mining and salvaging. Mid slot items include modules to improve shields or propulsion, repair hull damage, engage in electronic warfare, and \"tackle\" other ships to slow or stop movement and prevent escape. Low slot items include armor enhancements and repair, increased cargo space, and improved speed, agility, computers, or power supply. Different-sized ships have different numbers and ratios of module slots.\n\nA ship may also have 2-3 slots for rigs, modules that require no power grid or CPU, but instead require a ship resource called calibration. Installing a rig is a semi-permanent action, as a rig cannot be removed from the ship without being destroyed. Rigs come in four sizes: small, medium, large, and capital which roughly correspond to the size of the ship, and are used to affect other aspects of the ship such as maximum speed or cargo capacity, or to augment the capabilities of other modules installed in the ship. Most rigs also incur a penalty to certain aspect of the ship; for example, armor rigs reduce the maximum velocity of the ship.\n\nAll ships in the game are also classed according to \"Tech level\", from Tech I to Tech III. Tech I (or T1) ships are general purpose, easily manufactured models that perform simple, straightforward functions in an obvious way; faction ships, which are usually very expensive and very good at their intended tasks, are also T1. Tech II (T2) ships are based on T1 designs that have been modified to perform specific roles using specialized technology. T2 ships are harder to manufacture and are only produced by certain corporations, and are priced well above the T1 variants. They also require significantly greater skills to fly than their T1 variants.\n\nThe Apocrypha patch introduced into \"Eve Online\" a new type of ship: the Tech III (T3) strategic cruiser. These highly advanced starships gain their unique qualities by being manufactured from material recovered from beyond wormholes, another new feature introduced by Apocrypha. Strategic cruisers are rare and expensive, and require unique skillsets on the part of manufacturers that allow the reverse engineering and integration of highly advanced technologies recovered from dead or dormant ancient civilizations. They differ from other ships in that they are modular. Players start with a hull and then add four subsystems to it, the choice of which can dramatically change the ship's character, giving it a different layout of module slots, different preferred weapon systems, and abilities such as being able to fit covert cloaks or ignore some warp disruption effects. The Rhea, Aegis, Tiamat, and Carnyx patches introduced four new Tech III tactical destroyers. While these lack the modular nature of their strategic cruiser big brothers, they can dynamically swap between three \"modes\", augmenting their offensive, defensive, or propulsion capabilities, respectively, as needed by the pilot, even in the midst of combat. This gives these tactical destroyers substantially superior offensive, defensive, or evasive capabilities compared to other lower-tech destroyers, though they can only focus on one of the three capabilities at a time.\n\nPlayers have several interaction options when playing \"Eve Online\". Every activity is possible for solo players but larger and more complicated tasks become more feasible for groups, such as pirate clans or corporations.\n\nPlayers can organize themselves into corporations (similar to guilds or clans in other MMOs). Corporations are run by one chief executive officer (CEO) who controls the corporation's assets. The CEO assigns roles to corporation members such as director, accountant and personnel manager. Corporations may also band together to form alliances. Corporations and alliances come in different shapes and sizes. Some player groups write press releases about new business openings and send out IPO information to potential in-game venture capital investors. Alliances can control enough star systems that their territory can be plotted on the \"Eve Online\" game map. Alliances based in lawless space often form unofficial political power blocs with other alliances. These power blocs are typically referred to as \"coalitions\". Unlike formally established alliances, coalitions are similar in nature to Japanese \"keiretsu\" an informal 'business arrangement' in which several corporations band together to provide mutual financial, military and/or industrial support.\n\nCorporations take up numerous business models such as mining, manufacturing or \"ratting\" (hunting NPC pirates for their bounties and loot). Corporations can levy income taxes on their members, which skim off a percentage of every member's earnings. Many corporations offer a variety of benefits to their members, such as free or discounted ships, equipment, formal training, and organized corporate group operations.\n\nAmong the many activities that corporations can organize is piracy. Actions considered piracy generally involve breaking the in-game law, and can come in a variety of forms. Pirates may camp stargates waiting for other players to arrive, attack players operating in asteroid belts or hunt for players carrying out an NPC agent-assigned mission. Because these activities are considered to be \"illegal\" within the game mechanics, pirate characters often will have low security status and may even be branded as outlaws by CONCORD. Likewise, victims of overt piracy may retaliate without intervention from CONCORD, often via an expressed right to destroy the pirate ship (i.e., \"kill right\"). Although piracy activities are \"illegal\" within the game universe, they are not against the rules of the game, i.e., there will only be in-game retaliation and punishment for them.\n\nIllegally attacking another player in secure space will result in a loss of security standing; CONCORD, the interstellar NPC police, will arrive shortly to destroy the aggressor's ship. There are, however, legal ways to attack other players in high-security space.\n\nWhole corporations and whole alliances can officially declare war on (or \"war-dec\") other corporations or alliances for a weekly fee, permitting all members of the involved corporations or alliances to attack each other without loss of security status or the intervention of CONCORD. The weekly fee can be eliminated if the war declaration is reciprocated. War declarations will clearly flag a player's enemies, so the player can determine who can legally attack and be attacked.\n\nIn March 2006, CCP made a deal with Optic Communications to start working on bringing \"Eve Online\" to the Chinese gaming audience. Closed alpha testing was held on a small cluster for some time, with about 3,000 players chosen from an initial pool of 50,000. The Chinese open beta test began on June 13, 2006, and proved to be very popular, gaining numbers comparable to \"Eve Online\"'s main server cluster. In order to avoid the shock of quickly adding thousands of new players to the current server (Tranquility), CCP Games decided to launch \"Eve\" in China on its own server (Serenity). In 2011, CCP allowed its licensing agreement with CDC Games, which had acquired Optic in July 2007, to expire. CCP created a new partnership with TianCity to relaunch Serenity on December 11, 2012.\n\nThe code base between Serenity (serving China) and Tranquility (serving the rest of the world) is synchronised, so that feature development is distributed to both server clusters, although the game worlds are not connected. \"Eve Online\" fully supports Unicode and has a back-end system to enable localization of each and every aspect of the game's content and UI.\n\nIn October 2006, the average age of an \"Eve Online\" player was 27, and 95% of players were male. The average weekly playtime was 17 hours, or just under 2.5 hours per day. By May 6, 2009, \"Eve Online\" claimed to have more than 300,000 active subscriptions and 45,000 active trial accounts. The total active subscription count at end of 2010 was 357,000 accounts.\n\nOn July 7, 2011, CCP announced that it planned to partner with Nexon Co. Ltd. to bring a \"fully localized game client and product services for CCP's award winning... EVE Online\" to Japan in the fall. Localized services for Japanese players would enable them to access the game in their native language through the Tranquility server, which currently hosts over 350,000 subscribers from around the world in three languages: English, German and Russian.\n\nOn May 5, 2013, \"Eve Online\" claimed a new record for the maximum number of simultaneous pilots online with 65,303 concurrent accounts logged on to the same server at the same time. This record was set on the eve of \"Eve Online\" 10 year birthday and topped the previous record of 63,170 set January 23, 2011. \"Eve Online\" typically experiences the highest number of users on Sundays and the peak player records have almost exclusively been broken on Sundays.\n\nDuring two weekends in July 2006, a live streaming video production called Eve TV covered the events of the 2nd Caldari Alliance Tournament. The tournament pitted three-man teams from the top alliances against each other. Eve TV provided live in-game footage of the battles along with expert commentary. Analysis of the teams and strategies, interviews with CCP staff and behind-the-scenes specials were also aired between battles. Eve TV was produced and hosted primarily by DJs from Eve-Radio (a player-run streaming radio station) with resources provided by CCP. A total of 95 matches were scheduled, with the Band of Brothers alliance emerging the winner.\n\nThe first two weekends in December 2006 saw the 3rd Alliance tournament. This was once again broadcast via live streaming video by Eve TV The tournament saw 40 Alliances pitting five-man teams against each other. Once again, the Band of Brothers alliance emerged as the winner. Of particular note in this tournament was the fielding of an Imperial Apocalypse by the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate. The ship was destroyed in the semi-finals of the tournament by the COW (Cult of War) team. A last-minute attempt to arrange an 8 billion ISK ransom for the ship fell through.\n\nThe fourth Alliance tournament in September 2007 brought several upsets, with Star Fraction defeating Band of Brothers in the second round, using only tech 1 cruisers, and Hun Reloaded sweeping both the semifinals and finals to win.\n\nThe two weekends starting February 29, 2008, and March 7, 2008, saw the fifth Alliance Tournament. Eve TV provided coverage via live streaming video. During the six days a total of 40 teams competed in 95 matches. The last tournament's winner, HUN Reloaded, made its way into the quarter-finals where it lost to Ev0ke alliance, who later became tournament champion after having won all eight of its matches.\n\nThe sixth Alliance Tournament was held during three consecutive weekends starting January 24, 2009, and ending on February 8, 2009. A total of 64 teams took part in the qualifying rounds on opening weekend. While the final weekend was broadcast live via Eve TV, the qualifying rounds were broadcast through various \"Eve Online\" radio channels. A number of changes were made to the tournament rules. This was also the first tournament Factional Militias were able to take part alongside traditional alliance teams. In the final match, R.U.R. went up against Pandemic Legion with Pandemic Legion emerging as the tournament winner.\n\nAlliance Tournament 7 took place in September 2009, with Pandemic Legion winning a second successive tournament, beating Circle of Two in the final. Alliance Tournament 8 took place in June 2010, with Pandemic Legion winning for the third time, beating Hydra Reloaded, while Alliance Tournament 9 took place in June 2011, with Hydra Reloaded as the winner in the uncontested final match against Outbreak.\n\nAlliance Tournament 10 took place over four consecutive weekends in July 2012. 64 Teams took part in the Tournament, with all matches being broadcast live on EVE TV. A number of changes were made to the format of matches, which included increasing the maximum number of pilots from 10 to 12. Verge of Collapse were eventually crowned Champions, defeating Alliance Tournament 4 winners HUN Reloaded in the final. The Alliance stunned everyone beating top teams to claim the title of Champions.\n\nAlliance Tournament 11 took place during 3 weekends in July and August 2013, with Pandemic Legion beating Exodus. in the loser's bracket, then coming back from a 2-0 score in a best of five match against Hydra Reloaded to win 3 matches in a row and win their fourth Alliance Tournament, and their first victory since Alliance Tournament 8.\n\nThe Interstellar Services Department (ISD) is a group of volunteers, made up of subscribed players, who assist in a variety of tasks like answering questions from players, bug hunting and QA testing, covering player-driven news, and writing game fiction. It includes ECAID (Equipment Certification and Anomaly Investigations Division), STAR (Support, Training and Resources), IC (Interstellar Correspondents), M (Mercury), CCL (Community Communication Liaisons), and YARR (Yulai Archives & Records Repository Team).\n\nAccording to the developers, \"Eve Online\" evolved from the classic computer game \"Elite\", which itself was based on concepts from the science-fiction role-playing game \"Traveller\". \"Eve\" combined concepts from \"Elite\" with the multi player chat and player-versus-player aspects of \"Ultima Online\". \"Elite\" had four single-player aspects of missions, mining, trade routes and combat with random hostile NPC's all of which are aspects of the first incarnations of \"Eve Online\".\n\nOne of the original developers of \"Elite\", David Braben, believes \"Eve Online\" is a reimplementation of the 1980s game, not its true successor. Some of the developers (John Cameron, James Cassidy, Joe Chaney) also believe that this game creates a world where players can become someone else only possible in their imaginations.\n\nBoth the server and the client software for \"Eve Online\" are developed in Stackless Python, a variant of the Python programming language. Stackless Python allows a relatively large number of players to perform tasks without the overhead of using the call stack used in the standard Python distribution. This frees the game developers from performing some routine work and allows them to apply changes to the game universe without resetting the server. However, the Eve cluster is taken offline daily for database and server maintenance.\n\nOn March 14, 2006, the \"Eve Online\" development team announced that they would be upgrading the graphics engine of \"Eve Online\" to a DirectX 10 / Windows Vista graphics platform. Revelations patch 1.4 had patch notes quoted as saying that the current \"Eve Online\" client should work in Vista \"as well as it does in XP.\"\n\nOn September 10, 2007, CCP Games announced that the new \"Trinity 2\" graphics engine will be using DirectX 9.0. This was released on December 5, 2007.\n\nOfficial support for Linux and Mac platforms, using Transgaming Technologies Cedega and Cider (forks of Wine) for Linux and Mac compatibility, was introduced with the Revelations 2.3 patch released on November 6, 2007. At Fanfest 2008 Transgaming announced and demonstrated that the Premium graphics client is now running on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. In February 2009 CCP announced that they planned to discontinue the official Linux client with the next major patch, and advised on using third-party programs to run the Windows version of the client under Linux (namely Wine). The discontinuation of the official Linux client was primarily because the game ran better using the Windows client via Wine than it did with the official one, as a result many Linux users were already using Wine instead.\n\nThird-party applications supplement players' \"Eve Online\" experience. Some of these, such as automated applications designed to claim publicly available contracts accidentally put up without an associated cost, can result in a ban if discovered, while others are endorsed, tacitly or explicitly, by CCP. EVEMon, a .NET application that monitors and forecasts skill training times, is one example of an explicitly authorized external application. Another such application, Eve Fitting Tool or EFT, allows players to try different ship setups and see how certain skills and modules will affect that ship.\n\nThird-party applications to monitor character information and skill training exist for both the Android and iPhone mobile platforms.\n\nIn May 2005, CCP announced the Eve API Project; third-party utilities such as EVEMon now interface with character data, market, and other data through an API.\n\nSince the initial release of \"Eve Online\", CCP has added twenty-one expansions to the game, free of additional charge to its subscribers. The twentieth expansion \"Rubicon,\" was released on November 19, 2013, and focused on new faction ships, introduction of mobile structures, and the first steps towards \"The Future of EVE\" outlined by CCP Seagull. The nineteenth expansion, \"Odyssey,\" was released on June 4, 2013, and focused on exploration and rebalancing battleships. The eighteenth expansion, \"Retribution,\" focused on a newly re-worked Crimewatch system. It also introduced the newly rebalanced frigates, destroyers, cruisers, and battlecruisers. The seventeenth expansion, \"Inferno,\" added enhanced graphics for missile systems, a host of new ship modules, and a controversial new \"Unified Inventory\" UI. The sixteenth expansion, \"Crucible\", was released in November 2011 and shifted the focus from cosmetic changes to game mechanics. The fifteenth expansion, \"Incarna,\" was released in the first stage of CCP's controversial Ambulation project, also known as the \"Walking in Stations\" project. \"Incarna\" added \"Captain's Quarters\" to stations, the first phase of allowing players to explore stations as human avatars, as well as an update to ship turret models. The fourteenth expansion, \"Incursion,\" was released in stages, the second of which introduced the Sansha Incursions, in which Sansha's Nation invaded constellations, disrupting all forms of activity in the area, but provided large rewards for fighting back the incursions, and an overhaul of the character creation tool, paving the way for the \"Incarna\" expansion.\n\nThe eleventh expansion of \"Eve Online\", \"Apocrypha,\" was released on March 10, 2009, and introduced features such as further graphics updates as started in the Trinity expansion; the ability for players to group their vessels' weapons for easier interaction; changes to autopilot routes and avoidance of player-defined star systems. The twelfth expansion, \"Dominion,\" was released on December 1, 2009, and overhauled the sovereignty system, while the thirteenth expansion, \"Tyrannis,\" released on May 26, 2010, added planetary interaction as well as the online platform \"EVE Gate\".\n\nOver time, expansions have added features such as conquerable and constructible space stations, massive capital ships, advanced versions of existing ships, or \"Epic Arcs\" for players to master. Apocrypha included an overhauled probing system, wormholes, a smarter and tougher AI and customizable Tech 3 ships as its major features. Dominion, which became available for download on December 1, 2009, included an overhaul of the sovereignty system, more realistic astronomy, the Titan Doomsday weapon functionality being changed and the in-game web browser with Chromium's WebKit. It also included a redesign of the UI and in-game mailing system. Tyrannis added new features, such as the ability to exploit planetary resources, a social networking program called EVE Gate, new technology for ships, and graphical updates.\n\nOn May 6, 2014 at their yearly Fanfest convention, CCP announced the move from the current development cycle of two expansions per year, to ten feature-releases per year on a rapid release cycle. Senior Producer of EVE Online Andie Nordgren (CCP Seagull) stated that the move was to necessary for future developments to have a more flexible release cycle, rather than the deadline imposed on the previous system, allowing smaller patches and changes to be deployed more rapidly and large projects not having to be rushed due to the expansion deadline.\n\nHowever, in September 2015, Nordgren announced that CCP, while continuing with a five-week release cycle, would return to intermittently releasing large scale expansions for \"EVE\". She described the new release cycle as a \"hybrid form\", where expansions would be \"a set of big, connected features\" with no fixed number per year, while the feature-releases would continue to bring \"quality of life changes, ship balance changes, visual upgrades\" and other smaller additions. The first new expansion, announced at EVE Vegas 2015, will introduce a new modular starbase called a Citadel, and will overhaul capital-class ships. Its release date is set for spring of 2016.\n\nThe developers have been working on a game feature to allow players to exit pods and interact with other player avatars in the communal setting of a station interior. The first iteration, called Captain’s Quarters, was released on June 21, 2011. The second iteration, with stylised quarters for each race, was released with the Crucible expansion. Player interaction in station environments has not yet been announced and only preliminary details have emerged.\n\nThe ability to enter a planet's atmosphere and to interact with its surface is mentioned as one of the future development plans. The \"Future Vision\" trailer portrays Dreadnaught-class ships performing planetary orbital bombardments on Dust battlefields. The first glimpse trailer of Dust 514 ended with a ship exploding in the atmosphere. However, the interaction between Dust and Eve has not been fully defined and no official confirmation has yet been provided. At Eve Fanfest 2005, a working prototype was demonstrated in which a Caldari Crow interceptor could be seen navigating a makeshift landscape superimposed on a nebula. However, this effort was later abandoned. CCP has stated that full-scale integration of such features requires an enormous effort and is only planned for post-Revelations (expansion) production phases, 2006. Subsequently, it was stated that, until a proven in-game reason is found for planetary access, further work on this feature will not have a high priority.\n\nDuring the 2009 Games Convention in Cologne, Germany, CCP unveiled \"Dust 514\", a console-based MMOFPS title meant to integrate with the \"Eve Online\" universe. According to developers, players hired by \"Eve Online\" alliances would fight over planets.\n\nAccording to \"Eve Online\" Creative Director Torfi Frans Ólafsson, at the recent Eve Online Fanfest, the Dominion release is planned to involve sovereignty, the ownership of districts on planets that are capable of creating industry. This player ownership system will be dynamic as it will be subject to PvP diplomacy as well as subjugation. The latter allows for linking with \"Dust 514\", whereby players within \"Eve Online\" will be able to contract, in-game, \"Dust 514\" players to take control of planetary regions within the \"Eve Online\" universe and these 'mercenaries' will then vie with other \"Dust 514\" players hired by the opposing faction. The integration between the console MMOFPS game and the \"Eve Online\" MMORPG is both through community interaction and through the changeable battlefields based on the planetary architecture of a common universe the outcome of these battles in \"Dust 514\" will affect the status and ownership of the corresponding planets in \"Eve Online\" as well. At E3 2011, it was announced that \"Dust 514\" is a PlayStation 3 exclusive with a PS Vita tie-in, both to be released in spring of 2012.\n\nOn May 20, 2011, leaked \"EVE Online\" source code was published by someone on a GitHub repository. After being online for four days, CCP issued a DMCA take-down request which was followed by GitHub.\n\nThe \"Eve Online\" soundtrack was composed by Jón Hallur Haraldsson, also known as Real-X. A digital soundtrack titled \"EVE Online: Original Soundtrack, Vol. 1\" was released on iTunes on August 12, 2009. The soundtrack comes with an audio book track \"EVE Chronicle – Taught Thoughts\". The soundtrack has since been removed from iTunes.\n\nThe game itself contains an extensive in-game soundtrack. On December 4, 2012, the \"Retribution\" expansion of Eve Online was released. Among its features was the removal of the Jukebox, which enabled players to select their favorite songs to play. In tandem with this, CCP Games announced that the entire game soundtrack (consisting of music in the game at the time) would be available to download for free from SoundCloud. The soundtrack consists of 74 songs, with a running time of nearly seven hours.\n\nPiracy (in the ship-to-ship sense) is part of the game, as is protection racketeering, theft, and ransom. \"Eve Online\" periodically has arisen for discussion within the wider gaming community as players of the game find various ingenious methods of scamming, deceiving, or attacking each other. One infamous example was a corporate infiltration and heist where one corporation infiltrated a target corporation over the course of nearly a year. They then performed a virtual assassination on the target's CEO and proceeded to steal corporate property to which they had gained access. The target corporation lost billions of ISK worth of property (amounting to about $16,500 USD) and a great deal of prestige; the CEO's expensive ship and cybernetic implants were destroyed in the attack. Events of this nature are debated both inside the game world and in the media.\n\nIn 2009, a player alliance known as Goonswarm was contacted by a disgruntled director of rival alliance Band of Brothers, one of the largest alliances in the game at that time. The defecting director then stripped Band of Brothers of a large quantity of assets including ships, money and territory, and disbanded the alliance.\n\nA player-run bank known as 'EBank' was also involved in controversy in 2009 when Ricdic, the CEO of the bank, withdrew 200 billion ISK and converted it into real world currency to pay for medical expenses.\n\nSuch dangers are an inherent part of \"Eve Online\"'s virtual economy and thus are purposely not dealt with by the developers. Players are expected to make financial decisions based (among other factors) on the possibility of other players' fiduciary malfeasance, much as in real-life economics.\n\nThe most common acts of piracy in Eve are , gate camping, and small gang warfare. Every pirate corporation in \"Eve Online\" has its own preferred activities, strategies, and tactics. Some utilize cheap but high damage ships to \"suicide gank\" and kill players in high-security space (where they should theoretically be safe) quickly before CONCORD law enforcement units arrive to destroy them (thus \"suiciding\"), in the knowledge that certain ships they destroy will be carrying valuable commodities or expensive gear capable of recovering the cost of the pirate vessels lost in the gank. Others choose to set up gate camping fleets consisting of varied ship types and roles capable of rapidly disabling and destroying any unwitting passersby, thereby locking down star systems and killing or robbing whoever tries to pass through. Other pirates choose to roam in very fast and versatile skirmish ships, such as interceptors, recons, or heavy assault ships, killing anyone they encounter in lightning attacks. On gaining the upper hand in a fight many pirates will ask the victim for an ISK ransom, in exchange for sparing their ship or escape pod.\n\nSuicide ganking has declined in overall popularity since the release of the \"Crucible\" expansion; while players may opt to insure their ships against loss using in-game currency, pilots will no longer be reimbursed if their ship is destroyed by CONCORD. Such changes have been the subject of intense debate on the game's official forums, with opinions divided on whether or not players should be truly 'safe' while flying.\n\nInstances of developer misconduct in \"Eve Online\" have been substantiated, leading to debates and controversy. On February 9, 2007, a player known as Kugutsumen hacked an enemy corporation's private forum to find out and reveal that \"Eve Online\" developer t20 had provided his corporation, Reikoku, with six valuable blueprints, giving them an advantage over competing corporations. Some within the \"Eve Online\" community asked for t20's dismissal. While an apology letter was left for the community in the form of a dev blog, he remained an \"Eve Online\" developer until late 2008. Kugutsumen was permanently banned from the \"Eve Online\" universe for violating the game's terms of service and end-user license agreement by revealing t20's real name.\n\nIn response to public concerns, CCP decided to set up an internal affairs division whose responsibility is to monitor the activities of both privileged and player accounts operated by CCP staff in-game.\n\nIn part due to the matters above, CCP invited users to stand for the first Council of Stellar Management (CSM) in March 2008, resulting in 66 candidates seeking election to nine positions. It was a requirement that candidates release their full real names in addition to stating their in-game details. In May, after a two-week voting period, the first Council was elected, comprising seven men and two women; three each from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, two from the USA and one from Denmark, their ages ranging from 17 to 52.\n\nThe remit of the Council has been changed since it was first proposed and is now seen by CCP primarily as a route for players to make requests for changes and improvements to the game mechanics, presentation, and game content of \"Eve Online\". The first four Councils served for six months, after which new ones were to be elected. Each individual was only permitted to serve twice. Each CSM gets the authority to put requests to CCP three times during their term of office which CCP have stated must be answered; once in person in Iceland and twice by e-mail, with most of the costs of their visit to Iceland being borne by CCP. The rules were changed for the fifth CSM to feature one-year terms with two Iceland trips and four email requests, as well as the abolition of the two-term limit.\n\nThe first meeting of the CSM with CCP took place in Reykjavik between June 19 and 23, 2008, and included not only the nine CSM members but a number of developers, designers, game masters, and producers from CCP and members of print and video media. Matters discussed by players on the \"Eve Online\" forums were reviewed in detail and whilst some were rejected for technical reasons, many were accepted by CCP as useful improvements to the game which would be introduced either in an early so-called point release or added to the development plans for a future major update.\n\nNominations for the second CSM opened on September 26, 2008, with voting commencing on November 9. The following third Council of Stellar Management included a modified age restriction: candidates under the age of 21 are then no longer eligible as CSM members.\n\nBeginning with the eighth CSM, a single transferable vote system was introduced, allowing voters to select up to 14 candidates.\n\nUsers start playing \"Eve Online\" by creating a free account (known as an Alpha account), being invited to the game as via the game's Recruit-A-Friend program, or purchasing the \"Eve Online\" Special Edition retail box. Alpha accounts are freely available through both the \"Eve Online\" website and the Steam content delivery system. The accounts through the Recruit-A-Friend program function identically to normal Alpha accounts, but start with some additional unallocated skill points (worth approximately 5-6 days worth of training time) on their first character. In addition, if the recruited account is subsequently converted to a subscription account (known as an Omega account), the referrer is rewarded with 30 free days of subscription time or the equivalent amount of PLEX.\n\nAlpha accounts are free and allow players to access most of the \"Eve Online\" game, with exceptions. Alpha players cannot train skills for some advanced ship types or modules, including all Tech 2 ships and most Tech 2 modules. Alpha accounts can also only passive train up to 5 million skill points using the normal skill training system. After that limit, the only way they can acquire more skill points is by converting to Omega, or by using skill point injectors (available on the in-game market). In December, 2017, an additional item called a Daily Alpha Injector was added to the game, available for purchase via the official game store for PLEX. This item is only usable by Alpha accounts, is only usable once per day, awards an amount of skill points roughly equal to a full 24 hours of training time, and costs slightly more than 1/30th as much as a 30 day subscription. This allows Alpha accounts to progress at a similar rate and cost to an Omega account even beyond the 5 million skill point limit, but to purchase that progression in smaller increments than a full 30-day subscription. Alpha accounts are limited to a specific list of skills and levels in those skills, and are unable to inject skill points into disallowed skills or beyond the maximum level in allowed skills. Alpha accounts have approximately 20.5 million skillpoints worth of skills available to them.\n\nOmega accounts that lapse on their subscription are downgraded to Alpha accounts. These accounts don't \"lose\" any skill points or skills, but any skills or skill levels beyond those allowed for an Alpha account are inactive and cannot be used to fulfill the prerequisites of modules or ships, nor do the passive effects of those skills take effect. Functionally, Omega accounts that lapse into Alpha accounts can only access and use any of those skills that are on the Alpha skill list (and thus may not be able to fly ships that they could as an Omega pilot), but if they later upgrade back to Omega, they regain access to their full skill list.\n\nAs of June 2008, Eve Time Codes (or ETCs) are available exclusively in 60-day increments. Before then, they were also offered in 30-, 50-, 90-, 100- and 120-day increments. Discontinued cards remain valid. Players using ETCs are treated like normal subscribers in every way. Eve Time Codes are available through CCP's online store as well as via online resellers. Cards purchased through resellers are usually delivered through email for immediate use while codes issued through the \"Eve Online\" store are issued via postal mail or in-game item, and as such ETCs do not violate the EULA and can be bought and sold within the game. There are no distinguishing differences in functionality between digital and hard-copy codes. Both provide the exact amount of specified game time, are entered into the same account section and can be exchanged between players for ISK using a secure exchange system facilitated by a \"Timecode Bazaar\" forum.\n\nIn November 2008, CCP introduced PLEX, the CONCORD Pilots License EXtension, which is an in-game item that can be used to extend a subscription for 30 days. PLEX can be purchased on the Eve Online website for real money, or inside the game for ISK. 60-day ETCs can be converted to two 30-day PLEX within the Eve Online client, which can then be sold via the in-game market. PLEX is the reason that the cost of in-game assets can be translated into real-life money. As the price of a PLEX is around €15, it can be calculated how much a certain ship or implant is theoretically worth in a real currency.\n\nIn May 2017, CCP converted PLEX into smaller increments. All existing PLEX were converted to 500 of the new PLEX (which are exclusively referred to as PLEX in-game, rather than Pilot License EXtension, though the acronym meaning remains unchanged). 30 days subscriptions now cost 500 PLEX, effectively the same cost as previously. The previous premium currency, Aurum, was retired and converted to PLEX at the same exchange rate as PLEX could be exchanged for Aurum previously (1 old PLEX per 3500 Aurum, so 1 new PLEX per 7 Aurum), provided the account had at least 1000 Aurum to convert. All items in the premium store that used to cost Aurum now cost an equivalent number of PLEX. This allowed CCP to market more granular deals on PLEX, as well as price certain services for PLEX with more granularity. For example, Multiple Character Training used to cost 1 PLEX, the same prices as 30 days of subscription time, but now costs 450 PLEX, 90% of the cost of 30 days of subscription time. In the same patch, CCP also introduced the PLEX Vault, a safe and secure way of moving PLEX around in-game without risking the item being lost if one's ship were destroyed.\n\nAs of March 10, 2009, a boxed edition is available in shops. The distribution is being managed by Atari. The boxed edition includes a 60-day ETC, instant standings update to facilitate quicker entry into factional warfare, exclusive online new player guide, and an exclusive expanded cargo hold shuttle. Although marketed as included in the retail box, the bonus items are only available to new accounts created with the 60-day ETC.\n\n\"Eve Online\" received mixed reviews at the launch of the game in 2003 but more favorable reviews later in its lifecycle. The original version received 75% on GameRankings and 69/100 on Metacritic. The \"Special Edition\" released in 2009 has an aggregate score of 88/100 on Metacritic.\n\nIn 2013, \"PC Gamer\" placed \"Eve Online\" at #12 on their list of 100 Greatest Games of All Time.\n\nIn June 2013, the Museum of Modern Art added \"Eve Online\" to its permanent collection of video games. The game is showcased as a \"day in the universe\" video. To create this, CCP Games called upon \"Eve Online\"s large player-base to provide gameplay footage of the game. Furthermore, CCP Games contributed a large amount of data from its servers, which were compiled to produce a \"stunning view\" of the accomplishments of player collaborations.\n\n\nIn 2013, CCP said that they had made deals to create both a comic book and a television series based on \"Eve Online\". The comic, titled \"Eve: True Stories\", was released by Dark Horse Comics and made available for free online in 2014. Following this, a physical version of the graphic novel containing bonus material was made available that same year. To make the television series, CCP signed a deal with Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur. As of May 2013, no information has been given about the title or the premiere date of the television series. The storylines from both the graphic novel and the television series will be based on actual player-driven events that happened in the game.\n\n\n"}

The tortoise was believed to be entirely extinct in the mid-20th century, until Hungarian malacologist József Vágvölgyi spotted Lonesome George on the Galapagos island of Pinta on 1 December 1971. Since then, Lonesome George has been a powerful symbol for conservation efforts in general and for the Galapagos Islands in particular. With his death on 24 June 2012, the subspecies is again believed to be extinct. With the discovery of 17 hybrid Pinta tortoises located at nearby Wolf Volcano a plan has been made to attempt to breed the subspecies back into a pure state.\n\nNot all species that are extinct in the wild are rare. For example, \"Ameca splendens\", though extinct in the wild, was a popular fish among aquarists for some time, but hobbyist stocks have declined quite a lot more recently, placing its survival in jeopardy. However, the ultimate purpose of preserving biodiversity is to maintain ecological function. When a species exists only in captivity, it is ecologically extinct.\n\nReintroduction is the deliberate release of species into the wild, from captivity or relocated from other areas where the species survives. This may be an option for certain species that are endangered or extinct in the wild. However, it may be difficult to reintroduce EW species into the wild, even if their natural habitats were restored, because survival techniques, which are often passed from parents to offspring during parenting, may be lost. While conservation efforts may preserve some of the genetics of a species, the species may never fully recover due to the loss of the natural memetics of the species.\n\nAn example of a successful reintroduction of an EW species is Przewalski's horse, which as of 2018 is considered to be an Endangered species, following reintroduction started in the 1990s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "399672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=399672", "title": "Helen Dale", "text": "Helen Dale\n\nHelen Dale (born Helen Darville; 24 January 1972), known for a time by her pen name Helen Demidenko, is an Australian writer and lawyer. She served as a senior adviser to David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat member of the Australian Senate, from 2014 through to the election in 2016. She has been a contributing writer to \"Quillette\" since 2017.\n\nA daughter of British immigrants, Darville was educated at Redeemer Lutheran College in Rochedale, a suburb of Brisbane. While studying English literature at the University of Queensland, she wrote \"The Hand that Signed the Paper,\" a novel about a Ukrainian family who collaborated with the Nazis in the Holocaust. In 1993, the novel won The Australian/Vogel Literary Award for an unpublished manuscript.\n\nDale published her book in 1994 under the pseudonym Helen Demidenko and won the Miles Franklin Award, becoming the award's youngest winner. The following year, she was the subject of a major Australian literary controversy because she had falsely claimed Ukrainian ancestry as part of the basis of the book (and her pseudonym). The misrepresentation has been described as a \"literary hoax\" in \"The Sydney Morning Herald.\" The novel was subsequently reissued under her legal name, then Helen Darville. It won the 1995 Australian Literary Society Gold Medal.\n\nAfter teaching, Dale returned to university, gaining her law degree in 2002. She later did post-graduate law study at Oxford and completed an LLB degree in 2012 at the University of Edinburgh. She returned to Australia and became a senior adviser to David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat member of the Australian Senate, but at the end of May 2016 Leyonhjelm revealed that Dale had left his employ.\n\nDarville's debut novel, \"The Hand that Signed the Paper\", tells the story of a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of Stalinist purges and state-imposed poverty and famine. The family comprises the parents, a daughter, and two sons. They suffer abuse by the drunken local commissar and are refused treatment by the village doctor and his wife (a secular Jew). Many Ukrainians hail the German invaders as liberators from Soviet oppression. Many volunteered for the German armed forces—Wehrmacht, SS, and Ordnungspolizei. The novel stresses the arbitrariness of the assignments to military units. A Ukrainian could as easily end up fighting on the front alongside the Wehrmacht as be in a death squad.\n\nThe two young brothers are separated in military assignments: 16-year-old Evheny to Nazi Einsatzgruppen C (a mobile killing squad) and the elder 19-year-old Vitaly to the SS training facility for Ukrainians at Trawniki in Poland. Evheny is implicated in the massacre at Babi Yar outside Kiev, while Vitaly is posted to Treblinka extermination camp as a guard. Evheny is later sent to a front-line Waffen SS formation on the Eastern Front, while Vitaly is posted to northern Italy. He is part of German anti-partisan activity in the wake of Italy's withdrawal from the Axis alliance.\n\nThe novel is told primarily from the point of view of Kateryna, sister of the two brothers, and Magda, Vitaly's common-law wife from the Polish village near the Treblinka extermination camp. Kateryna has a relationship with a German SS Hauptsturmführer. Magda assists a Jewish prisoner to escape after the Treblinka prisoner revolt in August 1943. The family's story is gradually revealed by Fiona, Evheny's Australian-born daughter, who starts investigating the past after her uncle Vitaly is charged in the early 1990s with war crimes in World War II.\n\nThe novel was frank about the anti-semitism of its major characters (who blame Jews for the excesses of Communism), and Darville represented the lives of Ukrainian military men in a sympathetic manner, rather than featuring their victims as is more usual in Holocaust literature. These elements attracted accusations of antisemitism and condemnation of the book by leaders of Australia's Jewish community. There was a perception that the attitudes of the author \"Helen Demidenko\" may have been informed by her Ukrainian ethnic identity, until her pseudonym was revealed along with her false representation of the book as history.\n\nThe novel won the Miles Franklin Award, one of the most prestigious literary awards in Australia. At the time, the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name. This promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature.\n\nDespite the adverse publicity for the author, the novel won the 1995 Australian Literary Society Gold Medal.\n\nWhen Dale submitted her novel to the University of Queensland Press in 1993, she said it was based upon recorded interviews with her own relatives, among others her uncle \"Vitaly Demidenko\". After the awards, the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" mistakenly reported in 2005 that the novel had been submitted as a non-fiction book. The author's 1993 note accompanying her manuscript had read: \"The things narrated in this book really happened, the things they did [are] historical actualities.\" Then Dale wrote that she was presenting her book as fiction, saying: \"But this is also a work of fiction. I have presented it as fiction...\"\n\nThe controversy that surrounded \"The Hand that Signed the Paper\" inspired the publication in 1996 of two books that assessed the novel and issues of authenticity: Robert Manne's \"The Culture of Forgetting: Helen Demidenko and the Holocaust\" and Andrew Riemer's \"The Demidenko Debate\". Manne is very critical of Darville's book. Riemer is not, believing her approach was consistent with fiction, even if she tried to exaggerate the specific historic basis of her work.\n\nIn 1995, Darville published a short story, \"Pieces of the Puzzle\", in the Australian culture journal \"Meanjin\". The byline was 'Demidenko', although the journal noted that the author had \"taken back\" her legal name of Darville. She has said that she had met Ukrainian witnesses to the war and the Holocaust, and based the story on their accounts. The Simon Wiesenthal Center wrote to her demanding that she identify these possible war criminals.\n\nDale was briefly a columnist with the Brisbane daily newspaper \"The Courier-Mail\". She was dismissed for accusations of plagiarism after repeating jokes originally from the 'Evil Overlord List' in one of her columns and passing them off as her own. She continued to write freelance features for other News Corporation newspapers and magazines, and occasionally the Fairfax press. In 2017, an investigation by BuzzFeed revealed that Dale had also plagiarised a number of social media posts in her Twitter and Facebook feeds. BuzzFeed asked Dale why she had been lifting the tweets. She replied over Twitter direct message: \"Cos it's amusing and I don't like Twitter. And don't you have more important stuff to be writing about?\"\n\nIn 2000, Darville was again accused of anti-semitism after interviewing David Irving, a Holocaust denier, for \"Australian Style\" magazine during his libel trial in London. (It was decided against him.) She wrote a post-September 11 article in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\nAfter working as a secondary teacher for several years in Australia and the UK, Darville returned to the University of Queensland in 2002 to study law. Graduating with a first class honours degree in law in 2005,she commenced work as a judge's associate for Peter Dutney, a justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland.\n\nPreviously a regular contributor to the libertarian group blog Catallaxy files under the name 'skepticlawyer', Darville now has her own blog in this name.\n\nSince gaining her law degree, Darville has also appeared on the SBS program \"Insight\", and as a guest of the University of Melbourne's Publishing and Communications Program. She is associated with the Australian Skeptics, and has written for both their in-house magazine and \"Quadrant,\" a conservative journal. In 2007 Darville was reported to be working on a second novel.\n\nDale completed the Bachelor of Civil Law programme at the University of Oxford, where she was a member of Brasenose College. In 2008 she started reading for an MPhil in Law (Jurisprudence). She completed a Graduate LLB degree at the University of Edinburgh School of Law in 2012. During that time she won the Law Society of Scotland's student essay competition. The topic of her prize-winning essay was same-sex marriage. Dale completed a post-graduate qualification before beginning work in 2013 as a trainee solicitor with the law firm MBM Commercial. \n\nDarville is reported to have worked variously as a graphic designer, property law lecturer, and physical education teacher.\n\nIn 2014, Dale returned to Australia, becoming a senior adviser to David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat member of the Australian Senate. She resigned during the election campaign in 2016.\n\nShe has recently written a new two-part novel titled \"Kingdom of the Wicked\". The first book, \"Rules\", came out in 2017 and the second, \"Order\", in 2018. It is a reimagining of the trial of Jesus Christ at the hands of Pontius Pilate in a technologically sophisticated Roman Empire.\n\n"}
{"id": "50415058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50415058", "title": "High-definition television in Australia", "text": "High-definition television in Australia\n\nHigh-definition television in Australia is available via cable, IPTV, satellite and terrestrial television. The first high-definition broadcasts began in 2001 and since then the number of channels available to view has grown to a maximum of 27 that can be viewed on pay-TV service, Foxtel.\n\nOn 1 January 2002, the ABC began a prime-time simulcast of ABC's Sydney station ABN, except that it had no watermark and was upconverted from standard definition to 1080i high definition. On 1 January 2005 it changed to 576p to accommodate the launch of new channel ABC2 and gradually expanded its operating hours.\n\nOn 1 January 2008, the ABC's high definition simulcast was rebranded as ABC HD, relaunching as a high definition multichannel with its own logo and branding. The channel was also enhanced to 720p to mark the start of native high-definition content.\n\nThroughout its multichannel era, ABC HD continued providing a high definition simulcast of ABN Sydney. As a result, viewers outside of New South Wales would see Sydney-based news bulletins and other localised content. The purpose of this as of 2008, was to provide high-definition versions of ABC1 shows when available (Prior to this, the broadcaster relied on regulation exemptions that allowed it to meet a high-definition quota using content upscaled from standard definition).\n\nThere were exceptions to the ABC1 simulcast: During the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, ABC HD became a dedicated sports broadcaster, simulcasting the dedicated coverage on ABC2 for most of the day. The 2009 VFL Grand Final was shown exclusively live on ABC HD. For a time up until ABC HD branding ceased, ABC HD screened a \"7:30 Select\" national highlights package instead of the Sydney version of \"Stateline\".\n\nOn 10 June 2010, ABC HD's unique branding was replaced with that of ABC1, reverting the channel to an ABN Sydney simulcast. ABC HD ceased being a simulcast of ABC1 from 6 July 2010 in Tasmania and the ACT; 7 July 2010 in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory; and on 8 July 2010 in Victoria and New South Wales, all replaced by a looped pre-launch promotion for ABC News 24 on channel 24. This made ABC the second broadcaster in Australia to permanently discontinue the high definition simulcast of its main channel, following the removal of Ten HD to create Ten's former sports and now entertainment channel One in 2009.\n\nABC Director of Television Richard Finlayson confirmed that the ABC will recommence simulcasting in HD in June 2016. However, in contrast to its past, ABC HD will provide regional-specific simulcasting, not just a nationwide simulcast of ABN Sydney. As a result, ABC News 24 will be reduced to a standard definition broadcast.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, the ABC HD recommenced simulcasting in high definition, upgrade to 1080i high-definition format via Freeview and Optus D1. As a result, ABC News 24 was reduced to a standard definition broadcast on channel 24.\n\nIn 2004, after the 2001 introduction of digital terrestrial television in Australia, the Seven Network began a part-time high definition simulcast on digital channel 70 under the name 7 HD Digital. This simulcast showcased native high definition content alongside standard definition services on Seven. During the times that native high definition content was unavailable for simulcasting, a promo loop that showcased extracts from a variety of Seven's programs was broadcast.\n\n7HD was officially announced on 15 September 2007, with the Seven West Media announcing their intention to start a high definition multichannel, that was initially expected to launch in December 2007. However, 7HD became the first Free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, when it launched prior on 15 October 2007, with \"25th Hour\" being the first program broadcast at 10:30pm.\n\nThe channel replaced Seven's existing high definition service 7 HD Digital, a part-time simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services. Due to an amendment of the \"Broadcasting Services Act 1992\" in 2006, the \"Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital television) Act 2006\", television networks are now permitted to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition. The channel expanded its broadcast schedule on 10 December 2007 to include daytime programming which had previously been a full simulcast of the main channel. 7HD breakaway programming ceased transmission on Sunday 4 October 2009 in preparation for the launch of 7TWO a few weeks later on 1 November. 7HD then returned to being a full high definition simulcast of Seven, before finally being replaced by 7mate on 25 September 2010.\n\nOn 10 May 2016, 7HD returned as a high definition simulcast on channel 70.\n\nFrom the launch of digital TV on 1 January 2001, the Nine Network's high definition service, a simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services, was heavily simulcasting Nine's standard definition content upconverted to HD. From 2002, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by Network Ten.\n\n2002 saw the first revenue-generating broadcast in native HD in Australia, with the drama Judging Amy. Nine increased its native HD output in the lead-up to the commencement of the HD quota on 1 July 2003, from which point it broadcast a minimum of 1,040 hours of native HD content per year. The largest portion of this was The Today Show.\n\n9HD was officially announced as a part-time (or \"breakaway\") multichannel on 27 September 2007, to replace the Nine Network's existing high definition simulcast service through the use of an amendment to the \"Broadcasting Services Act 1992\" in 2006. The \"Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital television) Act 2006\" permitted television networks to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition.\n\nAlthough originally expected to be the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, meant that 9HD was not the first high definition multichannel in Australia. Following this, plans for a November launch in 2007 were postponed until 2008. On 10 March 2008, PBL Media announced that it would launch the channel on 17 March 2008 at 10:30pm, with its first program, \"Nightline\".\n\nThe re-branded 9HD officially commenced transmission on 17 March 2008 from PBL Media's four metropolitan owned-and-operated stations, TCN Sydney, GTV Melbourne, QTQ Brisbane and NTD Darwin, in addition to WIN Corporation's two metropolitan stations NWS Adelaide, and STW Perth as well as on its regional stations RTQ Queensland, WIN southern New South Wales, VTV Victoria, and TVT Tasmania. The first official program on launch night began at 19:00, Nine News's flagship daily main national nightly television news bulletin program \"Nine Television News\".\n\nAll 9HD breakaway programming ceased transmission on Sunday 2 August 2009 in preparation for the launch of GO! (now 9Go!) on 9 August. As a result, 9HD became a full simulcast of Nine's main channel.\n\n9HD was replaced by the 9Gem multichannel on 26 September 2010, which unlike the previous incarnation, was a full-time breakaway and branded separately (with one exception being the London Olympics). This removed the HD simulcast of Channel Nine entirely to allow a third channel to fit on Nine's DVB-T multiplex (due to technical and regulatory limitations). As a result, Nine lost all youth, news and comedy content in HD, but instead screened female, crime and lifestyle content on its only HD facility.\n\nFor the purposes of some sport such as cricket, GEM was still used on an occasional basis to broadcast HD under the Wide World of Sports brand, though not necessarily as a simulcast with Nine. As such, this was generally limited to events outside of prime time, while those with more prominence continued to be shown on the Nine Network.\n\nOn 26 November 2015, Nine recommenced simulcasting in HD on channel 90. As a result, 9Gem was moved to channel 92 and reduced to standard definition.\n\nThis revival marked 9HD's switch to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC broadcasting, allowing the broadcaster to operate at full quality in 1920x1080i50 resolution using a lower bitrate than in 2007. This gives the network the ability to provide all the other multichannel services launched since 2009, such as 9Go!, at the same time.\n\nFrom the revamp of its production and circle logo and of the slogan \"Seriously Ten\" on 1 February 2001, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by Network Ten.\n\nTen HD was officially announced on 14 September 2007, to replace Network Ten's existing high definition service, a simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services, through the use of an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in 2006. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Act 2006 permitted television networks to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition.\n\nAlthough originally expected to be the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, the surprise launch of Seven Media Group's HD offering, 7HD, on 15 October 2007, two months before transmissions were scheduled to begin, meant that Ten HD was launched as the second high-definition multichannel in Australia. PBL Media announced the creation of a similar multichannel, 9HD, on 27 September, which was launched on 17 March 2008.\n\nTen's parent company, and shareholder in metropolitan ratings system OzTAM, Ten Network Holdings Limited, began discussions with the ratings system operator to have digital multichannels, such as Ten HD and ABC2, included in television ratings for the first time on 17 September 2007. As well as this, on the same day, it was announced that the national weekend editions of Ten News would be timeshifted from Ten onto Ten HD, an hour delayed at 6 pm, to directly compete with Seven News and National Nine News. This would have seen Ten News formally broadcast at 6 pm for the first time since 1992, however, the timeslot was later amended to 5.30 pm.\n\nIn preparation for the launch of Ten HD, Ten's digital terrestrial channel line-up was updated on 19 November 2007, with changes consisting of LCN1 redirecting Network Ten's current high-definition simulcast. Following this, on 21 November 2007, Ten Network Holdings Limited announced that it would launch the channel on 16 December 2007 at 5.00 pm, with the first program, \"Totally Wild\".\n\nTen HD officially commenced transmission on 16 December 2007 from the network's five metropolitan owned-and-operated stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. Prior to the official launch, at 5.00 pm the first program, Totally Wild, was broadcast. Following this, for the first time since 1992, Ten News and Sports Tonight were broadcast in direct competition with Seven News and National Nine News, timeshifted by thirty minutes to 5.30 pm and 6.00 pm respectively.\n\nThe first official program on launch night began at 8.30 pm, the 2001 movie Black Hawk Down. This was followed by Bon Jovi's Lost Highway Tour at 11.30 pm and Video Hits Presents: The Music of Supernatural at 12.25 am. Video Hits Up-Late marked the end of the first night of transmission for Ten HD at 12.50 am.\n\nIn the lead-up to the opening night, the channel promised up to eleven hours of time-shifted programming from Ten in addition to fifty hours of exclusive programming, which included live sport, entertainment, films, documentaries, science fiction and news. This consisted of six movies per week, in addition to National Geographic documentaries in the afternoon, from 3pm to 5pm, music-oriented programming following the Sunday Night Movie, along with a primetime breakaway schedule on Thursdays and from 10.30 pm to 11.30 pm Monday to Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to high definition broadcasting on channel 1, a standard definition simulcast of Ten HD was provided on channel 11 as Ten SD2.\n\nFrom 2009, commercial networks in Australia were allowed to broadcast a standard definition subchannel. Rather than introduce a new digital service, Ten decided to relaunch Ten HD as a sports-only channel, to be named One HD (now One), and use its standard definition simulcast on channel 11 to broadcast a standard definition simulcast called One SD. Before One HD's official launch, most breakaway programming shown on Ten HD ceased from 1 January 2009, and only showed a high-definition broadcast of the existing Ten digital service, along with a few sports-based breakaway programs. Ten HD officially shut down on 25 March 2009, with One HD launching the following day.\n\nAfter the Nine Network restarted broadcasting 9HD in November 2015, Ten confirmed that it was working on rebroadcasting Ten HD. However, they did not put a time frame on it, stating that they are \"working through some technical and rights issues\". On 11 February 2016, some smart TVs began receiving notification messages advising of Ten HD through a \"ghost broadcast\" that soon disappeared.\n\nTen later recommenced simulcasting in high definition on 2 March 2016 on channel 13 from 3pm, in time for the 2016 season of the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship. As a result, One was reduced to a standard definition broadcast on both channel 1 and channel 12.\n\nTen uses MPEG-4 technology to broadcast the channel.\n\nThe SBS HD multichannel was launched on 14 December 2006. It broadcasts identical programming to SBS, but in 1080i HD via Freeview and Optus D1.\n\nThe Freeview brand was launched in November 2008 with teaser commercials promising 15 channels in 2009. The first new \"Freeview\" channel started on 26 March 2009 with Network Ten's One sports channel. Further advertising began on 26 April 2009, with the first Freeview certified devices appearing in retailers from May 2009. In June 2010, the second phase of devices, marked as \"Freeview EPG\" devices, became available in retail stores, designed to work with the newly launched interactive EPG built on MHEG-5. This Freeview EPG will cease operating on 24 November 2017.\n\nFoxtel has been carrying HD channels since 2008. it has over 20 HD channels, a mix of basic and premium subscription, free-to-air and free-to-view services.\n\nHD broadcasts are received using the Foxtel IQ3 service or a Foxtel HD+ receiver. A selection of HD push-video on demand content is also available through Foxtel Anytime on Foxtel HD+ receivers.\n\nABC News, 7mate, 7HD, 9HD, Ten HD, SBS HD along with regional networks WIN HD, Prime7HD and 9HD with NBN are available unencrypted and without subscription on digital satellite, and may be received by anybody with suitable equipment – a high-definition satellite receiver and a satellite dish.\n\n"}

{"id": "1530409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1530409", "title": "LGBT themes in video games", "text": "LGBT themes in video games\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) characters have been depicted in video games since the 1980s. In the history of video games, LGBT characters have been almost nonexistent for a long time, reflecting the overall heteronormativity of the medium. While there has been a trend towards greater representation of LGBT people in video games, they are frequently identified as LGBT in secondary material, such as comics, rather than in the games themselves.\n\nA number of recurring tropes, themes and archetypes have developed in the gaming industry in regard to LGBTQ+ identity. These are similar to how other forms of popular culture, such as Hollywood films and TV shows, dealt with LGBTQ+ themes.\n\nAs in other media, LGBT characters in games often suffer from the \"bury your gays\" trope, a long-lasting narrative convention that requires that LGBT characters die or meet another unhappy ending. According to \"Kotaku\", these characters are \"largely defined by a pain that their straight counterparts do not share\". Facing challenges that \"serve as an in-world analogy for anti-LGBTQ bigotry\", they are defined by tragedy that denies them a chance at happiness.\n\nA common method of introducing LGBT characters is to reveal their sexual orientation through gender inversion. A male character's homosexuality is often indicated by making him a sissy character with effeminate or flamboyant mannerisms, dress, and speech. The underlying assumption is that homosexuals are also frequently transgender and, therefore, possess mannerisms stereotypical of the opposite sex. This technique has been widely used in Hollywood movies (to circumvent the Production Code's ban on \"sexual perversion\"), as well as in Vaudeville. Although mainly used in video games for its comedic value, gender confusion has also been used as a tool to offer social commentary about sexism or homophobia. The censorship codes of Nintendo and Sega limited the usage of gender inversion to exclusion of cross-dressing until 1994.\n\nThe \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" character Birdo, who was described as thinking he was a girl and wanting to be called \"Birdetta\" in early editions of the English instruction manual (the Japanese one simply stating that Catherine, as the character is known in Japan, wishes to be called \"Cassie\" because it sounds cuter), was changed to a more definite female until \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" introduced the concept of Birdo's gender being \"indeterminate\". Similarly, the Infocom game \"Circuit's Edge\" features several transgender characters.\n\nCapcom created \"Final Fight\" for the arcade in 1989. The game involved players choosing among three fighters on a quest to save the mayor's daughter, who was kidnapped by a criminal gang known as Mad Gear. In 1990, Capcom presented Nintendo with a version of the game for the 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). According to David Sheff's book \"Game Over\", Nintendo stated that Capcom could not put a female enemy in a video game published for the SNES, as that violated Nintendo's ban on violence against women. Capcom countered that there were no female enemies in the game, revealing that the female characters Roxy and Poison were transsexuals. The characters were nevertheless removed from the international versions of the SNES port (the Japanese Super Famicom version retained the characters). However, in 1993, Sega obtained the rights to release the game for their Sega CD. In a sign of Sega's more liberal policies, Poison and Roxy could remain in the international versions, but with less-provocative clothing, and there could be no indication of their supposed transgender status. (Sega of America later removed a homosexual boss and unlockable playable character called Ash from the international versions of \"Streets of Rage 3.\")\n\nThe character Vivian in \"\" is hinted at being transgender, but Nintendo removed all references to this in the English translation.\n\nKrem in \"Dragon Age Inquisition\" is openly transgender and is fully accepted by peers. Iron Bull, his close friend, will leave the party if the player character acts transphobic.\n\nIn the 2016 role-playing video game \"\", there is an optional dialogue tree in which the cleric Mizhena mentions that she was raised as a boy, indicating that she is a trans woman. This, along with a reference to the Gamergate controversy, attracted resulting in online harassment and insults towards the developers, especially against the game's writer Amber Scott. The game's Steam, GOG and Metacritic pages were bombarded with complaints that the transgender reference constituted \"political correctness,\" \"LGBT tokenism\", \"SJW pandering\" and pushing a political agenda. On an April 2016 post, Beamdog announced they would expand Mizhena's story, saying in part, \"In retrospect, it would have been better served if we had introduced a transgender character with more development.\" Paul Tumburro of \"CraveOnline\" termed this as \"spineless and disappointing\" stating that Beamdog's founder Trent Oster refused to acknowledge the transphobic criticisms leveled at the game.\n\nIn the 1995 game \"\", an interactive movie point and click adventure, the main character meets more than one homosexual character (amongst them his \"antagonist\"), some of whom express romantic feelings. A semi-historical-subplot about the romantic feelings of Ludwig II is also an important part of the storyline.\n\n\"\" featured a futuristic beauty contest that featured oddly-dressed humans. One person with whom the player can interact is Harold, who is dressed like a woman but is referred to as a man by other characters as well as referring to himself as one. Harold has a very overstated French accent and is effeminate—he could be read as gay, although cross-dressing does not necessarily have a connection to sexuality or gender. The sprite of the character is based on that of George Washington, who also appears in the game.\n\nHaving gay male characters in fighting games can challenge the perception of homosexuality and masculinity. Nevertheless, hints about a particular character's sexual orientation in a fighting game often take the form of stereotypical femininity in an otherwise tough masculine character.\n\nIn 1994, Sega of America made various changes to the fighting game \"Streets of Rage 3\" from its original Japanese counterpart \"Bare Knuckle 3\". Among the changes was the removal of the boss named Ash (with a straight character named Shiva replacing him) who was suspected to be gay due to his attire. Ash was removed from the western edition of the game, but remained a playable character with the aid of the Game Genie. Thus, Sega unintentionally became the first major video game company in the west to give the player the option of choosing a gay character.\n\nThe \"Street Fighter\" character Zangief has long been thought of as being homosexual, since large hairy men are in fact a common stereotypical image of male homosexuals in Japan, although this was disputed in \"Capcom Fighting Evolution\", where he was seen dreaming about women in his ending, though the game is non-canon. Another \"Street Fighter\" character, Eagle, who appears in the original \"Street Fighter,\" as well as in \"Capcom vs. SNK 2\", has been confirmed to be gay, as a tribute to Queen singer Freddie Mercury, whom Eagle is also modelled after, although several of Eagle's quotes clearly displaying his orientation were censored in the North American version of the game. In the more recent \"Super Street Fighter IV\", the female fighter Juri Han is hinted at possibly being a lesbian, especially evident in Chun-Li and Cammy's rival cutscenes where Juri seems to flirt with them before proceeding to trying to kill them. When Juri Han's official profile was first released, it mentioned that she loves large breasts. However, Juri has also been known to flirt with male characters indiscriminately during combat, which could at least indicate bisexuality. In Cammy's Street Fighter V Ending she is implied to have feelings for the character Juni.\n\nIn the \"Guilty Gear\" series, the character Venom is clearly in love with his deceased leader, Zato-1, although his feelings do not seem to have been returned.\n\nLilith Aensland and Morrigan Aensland, Succubi in Capcom's \"Darkstalkers\" series, have been portrayed bisexual, while Q-Bee has suggested the same through her dialogue.\n\nAn obscure game \"Groove on Fight\" is currently the only known fighting game featuring an openly gay couple, the somewhat stereotypical characters Rudolph Gartheimer and Damian Shade.\n\nThe character Rasputin in the \"World Heroes\" series is implied to be homosexual. One of his win poses has him trying to hold his robes down while wind blows them up, reminiscent of the famous Marilyn Monroe pose. He has a special move in World Heroes Perfect called \"The Secret Garden\", in which he pulls characters into bushes and presumably has his way with them while hearts float skyward, a move that only works on male characters.\n\nIn the \"Blazblue\" series, the character Amane Nishiki is a man who wears effeminate Japanese attire, with a fighting style that is both graceful and resembles a dance. He has an apparent attraction to the veteran character, Carl Clover, and wishes for him to join his dance troupe that he is putting together. Another character Makoto Nanaya is openly bisexual and kisses the female character Mai Natsume without a second thought.\n\nIn the \"Mortal Kombat\" series, Kung Jin is a homosexual character. The story mode of \"Mortal Kombat X\" features an exchange between Jin and Raiden that implies Jin's sexuality. Jin's homosexuality was confirmed by NetherRealm Studios cinematic director Dominic Cianciolo. The same game also implies that Mileena and Tanya are in a relationship, or at least show obvious attraction to each other.\n\nIn \"Fighting EX Layer\" the character Sharon has been revealed to be lesbian. Making her one of the first openly lesbian characters in a fighting game.\n\nIn 2001, \"\" featured a bisexual character, Vamp. Solid Snake reveals Vamp's bisexuality in a conversation in which he explains that he was the lover of Scott Dolph, a bisexual Navy commander. The game does not dwell on this point, however, and accepts it as a factor of the character.\n\nThe 2004 prequel \"\" featured male bisexuality (Volgin and Major Raikov), as well as other sexual topics rarely touched upon in popular entertainment, such as sexual sadism (Volgin) and polyamory.\n\nPerhaps one of the most flagrant uses of gay or homoerotic imagery in a comedic manner is the Cho Aniki series, an unusual group of games that uses these themes in such an exaggerated way that players regard it as a parody. The series is best known for its homoerotic overtones, wacky humor and vivid, surreal imagery. In Japan, they are regarded as examples of the \"kuso-ge\" or \"shit game\" genre, which are enjoyed for their kitsch.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 game \"The Last of Us\" (2013) was praised for its gay characters, including teenage protagonist Ellie. GLAAD, the American organization promoting the image of LGBT people in the media, named the supporting character Bill one of \"the most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013\".\n\nSame-sex relationships as an option available to players in video games were first portrayed in the role-playing genre.\n\nThe original Gameboy game titled \"Great Greed\" in the US and \"Bitamīna Oukoku Monogatari\" in Japan, released in September 1992, featured the possibility of your male protagonist's marriage to a variety of characters at the end of the game that included any of the kings daughters (except the eleven year old), the elderly court magician, the queen, and even the king himself. While possibly not the absolute earliest appearance of same sex relationships in video games it is much earlier than the current runner up Fallout 2.\n\n\"Fallout 2\" (1998) was the second game to allow players to marry a character of the same sex, and \"\" (1999) allowed players to engage in a same-sex relationship. \"Fable\" (2004) allowed same-sex marriage among a wide range of domestic activities. In life simulator \"The Sims\" (2000), the sexual orientation of characters was set depending on the player's actions. However, same-sex couples were described as \"roommates\", and they could not get married. Same-sex marriage was made available in the 2009 sequel \"Sims 2\".\n\nBioWare's RPGs, including \"Baldur's Gate\"' (since 1998), \"Mass Effect\" (since 2007) and \"Dragon Age\" (since 2009) are particularly noted for their inclusion of LGBT characters and same-sex romance options. The \"Elder Scrolls\" series made same-sex relationships available in \"Skyrim\" (2011). Among Japanese RPG series, \"Final Fantasy\" allowed same-sex relationships with a patch to \"\" in 2014, and \"Fire Emblem\" is to do so with \"Fire Emblem Fates\" (2016).\n\nThe release of \"The Temple of Elemental Evil\", a role-playing video game developed by Troika Games, created controversy in 2003 due to the availability of the option for a male character to enter a same-sex marriage. In the town of Nulb, a pirate named Bertram begins flirting with male characters in the party and offers a lifetime of love and happiness in exchange for his freedom. This relationship was noted as another example of video games \"pushing the boundaries\" by \"The Guardian\". Game developers and publishers generally did not object to the inclusion of a homosexual story option. Criticism of the relationship came primarily from gamers who felt that gay characters should not be included in video games. Industry observer Matthew D. Barton commented on the irony of so-called \"geeky gamers\", subject to stereotyping themselves, stereotyping gays in their opposition. Producer Tom Decker defended the move, saying in an interview with RPG Vault: \"I particularly felt strongly that since we had several heterosexual marriages available in Hommlet, we should include at least one homosexual encounter in the game and not to make it a stereotyped, over the top situation, but on par with the other relationships available in the game\". Bertram was named #6 on GayGamer.net's Top 20 Gayest Video Game Characters.\n\nUndertale (2015) which won IGN's best PC Game of 2015 features a gender neutral playable main character, Frisk. During the game, depending on the route the player takes, may encounter a dating simulation in which the gender of both parties are unclear and a major plot line is the development of a lesbian relationship between Undyne and Alphys.\n\nIn order to legally release a game for a Nintendo system, a developer must first obtain permission from Nintendo, which reserves the right to preview the games and demand changes before allowing their release. In this way, Nintendo exercises quality control and can prevent any content they deem objectionable or offensive from being released on their systems. Prior to the introduction of the Entertainment Software Rating Board in 1994, a game sold for a Nintendo system could neither display, nor make reference to, illicit drugs, tobacco and alcohol, violence against women, blood and graphic violence, profanity, nudity, religious symbols, political advocacy, or \"sexually suggestive or explicit content.\"\n\nIn 1988, a creature in Nintendo's \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", the miniboss named Birdo, was described in the original instruction manual as thinking he was a girl and wanting to be called \"Birdetta\". This was later censored by Nintendo of America in future appearances of the character. In 1992, Enix was ordered to remove a gay bar from \"Dragon Warrior III\", among other content changes, before the game could be sold for a Nintendo system. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) version of \"Ultima VII\" also had to be substantially altered from its original computer edition in order to remove potentially objectionable content, including ritual murders, and the option to have a male or female \"bedmate\" if the player paid a fee at the buccaneer-run island.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Nintendo had largely abandoned these censorship policies, as they felt the inclusion of ESRB ratings on the packaging would suitably communicate to consumers whether potentially objectionable content could be found in the game. In 2000, British video game developer Rare released \"Banjo-Tooie\" for the Nintendo 64, featuring a gay frog bartender named \"Jolly Roger.\" The frog wanted Banjo and Kazooie to rescue his co-worker, Merry Maggie, a cross-dressing amphibian who appeared to be Jolly Roger's lover. Jolly Roger would return as a playable character in the Game Boy Advance game \"Banjo-Pilot\" (2005). Rare would also release \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" (2001) for the Nintendo 64, featuring an alcoholic squirrel named Conker and his adventures in a world where all of the characters are foul-mouthed creatures who made various dirty jokes in reference to hangovers, homosexuality and oral sex. Enix Corporation re-released \"Dragon Warrior III\" for the Game Boy Color and was allowed to keep all of the original content, provided the game was given a \"Teen\" rating by the ESRB.\n\nAlthough there is no policy against featuring such content, Nintendo has come under fire for omitting the option of same-sex romance and LGBT expression in their franchises (as well as third-party games released on Nintendo Consoles) on several occasions, with the most notable and vocal controversy stemming from the video game \"Tomodachi Life\". Marriage plays a big role in the game, which does not include the option of same-sex marriage.\n\nLike Nintendo, Sega policed the content of games for Sega systems. Unlike Nintendo, Sega's initial system of censorship was more liberal. Their content code allowed games to have blood, more graphic violence, female enemies, and more sexually suggestive themes.\n\nAlthough Sega allowed LGBT themes and characters in games sold for its home console systems, Sega often chose to tone down or erase LGBT characters when porting Asian games to American markets. In \"Phantasy Star II\", a musician's homosexuality was edited so that the only acknowledgment of his sexual orientation was his practice of charging all male characters less money for his music lessons.\n\nIn 1992, when \"Final Fight CD\" was released for the Sega CD and Vendetta was released for the Sega Genesis, minor transgender and homosexual enemies were censored. Sega's \"Streets of Rage 3\" removed a gay villain wearing Village People attire and transformed a transsexual villain into a man with long hair.\n\nIn 1993, Sega developed the Videogame Rating Council to give content-based ratings to all games sold for a Sega system, thus reducing the need for Sega to maintain a content code for its developers. When \"Rise of the Dragon\" was developed by Dynamix for the Sega CD, a transgender bar patron was retained from the original computer edition, as was a gay joke relating to the playable character mistaking his girlfriend for a man with long hair. As a result, the game was given the council's \"MA-17\" rating.\n\nIn 1994, several top gaming publishers formed the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) as the trade association of the video game industry. Shortly after its creation, the ESA established the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to independently assign individual games content ratings and descriptors according to a variety of factors. Identification of sexuality falls under the sexual content description which is allowed for games rated Teen to Adults Only .\n\nFollowing the establishment of the ESRB, console developers relaxed their in-house regulations in favor of ESRB ratings. In 1994, Sega dissolved its Videogame Rating Council after only one year in existence.\n\nMost games made in Japan, Korea and Taiwan are produced for local audiences. In Japanese popular culture, gay and bisexual men were often considered bishōnen, which translates as \"beautiful boys.\" This was also tied to the success in Japan of comic books and animation with open and subtle LGBT characters. A select genre of adult pornographic Japanese games called H-games includes gay male and gay female subgenres. This material generally does not make it over to the west in English, and western reviews of the gay male video games tend to see the homosexuality as a gimmick in an otherwise mediocre game. However, homosexuality, while relatively innocuous among celebrities in Japan, can still be considered an oddity due to Japan's regimented and conservative social structure. Despite a lack of strong social stigma, homosexuality in men is commonly misconstrued with transgenderism and transvestism in Japan and open homosexuality is rare, due to conformity.\n\nThe belief that young, white, heterosexual males were the force driving the industry forward was strongly challenged by the record-breaking success of \"The Sims\". Video game developer Maxis had resisted Will Wright's goal of creating the title on the grounds that \"girls don't play video games.\" The title was seen as unappealing to young heterosexual males. In the 1990s, the industry began to make some effort to market games to women by creating software titles with strong, independent female characters, such as those in \"Tomb Raider\" and \"Resident Evil\". Some video game companies are now moving to further expand their marketing base to include the perceived market of affluent homosexual young men by including LGBT characters and supporting LGBT rights. BioWare included female same-sex scenes in \"Mass Effect,\" female same-sex relationships in Mass Effect 2 and same-sex relationships for either gender in Mass Effect 3, and allowed sexual interaction between any gender groups in \"\". In \"Dragon Age II\", this was taken even further by allowing all romance-able party members to be romanced by either gender (with the exception of a particular DLC-only companion), as opposed to the first game's requirement of choosing between two bisexual rogues.\n\nEven some games that are considered to appeal mainly to the non-traditional demographic continue to censor homosexuality. For instance, despite the tremendous success of \"The Sims\", even the most recent version of the franchise suppresses homosexual identity. Autonomous romantic interactions exist only for heterosexual characters by default. In \"The Sims 3\", players must manually initiate multiple same-sex romantic interactions before a character will be \"converted\" to homosexuality and begin to engage in such interactions autonomously. The town will then be marked gay-friendly, unlocking the autonomy for other characters. If a player does not force at least one character to engage in same-sex advances several times, the player's town will have no visible homosexuality.\n\nCritics of the suppression of gay identity often conclude that, as homosexuality is normalized in broader culture, it will be in video games as well.\n\nA 2006 survey exploring gay gamers was the first academic study of any gamer group. With about 10,000 respondents, the survey exhibited a reverse bell curve of gamer sexuality, with most people identifying as either completely heterosexual or homosexual.\n\nA 2009 academic paper explored the cultural production of LGBT representation in video games and found that factors that would lead to a significant increase in LGBT content included: the presence of motivated producers in the industry (those that are personally, politically, or commercially interested in LGBT content), how the audience for a text or medium is constructed (what the public backlash from both the LGBT community and conservative groups will be, as well as industry-based reprisals in the form of censorship or ratings), the structure of the industry and how it is funded, and how homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgender identities can be represented in the medium.\n\n\n"}

Once she went to a radio station and sang the national anthem of Bolivia, the only song in Spanish that she knew. Later on she was selected as the lead singer by a musical band that participated in a contest in Cochabamba. The popular songs she sang in this occasion were designed to meet the demands of the vast popular segments of the population, mostly descendants of indigenous peoples but who already lived in the cities and spoke Spanish.\nAfterwards, \"Siway Azucena\", a melody composed by her inspired by the music of Northern Potosí, spread throughout the country, the first truly indigenous song to have widespread popular success.\n\nContrary to the prevalent trend of modernization, she started looking deeper into the cultural and musical ways of the Andes and singing in Quechua, rather than Spanish. The main ingredient was not to please the audiences that kept growing but rather to use her music as an expression of rebellion against the predominance of western ways of cultural progress over indigenous ones, as a way to show that this so far subordinated world also had a contribution to make, and as a way to build more harmonious relationships among the peoples of the world. In this quest, she authored and coauthored a number of songs for children: \"Ima sarata munanki\" (\"What kind of corn do you want\"), \"Aylluman kutiripuna\" (\"Let us return to the community\") and many others. These songs became popular with children in rural schools.\n\nThen she went to Paris where her musical evolution continued.\n\nOn April 21, 2006, Snacc President Evo Morales appointed Luzmila Carpio as Bolivia's ambassador to France (Mission that lasted four years, until March 31, 2010).\n\nLuzmila Carpio has been awarded Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the French Republic (Grande Officier de l'Ordre National du Mérite), on June 14, 2011\n\n"}

France represents about 40% of the European manga market and in 2011 manga represented 40% of the comics being published in the country. In 2007, 70% of the comics sold in Germany were manga. In the United States, manga comprises a small (but growing) industry, especially when compared to the inroads that Japanese animation has made in the USA. One example of a manga publisher in the United States, VIZ Media, functions as the American affiliate of the Japanese publishers Shogakukan and Shueisha. The UK has fewer manga publishers than the U.S.\n\nSince written Japanese fiction usually flows from right to left, manga artists draw and publish this way in Japan. When first translating various titles into Western languages, publishers reversed the artwork and layouts in a process known as \"flipping\", so that readers could follow the books from left-to-right. However, various creators (such as Akira Toriyama) did not approve of the modification of their work in this way, and requested that foreign versions retain the right-to-left format of the originals. Soon, due both to fan demand and to the requests of creators, more publishers began offering the option of right-to-left formatting, which has now become commonplace in North America. Left-to-right formatting has gone from the rule to the exception.\n\nTranslated manga often includes notes on details of Japanese culture that foreign audiences may not find familiar.\n\nOne company, TOKYOPOP (founded 1997), produces manga in the United States with the right-to-left format as a highly publicized point-of-difference.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Culture announced in 2015 that it has blacklisted 38 Japanese anime and manga titles from distribution in China, including popular series like Death Note and Attack on Titan online or in print, citing \"scenes of violence, pornography, terrorism and crimes against public morality.\" \n\nManga in Indonesia is published by Elex Media Komputindo, Acolyte, Level Comic, M&C and Gramedia, and has greatly influenced Indonesia's original comic industry.\n\nThe wide distribution of scanlations actually contributes to the growth of publication of bootleg manga, which is printed in lower quality. One of the most notable publisher is Seventh Heaven which publishes bootleg version of One Piece. Many popular titles, such as Bleach, Loki, Magister Nagi, Rose Hip Zero, and Kingdom Hearts, have been pirated, which draws controversy toward manga readers in Indonesia.\n\nManga in the Philippines were imported from the USA and were sold only in specialty stores and in limited copies. The first manga in Filipino language is Doraemon which was published by J-Line Comics and was then followed by Case Closed.\n\nA few local publishing companies like VIVA-PSICOM Publishing feature manga created by local artists whose stories are usually based from popular written books from the writing site Wattpad and are read from left to right instead of the usual right-to-left format for Japanese manga. The very first commercial local manga is She Died, an adaptation of the book written by Wattpad writer HaveYouSeenThisGirl. The art was done by Enjelicious.\n\nIn 2015, VIVA-PSICOM Publishing has announced that they will start publishing manga titles in the Filipino language with the line-up starting with Hiro Mashima's Fairy Tail and Isayama Hajime's Attack on Titan.\n\nIn 2015, Boy's Love manga became popular through the introduction of BL manga by printing company BLACKink. Among the first BL titles to be printed were Poster Boy, Tagila, and Sprinters, all were written in Filipino. BL manga have become bestsellers in the top three bookstore companies in the Philippines since their introduction in 2015.\n\nThe company Chuang Yi publishes manga in English and Chinese in Singapore; some of Chuang Yi's English-language titles are also imported into Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines by Madman Entertainment. Singapore also has its own official Comics Society, led by manga artist Wee Tian Beng, illustrator of the Dream Walker series.\n\nIn Thailand, before 1992, almost all available manga were fast, unlicensed, poor quality bootlegs. However, due to copyright laws, this has changed and copyrights protect nearly all published manga. Thailand's prominent manga publishers include Nation Edutainment, Siam Inter Comics, Vibulkij, and Bongkoch.\n\nMany parents in Thai society are not supportive of manga. In October 2005, there was a television programme broadcast about the dark side of manga with exaggerated details, resulted in many manga being banned. The programme received many complaints and issued an apology to the audience.\n\nIn 2015, Boy's Love manga have become popular in mainstream Thai consumers, leading to television series adapted from BL manga stories since 2016.\n\nFrance has a particularly strong and diverse manga market. Many works published in France belong to genres not well represented outside Japan, such as too adult-oriented drama, or too experimental and \"avant-garde\" works. Early editors like Tonkam have published Hong-Kong authors (Andy Seto, Yu & Lau) or Korean authors (Kim Jae-hwan, Soo & Il, Wan & Weol and Hyun Se Lee) in their \"manga\" collection during 1995/1996 which is quite uncommon. Also, some Japanese authors, such as Jiro Taniguchi, are relatively unknown in other western countries but received much acclaim in France.\n\nSince its introduction in the 1990s, \"manga\" publishing and \"anime\" broadcasting have become intertwined in France, where the most popular and exploited \"shōnen\", \"shōjo\" and \"seinen\" TV series were imported in their paper version. Therefore, Japanese books (\"manga\") were naturally and readily accepted by a large juvenile public who was already familiar with the series and received the \"manga\" as part of their own culture. A strong parallel backup was the emergence of Japanese video games, Nintendo/Sega, which were mostly based on \"manga\" and \"anime\" series.\n\nProducer Jean Chalopin contacted some Japanese studios, such as Toei (who did \"Grendizer\"); and Tokyo Movie Shinsha, Studio Pierrot and Studio Junio produced French-Japanese series. Even though made completely in Japan by character-designers such as Shingo Araki, the first Chalopin production of this type, \"Ulysses 31\" took thematic inspiration from the Greek \"Odyssey\" and graphic influence from Stanley Kubrick's \"\". \"Ulysses 31\" went on sale in 1981, other shows produced by DiC Entertainment followed in 1982, \"Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors\", \"Mysterious Cities of Gold\", later \"M.A.S.K.\", etc. Such series were popular enough to allow the introduction of licensed products such as tee shirts, toys, stickers, mustard glass, mugs or \"keshi\". Also followed a wave of \"anime\" adaptations of European tales by Studio Pierrot and mostly by the Nippon Animation studio, \"e.g.\" Johanna Spyri's \"Heidi, Girl of the Alps\" (1974), Waldemar Bonsels's \"Maya the Honey Bee\" (1975), Hector Malot's \"\" (1977), Cécile Aubry's \"Belle and Sebastian\" (1980), or Jules Verne's \"Around the World with Willy Fog\" (1983), notable adaptation of American works were Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1980) and Alexander Key's \"Future Boy Conan\". Interesting cases are Alexandre Dumas, père's \"The Three Musketeers\" adapted to \"Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds\" (1981) and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes become \"Sherlock Hound\" (1984), both turned human characters into anthropomorph animals.\n\nSuch anthropomophism in tales comes from old and common storytelling traditions in both Japanese and French cultures, including the \"Chōjū giga\" \"emaki\" (the true origins of \"manga\") of Toba Sōjō (1053–1140), and the animal fables of Jean de La Fontaine (1621–1695). Changing humans to anthropomorphized dogs reflects a known form of Cynicism: etymologically speaking, the bite of the Cynic comes from the fact he is a dog (\"cyno\" means \"dog\" in Greek). The adaptations of these popular tales made easier the acceptance and assimilation of semi-Japanese cultural products in countries such as France, Italy or Spain. The localization including credits removal by Saban or DiC, was such that even today, twenty or thirty years later, most of French adults who have watched series like \"Calimero\" (1974) adapted from an Italian novel, \"Wanpaku Omukashi Kum Kum\" (1975), \"Barbapapa\" (1977) adapted from a French novel, or \"Monchichi\" (1980) as kids don't even know they were not local animation but \"Japananimation\" created in Japan.\n\nIn 1986 and 1987 three new private or privatized television channels appeared on French airwaves. An aggressive struggle for audience, especially on children television shows, started between the two public and the two private channels. After the private channels lost market share, they counter-attacked with a non-Japanese lineup, mostly American productions such as Hanna-Barbera. This ploy failed, and TF1 remained pre-eminent in children's TV shows with its Japanese licenses.\n\nIn 1991 French theaters showed an \"anime\" feature-film for the first time: Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira\", a teen-rated, SF movie supported by manga publisher Glénat. TF1 Video edited the video (VHS) version for the French market, and \"Akira\" quickly became an \"anime\" reference. However, Japanese animation genre became massively exploited by TV shows from the late 1980s onwards, most notably the cult Club Dorothée show (mostly dedicated to Toei anime and tokusatsu series). In fact, the commercial relationship between the Japanese studio and the French show producers were so good, that the French presenter was even featured in a Metal Hero Series episode as guest star.\n\nJust as in a Japanese \"manga\" series magazine, the Club Dorothée audience voted by phone or minitel to select and rank their favourite series. Top-ranked series continued the following week, others stopped. The most popular series were \"Dragon Ball\" and later its sequel, \"Dragon Ball Z\", which became number one, and was nicknamed \"le chouchou\" (\"the favorite\") by the show presenter, Dorothée. As the series kept number one for several months, Dorothée invited Akira Toriyama (Toei Animation), creator of the series, on the TV show studio to introduce him to the French audience and award him a prize in the name of the TV show.\n\nSaint Seiya was another \"anime\" series to achieve popularity in France. It showed more violence – directed towards an older audience – than the Nippon Animation studio \"shōnen\"/\"shōjo\" series of the 1970s and 1980s. Notable Toei and non-Toei \"anime\" series broadcast by that time on French TV included \"Captain Tsubasa\", \"Robotech\", \"High School! Kimengumi\" and \"Kinnikuman\". This cult TV show ran from 1987 to 1997.\n\nGlénat published the first manga issued in France, \"Akira\", in 1990 — supported by the respected newspaper \"Libération\" and by the national TV channel Antenne 2. Followers included \"Dragon Ball\" (1993), \"Appleseed\" (1994), \"Ranma 1/2\" (1994) and five others. In the mid-1990s, \"manga\" magazines in B5 size like \"Kameha\" (Glénat) and \"Manga Player\" (MSE) were available.\n\nAt the same time a controversy arose among some parents. In particular, the conservative association \"\" started a media polemic about the undesirable contents, such as violence, portrayed in the Club Dorothée, a kids' TV show. By this time, a generational conflict had arisen between the young fans of \"Japanimation\" (in use until \"anime\" became mainstream) and the older \"Japoniaiseries\" (a pejorative pun for \"Japonaiseries\", literally \"Japanese stuff\" and \"niaiseries\", \"simpleton stuff\"). Ségolène Royal even published a book, \"Le Ras le bol des bébés zappeurs\" in which manga are described as decadent dangerous and violent. She hasn't changed her position on that topic yet. The same adult content controversy was applied to \"hentai\" manga, including the notorious, \"forbidden\", \"Shin Angel\" by U-Jin, published by pioneers such as Samourai Editions or Katsumi Editions and later to magazines. The first \"hentai\" series magazine, \"Yoko\", featured softcore series like Yuuki's \"Tropical Eyes\". It was first issued in late 1995. The same year, the noir and ultra-violent series, \"Gunnm\" (aka \"Battle Angel Alita\"), was serialized in a slim, monthly edition. Around the same period a hardcore version of Yoko magazine \"Okaz\" was issued.\n\nIn 1996 the production group of Club Dorothée, broadcast on private channel TF1, set up a cable/satellite channel dedicated to \"manga\" and \"anime\". The new channel changed its name to \"Mangas\" in 1998: the concepts of \"anime\" and \"manga\" have become intertwined in France, and \"manga\" actually became the mainstream generic term to designate the two media. The channel broadcasts former discontinued series from the Club Dorothée both to nostalgic adults and to new and younger generations.\n\nIn late 1999 respected newspapers such as \"Le Monde\" gave critical acclaim to Hiroyuki Okiura's \"Jin-Roh\", and in 2000, Hayao Miyazaki's \"Princess Mononoke\" became a commercial success.\n\nIn 2004, Mamoru Oshii's \"\" became the first animation finalist in the prestigious International Film Festival of Cannes, which demonstrates a radical perspective change and a social acceptance of Japanese \"anime\"/\"manga\". Since 2005, contemporary Japanese series such as \"Naruto\", \"Initial D\", \"Great Teacher Onizuka\", \"Blue Gender\" or \"Gunslinger Girl\" appeared on new, analog/digital terrestrial (public) and on satellite/broadband (private) channels. As the highly aggressive competition who raged once between, the sole two or three available channels no more exists in the new, vast, and segmented French TV offer, the \"anime\" is doing a revival in France. In 2011, 40% of the comics published in France were manga. In 2013, there were 41 publishers of manga in France and, together with other Asian comics, manga represented around 40% of new comics releases in the country, surpassing Franco-Belgian comics for the first time.\n\nA surge in the growth of manga publishing circa 1996 coincided with the \"Club Dorothée\" show losing its audience – which eventually led to the show going off the air. Some early publishers like Glénat, adapted manga using the Western reading direction and its induced work of mirroring each panel and graphical signs, and also using a quality paper standard to the Franco-Belgian comics, while others, like J'ai Lu, were faithful to the original manga culture and not only kept the original, inverted, Japanese direction reading but also used a newspaper standard, cheap quality, paper just like in Japan. The Japanese manga was such an important cultural phenomenon that it quickly influenced French comics authors. A new \"French manga\" genre emerged, known as \"La nouvelle manga\" (\"lit. the new manga\") in reference to the French Nouvelle Vague.\n\nMuch like France, television had a large part in influencing the popularity of Japanese Manga, particularly with \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Saint Saiya\" showing up in the early nineties. Manga shook up the Spanish comics industry with new publishers taking in different directions with mostly publishing up manga instead of European comics.\n\nSince late 1970s, Italy had many anime broadcast on private channels, taking a great popularity to japanese animation. Unfortunately, many of these were censored on some channels and for this reason some anime were not taken very seriously. Many Manga drawn by Italian artists were also released, based on these censored versions. The publishing of Akira took an interest in older readers picking up other manga in the same vein. Italy had a high acceptance of comics with violence and nudity which contributed to this development. The very first un-flipped version of a manga was \"Dragon Ball\" released for the very first time in a tankōbon format.\n\nUnlike its European neighbours, Germany never had a vibrant local comic production. A volume of \"Barefoot Gen\" was licensed in Germany in the 1980s, as was \"Japan Inc.\", published by small presses. \"Akira\"'s first volume was not very popular. Paul Malone attributes the wider distribution of manga in the late 1990s to the fledgling commercial television stations showing dubbed anime, which led to the popularity of manga. Malone also notes that the native German comics market collapsed at the end of the 1990s. Manga began outselling other comics in 2000.\n\nWith a few other series like \"Appleseed\" in the following years, the \"manga movement\" picked up speed with the publication of \"Dragon Ball\", an un-flipped German manga, in late 1996. In 2007, manga accounted for approximately 70–75% of all comics published in Germany.\n\nIn Portugal, manga has been published by Bertrand, Devir, Mangaline, Meribérica/Líber, Planeta DeAgostini and Texto Editora. The first manga published in Portugal were \"Ranma ½\" and \"Spriggan\", both in 1995. There is a magazine of manga-inspired Portuguese comics, \"Banzai\".\n\nComics never gained high popularity in Russia, only few Marvel's titles being a moderate success. Russian readers traditionally considered them children's literature, so the manga market developed late. A strong movement of anime fans helped to spread manga. The general director of Egmont Russia Lev Yelin commented that the most popular manga series in Japan are comics which \"contain sex and violence\", so they probably won't be published in Russia. A representative of Sakura Press (the licensor and publisher of \"Ranma ½\", \"Gunslinger Girl\" and some other titles) noted that although this niche is promising, it's hard to advance on the market, because \"in Russia comics are considered children's literature\". It is also impossible for publishers to predict the success or failure of any specific title. On the contrary, Rosmen's general director Mikhail Markotkin said the whole popularity of comics doesn't matter, as only artistic talent and good story make a successful project, and only such manga \"will work\" on the market.\n\nThe first officially licensed and published manga series in Russia was \"Ranma ½\". Sakura Press released the first volume in 2005. Since then several legal companies appeared, including Comics Factory and Comix-ART. Comix-ART, which is working in collaboration with Eksmo, one of the largest publishing houses in Russia, was the first company to publish Original English-language manga (usually called \"manga\" or just \"comics\"), such as \"Bizenghast\", \"Shutterbox\" and \"Van Von Hunter\".\n\nManga has been published in Poland since 90s when owner (Japanese person) of one of biggest publisher (J.P.F.) translated Dragon Ball into polish to practice with this language. Later he decided to publish his work. The publisher is known from series like DB, One Piece, Bleach and many others including Junjo Ito horrors or well known, old josei manga. Next to JPF we have publishers like Waneko or Studio JG known as 2 others top 3 biggest in Poland. Waneko is well known from publishing the biggest number of manga monthly and series like GTO, Kuroshitsuji, Pandora Hearts or Bakuman. They are also very known from publishing less popular series like Bokura no Kiseki. Studio JG makes a lot of controversy by making long breaks between manga volumes, many fans are very frustrated by their attitude. They are known from series like Toradora or Spice and Wolf. Behind that there are publishers like Yumegari (manhwa mainly although), Kotori (known from Sword Art Light Novel and many yaoi manga) or Dango which is the youngest from all polish publisher. Dango is very much appreciated by fans due to good quality of volumes and many extra free gadgets included. Yaoi manga are well selling in Poland. The other publisher which really deserve attention is Hanami. They are well known from more mature manga like Monster or Pluto.\n\nThe growth of manga translation and publishing in the United States has been a slow progression over several decades. The earliest manga-derived series to be released in the United States was a redrawn American adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's \"Astro Boy\" published by Gold Key Comics starting in 1965. \n\nIn 1979, the Gold Key published the comic book Battle of Planets, based on a television series of the same name. Marvel published a series based Shogun Warriors, bringing characters of the mecha anime and manga series: Brave Raideen, Chodenji Robo Combattler V and Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace.\nThe first manga to be published in the US with its original artwork intact was Nakazawa's major work \"Barefoot Gen\" published in 1979 – brought over by Frederik Schodt and Jared Cook with funds raised from their Project Gen charity, In December 1982 the San Francisco-based publisher Educomics released a colorized and translated version of Keiji Nakazawa's \"I Saw It\". Four translated volumes of it were also published in the early 1980s by New Society Publishers. Short works by several \"Garo\"-affiliated artists including Yoshiharu Tsuge and Terry Yumura appeared in May 1985 in \"RAW\"'s no. 7 \"Tokyo Raw\" special.\nIn 1987, Viz Comics, an American subsidiary of the Japanese publishers Shogakukan and Shueisha, began publishing translations of three manga series – \"Area 88\", \"Mai the Psychic Girl\", and \"The Legend of Kamui\" – in the U.S. in association with the American publisher Eclipse Comics. Viz went on to bring English translations of popular series such as \"Ranma ½\" and \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some other American publishers released notable translations of Japanese comics in this period, such as First Comics' serialization of \"Lone Wolf and Cub\" which started in May 1987. However, the first manga to make a strong impression on American audiences was Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira\", which was brought to the United States in colorized form in 1988 by Epic Comics, a division of Marvel.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, manga slowly gained popularity as Viz Media, Dark Horse and Mixx (now Tokyopop) released more titles for the US market. Both Mixx and Viz published manga anthologies: \"MixxZine\" (1997–1999) ran serialized manga such as \"Sailor Moon\", \"Magic Knight Rayearth\" and \"Ice Blade\", while Viz's \"Animerica Extra\" (1998–2004) featured series including \"Fushigi Yugi\", \"Banana Fish\" and \"Utena: Revolutionary Girl\". In 2002 Viz began publishing a monthly American edition of the famous Japanese \"phone book\"-style manga anthology \"Shōnen Jump\" featuring some of the most popular manga titles from Japan, including \"Dragon Ball Z\", \"Naruto\", \"Bleach\" and One Piece. Its circulation far surpassed that of previous American manga anthologies, reaching 180,000 in 2005. Also in 2005, Viz launched \"Shojo Beat\", a successful counterpart to \"Shonen Jump\" aimed at female readers.\n\nIn 2002, Tokyopop introduced its \"100% Authentic Manga\" line, which featured unflipped pages and were smaller in size than most other translated graphic novels. This allowed them be retailed at a price lower than that of comparable publications by Viz and others. The line was also made widely available in mainstream bookstores such as Borders and Barnes & Noble, which greatly increased manga's visibility among the book-buying public. After Tokyopop's success, most of the other manga companies switched to the smaller unflipped format and offered their titles at similar prices.\n\nA large number of small companies in the United States publish manga. Several large publishers have also released, or expressed interest in releasing manga. Del Rey translated and published several Japanese series including \"xxxHolic\", \"\" and, \"\", while Harlequin has brought its Ginger Blossom line of manga, originally released only in Japan, to the United States as well.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, many popular Japanese- and Chinese-language manga and anime are distributed by Madman Entertainment.\n\nBefore the 1990s some trial marketing of manga took place in Brazil, including \"Lone Wolf and Cub\", the first one published in the country in 1988, \"Mai, the Psychic Girl\", \"Akira\", \"Cobra\", \"Crying Freeman\", and \"The Legend of Kamui\". The Brazilian \"shōnen\" market started in the mid-1990s with \"Ranma ½\" published by Animangá, although the publication did not prove successful (due to the fact that it was released in the American format and contained only two chapters per issue, roughly equivalent to one fourth of a \"tankohon\"). It was followed by \"\", released by Conrad in 1999, during the \"Pokémon\" boom.\n\nIn 2000, Conrad published \"Saint Seiya\" and \"Dragon Ball\" (both titles already well known, since the equivalent anime had been highly successful in the 1990s). After the success of these titles, Conrad released not only trendy manga like \"One Piece\", \"Vagabond\", \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", and \"Slam Dunk\", but also classic manga like Osamu Tezuka titles (including \"Adolf\" and \"Buddha\"), \"Nausicaä\", and less known titles like \"Bambi and Her Pink Gun\" and \"Sade\".\n\nIn 2003, the Japanese-Brazilian company Japan Brazil Communication (JBC) started publishing manga, releasing \"Rurouni Kenshin\", \"Magic Knight Rayearth\", \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" and \"Video Girl Ai\". In 2009, JBC published Clamp titles like \"X/1999\", \"Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle\" and \"xxxHolic\", and popular titles like \"Inuyasha\", \"Negima!\", \"Fruits Basket\", \"Death Note\", \"Fullmetal Alchemist\", \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\", \"Shaman King\", \"Love Hina\" and \"Bakuman\", having also picked up the publishing rights for \"Ranma ½\" and \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" in the same year.\n\nIn 2004, Panini started publishing manga, with the release of \"Peach Girl\" and \"\". In 2012, Panini published the most popular manga in Brazil: \"Naruto\" and \"Bleach\", as well as titles like \"Black Lagoon\", \"Highschool of the Dead\", \"Full Metal Panic!\" and \"Welcome to the N.H.K.\". Panini has also, in 2012, acquired the publishing rights to \"One Piece\" in Brazil, continuing publication from where Conrad had stopped (Japanese volume 37) as well as reprinting earlier volumes in the original Japanese format.\n\nOriginally, Brazilian manga appeared with about half the size of a tankoubon (about 100 pages of stories and two to eight pages of extras), but almost all of the manga is released in the original format.\n\nAfter years of negotiation, JBC finally released Sailor Moon in early 2014. The edition, regarded as the most important release ever done by the company, was reportedly praised by creator Naoko Takeuchi and Kodansha employees, thanks to its quality.\n\nAnother popular form of manga distribution outside Japan involves Internet scanlations (or \"scanslations\"). Typically, a small group of people scan the original version of a series with no current license in the language which they wish to translate it to, translate it, and freely distribute it; usually through the use of IRC or BitTorrent.\n\nManga has proved so popular that it has led to other companies such as Antarctic Press, Oni Press, Seven Seas Entertainment and Tokyopop, as well as long-established publishers like Marvel and Archie Comics, to release their own manga-inspired works that apply the same artistic stylings and story pacing commonly seen in Japanese manga. One of the first of these such works came in 1985 when Ben Dunn, founder of Antarctic Press, released \"Mangazine\" and \"Ninja High School\".\n\nWhile Antarctic Press actively refers to its works as \"American Manga\", it does not source all of these manga-inspired works from the United States. Many of the artists working on Seven Seas Entertainment series such as \"Last Hope (manga)\" and \"Amazing Agent Luna\" are Filipino and TOKYOPOP has hired a variety of Korean and Japanese artists to work on titles such as \"Warcraft\" and \"Princess Ai\". Many of these works have been classified on the Internet with titles such as OEL Manga, MIC, and World Manga, although none of these terms have actually been used by manga companies to describe these works on the books themselves.\n\nIn Brazil, the popularity of manga is marked also by the large number of Japanese and descendants in the country. In the 1960s, some of Japanese descent, such as Minami Keizi and Claudio Seto, started using graphic influences, narratives or manga themes in their work in EDREL publisher founded by Keizi.\n\nIn Germany, as manga began outselling domestic comics in 2000, German publishers began supporting German creators of manga-styled comics. Jürgen Seebeck's \"Bloody Circus\" was not popular amongst German manga readers due to its European style, and other early German manga artists were affected by cancellations. After this, German publishers began focussing on female creators, due to the popularity of shōjo manga, leading to what Paul Malone describes as a \"home-grown shōjo boom\", and \"more female German comics artists in print than ever before\". However, genuinely manga-influenced stylistic conventions, such as sweatdrops, are employed to ensure \"authenticity\", original German works are flipped to read in a right-to-left style familiar to manga readers, author's afterwords and sidebars are common, and many German manga take place in Asia.\n\nThe Arabic language manga \"Canary 1001\" is by a group calling themselves Amateam, whose director is Wahid Jodar, from the United Arab Emirates. Another Arab language manga is \"Gold Ring\", by Qais Sedeki, from 2009, also from the United Arab Emirates. Both groups of artists use the word \"manga\" for their work.\n\nIn May 2010, Glenat Spain introduced their new line of works known as \"Linea Gaijin\" which showcases the works of several Spanish and Latin American comic book artists. This is an effort on the part of Glenat to bring fresh new content and breed a new generation of manga-inspired artists that grew up reading manga. The line began with titles such as \"Bakemono\", \"Dos Espadas\", and \"Lettera\" that were shown on the \"Salón del Manga de Barcelona\" in October 2010, but it would later introduce other works as well.\n\nMany Western webcomics are influenced to varying degrees by manga. Some, like Megatokyo, follow traditional manga artwork and plotlines closely. Others, like Sinfest or Girly, incorporate Western techniques and do not follow traditional Japanese manga story elements.\n\n\n"}

Written by Meghan McCarthy and directed by Jayson Thiessen, the film was produced by DHX Media's 2D animation studio in Vancouver, Canada for Hasbro Studios in the United States, as a sequel to 2013's \"\". The film premiered in select theaters across the United States and Canada on September 27, 2014, which was followed by broadcast on Discovery Family, a joint venture between Discovery Communications and Hasbro, on October 17, 2014, and then a home media release on October 28, 2014.\n\nLike the first film, \"Rainbow Rocks\" re-envisions the main characters of parent franchise, normally ponies, as teenage human characters in a high school setting. Set between the television series' and , the film's plot involves Twilight Sparkle returning to Canterlot High School to compete in a Battle of the Bands alongside the counterparts of her friends – including former school bully/former student of Princess Celestia Sunset Shimmer – to save the school from a trio of sirens from Equestria.\n\nThe film was well received by critics, who described it as \"far superior\" to the first installment. It was followed by two sequels, \"\" and \"\".\n\nFormer Canterlot High School bully & student of , , who has reformed after being defeated by the magic of 's crown, is ostracized by most of the school despite her efforts to atone for her actions. Her only friends are the counterparts of , , , and , who have formed a rock band called \"the Rainbooms\" to participate in the school's upcoming musical showcase. The five girls discover that the magic left over from Twilight's crown has given them the ability to grow pony-like ears, tails, and wings whenever they play their instruments.\n\nHoping to make a fresh impression, Sunset gives a school tour to three new students – – and informs them of the showcase, unaware that they possess magical singing voices. Calling themselves \"the Dazzlings\", the trio perform a song that turns the other students aggressive and competitive towards each other, convincing them to turn the friendly showcase into a Battle of the Bands. Sunset and her friends are protected from the song by their own magic, but fail to convince the bewitched and of the danger. Sunset remembers a book that magically copies whatever she writes in it to another kept by , her mentor from the parallel world of Equestria, which she uses to send a message requesting Twilight's help.\n\nPrincess Celestia's book is delivered to Twilight's castle in Ponyville. Receiving Sunset's message, Twilight deduces that the Dazzlings are banished sirens from Equestria that feed on negative emotions to fuel their singing powers for their goal of world conquest. Twilight uses the book's magic to reactivate the portal between worlds, allowing her and to return to the parallel world. Twilight and the girls attempt to use the magic of their friendship to lift the Dazzlings' spell, but it takes no effect. Concluding that they must perform a musical counter-spell, the girls enter the Battle of the Bands to give Twilight time to complete the spell. The Rainbooms face hostility and sabotage from the bewitched bands throughout the competition, which raises existing tensions among Twilight's friends over conflicting aspects of their band.\n\nDesperate for time in the semifinal round against 's band, Rainbow Dash performs an egotistical song to substitute the counter-spell and nearly transforms, which forces Sunset to ruin her performance to keep her from exposing their plan to the Dazzlings. Despite this, the Dazzlings intervene to allow the Rainbooms' advancement to the final round, goading a jealous Trixie into trapping the Rainbooms beneath the stage to take their place. Isolated for hours, Twilight's friends enter a heated argument that allows the Dazzlings to absorb their magic. Realizing that their constant infighting is interfering with Twilight's spell, Sunset convinces the girls to resolve their differences, while Twilight reasons that simply playing together as friends will make the counter-spell work.\n\nSpike rescues the girls with assistance from , a student whose headphone music protects her from the Dazzlings' spell. DJ Pon-3 provides a sound system that the Rainbooms use to engage the Dazzlings in a musical battle. Overwhelmed by the Dazzlings' projected siren forms, the Rainbooms are joined by Sunset, who assumes her own pony-like form; with her help, the Rainbooms are able to destroy the pendants that provide the Dazzlings with their singing abilities, rendering the trio tone-deaf. Returning to its harmonious state, the school drives the Dazzlings away and praises the Rainbooms. Twilight and Spike return to Equestria, while Sunset uses Princess Celestia's book to remain in contact with Twilight.\n\nDuring the closing credits, a montage plays showing Sunset being accepted by the student body and performing as the Rainbooms' new lead singer and guitarist. In a post-credits scene, the human world's version of Twilight Sparkle is shown investigating the strange activity around Canterlot High.\n\n\nThe appears prominently in the film in a non-speaking role. The film features minor appearances from Michelle Creber as ; Ingrid Nilson as a counterpart of , Pinkie Pie's sister; Peter New as a counterpart of ; Lee Tockar and Richard Ian Cox as the counterparts of ; Tabitha St. Germain as a counterpart of ; and Brian Drummond as a delivery pony in Equestria.

The film's opening credits were storyboarded by Tony Cliff. The storybook illustration depictions of the sirens in Equestria were done by Rebecca Dart. The illustrations shown during the ending credits were drawn by Katrina Hadley.\n\nIn the audio commentary included in home media releases, Meghan McCarthy commented that \"Equestria Girls\" was initially not intended to become an ongoing franchise, and the thought of a sequel did not cross her mind. Additionally, Sunset did not become a main character until the second draft of the script. The DVD commentary also points out that the midnight snack scene between Twilight and Sunset was actually added late into the film's production, Rarity's line \"past...ahem...booboos\" was ad-libbed by Germain, and the freestyle rap by Snips and Snails' counterparts was genuine freestyling by Lee Tockar and Richard Cox.\n\nOn February 13, 2014, songwriter Daniel Ingram wrote on Twitter that there will be a total of 12 songs in the film, the greatest number of songs featured in a \"Friendship Is Magic\" episode or \"Equestria Girls\" film thus far; however, only 11 songs made it in the film.\n\nLike in \"Equestria Girls\", the songs were composed by Ingram with lyric writing shared between Ingram and screenwriter Meghan McCarthy; with the exception of \"Rainbow Rocks\" and \"Shine Like Rainbows\" which had lyrics by Ingram; \"Bad Counter Spell\" and \"Under Our Spell\" by McCarthy; and \"Shake Your Tail\" having a first draft by writer Amy Keating Rogers, in which Ingram later revised. Trevor Hoffman provided the arrangements for the songs, and musician Caleb Chan produced the songs as well as played guitar and bass.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, a movie clip and a teaser trailer were released on Yahoo! TV. On September 10, 2014, through the Equestria Daily fan news blog, Shout! Factory revealed a 30-second trailer. Two days later on September 12, a 50-second trailer was released on YouTube. Six days later on September 18, a full theatrical trailer was released also via Yahoo! TV; the trailer was then uploaded to Hasbro's YouTube channel four days later on September 22.\n\nThe film received a limited theatrical release on September 27, 2014, in the United States through Screenvision theaters and in Canada through Cineplex theaters. It also received a \"Purple Carpet\" premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, which was attended by the cast and crew as well as some celebrities such as Jamie Foxx, \"Modern Family\" actress Ariel Winter, and Academy Award nominee Quvenzhané Wallis. Like the first film, the screenings of \"Rainbow Rocks\" in the United States bore no classification from the MPAA (which is not a mandatory, although many theaters carried a G-rating), while the Canadian screenings had classifications from provincial film boards (usually G).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was theatrically released on October 25 and 26, 2014. The film was theatrically released on November 15, 2014, in Australia.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Shout! Factory on October 28, 2014, in Region 1. Special features include a new featurette, the eight prelude animated shorts, a sing-along song, and an audio commentary on the film by writer Meghan McCarthy, director Jayson Thiessen, co-director Ishi Rudell, vice president of development at Hasbro Studios Michael Vogel, and Hasbro's executive director Brian Lenard. There were also three store exclusives for the United States release of the DVD: The Target edition included a bracelet, a USD $4 coupon for one My Little Pony toy, and the DVD of the first \"Equestria Girls\" film; The Walmart edition included a music CD, a digital copy of the film, and the same $4 coupon; The Kmart edition included a \"backstage pass\" and the coupon. The initial production run of the DVD contained an error that caused chapters 5 and 6 to play in reverse order when the film was viewed using the \"Play\" option on the main menu.\n\nA Region 2 \"Rainbow Rocks\" DVD from distributor Primal Screen Entertainment was released on March 23, 2015, for various countries, including France, Germany, Italy, the Middle East region, Netherlands, and United Kingdom.\n\nAlongside \"Equestria Girls\" and \"Friendship Games\", this film was released in a box set on October 13, 2015 in Region 1.\n\n\"Rainbow Rocks\" made its United States television premiere on Discovery Family (a joint venture between Discovery Communications and Hasbro) on October 17, 2014. The film premiered on the Family Channel in Canada on November 8, 2014. In the United Kingdom, it premiered on Pop on December 24, 2014.\n\nThe film is a part of music-themed Rainbow Rocks lineup, a second installment in the toy line and media franchise, which was first displayed at the 2014 American International Toy Fair. LB Kids published two novelizations of the film, all written by Perdita Finn. A Rainbow Rocks missile command-type mini-game was added to the \"Hasbro Arcade\" mobile app on April 8, 2014. An issue of IDW's \"Fiendship Is Magic\" features the sirens.\n\nOn February 13, 2014, \"Entertainment Weekly\" released the first trailer; about four months later however, McCarthy confirmed on her Twitter post that the clips from that trailer \"are separate shorts and not scenes in the movie.\" A series of eight animated shorts was released on Hasbro Studio's YouTube channel in 2014 from March 27 to June 19 to promote the film. The shorts were created by the \"Friendship Is Magic\" crew to tie into the film, and are considered \"prequels\" to the film's events, detailing how each of them discovered that they could awaken Equestrian magic within them by playing their respective instruments.\n\nThe first eight shorts made their television debut on Discovery Family on May 30, 2015.\n\nWith lyric collaboration between Katrina Hadley, Daniel Ingram, Brian Lenard, Jayson Thiessen and Michael Vogel, and songs composed by Ingram, Hasbro released three \"Rainbow Rocks\" music videos on March 31, 2015: \"Friendship Through the Ages\", \"Life Is a Runway\", and \"My Past is Not Today\"; but were reuploaded two days later on April 2, 2015. These shorts are separate initiatives that lead up to the third \"Equestria Girls\" film installment, \"Friendship Games\". On April 6, 2015, Ingram replied in a comment on Facebook that these will likely be on the next \"Equestria Girls\" album in late 2015. On September 17, 2015, the encore shorts were released as the first three audio tracks on the \"My Little Pony Equestria Girls: The Friendship Games\" soundtrack.\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released on September 10, 2014 via the iTunes Music Store. Announced on Ingram's Twitter eight days later on September 18, the soundtrack placed #15 on the Kid Albums Billboard chart; two weeks later on October 2, the soundtrack placed #12; a week later on October 9, it placed #10.\n\nIn the Hasbro Earnings Report, it was revealed that the box office returns from this film exceeded that of the first film in the first weekend by 37%. On a per theater basis, sales for tickets grew by 19% in the first three weeks of its limited theatrical run. The film grossed $347,511 in it limited time in theaters in the United Kingdom, Finland, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay.\n\nWhen the main feature premiered on Discovery Family on October 17, 2014, it was viewed by approximately 610,000 viewers.\n\nWhen the first eight \"Rainbow Rocks\" shorts made their television debut on Discovery Family on May 30, 2015, they were viewed by approximately 299,000 viewers.\n\n\"My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks\" was well received by critics and fans alike. Sherilyn Connelly for \"The Village Voice\" called \"Rainbow Rocks\" \"far superior\" to the first \"Equestria Girls\" film, and that while \"the picture is continuity-heavy and not particularly accessible to newcomers\", that the film was \"up there with the show at its most thoughtful\". Sheri Linden of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" complimented the film, saying \"Though it's strictly for the faithful, the tween-friendly mix of cute and earnest has a forthright sharpness and is never cloying.\" Shane O'Hare of Geekscape gave the Blu-ray of the film a score of 4 out of 5, praising the soundtrack stating \"The show's composer, Daniel Ingram...killed it. 10 all new original recordings from Daniel really stole the show.\" Ed Liu of Toon Zone, who gave the first film a mixed review, also found this film to be better. He wrote the film \"is almost as sweet and charming as the best episodes of the series, finding new and interesting ways to expand on the show’s themes of friendship.\"\n\n\"Gerry O\", 12-year-old film critic for The Huffington Post's Kids First! column called the film \"a combination of adventure with a crème of comedy and a sprinkle of excitement all up in a friendship sandwich.\"\n\nIn 2017, IGN named the film among one of the \"Best Kids Movies Streaming on Netflix\".\n\n"}

{"id": "13441002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13441002", "title": "National Broadcasting School", "text": "National Broadcasting School\n\nThe National Broadcasting School began operating in 1980 as an independent organization supported by the UK's Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to provide professional training in radio presentation, production and journalism for Independent Local Radio (ILR). NBS's chairman was Peter Baldwin, deputy director of radio at the IBA, and one of the three governors appointed by them.\n\nThe need for a unified training scheme for ILR stations was established the previous year in a report by the Radio Consultative Committee. The school was an aspirational project favored by Capital Radio managing director John Whitney, who shortly afterwards became director general of the IBA.\n\nThe IBA's National Broadcasting School operated in London from 1980 to 1985. After a break of 18 years, a National Broadcasting School was established in 2003 in Brighton by former staff member Rory McLeod. In 2015 a National Broadcasting School operates in Liverpool and is associated with the long-established ILR station Radio City, continuing in a similar tradition to the NBS of the 1980s.\n\nIn the early 1980s professional radio training was provided almost exclusively by the BBC. Those independent stations who did train their staff, particularly journalists, found they moved quickly to ITV or the BBC. Music presenters came up through the UK's network of hospital radio and student radio stations, or from the very few other opportunities available, such as the corporately run United Biscuits Network, UBN, and some larger ILR stations managed to attract talent from pirate radio.\n\nHowever, ILR stations had specific obligations in order to hold their licences. They were independent stations, not commercial stations, required to produce local output, including strong local news, information and features, plus a wider range of music than a commercial station would be prepared to sustain. They required a particular style of presenter, far less staid than BBC local radio, but still in touch with a local audience rather than having a full-on commercial approach. Smaller stations in particular had to grow their own talent, unable to rely on well-known names from the BBC or pirate radio joining them.\n\nNBS was seen as a way of attracting new talent to the independent broadcasting sector and providing professional training relevant to the new and more flexible working practices and modern equipment being introduced into ILR. The six broadcast-capable studios and newsroom were new and well-equipped in comparison to the general standards in BBC local radio at that time, having the latest decks and cartridge machines. Students could use professional-quality Marantz cassette recorders for news gathering rather than the unwieldy reel-to-reel Uher machines used by the BBC. The IBA reported in 1981 that NBS had \"quite impressive studios and facilities in Greek Street.\"\n\nFunding came from a controversial levy by the IBA on the profits of ILR stations, called \"secondary rental\", which created a pool of money for the common use of the industry. In 1980 secondary rentals from ILR had been swollen by a strike at ITV which meant advertisers and audiences turned to radio, and part of this windfall was used to finance the setting up of the school.\n\nThe school was housed in the former St James's & Soho Club at 14 Greek Street, Soho. As a working men's club in 19th century London it had been a focus for radical activity - perhaps a fitting heritage for the ex-pirate radio staff who began to frequent it in the early 1980s. Less fitting perhaps, the Times reported that NBS was housed in what was once a \"thriving Victorian brothel.\" It was described by former trainee Fiona Phillips as \"right in the centre of London's partially cleaned-up redlight district.\" The burgeoning Comedy Store above a strip club a few streets away became a magnet for those who saw Kenny Everett as a more suitable role model than Lord Reith.\n\nNBS's principal was the broadcaster Michael Bukht, later one of the founders of Classic FM, who was best known for his appearances on the BBC show Food and Drink in his persona as Michael Barry the Crafty Cook, a title he first used on London's Capital Radio in the 1970s. One of the first handouts given to new trainees was an extensive list of nearby Soho restaurants, each with a price guide and a capsule review prepared by the principal.\n\nBukht had worked in Jamaica, where he reinvigorated commercial radio, and had recently returned from Transkei, one of the \"independent\" republics set up by the government of South Africa during apartheid, where he established Capital Radio 604. This privately run station, free of state control and providing uncensored music and news to South Africa, was firmly in the pirate radio tradition.\n\nMichael Bukht was programme controller of Capital Radio when John Whitney asked if he would launch NBS to support the expansion of ILR, then growing at the rate of five to eight stations a year. While the need for new staff was growing, the number lost to television each year was also growing.\n\nNBS's director of programmes was the influential former pirate radio DJ Dave Dennis (real name Neil Spence), who in the 1960s was among the first to introduce a high-pressure American style of music radio presentation to the UK while working at the pirate station Radio London, where he worked alongside the maverick DJ and presenter Kenny Everett. At Capital Radio, Bukht was now the programme controller charged with harnessing Everett's talent.\n\nSpence had left Radio London in 1966 and had since developed a reputation as a talent spotter. He had been a tutor at Earl Richmond's \"London Broadcasting School\" where one of his students was James Whale, In the 1970s he had been programme controller at UBN where he developed talents such as Graham Dene, and programme controller at ILR's Radio Trent where he employed ex-UBN presenter Dale Winton.\n\nNBS's central location in 1980s Soho and the presence of Neil Spence led many a former pirate radio DJ to pop in for a catch-up, along with others Spence had trained and mentored as programme director at UBN. NBS trainees often had the slightly strange sensation of vaguely recognizing the face of a visitor they passed on the stairs, but then hearing an instantly-recognizable voice.\n\nHead of news was Martin Campbell, an experienced journalist who after eight years in newspapers moved into commercial radio in 1975, and had been head of talks at BRMB in Birmingham, and head of features at Radio Trent in Nottingham, where among a comprehensive speech output he fronted daily phone-ins and music shows, and produced commercial radio's first situation comedy. In 1998 he would become director of programming and advertising at the Radio Authority and in 2004 the first head of radio at Ofcom. In his early career Campbell was said to have been inspired by Neil Spence's teachings on radio broadcasting.\n\nAmong the journalism staff was Rory McLeod, who began his career at the ILR station Radio Clyde in Glasgow and in 1983, Rory alongside Keith Belcher, helped establish Southern Sound .Keith Belcher stayed on as Managing Director. In 2003 after a break of 18 years Rory would be the director of a new \"National Broadcasting School\" near Brighton.\n\nThe school had a department of community education headed by Keith Yeomans, a BBC radio producer and later an adviser to the UK government's department of international development. Julie Hill, who had worked in training for the BBC and ITV as well as for the British Council overseas, was course director for NBS's Development Support Communication Course which was run for students from less-developed countries.\n\nJournalism courses were recognised by the National Union of Journalists, the NUJ, and accredited by the Joint Advisory Committee for the Training of Radio Journalists, JACTRJ, now the Broadcast Journalism Training Council, BJTC. Journalism trainees needed to be aged 18 or over, and at the beginning did not need to be graduates, although by 1984 most were.\n\nStandards were rigorous. Trainees in presentation and production were selected by audition tape. Unlike the journalism courses, anyone could apply regardless of their qualifications, and Spence and his staff were deluged with audio cassettes which had to be whittled down ruthlessly to find candidates with potential.\n\nMost trainees funded the substantial course fee and their living expenses themselves, and the 13-week courses were so intensive that working a part-time job to make ends meet was impossible. Industry sponsorship for trainees was extremely scarce, and taking the course required giving up any regular work they already had.\n\nSpence's critique of a presenter's performance was always formidable, and his influence extended far beyond NBS. As a fledgling DJ Peter Young worked for Spence at UBN and benefited from his training and mentoring. By the time Spence was at NBS, Young was an experienced and accomplished presenter with a late night show on Capital Radio. \"One night he phoned me on air to tell me off for something he considered to be out of order,\" said Young. \"I had to laugh, but was very flattered that he considered it to be worth his while.\"\n\nTurning out presenters for ILR meant teaching them to work creatively within a format and to develop an authentic on-air personality which was bright but accessible for a broad local audience. The tone was very different from pirate days, and Spence abhorred reminders of his pirate radio past. When one trainee presenter used a Dave Dennis catchphrase back to him during a critique, he asked her where she had heard it. When told it was from Dave Cash, who had worked with him at Radio London and was then programme director at the ILR station Radio West (now Heart Bristol), Spence was uncompromising: \"If you listen to him you’ll end up working in Gibraltar with monkeys for an audience.\" Cash's feelings were hurt, but Spence had a point. Radio West struggled to find an audience until its music and presenters became more mainstream.\n\nPresenters' end-of-course assessments were graded one to five. A five meant basic proficiency and competence, while a grade one denoted a student of outstanding talent and distinction. The course materials noted that a grade one was \"very rarely awarded,\" but in practice Spence was never known to award a grade one, nor for that matter a grade two. A grade three was considered a high accolade - denoting \"a student of merit - diligent, talented and able.\" At most, 20% reached this grade.\n\nThe school also ran intensive courses for broadcast engineers who wanted to work in ILR. It trained businessmen and politicians in media skills. It ran short courses for charities to learn how to get their information on air. It sent trainers out to ILR stations so that working broadcasters could brush up and develop their skills. It ran high-level seminars for station managers. It sent consultants to new stations to advise on training. The school was recognized by the British Council, and provided training advisers to stations in Oman, Jamaica and the Solomon Islands. Many trainees came from the Commonwealth. \nThe intensive radio journalism and presentation courses continued throughout.\n\nA television journalism course was set up in 1983 after NBS was approached by the editorial director of ITN, Mike Morris, who was concerned at the high drop out rate among ITN's small number of graduate trainees. In one two-year period, four out of six trainees had left, frustrated by what Morris's successor, Derek Taylor, labelled \"sink-or-swim\" training. NBS then provided structured television training in same mould as its radio training.\n\nNBS courses were intensive with good reason. Nick Stuart, later to be an award-winning independent television producer and CEO of CTVC and Odyssey Networks, graduated in the top three of his radio journalism course to win a coveted industry placement at 2CR. Reflecting in 2014 he said: \"I think the first two weeks at Two Counties was just a shock. Wow, it's this intense.\" He quickly moved to a 5am shift at another station to compile traffic and travel reports, where his first bulletin prompted the newsreader to hit him around the head for not providing completely clean copy: \"Maybe it was just a style of management that was big in those days, that's all. Very aggressive.\"\n\nNBS provided its courses to a large number of future broadcasters, some of whom became household names. They included the GMTV journalist and presenter Fiona Phillips, who wrote:\n\nPhillips' subsequent experience was typical - she was asked to work for free. But nearly all trainees accepted that the early months working in ILR would involve long hours and little if any pay, at least until they had proved that NBS had given them the practical skills valued by the industry.\n\nAmong other alumni, BBC Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine took a presentation and production course aged 17 before going to university, Chris Skudder of Sky Sports studied journalism, and so did Lisa Aziz, who became one of the first Asian presenters on British television.\n\nZeinab Badawi, who by the end of the 1980s was presenting Channel 4 News with Jon Snow, was one of the few trainees to have industry sponsorship: \"In those days there wasn’t any kind of media course or anything like that. I was trained on the job, but ITV sent me to something called the National Broadcasting School, which doesn’t exist anymore, which was in Soho, and I did a three-month intensive training course there and that was it.\"\n\nOthers who trained at NBS included the broadcaster and academic Tim McLellan, Virgin Radio presenter Russ Williams, and the LBC talk show host Clive Bull. Martine Dennis subsequently worked at LBC and the BBC before joining Al Jazeera English.\n\nAmong the many musicians who trained in presentation and production was the reggae artist Mikey Dread, who had produced The Clash's iconic single Bankrobber and worked on their album Sandinista!. From NBS he went on to narrate the Channel 4 reggae documentary Deep Roots Music and host the television series Rockers Roadshow.\nMartha Kearney graduated from NBS at the start of a career in which she rose from phone operator and news information researcher at LBC to a BAFTA nomination for her coverage of the Northern Ireland Peace Process in 1998 and presenting the BBC's flagship The World at One\n\nChris Shaw became programme controller of Channel 5 and editorial director of ITN Productions.\n\nJohn Leech won a clutch of Gold Medals at the New York Festival for his soul and dance shows, and a UK Sony Award for music documentary. Nick Hirst also won gold at the New York Festival and was responsible for running all British Foreign Office radio and print communications in more than 130 countries. Hugh Terry went to Radio Television HK as a presenter while also pursuing an acting career including the Radio 4 adaptation of Bleak House, which won a Sony radio award.\n\nGavin Ford features in the Pirate Radio Hall of Fame for his work at Radio Caroline and has presented for Lebanon's Radio One for 16 years. Tony Leo returned from NBS to Radio St Helena where he developed the station using voluntary producers in the community, retiring after 29 years service. Electronics engineer Bob James arrived at NBS from hospital radio and working as a club DJ, and after 20 years in commercial radio as presenter and engineer started broadcasting at Bay Radio in Spain. Debbie Flint worked at Piccadilly Radio as a broadcasting assistant before reporting and presenting for them, and later establishing a career as a children's presenter.\n\nAmong the international students who studied radio presentation and production was the Nigerian writer and broadcaster Agwu Nwogo who for many years worked for the Imo Broadcasting Service, IBS. Colin Burrows became a producer at Capital Radio and BBC Radio 1 before launching Sky's film programme and acting as a specialist consultant on film marketing. After NBS, Robert Gallacher began in the BBC's gramophone library and rose to be commissioning editor for BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music, and has won three Radio Academy awards and five PROMAX awards. After NBS Sean Bolger joined Southern Sound as a presenter and after a spell at ILR station Radio 210 joined BFBS in Cyprus.\n\nThe documentarist Mark Halliley, best known for narrating UK series of The Apprentice, in his early years after leaving NBS produced a string of award-winning radio features, picking up New York Festival gold medals, Sony awards, a Prix Futura Berlin, and producing two ILR entries for the Prix Italia award.\n\nWhen it was set up, NBS was projected to be self-financing by the financial year 1983-84. The IBA was initially prepared to absorb some of the projected losses, with Capital Radio making substantial contributions, outweighing other ILR stations. But by 1983 NBS board members had to be given indemnities that they were \"acting properly on behalf of the Authority,\" and by June 1984 the annual grant was no longer enough.\n\nBy 1984, seven ILR companies had reached the level of profitability required to pay the bitterly resented \"secondary rental.\" Their trade body, the Association of Independent Radio Contractors, issued a strong protest to the IBA, in particular warning that they would not bear the costs of any proposed national independent radio station. The IBA responded tactically by reducing secondary rental by 10 per cent from July 1985, but the position for NBS was clear. For Tony Stoller, a former chief executive of the Radio Authority, this was a pivotal moment when independent local radio, with its clear obligations to local communities, was set on course to become commercial radio.\n\nThe school announced its closure on 11 July 1985, stating that the level of financial support available from the industry was insufficient to allow the school to continue training after the end of the existing courses that August. According to one of its television tutors, the ITN journalist Jon Lander:\n\nAnnouncing the closure, NBS chairman Peter Baldwin said that many broadcasters already looked back with \"pride and affection\" to their days at the school. The statement added: \"During its five years of operation, the NBS, under its principal, Michael Bukht, has achieved an outstanding reputation for practical vocational training in broadcast programming, journalism and engineering.\"\n\nMichael Bukht claimed that more than 3,000 broadcasters trained at the school between 1980 and 1985, but of this figure, only 500 or so took the flagship intensive 13 week courses in radio (and later television) journalism, and music radio presentation and production. Bukht was proud that at one point half of all the programme controllers in the UK had been trained at the National Broadcasting School, by a training staff which never numbered more than a handful. But pirate radio \"anoraks\" were also quick to note in 1985 that many of those who had trained at NBS in the previous five years were broadcasting on the current crop of pirate stations.\n\nThe impact of NBS's training at ITN was profound. Three months after NBS closed, editorial manager Derek Taylor, recalling his own \"miserable\" experience as a trainee in the 1960s, announced the development of new in-house training in the same mould as that of NBS. Although NBS had closed, he told staff: \"At ITN, we were determined there would be no return to the Dark Ages.\" Former ITN staff reporter Sue Lloyd-Roberts had just a month's notice to organize a structured twelve-week training programme in TV journalism. As Taylor said: \"After all, if we believe we're the best in the world at what we do, there ought to be just a few tricks we could pass on.\"\n\nMany former NBS staff and students remained actively involved in training new generations. NBS head of news Martin Campbell became principal lecturer at Cornwall's post-graduate diploma in broadcast journalism, former trainee Andrew Jones launched an undergraduate degree in journalism at Robert Gordon University, and many others passed on the lessons and the ethos formally or informally in the following decades.\n\nBukht told former BRMB programme controller Mike Owen that NBS was \"a wonderful organization,\" comparing it favorably to the subsequent rapid development of media studies degree courses. \"The school was interested in theory only so far as it impinged on the practice, and that was a very different approach. There were no essays at the National Broadcasting School.\"\n\nWhile the school's approach was very different from academic media studies, it was similar in ethos and approach to the long-established skills-based newspaper journalism courses and indenture system run by the National Council for the Training of Journalists. But even NCTJ courses required essays. At NBS the focus was more intense, more practical, faster-paced, and for large parts of the curriculum, live. As far as possible it reflected radio as a medium. Newspaper reporters had news editors and sub-editors to catch their mistakes before they became public. Live radio had no such luxury, and for presenters especially, any mistakes,lapses of taste, or errors of judgement went out on air. An environment which closely simulated real working conditions was essential for effective skills-based training.\n\nWith intensity came competition. Celebrating 20 years at Virgin Radio in 2013, a record for a commercial radio presenter, Williams recalled how he and Jeremy Vine had started the same NBS music presentation and production course exactly thirty years before, in 1983: \"I came out with the Student of the Course award,\" he said. \"I like to remind Jeremy of that from time to time.\"\n\nBut trainees were imbued with Bukht's considered approach to broadcasting, with the emphasis on finding a broad audience: \"If you don't want to talk to the multitude, get off the mountain,\" he told his trainees. \"Fundamentally, good radio is listener radio not broadcaster radio. I say to people good radio starts with the audience, it doesn't start with what you want to do.\"\n\nThe Guardian's classical critic and author Fiona Maddocks recalled: \"His aim was to make first-class independent radio broadcasters of his students, of whom I was one: no airs, graces, circumlocution or elocution. His mythical listener was called Doris. \"You've got to catch Doris hanging out her washing – and make her listen,\" was his mantra as we each headed to the microphone.\"\n\nInterviewed in an era when local radio stations were amalgamating and digital and internet radio were making inroads, Bukht reinforced the message he gave his students in the 1980s: \"It doesn't matter what the technology does, in the end it's a human being in the box that makes the difference.\"\n\nIn 2003 former NBS staffer Rory McLeod became director of a new incarnation of the National Broadcasting School in Brighton. The new NBS was located in the Innovation Centre of the University of Sussex, and Red FM (Red Radio) was the school's own radio station. In 2007 it was running two practical 11-week courses - a radio news course for post-graduates, and a radio presentation and production course for which no formal qualifications were necessary other than \"creativity and an ability to connect to the listener.\" Students created daily air shifts and news bulletins five days a week, using the equipment they would encounter in the workplace. Head of presentation and programming was Ray Arthur, ex-KROQ and a consultant to Virgin Radio.\n\nIn 2009 the school was described as having two centres, one in Brighton and the other in Liverpool at Radio City. It described its approach to training as \"short, intensive, practical and demanding. Classes are small and the student to instructor ratio is never more than 7:1. Emphasis is on voice, creativity, fluency, performance plus core skills such as software and law.\"\n\nIn 2015 the National Broadcasting School / Radio City Academy in Liverpool under course director Liam Fogarty continues the tradition of training journalists for commercial and BBC radio stations, providing courses accredited by the Broadcast Journalism Training Council.\n\nAccording to UK Press Gazette: \"The course is based at the professional studios of Radio City in Liverpool, the UK’s most successful commercial radio station. The NBS has its own \"Newsroom\" and full-time access to its own training studio. Students also have access to the main broadcast studios when available. Each student has a professional portable recording kit and a work station, a network news provider, the internet, news software, programming software, Adobe Audition, and phone out interview facilities. Students will also broadcast on NBS Live during the course.\"\n\nThe NBS official Twitter account states: \"We like to think we produce the best radio graduates in the country: the future of radio, if you like.\"\n\n\n"}

The park was founded by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia () and the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío (), and opened on 24 February 1995. It consists of two main areas: by the main entrance are the buildings housing the museum and exhibitions detailing the history, culture and process of growing and producing coffee in the region; and in the valley beyond is an amusement park with rides and shows. The two areas are linked by two gondola lifts and a chairlift: it is also possible to walk between the two areas via an ecological trail that passes through a plantation of many varieties of coffee bushes.\n\nAs well as amusement rides the park also offers other attractions such as animatronics shows, a global coffee garden, food stalls based on coffee and traditional Colombian architecture. In 2009 the park received its five millionth visitor and has grown to become one of Colombia's top tourist attractions, with more than one million visitors in 2017.\nThe idea for a coffee museum came after Diego Arango Mora and his wife Margarita visited the Sugar Museum in nearby Valle del Cauca Department. Margarita remarked that if the country had a museum dedicated to sugar, it should also have one dedicated to Colombia's best known export. Arango, a member of the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío, agreed and contacted Jorge Cárdenas Gutiérrez, the head of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, who was also receptive to the idea. When Arango was elected to chair the National Congress of Coffee Growers in 1982, he proposed the creation of the museum, but was told by the secretary of the Congress that he did not have the quorum to pass the proposal.\n\nOver the following years, Arango continued to work toward the creation of the museum, despite lack of financial support from banks unwilling to lend money for an enterprise they saw as non-profitable, and opposition from delegates from three other departments of Colombia who lobbied for the museum to be constructed in their departments, as well from other towns within the department of Quindío itself who objected to Arango's choice of Montenegro as the planned site for the museum.\n\nThe museum was finally constructed and opened on 24 February 1995, and drew 250,000 visitors in its first year. However, visitor surveys showed that it was mainly those of 40 years of age who enjoyed the park, while younger visitors and children indicated they would not return. Arango took the decision to add an amusement park to the museum in order to attract the younger crowds. The first attractions were the gondola lift and the steam railway, followed by the roller coaster and other rides.\n\n\n\nThe amusement park contains 27 rides as of 2018. These include three roller coasters:\n\nOther rides include free-fall rides, a log flume, a Ferris wheel, bumper boats and bumper cars (dodgems), go-karts and a traditional train (with live folkloric music onboard) and station\n\n\n"}

{"id": "156746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156746", "title": "News presenter", "text": "News presenter\n\nA news presenter – also known as a newsreader, newscaster (short for \"news broadcaster\"), anchorman or anchorwoman, news anchor or simply an anchor – is a person who presents news during a news program on the television, on the radio or on the Internet. They may also be a working journalist, assisting in the collection of news material and may, in addition, provide commentary during the program. News presenters most often work from a television studio or radio studio, but may also present the news from remote locations in the field related to a particular major news event.\n\nThe role of the news presenter developed over time. Classically, the presenter would read the news from news \"copy\" which he may or may not have helped write with a producer or news writer. This was often taken almost directly from wire services and then rewritten. Prior to the television era, radio-news broadcasts often mixed news with opinion and each presenter strove for a distinctive style. These presenters were referred to as commentators. The last major figure to present commentary in a news broadcast format in the United States was Paul Harvey.\n\nWith the development of the 24-hour news cycle and dedicated cable news channels, the role of the anchor evolved. Anchors would still present material prepared for a news program, but they also interviewed experts about various aspects of breaking news stories, and themselves provided improvised commentary, all under the supervision of the producer, who coordinated the broadcast by communicating with the anchor through an earphone. Many anchors also write or edit news for their programs, although modern news formats often distinguish between anchor and commentator in an attempt to establish the \"character\" of a news anchor. The mix of \"straight\" news and commentary varies depending on the type of program and the skills and knowledge of the particular anchor.\n\nThe terms \"anchor\" and \"anchorman\" are derived from the usage common in relay racing, specifically the anchor leg, where the position is typically given to the fastest or most experienced competitor on a team. In 1948, \"anchor man\" was used in the game show \"Who Said That?\" to refer to John Cameron Swayze, who was a permanent panel member of the show, in what may be the first usage of this term on television. The \"anchor\" term then became commonly used by 1952 to describe the most prominent member of a panel of reporters or experts. The term \"anchorman\" also was used to describe Walter Cronkite's role at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, where he coordinated switches between news points and reporters.\n\nThe widespread claim that news anchors were called \"cronkiters\" in Swedish has been debunked by linguist Ben Zimmer.\n\nAnchors occupy a contestable role in news broadcasts. Some argue anchors have become sensationalized characters whose identities overshadow the news itself, while others cite anchors as necessary figureheads of \"wisdom and truth\" in the news broadcast. The role of the anchor has changed in recent years following the advent of satirical journalism and citizen journalism, both of which relocate the interpretation of truth outside traditional professional journalism, but the place anchormen and anchorwomen hold in American media remains consistent. \"Just about every single major news anchor since the dawn of the medium after World War II has been aligned with show business,\" says Frank Rich, writer-at-large for New York Magazine, in a polemic against commoditized news reporting, \"reading headlines to a camera in an appealing way is incentivized over actual reporting\". Brian Williams, a recurring minor character in NBC's sitcom 30 Rock, evidences this lapse in credibility generated by the celebration of the role of the anchor. In early 2015, Williams apologized to his viewers for fabricating stories of his experiences on the scene of major news events, an indiscretion resulting in a loss of 700,000 viewers for NBC Nightly News. David Folkenflik of NPR asserted that the scandal \"corrodes trust in the anchor, in NBC and in the greater profession\", exhibiting the way in which the credibility of the anchor extends beyond his or her literal place behind the news desk and into the expectation of the news medium at large. CBS's long-running nighttime news broadcast 60 Minutes displays this purported superfluousness of anchors, insofar as it has no central figurehead in favor of many correspondents with similarly important roles. Up-and-coming news networks like Vice Magazine's documentary-style reporting also eschew traditional news broadcast formatting in this way, suggesting an emphasis on on-site reporting and deemphasizing the importance of the solitary anchor in the news medium. In her essay, \"News as Performance\", Margaret Morse posits this connection between anchor persona newsroom as an interconnected identity fusing many aspects of the newsroom dynamic:\n\nFor the anchor represents not merely the news \"per se\", or a particular network or corporate conglomerate that owns the network, or television as an institution, or the public interest; rather, he represents the complex nexus of all of them. In this way, the network anchor position is a \"symbolic representation of the institutional order as an integrated totality\" (Berger and Luckmann 1967, p. 76), an institutional role on par with that of the president or of a Supreme Court justice, although the role originates in corporate practices rather than political or judicial processes. [...]\n\nDespite the anchor's construction of a commodified, aestheticized version of the news, some critics defend the role of the anchor in society, claiming that he or she functions as a necessary conduit of credibility. The news anchor's position as an omnipotent arbiter of information results from his or her place behind a typically elevated desk, wherefrom he or she interacts with reporters through a screen-within-screen spatial setup. A criticism levied against the role of anchor stems from this dynamic, insofar as anchors simply \"... regurgitat[e] or reproduc[e] the report of others...\", differentiating them from the productive occupations of journalists and on-site reporters. However, journalism professor Elly Alboim articulates the pro-anchor position by characterizing the anchor's nightly presence as a necessary way to build familiarity and trust between the network and its viewers: \"People tend to want to believe and trust in television new and start, really, from the anchor\". Beneficial or not, the anchor fits snugly into the \"personality cult\" engendered within American society that encourages celebrity that demands a hierarchy of authority, evidenced by the negligible change in ratings following implementation of new anchors in broadcast lineups. The identity of a particular anchor seems to influence viewer perception less than the presence of an anchor in general.\n\nFinally, the role of the anchor correlates with the analogous, authority- and information-bearing positions already well-established in American politics, and the benefits it confers upon the political realm elucidate the compatibility between these two systems of information. Once again, Morse outlines this relationship between the anchor and the larger context in which they operate: \"[s]ince there are few other organs for inclusive and substantial discourse on social and cultural values in American life, the responsibility for interpreting the world and posing a political course of action and a social agenda falls on a very limited number of public personas, including such news personalities and the president\". She levies a criticism against the anchor in this case, claiming that by decreasing the number of people responsible for delivering the news, American viewers receive a bottlenecked stream of information about their surroundings. The choreography and performativity involved in the construction of the news broadcast dramatizes political processes, but in doing so, exposes its flattening of subjectivity and insistence upon itself as the final word of truth. More specifically, \"the news media may do 'an important social good when using the techniques of dramaturgy to make governance more interesting to people than would be the case otherwise.' At the same time, however, 'there is an important difference between drama and democracy, with the former requiring spectators and the latter participants.'\" In contrast to perceptions of the news as a one-sided relationship with its viewers, some believe that the news works in conjunction with its audience to produce the most efficient picture possible of the world. Tom Brokaw, in speaking about his experiences as a news anchor for NBC, explained how news stories for the length of their duration tend to feed off viewers' demands, and that news is inherently a \"populist medium\", and that \"[p]eople are not going to turn to television networks for a historically accurate and detailed description of what happened.\"\n"}

Casinos generally pay dealers minimum wage. However, a dealer's primary source of income is not salary, but tips from players. Tip income may be substantial for dealers who can deal hands quickly and efficiently. (In some countries e.g., in Sweden, where all the casinos are owned by the state, Dealers and other casino personnel may not accept tips from players. This rule is complied with strictly.)\n\nTo become employable by a casino, applicants without prior experience are typically required to complete a 4-6 week training program at a dealing school. Dealing in a casino may require working late hours and remaining seated for long periods of time. Dealers also commonly work holidays, since these are especially busy days for casinos. Having to deal with difficult individuals may be another drawback to dealing at a casino—some players are abusive to dealers.\n\nMajor poker tournaments also hire dealers. For a given tournament stop, the tournament coordinator will hire dealers on contract for the duration of the tournament, which may be a few days to a few weeks. Room and board may or may not be provided by the tournament management; the dealer is typically responsible for his own travel expenses.\n\nDealers must be proficient in shuffling the deck, distributing the cards to the players, and, if required by the game being dealt, turning up the community cards in the center of the table. There are two methods of distributing the cards, \"American\"-style and \"European\"-style.\n\nTo shuffle the cards, the dealer follows a sequence defined by the casino. First all cards are spread out on the table and pushed around randomly. This is called \"scrambling\" or \"washing\" the cards. Then the cards are collected and squared into a deck. At this point a typical shuffling sequence might be: riffle, riffle, box, riffle. Professional dealers always keep both halves of the deck very low to the table while shuffling. Some casinos have automatic shufflers built into the table that shuffle a different deck of cards while the previous hand is being played, which speeds up the game. \n\nFinally, a cut card is placed on the table and the deck is cut onto the card. The cut card is held on the bottom of the deck for the entire hand, to keep the bottom card from being exposed.\n\nIn American-style dealing, the deck is held in one hand, and the dealer uses the thumb of their deck hand to slide the top card of the deck toward their pitching hand. The pitching hand clasps the card between the thumb and index finger while at the same time the mid-point of the card touches the face (nail) of the middle finger. It is the extension of the middle finger that 'pitches' the card off the top of the deck and a 'whoosh' should be heard as each card exits the top of the deck.\n\nThe ability to pitch cards accurately is critical, since the cards must be delivered in a way that players at the table can not see the undersides of the cards. \n\nEuropean-style dealers touch only the top of each card being dealt. The card is pushed off the top of the deck to the table surface in front of the dealer. The dealer then propels the card toward the recipient, usually imparting some spin to the card to encourage sliding.\n\nBefore dealing a community card, the top card off the deck is burned, or discarded. The rationale for burning is that the top card on the deck is visible to players during the previous betting round, so that a cheat might be able to spot a mark on the top card and therefore gain an advantage on his opponents.\n\nWhen burning, the deck must be held low and the burn card kept level with the table surface. Casinos watch carefully to make sure a dealer does not \"flash\", or inadvertently expose, the burn cards to players at the table.\n\nIn flop games, the three community cards comprising the flop are turned up simultaneously, never one at a time.\n\nDealers control the action during a hand. This may include prodding players to act, verbally announcing actions of players to the rest of the table, and correcting players who act out of turn.\n\nDealers also must manage the pot. The dealer must verify the amount of bets and raises by players, collect folded hands, maintain side pots, and read players' hands at showdown to identify the winner or winners. In games with a rake, the dealer also must keep track of the amount of money in the pot and remove the appropriate amount for the house.\n\nAt times the dealer needs to communicate with the floor, or other casino staff. Some casinos equip the dealers with a headset or walkie-talkie for this purpose, while in other casinos the dealer must shout over the ambient noise. The following table shows some common calls a dealer may make, and their meanings:\n\nOnline poker sites use Random number generation (RNGs) when dealing cards. A successful RNG distributes cards in an unpredictable and random way.\n\n\n"}

It was published by DC Comics' Vertigo imprint in July 2010.\n\nIt tells the story of Sam, a man who lives each day twice: first in a normal world, and then again in an alternate world which is falling apart. Sam must learn why the second universe exists, and choose which one to live in.\n\nKindt credits the idea for \"Revolver\" to his fascination with the end of the world, and says he was looking to mix \"Groundhog Day\" with \"Fight Club\".\n\nIt was first published in hardcover by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics in July, 2010.\n\nAfter a night out drinking, Sam wakes with a hangover. When he arrives at the newspaper office where he works, he discovers it has been bombed and the city (Chicago) is in a panic. Helping his boss, Jan, evacuate, the two are confronted by her ex-boyfriend. During a panicked scuffle, Sam kills the ex-boyfriend. He returns with Jan to his apartment, where they fall asleep. Sam wakes the next morning alone, and his injuries have vanished. He discovers it is the same day, and that the city is not under attack. He is certain what he remembers was not a dream.\n\nSam continues to live each day twice, alternating between the two worlds. In the chaotic one, he works with Jan and two other coworkers to produce a leaflet-style newspaper reporting the disasters. In the calmer one, he grows increasingly frustrated with how superficial his life is. He uses his time in the calmer world to learn skills that aid him in the more frantic one, such as hot-wiring a car. He and Jan become close in one world while remaining distant and unfriendly in the other. Meanwhile, Sam's relationship with his girlfriend Maria becomes sour.\n\nThe man suspected of being the mastermind of the bombings, P. K. Verve, is a motivational speaker in the calmer world. Suspecting a connection between Verve and the dual worlds, Sam seeks to meet the motivational speaker. He convinces the unfriendly Jan to finance his trip by blackmailing her with a confession she made in the chaotic world.\n\nWhen Sam finally meets Verve, he learns that both of them are alternating worlds. Verve claims the two divergent worlds were created when his brother died in a government-arranged plane crash one day, and was alive the next. Verve has used his motivational speaking to travel and learn secrets which he then uses to commit terrorist acts as vengeance in the other. Hoping Sam will be his ally, Verve arranges for them to meet in the chaotic world.\n\nSam meets with the military, and takes a tracer with him to the meeting. After confirming he is with Verve, the military bombs the hideout, killing them both. Sam wakes in the calmer world, and stops entering the alternate one.

{"id": "58902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58902", "title": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame", "text": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.\n\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and \"American Bandstand\"), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.\n\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \"rock and roll\" and heavily promoted the new genre—and that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others. Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\n\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 \"USA Today\" poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.\n\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As \"The Plain Dealer\" music critic Michael Norman noted, \"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\" but then added, \"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\"\n\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\n\nAt one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200 ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162 ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\n\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\n\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.\n\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986–92, 1994–96, 1998–2008, 2010–11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a public–private partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.\n\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.\n\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \"Backstage Stories.\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.\n\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \"The Power of Rock Experience,\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies. Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.\n\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, \"Women Who Rock\", and the Rolling Stones.\n\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \"tent\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\n\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a café.\n\n\"In designing this building,\" Pei said, \"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\" \n\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\n\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called \"I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 – 1969\". It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\n\nThat exhibit was followed by \"Elvis is in the Building\", an exhibit about the \"King of Rock and Roll\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career. Next, the museum curated \"Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story\". That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by \"Rock Style\", an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, \"Rock Style\" traveled to other museums in the U.S.\nOther temporary exhibits have included \"Lennon: His Life and Work\", which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by \"In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2\" and then \"Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection\". A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was \"Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.\"\n\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (\"Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash\"), the Doors (\"Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors\"), the Who's \"Tommy\" (\"Tommy: The Amazing Journey\"), and Bruce Springsteen (\"From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen\"). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (\"Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power\"). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\n\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford, and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.\nEvery February, the museum celebrates Black History Month by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\n\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\n\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\n\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with \"Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger\". Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008), Janis Joplin (2009), Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011), and Chuck Berry (2012).\n\nHall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\", created an unordered list of \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995. It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The oldest song on the list is \"Wabash Cannonball\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" and My Chemical Romance's \"Welcome to the Black Parade\", both released in 2006. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660-song list, with eight songs each.\n\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.\n\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. \nGenerally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters.\nThe first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\n\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \"Performers\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.\n\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \"There was a lot of discussion about this,\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\"\n\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \"rock era\".\n\nFormerly the \"Non-Performers\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.\n\nFormerly the \"Sidemen\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \"Award for Musical Excellence\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\"\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\n\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\n\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\n\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.\n\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\"\nSister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\", but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \"Hall of Lame\".\n\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of \"The New York Times\" wrote:\n\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders – and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\"\n\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\"\n\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all. The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres. According to author Brett Milano, \"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\" In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).\n\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted. A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped. The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.\n\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \"a piss stain\" and \"urine in wine\".\n\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\" In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%. Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which 61 have been women, none of whom has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.\n\n2016 inductee Steve Miller voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.\n\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\"\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\" The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.\n\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the \"New York Post\" that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\n\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\"\n\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as \"Time\", NPR radio, \"The Christian Science Monitor\", \"Goldmine\" magazine, Yahoo Music and MSNBC have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

It denotes the set of swaras, Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni which comprise a musical scale in Indian classical music. In Sanskrit, saptak\"' literally means \"containing seven\" and is derived from the Sanskrit word \"sapta\" which means \"seven\".\n\nThe basic saptak is called the Madhya Saptak (Devanagari: मध्य सप्तक). For notes with lower frequencies, the artist may use the Mandra Saptak (Devanagari: मंद्र सप्तक)', which is a lower octave than the Madhya Saptak. For notes with higher frequencies, the upper octave or the Taar Saptak (Devanagari: तार सप्तक) is used.\n\nThe usual scale of Indian music spans from Sa in the Madhya Saptak to Sa in the higher, Taar Saptak. This makes eight notes instead of the seven in each Saptak.\n\nGenerally, a raga involves notes from three saptaks. The notes in the lower octave are denoted by an apostrophe before the note representation (or a dot below the note representation) and the notes in the upper octave are denoted by an apostrophe after the note representation (or a dot above the note representation).\n\nFor example:\n\n"}
{"id": "43529715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43529715", "title": "Shooting of Michael Brown", "text": "Shooting of Michael Brown\n\nOn August 9, 2014, Michael Brown Jr., an 18-year-old African American man, was fatally shot by a white police officer, 28-year-old Darren Wilson, in the city of Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson who was 22. Wilson said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked Wilson in his police vehicle for control of Wilson's gun until it was fired. Brown and Johnson then fled, with Wilson in pursuit of Brown. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car; the last was probably the fatal shot. Brown was hit a total of six times from the front.\n\nThis event ignited unrest in Ferguson. Although a subsequent FBI investigation found that there was no evidence that Brown had his hands up in surrender or said \"don't shoot\" before he was shot, protesters believed that he had done so, and used the slogan \"Hands up, don't shoot\" in protest. Protests, both peaceful and violent, continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police established a nightly curfew. The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by the media and politicians. There were concerns over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. Missouri governor Jay Nixon ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.\n\nA grand jury was called and given extensive evidence from Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On , 2014, McCulloch announced the St. Louis County grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson. On , 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It found forensic evidence supported the officer's account, that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible, and that witnesses who had incriminated him were not credible, with some admitting they had not directly seen the events. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.\n\nMichael Brown Jr. (May 20, 1996 – August 9, 2014) graduated from Normandy High School in eight days before his death, completing an alternative education program. At the time of his death, he was 18 years old, tall, and weighed . He was an amateur musician who posted his songs on the popular music-sharing site Soundcloud under the handle \"Big'Mike\". He was two days from starting a training program for heating and air conditioning repair at Vatterott College technical school.\n\nDarren Dean Wilson (born , 1986, in Fort Worth, Texas) was tall and weighed about . He was armed with a SIG Sauer P229. His parents divorced in 1989. Wilson attended St. Charles West High School; in November 2002, while he was a student there, his mother died of natural causes. Wilson graduated from high school in 2004.\n\nWilson's first police job was as a rookie officer in Jennings, Missouri, where he began working in 2009. With respect to this job, Wilson said to \"The New Yorker\" in 2015, \"I'd never been in an area where there was that much poverty.\" The police force in Jennings was shut down by the town's city council in March 2011. In October 2011, Wilson began working for the Ferguson Police Department. In February 2013, Wilson won a commendation from the Ferguson Police Department after he apprehended a suspect who was later charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and resisting arrest.\n\nSurveillance video which was publicly released in the 2017 documentary film \"Stranger Fruit\" shows Michael Brown walking into Ferguson Market and Liquor at 1:13 a.m., twelve hours before he entered the store for the final time. The footage shows Brown handing a young clerk a brown package, believed by the filmmaker to be marijuana, and then receiving an unpurchased package of cigarillos from the store. After the video was rediscovered and made public in 2017, some, including Brown's family, said they believed Brown had left the package there for safekeeping and later returned to retrieve it. The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him \"cigarillos for pot.\" The lawyer claimed \"[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back.\" The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him. Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis county prosecutor to try to settle questions.\n\nAt , Wilson responded to a call about a baby with breathing problems and drove to Glenark Drive, east of Canfield Drive. About three minutes later and several blocks away, Brown was recorded on camera stealing a box of Swisher cigars and forcefully shoving a Ferguson Market clerk. Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, left the market at about At 11:53, a police dispatcher reported \"stealing in progress\" at the Ferguson Market and described the suspect as a black male wearing a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip. The suspect was reported as having stolen a box of Swisher cigars. At 11:57, the dispatch described the suspect as wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki shorts, and that he was accompanied by another male. At , Wilson reported he was back in service and radioed units 25 and 22 to ask if they needed his assistance in searching for the suspects. Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer said the suspects had disappeared. Wilson called for backup at 12:02, saying \"[Unit] 21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.\"\n\nInitially, reports of what happened next differed widely among sources and witnesses, particularly with regards to whether Brown was coming towards Wilson when the shots were actually fired. At noon on , Wilson drove up to Brown and Johnson as they were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive and ordered them to move off the street. Wilson continued driving past the two men, but then backed up and stopped close to them. A struggle took place between Brown and Wilson after the former reached through the window of the police SUV, a Chevrolet Tahoe. Wilson's gun was fired twice during the struggle from inside the vehicle, with one bullet hitting Brown's right hand. Brown and Johnson fled and Johnson hid behind a car. Wilson got out of the vehicle and pursued Brown. At some point, Wilson fired his gun again, while facing Brown, and hit him with at least 6 shots. Brown was unarmed and died on the street. Less than 90 seconds passed from the time Wilson encountered Brown to the time of Brown's death.\n\nAn unidentified officer arrived on the scene and, 73 seconds after Wilson's call, asked where the second suspect was. Thirty-one seconds later, a supervisor was requested by Unit 25. At , an officer on scene radioed to dispatch for more units. Also at 12:07, the County police were notified and county officers began arriving on scene at around The County detectives were notified at and arrived about , with the forensic investigator arriving at about \n\nPolice dispatched a dozen units to the scene by with another dozen, including two canine units, by Gunshots were recorded in Ferguson police logs at , and by the ambulance dispatch again at , which led to the response of 20 units from eight different municipal forces in the next 20 minutes. As the situation deteriorated, the police commanders had investigators seek cover and detectives assisted in crowd control. At , four canine units arrived on scene, and the SWAT team arrived at The medical examiner began his examination at around and concluded about half an hour later, with the body being cleared to be taken to the morgue. At , Brown's body was signed in by workers at the morgue.\n\nBrown was fatally shot by Wilson at about 12:02 p.m. The Ferguson Police Department was on the scene within minutes, as were crowds of residents, some expressing hostility toward the police. Paramedics covered the body with sheets. About after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Chief turned over the homicide investigation to the St. Louis County Police Department (SLCPD). The arrival of SLCPD detectives took about , as they were occupied with another crime scene away. On arrival at 1:30 p.m., they put up privacy screens around the body. Their investigation was slowed due to safety concerns regarding the sound of gunfire in the area and some hostile members of the crowd encroaching on the crime scene. An investigator from the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office arrived at 2:30 p.m. Brown's body was removed at 4:00 p.m. Local residents criticized authorities for leaving Brown's body in the street for 4 hours in an action seen as demeaning and disrespectful.\n\nOn , 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a civil rights investigation into the incident. A spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office said the decision to open an investigation was not motivated by the protests and riots which had ensued. Forty FBI agents went door-to-door looking for potential witnesses who may have had information about the shooting. Additionally, attorneys from the Civil Rights Division and from the United States Attorney's Office were participating in the investigation.\n\nOn , 2015, the federal investigation cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. The investigation concluded there was no evidence upon which prosecutors could rely to disprove Wilson's asserted belief that he feared for his safety, that witnesses who contradicted Wilson were not credible, that forensic evidence and credible witnesses corroborated Wilson's account, and that the facts did not support the filing of criminal charges against Wilson. Credible witnesses did not support accounts that Brown had his hands up in surrender. He was not shot in the back. Forensic evidence showed he was moving toward Wilson. Numerous witnesses were found to have given accounts of actions they were unable to see from their vantage points, or to be recounting others' accounts.\n\nThe grand jury was made up of members who had been impaneled in May 2014 for a regularly scheduled term, to hear all cases put forward by the prosecuting attorney's office. There were three black members (one man and two women) and nine whites (six men and three women), an ethnic breakdown that roughly reflects the racial makeup of County, which is about 30% black, and 70% white. On , 2014, the grand jury started hearing evidence in the case \"State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson\", in order to decide whether a crime was committed and if there was probable cause to believe Wilson committed it.\n\nThere was intense interest focused on the grand jury. Robert P. McCulloch, the elected prosecuting attorney for County, was in charge of the prosecution but did not participate in the direct handling of the grand jury hearing. It was handled by two Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys of McCulloch's office: Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila Whirley. McCulloch announced an unusual process: the grand jury would hear all the evidence, the proceedings would be transcribed, and the materials would be made public if the grand jury did not indict.\n\nThe grand jury took 25 days, over the span of three months, to hear more than 5,000 pages of testimony from 60 witnesses and then deliberate on whether or not to indict Wilson. Most grand juries complete their work in a matter of days. The grand jury was not sequestered during the process. \n\nOn the night of , Prosecutor McCulloch reported in a 20-minute press conference that the grand jury had reached a decision in the case and would not indict Wilson.\n\nFollowing his announcement, McCulloch released thousands of pages of grand jury documents, with materials published on the Internet for public perusal. The documents include transcripts of the proceedings, expert statements, and the testimony of some witnesses. On , more witness interviews and more than 50 brief audio recordings between the police dispatchers and responding police officers were released. On , a third release included the transcripts of witness interviews, including one with Dorian Johnson. A video of the two-hour interview of Johnson by FBI and county police was withheld.\n\nRobert P. McCulloch was the main focus of much of the criticism throughout the process and well into its aftermath. Attorney Raul Reyes characterized McCulloch as not being impartial, as his father was a police officer killed in an incident with a black suspect and other members of his family served with the Police Department. A petition calling for McCulloch to recuse himself gained 70,000 signatures. Governor Jay Nixon declined to remove McCulloch and said doing so would potentially jeopardize the prosecution. McCulloch dismissed the claims of bias, and later said he regretted not speaking publicly about his background at the time.\n\nLegal analysts raised concerns over McCulloch's unorthodox approach, saying this process could have influenced the grand jury to decide against indictment and that they were given too much material to assess. The analysts highlighted the significant differences between a typical grand jury proceeding in Missouri and how Wilson's case was handled.\n\nEvidence presented to the grand jury showed the shooting scene extended approximately along Canfield Drive, near where it intersects Copper Creek Court. The two-lane street runs in an approximately west-to-east direction and has sidewalks and curbs on both sides. Immediately prior to the incident, Brown was walking eastbound on Canfield and Wilson was driving westbound. Evidence at the scene was generally clustered around Wilson's SUV on the western side of the scene and near Brown's body, which was in the eastern part of the area.\n\nThe western area included Wilson's police vehicle, which was angled slightly toward the right curb with its left-rear corner on the center line. Evidence included two bracelets, a baseball cap, and two .40 caliber spent casings. One of these casings was found at the western edge of the scene and the other was located near the rear driver's side of the police vehicle. There were two groups of red stains near the driver's side of the vehicle and a left sandal was also located in the vicinity. The right sandal was approximately east of the western area.\n\nThe eastern area, which was approximately east of the western area, was about wide. Brown's body was situated along the center-line of the road with his head oriented in a westerly direction. The distance from the driver's door of the SUV to Brown's head was about . Two groups of red stains were located at the extreme eastern edge of the scene, with the furthest under from Brown's feet.\n\nOne apparent projectile was found near the body. There were ten spent casings scattered on the south side of the road near Brown's body. The distribution of the casings, combined with most of the casings being east of the body, was consistent with the officer moving backward while firing. Blood spatter approximately 25 feet behind Brown's body suggested he was moving toward Wilson when he was killed.\n\nBrown's DNA was found on the gun. His DNA was also found on the left thigh of Wilson's pants and on the inside driver's door handle of Wilson's police SUV, the result of Brown's spilled blood staining Wilson's pants and the door handle. Wilson's DNA was found on Brown's left palm but was not found under Brown's fingernails or on his right hand.\n\nDr. Michael Graham, the St. Louis medical examiner, said blood was found on Wilson's gun and inside the car, and tissue from Brown was found on the exterior of the driver's side of Wilson's vehicle; this evidence was consistent with a struggle at that location. According to Judy Melinek, a San Francisco pathologist who commented on the case as an expert, the official autopsy, which said Brown's hand had foreign matter consistent with a gun discharge on it, supported Wilson's testimony that Brown was reaching for the weapon, or indicated the gun was inches away from Brown's hand when it went off.\n\nAccording to the detective who performed tests on the gun, he had to decide whether to perform a DNA test or dust for fingerprints, because only one test can be performed without affecting the other. He found the gun stored in an unsealed envelope, contrary to the customary evidence-handling protocol. Documents released after the grand jury proceedings show Wilson washed blood from his hands and checked his own gun into an evidence bag, both actions described by media outlets as unorthodox procedures for such a case.\n\nThree autopsies were performed on Brown's body, with all three noting Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. He received no shots in his back.\n\nThe county autopsy report described gunshot entry and exit wounds to Brown's right arm coming from both the front (ventral, palms facing forward) and the back (dorsal, palms facing backward).\n\nThe local medical examiner autopsy report released to state prosecutors said Brown was shot in the front part of his body. When Mary Case, the County medical examiner, was asked to provide details, she declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown's death. The official county autopsy was later leaked to the \" Post-Dispatch\".\n\nThe narrative report of investigation from the office of the medical examiner of agreed with Wilson's testimony. It noted Brown had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head, torso, and right arm, as well as a single gunshot wound to the inside of his right hand near his thumb and palm; it also noted Brown's body had abrasions to the right side of his face and on the back of his left hand.\n\nThe autopsy noted the absence of stippling, powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot was fired at a relatively short range. Dr. Michael Graham, the medical examiner, notes gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from the thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing. The gunshot wound to the top of Brown's head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.\n\nA toxicology test performed by a University laboratory revealed the presence of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in Brown's blood and urine. The presence of THC indicates Brown had used marijuana within a few hours of his death, but it could not be determined whether or not Brown was impaired at the time of his death.\n\nAt the request of Brown's family, on a preliminary autopsy was conducted by Dr. Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York (1978–1979). This autopsy was limited because the previous county autopsy had washed, embalmed, and taken evidence off the body.\n\nAccording to Baden's report, Brown was shot six times into his front: four of the bullets entered his right arm, one entered his right eye on a downward trajectory, and one entered the top of his skull. All of the rounds were fired from a distance of at least one foot. One of the shots shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, then exited his jaw and reentered his collarbone. The shot that entered the top of his skull caused the fatal injury. Brown could have survived the first bullet wounds, but the bullet that entered the top of his head resulted in a fatal injury.\n\nBaden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. Baden concluded there was too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting. At least two commentators noted the results of both autopsies contradicted some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, which had reported Wilson shot Brown in the back and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck. In later analysis, Baden reclassified one of Brown's chest wounds as an entry wound.\n\nDr. Baden was assisted by Shawn Parcells, who does not have a degree or other credentials in medicine or pathology. Dr. Thomas Young, former Jackson County Medical Examiner, said Parcells is giving out forensic pathology opinions when he is not qualified to do so. Dr. Mary Case, who performed the initial autopsy, said Parcells' involvement could cause issues with the second autopsy. Parcells said all he did was assist Dr. Baden.\n\nAttorney General Holder ordered a third autopsy of Brown's body. Its findings matched the other two autopsies, but its detailed findings were initially withheld from the public due to the ongoing investigation. The federal autopsy report was among a group of documents released by the County Prosecutor's Office on , two weeks after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.\n\nOn , CNN released an audio recording purported to contain the sounds of the shooting. The recording was made by an anonymous third-party who happened to be recording a video-text message at the time of the incident. Glide, a video messaging service, confirmed the audio had been recorded on their site at on the day of the shooting. The twelve-second recording contains a series of shots, a short pause, and then a second series of shots.\n\nForensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg says he heard six shots, a pause, and then four additional shots. Ginsberg said, \"I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.\" CNN's law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes noted most accounts of the shooting say there was a single shot earlier in the incident near the vehicle that is not audible in the recording. The recording was also analyzed by SST, Inc., a company specializing in gunfire locator technology. That analysis found the sound of ten gunshots and seven gunshot echoes within seven seconds, with a three-second pause after the sixth shot. The company's analysis also said all ten rounds were fired from within a radius of , indicating the shooter was not moving.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" said there were unorthodox forensic practices shown in the published testimony of Wilson and other law enforcement officials. It said Wilson washed blood off of his hands without photographing them first. It also said Wilson submitted his gun to evidence by himself, and that initial interviews of Wilson were conducted with other personnel present and were not taped. It described Wilson's face injuries after the shooting as photographed by a local detective at the Fraternal Order of Police building, instead of at Ferguson Police headquarters. An investigator with the County Medical Examiner's office testified he decided not to take measurements at the crime scene nor did he photograph the scene, instead relying on photographs taken by the County Police Department.\n\nMultiple witnesses saw part or all of the event and have given interviews to the media, testified to the grand jury, and were interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The witness accounts were conflicting on various points. David A. Klinger, a criminologist at the University of Missouri–, said eyewitness testimony often differs from witness to witness, a phenomenon commonly known as the Rashomon effect.\n\nAn Associated Press review of the grand jury found numerous problems in the witness testimony, including statements that were \"inconsistent, fabricated, or provably wrong\". Several of the witnesses admitted changing their testimony to fit released evidence, or other witness statements. Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch said, \"I thought it was important to present anybody and everybody, and some that were, yes, clearly not telling the truth, no question about it.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice investigation into the shooting determined witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account were credible while those who contradicted his account were not. The witnesses that claimed Brown was surrendering or did not move toward Wilson were not credible; the report said their claims were inconsistent with the physical evidence, other witness statements, and in some cases prior statements from the same witness. No witness statements that pointed to Wilson's guilt were determined to be credible. Twenty-four statements were determined to lack any credibility, while eight which were found credible corroborated Wilson's account. Nine did not completely contradict nor corroborate Wilson's account. Several witnesses reported fear of reprisals from the community for providing evidence that corroborated Wilson's account.\n\nWilson gave his account of the incident in an interview with a detective on , and in testimony before the grand jury in September. Wilson said he had just left a call involving a sick person when he heard on his radio that there was a theft in progress at a local convenience store. Wilson heard the description of the suspects and soon after observed two black males walking down the middle of the street. Wilson pulled up to them and told the two to walk on the sidewalk, and Johnson replied, \"we're almost to our destination\". As they passed his window, Brown said \"fuck what you have to say\".\n\nWilson then backed up about ten feet to where they were and attempted to open his door. After backing up, Wilson told the two to \"come here\", and Brown told him in reply, \"what the fuck are you gonna do\". Wilson shut the door and Brown approached him and he opened the door again \"trying to push him back\", while telling him to get back. Brown \"started swinging and punching at me from outside the vehicle\", and Brown had his body against the door. Wilson said the first strike from Brown was a \"glancing blow\", and at that point he was trying to get Brown's arms out of his face. This was when Brown turned to his left and handed Johnson several packs of the stolen cigarillos he had been holding. Wilson then grabbed Brown's right arm trying to get control, but Brown hit him in the face. Wilson said he \"felt like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan\" while he attempted to restrain Brown when he reached through his police car window. Wilson said it \"jarred\" him back and he yelled at Brown numerous times to stop and get back. Wilson said he thought about using his mace and his baton, but he was unable to reach either of them. He then drew his weapon and pointed it at Brown and told him to stop or he would shoot him, while ordering him to the ground.\n\nAccording to Wilson, Brown then said \"you're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me\" and grabbed for his gun and twisted it, pointing it at him, into his hip area. Wilson placed his left hand against Brown's hand and his other hand on the gun and pushed forward with both his arms. The gun was somewhat lined up with Brown, and Wilson pulled the trigger twice, but the weapon failed to discharge. On the next try, the gun fired and Brown then attempted to hit him multiple times inside his vehicle. Wilson shot at Brown again, but missed and he took off running east, while Wilson exited his vehicle and radioed for backup. Wilson followed him, yelling for him to stop and get on the ground, but he kept running. Brown eventually stopped and turned and made a \"grunting noise\" and started running at him with his right hand under his shirt in his waistband. Brown ignored Wilson's commands to stop and get on the ground, so Wilson fired multiple shots at him, paused and yelled at him to get on the ground again, but Brown was still charging at him and had not slowed down. Wilson then fired another set of shots, but Brown was still running at him. When Brown was about eight to ten feet away, Wilson fired more shots, with one of those hitting Brown in the head, which brought him down with his hand still in his waistband. Wilson said two patrol cars showed up approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after the final shot. When his supervisor arrived, he was sent to the police station.\n\nWilson told detectives Brown had reached his right hand into his waistband and that the hand still appeared to be in the waistband after Brown was shot. The medical investigator at the scene of the shooting did not take any photographs and testified to the grand jury that Brown's left hand was under his dead body, near the waistband, and the right hand was extended outwards.\n\nOn , Wilson gave his first public interview about the shooting to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.\n\nNumerous witness accounts were consistent with Wilson's account and also agreed with the physical evidence at hand. Many witnesses corroborated that Wilson acted in self-defense during the event. A number of the witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account of events expressed fear and apprehension in testifying, saying they had been harassed or threatened by individuals from the Ferguson community. The following are a sample of the witnesses whose accounts aligned with Wilson's testimony.\n\nWitness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He said he saw Wilson chase Brown until Brown abruptly turned around. Brown did not put his hands up in surrender but made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.\n\nAfter the shooting Witness 102 remained in the neighborhood for a short period of time, and corrected a couple of people who claimed Wilson \"stood over [Brown] and shot while [he was] on the ground\". In response, Witness 102 said Wilson shot Brown because Brown came back toward Wilson. Witness 102 \"kept thinking\" Wilson's shots were \"missing\" Brown because Brown kept moving. Witness 102 did not stay in the neighborhood for long, and left the area shortly afterward because he felt uncomfortable. According to the witness, \"crowds of people had begun to gather, wrongly claiming the police shot Brown for no reason and that he had his hands up in surrender\". Two black women approached Witness 102, mobile phones set to record, asking him to recount what he had witnessed. Witness 102 responded that they would not like what he had to say. The women responded with racial slurs, calling him names like 'white motherfucker'.\"\n\nWitness 103, a 58-year-old black male, testified that from his parked truck he saw \"Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver's window of the SUV... Wilson and Brown [had] hold of each other's shirts, but Brown was 'getting in a couple of blows [on Wilson]'.\" Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running. Wilson exited the SUV, appeared to be using his shoulder microphone to call into his radio, and chased Brown with his gun held low ... Brown came to a stop near a car, put his hand down on the car, and turned around to face Wilson. Brown's hands were then down at his sides. Witness 103 did not see Brown's hands up. Wanting to leave, Witness 103 began to turn his car around in the opposite direction that Brown had been running when he heard additional shots. Witness 103 turned to his right, and saw Brown \"moving fast\" toward Wilson. Witness 103 then drove away.\"\n\nWitness 104, a 26-year-old biracial female, witnessed the end of the altercation from a minivan:\n\n[Witness 104] saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who \"hopped\" out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling \"stop, stop, stop\". Wilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and \"for a second\" began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly \"balled up in fists\" in a running position and \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a \"tackle run\", explaining Brown \"wasn't going to stop\". Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him. Witness 104 explained there were three separate volleys of shots. Each time, Brown ran toward Wilson, Wilson fired, Brown paused, Wilson stopped firing, and then Brown charged again. The pattern continued until Brown fell to the ground, \"smashing\" his face upon impact. Wilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she \"would have fired sooner\". Wilson did not go near Brown's body after Brown fell to his death.\n\nWitness 108, a 74-year-old black male, told detectives the police officer was \"in the right\" and \"did what he had to do\", and that statements made by people in the apartment complex about Brown surrendering were inaccurate. Witness 108 later told investigators he \"would have fucking shot that boy, too\", and mimicked the aggressive stance Brown made while charging Wilson. He explained Wilson told Brown to \"stop\" or \"get down\" at least ten times, but instead Brown \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 108 also told detectives there were other witnesses on Canfield Drive who saw what he did.\n\nWitness 109, a 53-year-old black male, said he decided to come forward after seeing Dorian Johnson \"lie\" about the events on television. He said when Wilson asked the two boys to get out of the street, Brown responded something to the effect of \"Fuck the police.\" Afterward, Wilson got out of his car and Brown hit him in the face. Witness 109 said he saw Wilson reach for his taser but dropped it and then grabbed a gun, after which Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun. According to 109, at one point Brown ran away from Wilson, but turned around and charged toward the officer. He said Wilson fired in self-defense, and did not appear to be shooting to kill at first.\n\nWitness 113, a 31-year-old black female, made statements that corroborated Wilson's account. She said she was afraid of the \"neighborhood backlash\" that might come from her testimony, and feared offering an account contrary to the narrative reported by the media that Brown held his hands up in surrender. She also told investigators she thought Wilson's life was in danger.\n\nWitness 136 was in his apartment using a video chat application on his mobile phone while the shooting occurred. After hearing the first few shots, he recorded the remainder of his chat on his phone and turned it over to the FBI. The recording is about 12 seconds long and captured a total of 10 gunshots. The gunshots begin after the first four seconds. The recording captured six gunshots in two seconds. After a three-second pause, a seventh gunshot is heard. A pause of less than one second gave way to the final three-shot volley within two seconds. The recording was not time-stamped. As detailed below, this recording is consistent with several credible witness accounts as well as Wilson's account, that he fired several volleys of shots, briefly pausing between each one.\n\nSeveral witnesses who originally testified against Wilson were also interviewed by the prosecution. They admitted to lying under oath as to the truthfulness of their testimony. At least one witness took an account from a newspaper; this witness was later discredited by investigators during the process.\n\nWitness 22, who originally claimed she saw Wilson kill Brown in cold blood, admitted she lied to investigators and never saw the incident at all. She said she was just passing along information which her boyfriend told her he saw. The court transcript reads:\n\nProsecutors also played the grand jury a 10-minute police interview with a man who claimed to have witnessed the shooting. They then played a phone call in which that man admitted he actually had not seen the incident at all. Another witness insisted another officer was with Wilson at the time of the shooting. (By all other accounts, Wilson was the only officer present when he shot Brown). This witness described having a clear view of what transpired despite there being a building between the witness' location and where the incident took place.\n\nWitness 35 said Brown was \"on his knees\" when Wilson shot him in the head. Under questioning, his testimony fell apart, and he admitted fabricating it.\n\nAnother witness described Brown on his hands and knees pleading for his life. After a prosecutor confronted the witness and told them what they had seen was not forensically possible based on the evidence, the witness later asked to leave.\n\nAnother witness—number 37—testified that, during a confrontation at Wilson's vehicle, Wilson shot Brown point blank in the chest—but Brown did not fall over and was not clearly bleeding as he ran away. This witness gave several different accounts of how many shots were fired. While he was further pressed for answers as to the truthfulness of his statements, he instead posed questions in return, refusing to elaborate on his statements.\n\nJohnson, a friend of Brown, who was with him that day, gave his account of the incident to media outlets in August and testified before the grand jury in September. In media interviews, Johnson said Wilson pulled up beside them and said, \"Get the f— on the sidewalk.\" The young men replied they were \"not but a minute away from [their] destination, and [they] would shortly be out of the street\". Wilson drove forward without saying anything further and abruptly backed up, positioning his vehicle crosswise in their path. Wilson tried to open his door aggressively and the door ricocheted off both of their bodies and closed back on Wilson. Wilson, still in his vehicle, grabbed Brown around his neck through the open window, and Brown tried to pull away, but Wilson continued to pull Brown toward him \"like tug of war\". Johnson said Brown \"did not reach for the officer's weapon at all\", and was attempting to get free, when Wilson drew his weapon and said, \"I'll shoot you\" or \"I'm going to shoot\", and fired his weapon hitting Brown. Following the initial gunshot, Brown freed himself, and the two fled. Wilson exited the vehicle, and fired several rounds at the fleeing Brown, hitting him once in the back. Brown turned around with his hands raised and said, \"I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!\" Wilson then shot Brown several more times, killing him.\n\nIn his testimony to the grand jury, Johnson said he and Brown had walked to a convenience store to buy cigarillos, but Brown instead reached over the counter and took them and shoved a clerk on his way out the door. Johnson testified that on their walk back home, Brown had the cigarillos in his hands in plain sight and two Ferguson police cars passed them, but did not stop. When Wilson encountered them, he told the two to \"get the fuck on the sidewalk\" and Johnson told him they would be off the street shortly as they were close to their destination. Johnson testified Wilson was the aggressor from the beginning and that for no apparent reason, he backed his vehicle up and tried to open his door, but Brown shut it, preventing him from getting out. Johnson said Wilson then reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck and the two were engaged in a \"tug of war\", and Wilson said \"I'll shoot\". Johnson said he never saw Brown hit Wilson and did not think Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun, but that a shot was fired. At that point, Johnson said they both ran and Wilson fired while Brown was running away, Brown turned around and \"at that time Big Mike's hands was up, but not so much in the air, because he had been struck\". Johnson told the jurors Brown said \"I don't have a gun\", was mad and tried to say again \"I don't have a gun\", but \"before he can say the second sentence or before he can even get it out, that's when the several more shots came.\" In his testimony, Johnson maintained Brown did not run at Wilson prior to the fatal shots.\n\nPeaceful protests and civil disorder broke out the day following Brown's shooting and lasted for several days. This was in part due to the belief among many that Brown was surrendering, as well as longstanding racial tensions between the majority-black population and the majority-white city government and police. As the details of the original shooting event emerged from investigators, police grappled with establishing curfews and maintaining order, while members of the Ferguson community demonstrated in various ways in the vicinity of the original shooting. On , a day of memorials began peacefully, but some crowd members became unruly after an evening candlelight vigil. Local police stations assembled approximately 150 officers in riot gear. Some people began looting businesses, vandalizing vehicles, and confronting police officers who sought to block off access to several areas of the city. Widespread media coverage examined the post-9/11 trend of local police departments arming themselves with military-grade weapons when dealing with protests. In the days following the shooting, state and federal officials weighed in on the matter. On , President Barack Obama offered his condolences to Brown's family and community. On , Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said in an op-ed in \"Time Magazine\", that the event was a tragedy and that police forces need to be demilitarized.\n\nOn , a report and video showing the robbery of a convenience store by Brown was released by the Ferguson Police Department. Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson. The report and video were part of a packet that included information about the shooting afterward. The report containing frames of the surveillance footage showed Brown grabbing a box of cigarillos, followed by an apparent struggle or confrontation between Brown and a store clerk. The statutory deadline in the Sunshine Law, Missouri's equivalent of the federal Freedom of Information Act, was the cited reason for the release following requests by \" Post-Dispatch\", Judicial Watch and others.\n\nThe Department of Justice had urged the video not be released, saying a release would inflame tension. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon identified the release as an attempt to disparage Brown during the investigation that would inflame the community. Brown's family released a statement in which they condemn the way the police chief chose to disseminate information, calling it character assassination following the \"execution-style murder\" of their son.\n\nThe release of information was criticized as part of an erratic and infrequent release of information by the police. Previously, the police withheld the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing safety concerns following death threats against the unnamed officer. The County Police incident report lacked details. The Ferguson Police incident report was obtained by the ACLU after a request and subsequent lawsuit. Wilson did not file an incident report and there was no Ferguson Police use-of-force report related to the incident. The Ferguson Police Department refused to commit to a deadline for releasing a full autopsy report.\n\nWhen the report and video were released, the police said Wilson had known Brown was a suspect in the robbery. In a media conference, Ferguson's chief of police Tom Jackson said the robbery was unrelated to the initial contact, and had nothing to do with Wilson stopping Brown and Johnson. Jackson later clarified Wilson recognized Brown as a suspect because he saw a box of cigars in his hand. Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in New York City who now serves as a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said, while the police officer may have stopped Brown for jaywalking, Brown may have been thinking the officer knew about the robbery: \"Obviously the cop's reaction is not affected, but what could be affected is [Brown's] reaction to the cop.\"\n\nA Pew Research Center Survey published on August 18 suggested differences in American public opinion between whites and blacks. It indicated 80% of blacks and 37% of whites believed the shooting \"raises important issues about race\".\n\nOn , St. Louis held their annual Peace Fest, which had a particular focus on Mike Brown. In attendance was Mike Brown's father, Mike Brown Sr., as well as the parents of Trayvon Martin (an unarmed black teen who was shot and killed in Florida in 2012).\n\nIn August, Chief Jackson said Wilson had been injured in the incident. Wilson's medical record shows his injuries were diagnosed as a facial contusion, a term used to describe a bruise.\n\nBrown's funeral was held on and was attended by an estimated 4,500 people. Al Sharpton delivered one of two eulogies.\n\nOn , anonymous sources leaked to the \"Post-Dispatch\" what they described as Wilson's grand jury testimony, following other leaks on Wilson's version of the events. The Justice Department issued a statement that it \"considers the selective release of information in this investigation to be irresponsible and highly troubling. Since the release of the convenience-store footage, there seems to be an inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case.\" Wilson's defense team denied they were behind the leaks, saying they \"[were] not in possession of any of the disclosed reports or the investigative report\". The County prosecutor spokesperson said his office would not investigate the leaks because they could not force journalists to divulge their sources, and \"you can tell by the information they have that the leaks are not coming from the grand jury or the prosecutor's office.\" The leaks concerning grand jury testimony were condemned by the Justice Department as inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case. The leaks referred to evidence supporting Wilson's testimony and decreased the likelihood of an indictment whilst fanning the flames of angry protesters.\n\nFollowing the grand jury announcement, protests, some of them violent, broke out in Ferguson and other cities across the United States. Several Ferguson businesses were looted and fires set by protesters. Protests erupted in 170 cities across the U.S., including St Louis, Philadelphia, Seattle, Albuquerque, New York City, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Oakland, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Chicago, and Boston. Numerous media reports and legal experts criticized the process for failing to return an indictment in cases concerning law enforcement officers.\n\nA December 2014 opinion poll by Washington Post-ABC News showed a majority of blacks do not believe that they receive treatment equal to whites by the police or the criminal justice system. Six out of ten white Americans believe the police treat races equally with roughly half of white Americans believing the criminal justice provides equal treatment, but there is a sharp partisan divide between white Americans. Conservative or Republican white Americans are far more likely to say whites and blacks receive equal treatment in the justice system than the liberal or Democratic white Americans.\n\nOn , the U.S. Department of Justice announced Wilson would not be charged in the shooting. Its report said \"[t]here is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety,\" and that accounts that Brown put his hands up are \"inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence\".\n\nPresident Obama reacted to the announcement, stating, \"The finding that was made [by the Department of Justice] was that it was not unreasonable to determine that there was not sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson. That was an objective, thorough, independent federal investigation.\" He further added, \"We may never know exactly what happened. But Officer Wilson like anybody else who is charged with a crime benefits from due process and a reasonable doubt standard.\"\n\nVarious heads of state and foreign news organizations have commented on the shooting and subsequent protests including the Chinese Xinhua News Agency, Germany's \"Der Spiegel\", Egypt's Ministry of Foreign affairs, the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency, protesters throughout the Middle East, the Russian Foreign Ministry, Spain's \"El Mundo\", the British \"Metro\", and others.\n\nAmnesty International (AI) sent a team of human rights observers, trainers, and researchers to Ferguson. It was the first time the organization deployed such a team in the United States. In a press release, AI USA director Steven W. Hawkins said, \"The U.S. cannot continue to allow those obligated and duty-bound to protect to become those who their community fears most.\" On , AI published a report declaring human rights abuses in Ferguson. The report cited the use of lethal force in Brown's death, racial discrimination and excessive use of police force, imposition of restrictions on the rights to protest, intimidation of protesters, the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and long range acoustic devices, restrictions imposed on the media covering the protests, and lack of accountability for law enforcement policing protests.\n\nThe grand jury process was atypical because of significant and numerous departures from other normal grand jury proceedings. The American grand jury process operates in secret, with the proceedings, evidence and testimony rarely being released to the public in cases of no indictment. From the beginning, McCulloch desired to provide transparency to the process and had the proceeding transcribed with the intention of releasing the materials to the public if there was no indictment. Paul Cassell, former U.S. federal judge, said the investigative grand jury was unique because they were investigating with no assurance that any criminal conduct was present, in contrast to normal grand jury proceedings which have been screened for probable cause by a prosecutor. McCulloch's intentions to present all the evidence resulted in the proceedings which took far longer than regular grand juries which decide within days.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, the prosecution presented a 1979 Missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force \"to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody [of a person]\". Before the grand jury deliberated, jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the Tennessee v Garner ruling, which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force cannot be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect. \"MSNBC's\" Lawrence O'Donnell argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict Wilson. Andrew F. Branca, a Massachusetts lawyer focusing on self-defense law, attributed O'Donnell's comments as a straw man because self-defense is a completely independent and sufficient justification for the use of deadly force. The Public Radio later clarified that even if Wilson was indicted and convicted at trial based on the Garner ruling, the conviction could be challenged on the basis that Missouri law permitted the use of deadly force.\n\nThe prosecution's handling of the case received particular attention. Roger Parloff said prosecutors do not usually exclude truly exculpatory evidence and that prosecutors do not typically indict if they believe the accused is not guilty, disagreeing with the notion that McCulloch should have presented evidence with the purpose of obtaining an indictment. Jay Sterling Silver said the grand jury case indicated a conflict of interest between local prosecutors and police, as the former needs to maintain a good relationship with law enforcement. Mark O'Mara said the unusual process was to avoid arguments that the presentation was to effect a particular result, yet despite this McCulloch was still criticized for the decision. Paul Callan, former deputy chief of homicide in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, gave a layered response which asserted the choice to present all the evidence was unusual, but not unprecedented in controversial cases. Callan said some prosecutors use the grand jury process as political cover in cases which would not succeed at trial, and in cases in which subsequent investigations and civil lawsuits would raise further criticism. William Fitzpatrick, of the National District Attorneys Association, said it was not strange for prosecutors in police-involved cases to provide all available evidence and not ask for a specific charge and defended McCulloch's inclusion of evidence. Jeffrey Toobin agreed the exoneration may have been well-justified because a conviction would have been very unlikely at a trial, but the process that was used does not inspire confidence in the legal system. In a later interview, McCulloch defended the choice to include all evidence and not skew the presentation just for the sake of getting an indictment.\n\n\"The New York Times\" described prosecutors' questioning of Wilson as \"gentle\" and said it contrasted with the sharp challenges to witnesses whose accounts seemed to contradict Wilson's, and reported this had led some to question whether the process was as objective as McCulloch had claimed. The \"Times\" reported prosecutors asked witness after witness if Brown appeared to be reaching for a weapon when confronting Wilson, though few of them said this. Furthermore, contradictions in testimony by Wilson and other law-enforcement officers were left unchallenged by prosecutors. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin criticized the prosecutors for asking softball questions during the cross examination of Wilson's testimony, and referred particularly to the fact that no witness could corroborate Wilson's story that he had warned Brown twice to lay down on the ground, and when asked, witnesses said they did not hear him say that.\n\nAfter the grand jury's decision was announced, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, turned to a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered, and yelled \"Burn this bitch down\", according to a \"New York Times\" video. Moments before, he had said \"If I get up [on the platform] I'm gonna start a riot.\" He later apologized for the outburst.\n\nBy September 24, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson publicly apologized to the family of Michael Brown. By March 12, five months later, Thomas Jackson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department. On , Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force with no severance, citing security concerns. Wilson's lawyer said Wilson \"will never be a police officer again\" as he does not want to put other officers at risk due to his presence. The National Bar Association, an organization of African American lawyers and judges, made a complaint to the Missouri Department of Public Safety demanding Wilson's police officer license be revoked. Wilson's attempts to obtain employment as a police officer have been unsuccessful.\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced the federal government would spend $75 million on body cameras for law enforcement officers, as one of the measures taken in response to the shooting.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press' annual poll of United States news directors and editors, the top news story of 2014 was police killings of unarmed blacks—including the shooting of Brown—as well as their investigations and the protests in their aftermath.\n\nRoger Goldman, emeritus professor at Saint Louis University Law School, Flanders, a Saint Louis University law professor, and Senator Jamilah Nasheed seek the updating of Missouri state law to comply with the 1985 U.S. Supreme Court decision, \"Tennessee v. Garner\".\n\nThe cover of \"The New Yorker\"s , 2015, issue depicted Martin Luther King Jr. linking arms with Eric Garner and Wenjian Liu, and joined by Trayvon Martin and Brown.\n\nFunds for Wilson and the Brown family were solicited on the Internet, each accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nBrown's death has been cited as one of several police killings of African Americans protested by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"Hands up, don't shoot\", or simply \"hands up\", is a slogan and gesture originating from the incident and was seen in demonstrations in Ferguson and throughout the United States. The gesture became a rallying cry against police violence.\n\nOn , 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report on the shooting, which said, \"There is no witness who has stated that Brown had his hands up in surrender whose statement is otherwise consistent with the physical evidence\" and \"our investigation did not reveal any eyewitness who stated that Brown said 'don't shoot'.\"\n\nOn , two NYPD officers were shot and killed in their police car in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The suspected gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, posted days earlier on Instagram his intention to kill police officers in response to the killings of Brown and Eric Garner. The suspect, who had a long criminal record and had shot his girlfriend in the stomach a few hours earlier, entered the New York City Subway and committed suicide.\n\nOn , 2015, two police officers were wounded by gunfire outside the Ferguson police headquarters. The officers, one from nearby Webster Groves, the other from the County Police, were providing security at a protest being staged outside the station. Two days later, 20-year-old Jeffrey L. Williams was arrested in connection with the shooting. Williams' attorney said, although Williams fired the shots, he was not aiming at the officers.\n\nEighteen-year-old Tyrone Harris (friend of Brown) was shot by police in Ferguson on August 9, 2015, one year after the shooting of Michael Brown. That same day, the Columbia (Missouri) Police Officers' Association (CPOA) proclaimed \"Darren Wilson Day\", calling Wilson an \"innocent, but persecuted, officer\" and insisted his ethnicity had nothing to do with their support of him. An ABC affiliate reported the post was shared nearly 60 times on the site before being removed. The CPOA then posted its support for Wilson and \"all law enforcement officers who endure similar situations.\"\n\nIn December 2014, president Barack Obama created a commission to make recommendations for broad police reform in the United States. The commission created by Obama released an interim report on , 2015, with numerous recommendations, including the recommendation that policy be created mandating \"external and independent criminal investigations in cases of police use of force resulting in death, officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death, or in-custody deaths\".\n\nOn , 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of the Ferguson, Missouri police force to examine whether officers routinely engaged in racial profiling or showed a pattern of excessive force. The investigation was separate from the Department's other investigation of the shooting of Brown. The results of the investigation were released in a , 2015, report, which concluded officers in Ferguson routinely violated the constitutional rights of the city's residents, by discriminating against African Americans and applying racial stereotypes, in a \"pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and federal statutory law\" .\n\nThe Report focused on the problem of issuing warrants for sometimes minor offenses. In many states, a chief cause for warrants is unpaid traffic tickets.\n\nOn , 2015, the Brown family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in state court against Wilson, Jackson, and the City of Ferguson, asking for damages in excess of $75,000 as well as attorney's fees. On , 2015, the lawsuit was moved from state court to federal court.\n\nOn , 2015, U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber responded to defense motions by dismissing four of the seven counts of the lawsuit and declining to dismiss two other counts. On , 2017, Webber approved a settlement between Brown's parents and the city of Ferguson. Terms of the agreement, including the settlement amount, were sealed from the public. A Ferguson city attorney revealed the city's insurance company paid $1.5 million.\n\nOn , 2015, Johnson filed a lawsuit in state court against Wilson, Jackson, and the City of Ferguson for being stopped by Wilson without probable cause, reasonable suspicion or legal justification to detain him. The lawsuit claimed that, according to the findings of the , law enforcement efforts focused on generating revenue rather than protecting the town's citizens. Johnson seeks 25,000 in damages. On , 2015, the lawsuit was moved from state court to federal court. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case; they appealed, and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them on July 25, 2017, allowing the lawsuit to go forward.\n\nOn May 9, 2016, Delrish Moss, a Miami law enforcement veteran and expert in community relations, was sworn in as the first permanent African American chief in Ferguson. He said his challenges would include diversifying the police force and dramatically improving community relations.\n\nOn April 25, 2018, the late Michael Brown's mother, Lezely McSpadden, announced to a Harvard University forum on police violence, that she will run for City Council of Ferguson. If successful, she will be part of the oversight of the Ferguson Police Department. Ferguson's residents are predominately black, but its city council and police department were both predominately white when Brown was killed.\n\nOn \"De L'Amour\" — his final studio album released before his death in 2017 — the French rock and roll singer Johnny Hallyday sings \"Dans la peau de Mike Brown\", a song against racial crimes and in memory of the 18-year-old black man (\"Ferguson Missouri, it's like the History bending, the return of the accursed times, the strange fruits on the black branches, black as the color, of all the bodies, in the evening counting the bullets, in Mike Brown's skin, in Mike Brown's skin...\").\n\nIn Prince's song about the Baltimore's protests, \"Baltimore\", he sings ... \"does anybody hear us pray for Michael Brown or Freddie Gray? Peace is more than the absence of war\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47349294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47349294", "title": "Subjective expected relative similarity (SERS)", "text": "Subjective expected relative similarity (SERS)\n\nSubjective expected relative similarity (SERS) is a normative and descriptive theory that predicts and explains cooperation levels in a family of games termed \"Similarity Sensitive Games (SSG)\", among them the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma game (PD). SERS was originally developed in order to (i) provide a new rational solution to the PD game and (ii) to predict human behavior in single-step PD games. It was further developed to account for: (i) repeated PD games, (ii) evolutionary perspectives and, as mentioned above, (iii) the SSG subgroup of 2x2 games.\nSERS predicts that individuals cooperate whenever their subjectively perceived similarity with their opponent exceeds a situational index derived from the game’s payoffs, termed the similarity threshold of the game. SERS proposes a solution to the rational paradox associated with the single step PD and provides accurate behavioral predictions.The theory was developed by Prof. Ilan Fischer at the University of Haifa.\n\nThe dilemma is described by a 2 x 2 payoff matrix that allows each player to choose between a cooperative and a competitive (or defective) move. If both players cooperate, each player obtains the reward (R) payoff. If both defect, each player obtains the punishment (P) payoff. \nHowever, if one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector obtains the temptation (T) payoff and the cooperator obtains the sucker’s (S) payoff, where \nT > R > P > S (and, \"R\" ≥ assuring that sharing the payoffs awarded for uncoordinated choices does not exceed the payoffs obtained by mutual cooperation).\n\nGiven the payoff structure of the game (see Table 1), each individual player has a dominant strategy of defection. This dominant strategy yields a better payoff regardless of the opponent’s choice. By choosing to defect, players protect themselves from exploitation and retain the option to exploit a trusting opponent. Because this is the case for both players, mutual defection is the only Nash equilibrium of the game. However, this is a deficient equilibrium (since mutual cooperation results in a better payoff for both players).\n\nThe PD game payoff matrix: \n\nPlayers that knowingly interact for several games (where the end point of the game is unknown), thus playing a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, may still be motivated to cooperate with their opponent while attempting to maximise their payoffs along the entire set of their repeated games. Such Players face a different challenge of choosing an efficient and lucrative strategy for the repeated play. This challenge may become more complex when individuals are embedded in an ecology, having to face many opponents with various and unknown strategies.\n\nSERS assumes that the similarity between the players is subjectively and individually perceived (denoted as \"p\", where \" 0 ≤ p ≤ 1\"). Two players confronting each other may have either identical or different perceptions of their similarity to their opponent. In other words, similarity perceptions need neither be symmetric nor correspond to formal logic constraints. After perceiving \"p\", each player chooses between cooperation and defection, attempting to maximize the expected outcome. This means that each player estimates his or her expected payoffs under each of two possible courses of action. The expected value of cooperation is given by\n\"R × p + S × (1-p)\" and the expected payoff of defection is given by \"P x p + T x (1 - p)\". Hence, cooperation provides a higher expected payoff whenever \n\"R x p + S x (1 - p) > P x p + T x (1 - p)\" which may also be expressed further as:\n\nTo illustrate, consider a PD payoff matrix with T = 5, R = 3, P = 1, S = 0. The similarity threshold calculated for the game is given by:\n\" p*= ≈ 0.71\". Thus a player perceiving the similarity with the opponent, \"p\", exceeding \"0.71\" should cooperate in order to maximise his expected payoffs.\n\nSeveral experiments were conducted to test whether SERS provides not only a normative theory but also a descriptive theory of human behaviour.\nFor example, an experiment involving 215 university undergraduates revealed an average of 30% cooperation rate for a payoff matrix with \"p* = 0.8\" and an average of 46% cooperation rate for a payoff matrix \"p* = 0.63\". \nParticipants cooperated 47% under high level of induced similarity and only 29% under low level of induced similarity.\nThe cooperation rate for manipulating the perception of similarity of the opponent, revealed an increase from 67% to 80% of cooperation for the lower similarity threshold and from 40% to 70% cooperation for the higher similarity threshold. \nOther experiments with various similarity induction methods and payoff matrices further confirmed SERS's status as a descriptive theory of human behaviour. \n\nExperiments on the impact of SERS on repeated games are presently being conducted and analysed at the University of Haifa and the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn.\n\nThe PD game is not the only similarity sensitive game. Games for which the choice of the action with the higher expected value depends on the value of \"p\" are defined as Similarity Sensitive Games (SSGs), whereas others are nonsimilarity sensitive. Focusing only on the 24 completely rank-ordered and symmetric games, we can mark 12 SSGs. After eliminating games that reflect permutations of other games generated either by switching rows, columns, or both rows and columns, we are left with six basic (completely rank-ordered and symmetric) SSGs.\nThese are games for which SERS provides a rational and payoff-maximizing strategy that recommends which alternative to choose for any given perception of similarity with the opponent\n\nDeveloping the SERS theory into an evolutionary strategy yields the \"Mimicry and Relative Similarity (MaRS)\" algorithm.\nFusing enacted and expected mimicry generates a powerful and cooperative mechanism that enhances fitness and reduces the risks associated with trust and cooperation. When conflicts take the form of repeated PD games, individuals get the opportunity to learn and monitor the extent of similarity with their opponents. They can then react by choosing whether to enact, expect, or exclude mimicry. This rather simple behavior has the capacity to protect individuals from exploitation and drive the evolution of cooperation within entire populations. MaRS paves the way for the induction of cooperation and supports the survival of other cooperative strategies. The existence of MaRS in heterogeneous populations helps those cooperative strategies that do not have the capacity of MaRS to combat hostile and random opponents. Despite the fact that MaRS cannot prevail in a duel with an unconditional defector, interacting within heterogeneous populations allows MaRS to fight unpredictable and hostile strategies and cooperate with cooperative ones, including itself. The operation of MaRS promotes cooperation, minimizes the extent of exploitation, and accounts for high fitness levels.\nTesting the model in computer simulations of behavioral niches, populated with agents that enact various strategies and learning algorithms, shows how mimicry and relative similarity outperforms all the opponent strategies it was tested against, pushes noncooperative opponents toward extinction, and promotes the development of cooperative populations.\n\n"}

{"id": "2260940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260940", "title": "TV parental guidelines (US)", "text": "TV parental guidelines (US)\n\nThe TV parental guidelines are a television content rating system in the United States that was first proposed on December 19, 1996, by the United States Congress, the television industry and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and went into effect by January 1, 1997, on most major broadcast and cable networks in response to public concerns about increasingly explicit sexual content, graphic violence and strong profanity in television programs. It was established as a voluntary-participation system, with ratings to be determined by the individually participating broadcast and cable networks.\n\nThe ratings are generally applied to most television series, television films and edited broadcast or basic cable versions of theatrically released films; premium channels also assign ratings from the TV parental guidelines on broadcasts of some films that have been released theatrically or on home video, either if the Motion Picture Association of America did not assign a rating for the film or if the channel airs the unrated version of the film.\n\nThe ratings were designed to be used with the V-chip, which was mandated to be built into all television sets manufactured since 2000, but the guidelines themselves have no legal force, and are not used on sports or news programs or during commercial advertisements. Many online television services, such as Hulu, Amazon Video and Netflix also use the guidelines system, along with digital video vendors such as the iTunes Store and Google Play.\n\nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the United States Congress called upon the entertainment industry to establish, within one year, a voluntary television rating system to provide parents with advance information on material in television programming that might be unsuitable for their children. This rating system would work in conjunction with the V-chip, a device embedded in television sets that enables parents to block programming they determine to be inappropriate.\n\nOn February 29, 1996, all segments of the entertainment industry, led by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), joined together and voluntarily pledged to create such a system. They agreed that the guidelines would be applied by broadcast and cable networks in order to handle the large amount of programming that must be reviewed – some 2,000 hours a day. The guidelines would be applied episodically to all programming based on their content, except for news, sports and advertising.\n\nOn December 19, 1996, the industry announced the creation of the TV Parental Guidelines, a voluntary system of guidelines providing parents with information to help them make more informed choices about the television programs their children watch. The guidelines were modeled after the movie ratings system created by the Motion Picture Association of America in 1968. The television industry agreed to insert a ratings icon on-screen at the beginning of all rated programs, and to encode the guidelines for use with the V-chip. The industry also created a Monitoring Board, composed of TV industry experts, to ensure accuracy, uniformity and consistency of the guidelines and to consider any public questions about the guideline applied to a particular program. The TV Parental Guidelines went into use on January 1, 1997.\n\nIn response to calls to provide additional content information in the ratings system, on August 1, 1997, the television industry, in conjunction with representatives of children's and medical advocacy groups, announced revisions to the rating system. Under this revised system, television programming would continue to fall into one of the six ratings categories (TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14 or TV-MA), but content descriptors would be added to the ratings where appropriate, based on the type(s) of objectionable content included in the individual program or episode: D (suggestive dialogue), L (coarse language), S (sexual content), V (violence) and FV (fantasy violence – a descriptor exclusively for use in the TV-Y7 category).\n\nFurther, the proposal stated that the icons and associated content symbols would appear for 15 seconds at the beginning of all rated programming, and that the size of the icons would be increased. The revised guidelines were supported by leading family and child advocacy groups, as well as television broadcasters, cable systems and networks, and television production companies. Finally, the revised proposal called for five representatives of the advocacy community to be added to the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board. On March 12, 1998, the Federal Communications Commission found that the Industry Video Programming Rating System was acceptable, and adopted technical requirements for the V-chip.\n\n\"This program is designed to be appropriate for all children.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-Y are designed to be appropriate for children of all ages. The thematic elements portrayed in programs with this rating are specifically designed for a very young audience, including children from ages 2–6.\n\n\"This program is designed for children age 7 and above.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-Y7 are designed for children age 7 and older. The FCC states that it \"may be more appropriate for children who have acquired the developmental skills needed to distinguish between make-believe and reality.\"\nPrograms given the \"FV\" content descriptor exhibit more 'fantasy violence', and are generally more intense or combative than other programs rated TV-Y7.\n\n\"Programs suitable for all ages.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-G are generally suited for all audiences, though they may not necessarily contain content of interest to children. The FCC states that \"this rating does not signify a program designed specifically for children 10 years of age and older, (and) most parents may let younger children watch this program unattended.\" The thematic elements portrayed in programs with this rating contain little or no violence, mild language, and no sexual dialogue or situations.\n\n\"This program contains material that parents may find unsuitable for younger children.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-PG contain material that parents or guardians may find inappropriate for younger children. Programs assigned a TV-PG rating may include some inappropriate language, very little sexual content or suggestive dialogue and/or violence.\n\n\"This program contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-14 may contain some material that parents or adult guardians may find unsuitable for children under the age of 14. The FCC warns that \"Parents are cautioned to exercise some care in monitoring this program and are cautioned against letting children under the age of 14 watch unattended.\" Programs with this rating contain crude humor, drug/alcohol use, moderate language, strong violence (may include some amounts of blood and gore), intense sexual content and moderate suggestive themes or dialogue.\n\n\"This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults, and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17.\"<br> Some content may be unsuitable for children. This rating was originally TV-M prior to the announced revisions to the rating system in August 1997, but was changed due to a trademark dispute and in order to remove confusion with the Entertainment Software Rating Board's (ESRB) \"M for Mature\" rating for video games. This rating is very seldom used by broadcast networks or local television stations due to FCC restrictions on program content, although it is commonly applied to television programs featured on certain cable channels (basic and premium networks) and streaming networks for both mainstream and softcore programs. Broadcast programming which has carried a TV-MA warning includes the pilot of the short-lived CBS police series \"Brooklyn South\" and documentaries such as Ken Burns' \"The Vietnam War\" on PBS, along with a few 10 p.m. ET drama series episodes with sensitive content. Programs with this rating commonly include dark humor, frequent use of profanity, intense violence (may include blood and gore) or strong sexual themes.\n\nSome thematic elements, according to the FCC, \"may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following\" sub-ratings, designated with an alphabetic letter:\n\nUp to four content descriptors can be applied alongside an assigned rating, depending on the kind of suggestive content featured in a program. The FV descriptor is an exception due to its sole use for the TV-Y7 rating, which can have no descriptor other than FV. As the rating increases pertaining to the age, the content matters generally get more intensive. These descriptors allow for 44 possible combinations for all the ratings total. The 'suggestive dialogue' descriptor is used for TV-PG and TV-14 rated programs only. The violence descriptor was used for TV-Y7 programs until the creation of the 'FV' descriptor in 1997.\n\nFor the first 15 seconds of every rated program lasting a half-hour or less, a large rating icon appears in the upper-left hand corner of the screen; previously this had a compulsory design but currently goes with a network's branding scheme, and may not necessarily utilize the skeleton of the icon, merely going with text. The icon was much smaller until June 2005 and only appeared on-screen for 7.5 seconds. For every rated program running an hour or longer, a rating appears in the upper-left hand corner of the television screen at the beginning of each half-hour. Starting in June 2005, many networks now display the ratings after every commercial break, in addition to the beginning of the program. Ratings icons formerly appeared in the safe area, even with a HD-designed presentation, but have moved into the top-left corner of the 16:9 picture as time has gone on.\n\nSome programs may voluntarily display a disclaimer regarding the show's objectionable content with the TV rating prior to the program starting, along with audibly repeating the same, with the reason for the rating (e.g. suggestive dialogue, drug and alcohol abuse, language, sexual situations, violence, nudity) and strongly cautioning parents to decide whether the program is suitable for their children. Several channels (including USA Network and AMC) insert special caution boards for strong language mid-show at the end of commercial breaks, almost always occurring before a series uses the word \"fuck\" in dialogue uncensored.\n\nViewer discretion advisories are mostly used for programs rated TV-MA where content may be unusual for the tone the series or event may usually have or for strong content. They are also commonly used for television broadcasts of theatrical films, albeit depending on the content and rating, though said content might also be edited out.\n\n\n"}

The album features guest appearances from Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, Kanye West and Future, among others.\n\nPreceded the album release, the album was supported by lead single: \"100\" featuring Drake.\n\nIn 2015, in an interview with Power 106, The Game announced that the album was about 90% complete and once Dr. Dre gets back from his vacation, me and Dre will be finishing recording the album. The Game also said that his children were his motivation to finish the album, speaking about being confident on his growth as a rapper: \"I listened to my first album and everybody thinks it's so amazing, but I think I'm better than that. I listened to it and heard all of the flaws of the young me, and I'm like, 'Man I would have never done this song like that today.'\" According to The Game, Dr. Dre was excited about the album that he called \"The Documentary 2\" would be the best rap album in five years. On July 21, 2015, The Game revealed that Diddy said \"The Documentary 2\" is \"his best album yet\".\n\nOn April 12, 2015, The Game released a video, titled \"The Making of The Documentary 2\", and it shows him in the studio with Meek Mill, working on a song, called \"Soundtrack\". The video also features cameo appearances from Cool & Dre and Travis Scott. During the 2015's BET Awards on North Carolina's Power 98, The Game said that he has been working with these record producers such as Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, Pharrell Williams, DJ Premier, The Alchemist, Jahlil Beats, Just Blaze, Scott Storch, and Mike Will Made It.

{"id": "20586385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20586385", "title": "Tiatr", "text": "Tiatr\n\nTiatr is a type of musical theatre popular in the state of Goa on the west coast of India as well as in Mumbai and with expatriate communities in the Middle East, London and other cities where Konkani speakers have a considerable presence. The dramas are performed mainly in the Roman Konkani dialects and include music, dancing and singing. Tiatr performers are called \"tiatrists\".\n\nThe word \"tiatr\" comes from the Portuguese word for theatre, \"teatro\". Earlier variations were Theatro, Thiatro and Tiatro.\n\nTiatr today revolves around social, religious and political themes. It is considered to be a mirror of Goan culture. The drama consists of 6 or 7 acts called \"pordhe\" . The acts are interspersed by songs which need not be directly linked to the content or the issues of the main drama. There are 2 or 3 songs between each of the acts.\n\nTiatrist have always demonstrated a very high degree of social awareness. Most of the themes of tiatr are concerned with social problems confronting the people.\n\nThe Tiatr is an instance where mass support plays a crucial role. It is one of those arts which despite centuries of Portuguese suppression and post-liberation neglect from the state governments, has not just survived but also thrived and reinvented itself in many ways.\n\nThe tiatr as a dramatic form has been traditionally dominated and patronised by Christian community, but over the years several young Hindu artists have been performing in the tiatr, which are also seen by people from the Hindu community. The lone Muslim so far has been mimicry artist Sheikh Amir.\n\nSongs integral to the plays are known as 'Kants'. Other songs, called \"kantaram\" are generally either comedic or based on topical, political and controversial issues that are interspersed through the performance. These musical interludes are independent of the main theme of the play. The songs are often satirical and unsparing of the politics and politicians of Goa. The music is provided by a live band including keyboard, trumpet, saxophone, bass guitar and drums.\n\nBesides the regular commercial shows, tiatrs are held as part of the celebrations of nearly every church and chapel feast in the State.\n\nThe Goa Kala Academy organises a state level Tiatr competition every year while the Tiatr Academy organises a Popular Tiatr competition for dramas which have exceeded 25 performances .\n\nTiatr songs and performances are recorded and sold on CD and DVD in Goan and Middle Eastern markets.\n\nAlthough efforts have been made to preserve the art form as a tradition of Goa, there have been calls for greater recognition of Mumbai based tiatrists.\n\nThere is another version of the Tiatr called the \"Khell Tiatr\", whose performance is restricted to the festivals of Carnival, Intruz and Easter. It differs from the Konkani Tiatr in another respect, that is that its songs are integrated with the main drama and do not deviate in content from it.\n\nPrior to the emergence of tiatr, entertainment in Konkani was mainly through \"zagors\" and \"khells\". Both of them had their distinct style. While the \"zagor\" was more lyrical, the \"khell\" had dialogues and while the former was more popular in Bardez, the latter was firmly entrenched in Salcete.\n\nCostancio Lucasinho Caridade Ribeiro, more popularly known as Lucasinho Ribeiro, who was from Assagao was seeking employment in Bombay. Passionate about the performing arts, he was highly impressed with the stylised Italian operas performed there. He took up a job for an Italian opera troupe which was touring Indian cities at the time, staging an opera called 'Italian Boy'. When the troupe left India, Lucazinho Ribeiro bought the costumes used in the play with the intention of staging a Konkani play on the style of the Italian Opera. His collaborators in the effort were Caetaninho Fernandes of Taleigao and João Agostinho Fernandes of Borda, Margao.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, 17 April 1892 the first tiatr performance ever, \"Italian Bhurgo\", adapted from the Italian play, was staged at the New Alfred Theatre, Bombay. This day is celebrated as \"Tiatr Dis\" (Tiatr Day). Hence, the Goan art form of tiatr was the product of the meeting of Goan culture and the opera of Italy, which, incidentally is the birthplace of the opera, and the tiatr was born in Bombay. Since there were many different scenes in this tiatr and as it required different stage sets, they thought of dropping the curtain and introducing songs and dances in front of the curtain. This was needed to entertain the audience while the Stage Setting was being done behind the curtain. These songs and dances did not have any relevance to the theme of the play.\n\nThe first original tiatr script was written and directed by João Agostinho Fernandes, entitled \"Belle de Cavel\" or \"Sundori Cavelchi\" in 1895 in Bombay and for all his consistent devotion and encouragement over fifty years, he was conferred the title \"Pai Tiatrist\" (Father Tiatrist).\n\nMrs. Regina Fernandes, wife of the playwright João Agostinho Fernandes, became the first female tiatr actor in \"Bhattkara\" on 22 November 1904. \"Divorce\", a tiatr written and directed by Airistides Dias was the first konkani tiatr to complete 100 performances on 5 October 1980.\n\nHowever, as time passed the standard of Zagor as well as Khell deteriorated in quality with the introduction of elements of vulgarity. Educated people stopped patronizing the Zagor as well as the Khell. While tiatr was making its presence felt, its original form – the zagors and the khells - were dying a slow death and the zagor finally stopped being performed while the khells continued.\n\nBut in 1956 the khell underwent a dramatic change. Given its state at that time, Antonio Moraes thought it fit to take the khell from the street performance to a stage performance. Helped by his friend and colleague Antonio Marian, the khell was performed on a stage for the first time with a backdrop and other paraphernalia associated with theatre. The first Khell Tiatr 'Sandlolo Put' written and directed by Antonio Moraes was staged on the third day of Carnival of March 1956. However, this form became very popular only in the 1970s when Rosario Rodrigues coined the term khell tiatr and came up with extremely successful shows. Thus, the ground-based plays known as Khells evolved onto the stage and further into 'Non-stop dramas' but have now generally dropped this label and are generally referred to as Tiatrs.\n\nTiatr contributed to keeping the Konkani language alive during Portuguese colonial rule, when Konkani was suppressed. Tiatrists played a major role in the struggle to make Konkani the officials language of Goa.\n\nIn 2007, the Government of Goa started the Tiatr Academy of Goa [ TAG ] to facilitate the development of \"Tiatr\". In 2008 legislation was approved granting 15 lakh rupees to the newly formed Tiatr Academy of Goa. 1\n\n\n"}

Vocal coaches may give private music lessons or group workshops or masterclasses to singers. They may also coach singers who are rehearsing on stage, or who are singing during a recording session. Vocal coaches are used in both Classical music and in popular music styles such as rock and gospel. While some vocal coaches provide a range of instruction on singing techniques, others specialize in areas such as breathing techniques or diction and pronunciation.\n\nA vocal coach is sometimes responsible for writing and producing vocal arrangements for four-part harmony for backup vocalists or helping to develop counter melodies for a secondary vocalist. Some vocal coaches may also advise singers or bands on lyric-writing for a music production. Some critics allege that in some cases where popular music recordings credit a singer for work as a vocal coach during a recording, this may be a subtle way of acknowledging a ghostwriting role, in which the coach writes lyrics for a singer-songwriter or rapper.\n\nIn the 2000s, the increasing use of recording software which contains vocal processing algorithms and digital pitch correction devices is replacing some of the roles of the vocal coach. In the 1970s, if a producer wanted to record a single with a popular sports star with few vocal skills, the celebrity would need weeks of vocal coaching to learn their song and improve their tone and diction. In the 2000s, the vocals are often processed through pitch correction software instead, and rhythm can be corrected with Pro Tools. This enables 2000s-era producers and audio engineers to in order to make an untrained performer's singing sound closer to that of a trained vocalist.\n\nThe training and education of vocal coaches vary widely. Many vocal coaches are former or current professional singers. Some vocal coaches have extensive formal training, such as a Bachelor of Music, a Master of Music, a Conservatory diploma, or degrees in related areas such as foreign languages or diplomas in human kinetics, posture techniques, or breathing methods. On the other hand, some vocal coaches may have little formal training, and so they rely on their extensive experience as a performer. For example, a native German language speaker who moves to the US may begin providing German diction coaching to amateur vocal students, and over several decades, this vocal coach may develop a broad range of on-the-job experience in coaching German-language singing styles such as lieder and Wagnerian opera.\n\nVocal coaches may also come to their profession through other routes, such as related musical professions or from other fields. Some vocal coaches, for example, are rehearsal pianists with decades of experience accompanying singers, or former or current choral, music theater, or symphony conductors. More rarely, vocal coaches may come to the profession from a non-musical route. For example, a specialist in Alexander Technique, yoga, or medical aspects of the throat and vocal cords may begin to specialize in coaching and training singers.\n\nThe vocal coaching field is competitive, especially at the highest professional levels. Salaries vary greatly, as do the conditions of work. While a small number of top vocal coaches can command very high hourly or daily rates, most vocal coaches, like most other music and arts professionals, tend to have salaries which are below the average for other professions which require a similar amount of education and experience, such as economists or bank managers. The work conditions vary widely, from part-time or occasional freelance work for individual singers, opera companies, or record companies, to full-time contracts or multi-year jobs for universities (coaching vocal performance students and students in opera courses) or music theater companies.\n\nWhile vocal coaches use many different techniques to teach singing, they will usually instruct students in one or more of the following methods:\n\n\nWithin the community of voice teachers, there has been some debate about the terms \"vocal coach\" and \"voice teacher\".\n\nWhile many believe the terms are synonymous, some professionals in the music community hold that the terms have slightly different meanings.\n\nThe terms \"voice teacher\" and \"singing teacher\" are most often used to refer to a teacher that has been educated and instructs vocal pedagogy, while a vocal coach may not possess the same education level.\n\nIn universities, for example, it would be rare to have a professor of voice refer to themselves as a vocal coach, even though they may teach private lessons.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"voice teacher\" or \"singing teacher\" normally refers to an instructor whose main role is developing the singing voice. The term \"vocal coach\", on the other hand, may be appropriated by someone who works on stage performance, vocal style or a host of other subjects that are related to voice, but not necessarily teach singing.\n\n"}

He announced on Radio Moscow all major international events in the 1940s–60s including the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the surrender of Germany on 9 May 1945, the death of Joseph Stalin on 5 March 1953, and the first manned spaceflight on 12 April 1961.\n\nLevitan was born to a Jewish family in Vladimir to a tailor and a housewife. In the early 1930s he traveled to Moscow hoping to become an actor, but was rejected because of his provincial manners. However, he secured a position on a Moscow radio station owing to his characteristic deep voice. In January 1934, after hearing his broadcast, Joseph Stalin called up the radio station and requested that from then on Levitan read his announcements. Consequently, Levitan became not only the personal announcer for Stalin, but the leading Soviet radio personality.\n\nAfter the German invasion in 1941 Levitan was evacuated to Sverdlovsk, because Moscow radio stations were taken down to avoid German bombardment. At the time, he lived in a secret location due to his importance as the nation's foremost radio personality. In March 1943, he was secretly transported to Kuybyshev, where the Soviet radio committee met. During all those years away from Moscow, his reports began with his trademark \"Attention, Moscow is speaking!\" () Levitan made some 2000 radio announcements during the war; he recorded recreations of many of them in the 1950s, when he reproduced them in studio for archiving purposes.\n\nAfter the war, Levitan reported on events on Red Square and state proclamations. Between 1978 and 1983, he announced the annual \"Minute of Silence\" to commemorate the Victory Day in Russia. In 1980, he was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR. He died from a heart attack in 1983, and was buried in the famed Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\n"}
