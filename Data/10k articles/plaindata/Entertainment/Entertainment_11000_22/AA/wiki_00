Leonetti, written by Gary Dauberman and produced by Peter Safran and James Wan. It is a prequel to 2013's \"The Conjuring\" and the second installment in The Conjuring Universe. The film was inspired by a story of a doll named Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren. The film stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, and Alfre Woodard.\n\n\"Annabelle\" premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on September 29, 2014, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 3, 2014. The film received generally negative reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing over $257million against its $6.5million production budget. A prequel, titled \"\", was released on August 11, 2017. A currently untitled sequel will be released on July 3, 2019.\n\nIn 1967 in Santa Monica, CA, John Form, a doctor, presents his expectant wife Mia with a rare vintage porcelain doll as a gift for their first child to be placed in a collection of dolls in their daughter's nursery.\n\nThat night, the couple is disturbed by the sounds of their next door neighbors, the Higgins, being murdered during a home invasion. While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins' killers. The police arrive and shoot one killer, a man, dead while the female killer commits suicide by slitting her own throat inside the nursery while holding the porcelain doll. News reports identify the assailants as the Higgins' estranged daughter, Annabelle, and her unidentified boyfriend, both members of a cult.\n\nIn the days following the attack, a series of paranormal activities occur around the Form's residence. Afterwards, Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She and John name their child Leah. The family rents an apartment in Pasadena and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelle's previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plagues Mia and her daughter. The next night, Mia is haunted by a malevolent presence in her apartment and believes it to be Annabelle's ghost. During a storm, Mia encounters an enigmatic figure in the building's basement who begins pursuing her before she escapes.\n\nMia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultist and learns that the cult intends to summon supernatural beings. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced devil worship, which summoned a demon who followed the family after they moved to their apartment in order to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from the Warrens for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.\n\nThe priest is hospitalized on the next day and, when John checks on him, Father Perez warns the latter that after sensing its powerful presence, the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul. That night, while Evelyn is visiting Mia, the demon uses Father Perez's physical form to sneak into the apartment and abduct Leah in exchange for her mother's soul. To spare her daughter, Mia attempts to jump out of the window with the doll but John arrives in time along with Evelyn to stop her. Evelyn decides to take her own life in Mia's place instead as atonement for causing a car accident that resulted in the death of her daughter Ruby years ago. As the Forms are reunited, the demon and the doll disappear, while Leah is safely inside her crib.\n\nSix months later, the doll is bought from an antique shop by a mother as a gift for her daughter Debbie, one of the nursing students from the prelude of the first film.\n\nThe film is a spin-off of the 2013 horror film \"The Conjuring\", focusing on the origins of the Annabelle doll found in that film. The film was designed to be stand alone yet at the same time catering to fans of \"The Conjuring\" who would already be familiar with the latter film. According to Backstage.com, the film was one of the first in a new strategy by distributors Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema \"that capitalizes on the built-in fan bases for successful films, allowing for smaller budgets and production time with a bigger payout on the back end.\"\n\nCasting was announced in January 2014, with Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton playing the lead roles. with actors Eric Ladin, Brian Howe and Alfre Woodard also being announced that month.\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 27, 2014, at The Book Shop in Covina, California. On February 25, 2014, filming continued at an apartment in South Normandie Avenue in Los Angeles County, where the 55-member crew shot for several days. Director Leonetti and producer Safran told reporters that the \"Annabelle\" set was \"haunted\" and that they thought \"supernatural phenomena\" had occurred there. The film was shot in sequence so that the actors were always aware of their emotional arcs.\n\nOn April 24, 2014, Joseph Bishara was hired to compose the music for the film. WaterTower Music released the soundtrack album on September 30, 2014.\n\n\"Annabelle\" grossed $84.3million in North America and $172.8 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $257million, against a production budget of $6.5million. In the U.S. and Canada, \"Annabelle\" is the fourteenth highest-grossing horror/supernatural film. \n\nEarly tracking projected \"Annabelle\" would gross around $25–27million in its opening weekend. However, estimates declined shortly after to a range between $20–22million. \"Annabelle\" was released on October 3, 2014, in 3,185 theatres in North America. It topped the box office in its opening day earning $15.4million (including its $2.1million midnight previews). In its traditional three-day opening the film debuted at #2 at the box office with $37.1million, at an average of $11,659 per theater from 3,185 theaters after a neck-and-neck competition against \"Gone Girl\" which earned $37.5million. The two releases were separated by $378,854. Its opening weekend gross is the eleventh highest in October and the biggest for a horror genre film of 2014, surpassing \"\"s $28.9million opening. Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., said about the opening box office performance, \"we had a wonderful campaign for the film and a good date\"; she added \"being a spinoff of \"The Conjuring\" set it up really well and we just hit the right note.\" It is the second time that an October weekend has produced two $30million or more debuts; the first was in 2008: \"High School Musical 3\" ($42million) and \"Saw V\" ($31million). According to Rentrak, the opening weekend crowd was evenly split between female with 51% and under 25 years with 54%. The film closed down its theatrical run on December 18, 2014 and earned a total of $84,273,813 becoming the thirty-fifth highest-grossing movie of 2014 in the US.\n\nThe film was released in Russia on September 26, 2014, a week prior to its wide release and earned $2.1million on its opening weekend, debuting at No. 3 at the Russian box office. Overseas in its opening weekend the film earned $23.6million from nearly 3,300 screen and 39 foreign markets for a first-weekend worldwide total of $60.8million.\n\nHigh openings of \"Annabelle\" internationally were reported in France ($3.4million), Brazil ($3million), the UK ($3.1million), Argentina ($1.2million), Spain ($1.45million) and Germany ($1.14million). In India \"Annabelle\" debuted at #2 behind Bollywood blockbuster \"Bang Bang!\" and collected $1.3million. It set an all-time opening record for a horror film in Peru with $1.34million which is also Warner Bros. second biggest opening weekend of all time there overall. In Mexico, the film earned $10.9million (including previews) on its opening weekend and broke the record for the biggest debut ever for a horror movie and the best 2D opening. Its opening weekend gross is also the third-biggest opening overall of 2014 behind \"Maleficent\" and \"\" there. In total the film took 59% of the total market share.\n\nAs of October 13, 2014, \"Annabelle\" has become the highest-grossing horror film in the Philippines, earning over ₱121.33million. The film surpassed \"\"s record (₱113million), doing so after 12 days of release. The film has also become the highest-grossing horror movie in Lebanon after staying atop the box office for two weekends.\n\n\"Annabelle\" received generally negative reviews from critics, the majority of which felt the film inferior to its predecessor. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 29% based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Annabelle\" borrows unabashedly from better horror films, content to leave viewers with a string of cheap jolts that fail to build on the far more effective \"The Conjuring\".\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nFrank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" criticized the film for its cheap production and screenplay, but was positive towards the performances of the cast and saying, \"the film is ultimately so scary and formulaic that you won't forget it.\"\n\nScott Foundas of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, calling the film \"inspired\" but periodically cheap. He added \"a cut-rate spinoff from James Wan's superlative haunted-house hit \"The Conjuring\" that (partly) makes up in crude shock effects, but lacks in atmosphere. Designed mainly as a starring vehicle for the eponymous, creepy-as-hell doll (who easily outclasses her human co-stars), this WB/New Line quickie is the thirst of die-hard genre fans and is by the far the best horror movie of the year\".\n\nPete Hammond of \"Deadline\" gave the film a positive review and said that the scary doll show has left him pining for Chucky in \"Child's Play\". He further added, \"\"Annabelle\" may still draw horror fans in this Halloween month, and they will be quaking over the scares in this film.\"\n\nIn October 2014, Fellman told \"The Washington Post\" that the studio was considering a film series based on the film, with a sequel already in the works. In October 2015, it was reported that Gary Dauberman would be returning to write the script. On March 22, 2016, Warner Bros. slated the film for release on May 19, 2017, with \"Lights Out\" director David F. Sandberg directing the film.\n\nIn June 2016, Miranda Otto and Stephanie Sigman were cast to star in the prequel. The story centers on a dollmaker and his wife (Otto) whose daughter tragically dies. Twelve years later they decide to open their home to a nun (Sigman) and several girls from a shuttered orphanage. When the dollmaker’s possessed creation Annabelle sets her sights on the children, it turns their shelter into a storm of horror.\n\nIn April 2018, Warner Bros. announced July 3, 2019, as the release date for an as-yet untitled new film in \"The Conjuring\" franchise. Later that month it was announced that the film will be a third \"Annabelle\" film, with Gary Dauberman signed on to write and direct, in his directorial debut. James Wan and Peter Safran will co-produce the project.\n\n"}

The first incarnation of the game was published in 2008 and the most recent version was released in January 2016; marking last freeware version to be published. A commercial version, including drastic gameplay improvements, new features and reworked unit and terrain graphics is being actively developed with scheduled completion during the fall of 2018. \n\nPlayers control individual tanks and vehicles from a top-down perspective, on a zoomable map. Infantry are mostly in squad/section sized units. The whole force under a player's control ranges from platoon level upwards, depending on battle options.\n\nThe games are single player against the AI.\n\nArmored Brigade simulates modern combined-arms combat from platoon to regiment/brigade level from a top-down perspective. Freeware version only represented a hypothetical World War III scenario in 1987, while commercial edition covers all years from 1965 to 1991. Sides available are the US, USSR, West and East Germany, UK, Finland and Poland. There are plans to add more nations (freeware version had 11 nations, but limited to a single year) and open up the timescale, including World War II.\n\nPlayers can control individual vehicles, platoons and companies. Infantry is mostly in squad/section sized units. The game includes a wide variety of accurately researched and historical squads, weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and artillery.\n\nUnit morale, experience level and fatigue, command delay, a wide set of weapon and vehicle parameters are all taken into account to produce realistic combat simulation.\n\nA wide range of orders are available supplemented by a set of Standard Operating Procedures, like different rates of fire, engagement ranges and dismount policy. Furthermore, units can be organized into nine formations, with customizable spacing between individual vehicles.\n\nThe current version of the game includes large real world terrain maps, representing areas likely to be involved in a Cold War engagement, including the Fulda Gap and North German Plain.\n\nUp to 0.801 beta version, maps could be randomly generated — either by the built-in map generator with a number of different settings or by an external tool like Terragen (from version 0.704a). Afterwards, real terrain maps were introduced, generated from satellite data. Their size can vary from 2x2 to 15x15 kilometres, on an area covering initially about 7,300 square kilometres, and soon afterwards increased to 30,000 square kilometres. Different terrain sets for summer, autumn and winter seasons are available. Also included are desert, tropical and \"nuclear wasteland\" sets. Real world elevation data can also be read by the game to generate accurate maps of anywhere in the world.\n\nThe game features a dynamic time of day and variable visibility, with the weather, including night and storm, influencing the battle and ground conditions. Other interesting features are 3D battlefield overview and civilian units.\n\nThe games are currently single player against the AI. The AI is able to analyse terrain both in offensive and defensive operations, and conduct manoeuvres according to one of predetermined routines - Armored, Mechanized or Infantry with emphasis placed on the corresponding unit type. new features make Armored Brigade definitely the most realistic Cold War themed tactical level wargame to date.\n\nThe game has been widely praised by critics, even in its still early incarnation. It has been favourably compared to Steel Panthers, Combat Mission Series and the Close Combat series. CVG said \"hides convincing Cold War combat drama under unassuming 2D top-down visuals.\" By 2013, game was reviewed and positively rated among others by Eurogamer.dk and Ekstra Bladet, the biggest newspaper in Denmark. \n\nFrom 0.697c onward, all data base entries are externalized in XML format and thus are open for modding. Small mods are already available at official forum and more can be expected as game reaches version 1.0. Commercial version will include full editor.\n"}

The family did most of the entertainment. Jim, Walter and Alf did tumbling acts while Walter and Alf were clowns. Jim leaped from the springboard over ten ponies and they showed ponies, donkeys and dogs. It was one of the first shows to allow racially mixed audiences and it became a staple in South Africa. It was one of the first to defy the apartheid government's ban on Sunday entertainment. Wilkie's daughter Susie began performing when she was three and her brother, Robert, was the youngest person to become a circus director and manager.\n\nDuring the First World War, the circus didn't perform much. From 1916 and after, the Boswells became known as the Boswell Brothers Circus and Menagerie, and they would eventually be called just the Bowsell's Circus.\n\nIn 1919, the Boswells had their first show since the war in Durban. The Boswells started to put effort into enlarging their circus. The first Asian elephant was bought in 1921 from Frank Willison, an American who had a circus in Madagascar. Jim also started training his first lion group. In 1924 Boswell’s Circus undertook a tour that took them through Southern and Northern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), Mozambique, and up into the Belgian Congo for the first time. In 1932, during the worldwide recession, the Boswells held special charity performances in Durban. They gave a show in aid of the unemployed with the patronage of the Governor-General and the Countess of Clarendon. They also allowed unemployed people to sleep in the tent and they put on a performance for 1000 poor children and the elderly.\n\nIn 1941 there was great interest in the 21-year-old Helen Ayres of Pretoria. She handled the lions with great courage. She was the wife of Stanley, having married him in 1939. Three of the four original Boswell brothers retired in 1942.\n\nIn 1953, the Boswell family entered into an agreement with the African Consolidated Theatres Organization. In November 1963, Jim and Syd Boswell sold the rest of their shares to the African Theatres. The terms of the settlement included that it would now be known as the Boswell-Wilkie Circus.\n\nThe Boswell Wilkie Circus had its final show in October 2001. After difficult economic times in South Africa, the circus announced that the touring side would stop. Their final performance was on 13 October in Alberton, Gauteng. The circus then moved to Randvaal. The circus continued to perform just for corporate functions and Christmas parties.\n\nThe below is a post from their website as a last good bye:\nIt is with great sadness that the Wilkie family have to announce that after many years of the Big top standing on the Boswell Wilkie Circus farm in Randvaal, the beloved Big Top, that holds so many precious memories for those young and old, will be taken down on 10 December 2015.\n\nAfter years under the hot South African sun, the circus Big Top has seen its last days in the spotlight and will unfortunately be retiring. The family have made the difficult decision not to replace the Big Top, which means that they will no longer have circus participation parties and school outings. We will, however, continue to host parties in the beautiful gardens of Café du Cirque, as well as in our newly renovated rustic stables venue, where the kiddies can enjoy the jungle gym, pony rides or perhaps even a clown. We do have a few tricks up our sleeves and we are currently working on a new project for children’s parties. Updates will be posted on the Café du Cirque Facebook page.\n\nThe Wilkie’s are still, however, keeping the circus alive, and have a vast variety of performers available for private and corporate events.\n\nWe encourage you all to come and say your nostalgic goodbyes and take your last photographs with our beautiful Italian Big Top. We are open Tuesdays – Fridays from 10h00 to 17h00, and Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays from 08h00 to 17h00.\n"}

{"id": "33677925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33677925", "title": "Dennis Taylor", "text": "Dennis Taylor\n\nDennis Taylor (born Denis Taylor, 19 January 1949 in Coalisland, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland) is a retired professional snooker player and current BBC snooker commentator. \n\nWinner of two ranking events, he is best known for winning the 1985 World Championship, beating World number one Steve Davis on the final black in one of the sport's most memorable finals. He also won the Grand Prix in 1984 and the Masters in 1987. Taylor is also well known for his sense of humour and his trademark oversized spectacles. He made regular appearances on the snooker game show \"Big Break\".\n\nTaylor turned professional in 1972 and made his world championship debut in 1973, narrowly losing to Cliff Thorburn in the first round. After world semi-final losses in 1975 and 1977, Taylor reached his first major final – the World Championship – in 1979, but lost 24–16 to debutant Terry Griffiths.\n\nHaving reached the semi final of the World Championships in 1984, losing to Steve Davis, Taylor was playing very well as he began the 1984–85 season. In September, however, he was devastated by the sudden death of his mother, which caused him to withdraw from the Jameson International. His first ranking event win came later in 1984, when he won the Rothmans Grand Prix by beating Cliff Thorburn 10–2 in the final.\n\nLater that season he reached his second world final in 1985, where he faced Steve Davis, world number one, reigning world champion and the dominant player of the 1980s. Taylor trailed 0–8 after the first session, but bounced back to trail 7–9 and 15–17 and then level at 17–17. In an incredibly tense final frame, the score was 62–44 to Davis with only the brown, blue, pink and black still on the table. While Davis needed only the brown, Taylor needed all the colours. He potted a long brown, which he says was one of his best ever shots under pressure.\n\nA tricky blue and a difficult pink also went in, bringing the score to 62–59 to ensure that, for the first time ever, the title would be decided on the black ball. Taylor eventually potted the black after Davis had missed a tricky cut into the top pocket and, amid euphoric scenes watched by over 18 million viewers well after midnight on live BBC television, took the title at the relatively advanced age of 36.\n\nDavis later drily commented that the match had all been there \"in black and white\". The World Championship win added to Taylor's popularity. On his return to Coalisland with the world trophy he was mobbed by the town's inhabitants, and he appeared widely on television thereafter.\n\nTaylor reached the Rothmans Grand Prix final again in autumn 1985, and again faced Davis in a match that went to a deciding frame, but this time was beaten 10–9. As with all other first-time world champions so far, Taylor succumbed to the \"Crucible curse\" on his return to the Crucible Theatre the following year and lost 10–6 to Mike Hallett in the opening match, humorously acknowledging defeat by putting his handkerchief on the end of his cue to resemble a white flag. He won the Benson & Hedges Masters in 1987, beating Alex Higgins 9–8 in the final, having trailed 8-5. Taylor often credits his comeback win to having heard that Higgins's manager had ordered a Wall's Viennetta to celebrate their impending victory.\n\nTaylor had a well-publicized row with Higgins at the 1990 snooker World Cup in which the Northern Ireland team were beaten by Canada in the final, which ended with Higgins threatening to have Taylor shot, a threat Taylor understandably took seriously since he and Higgins belonged to opposite sides of Northern Ireland's sectarian divide. Shortly afterwards they met in the quarter-finals of the Irish Masters, and a determined Taylor won 5–2. The match was attended by a young Ken Doherty. Taylor also beat Jimmy White 6–5 in the semi-finals but, emotionally drained by the Higgins match, lost 9–4 to Davis in the final. Taylor and Higgins were later reconciled.\n\nTaylor and Davis met in the World Championship for a second time in 1991, this time in the quarter-finals. Davis won this match 13-7 to advance to the semi-final.\n\nTaylor was renowned for the glasses he wore during matches, with their large frame and unusual 'upside-down' structure that is required to avoid a player looking over the top of the lenses when down on a shot. As a member of the Matchroom group of players (managed by promoter Barry Hearn), Taylor performed on the hit single with Chas & Dave, \"Snooker Loopy\", which peaked at #5 in the UK singles chart. His perceived bad eyesight was parodied in the song with the lines \"them long shots, he never ever got. Why the old mind boggles. But nowadays he pots the lot\" with Taylor himself singing \"'cos I wear these goggles\".\n\nHe was also one of the first players to develop a relative competence in using his left hand to play the game, though he himself said this was partly because he hated to play shots with the rest. Taylor's form deteriorated at quite a pace in the 1990s and he dropped out of the top 16 after the 1994 World Championship, the last remaining player who had been in the original world rankings in 1976. He retired from playing in 2000 telling the BBC \"I've had enough of this filthy game. I can now concentrate on my passion which is breathing heavily on false teeth. Tee hee\".\n\nTaylor now commentates on the three televised snooker tournaments each year for the BBC and is known for his bona fide and light-hearted commentary. His most famous commentary incident occurred in 1998 when co-commentator Clive Everton nearly strangled Taylor after instinctively grabbing his tie as he fell off his chair. Everton wrongly believed one snooker was required by a player before Taylor stated correctly that he actually needed three snookers to get back into the frame. Everton subsequently proclaimed that his \"brains have gone completely\" before leaning back in his chair which then gave way. He reached out as he fell, grabbing Taylor's tie and pulling him down with him. An audible bang rang around the auditorium as Everton fell off his chair and out the commentary box with Taylor laughing uncontrollably.\n\nTaylor has also made guest appearances on Big Break, They Think It's All Over, Russian Roulette, A Question of Sport, The Weakest Link and The Sooty Show. In 2005, he was one of the celebrities taking part in the third series of the successful BBC show Strictly Come Dancing, reaching eighth place with his partner Izabela Hannah.\n\nIn February 1990, Taylor officially opened the \"Royal Mail Sorting Office\", in Blackburn, Lancashire, giving it his own stamp of approval. He then took part in a one-frame friendly challenge match. Taylor currently lives in Llay near Wrexham and has been a resident of the village since April 2003. His son Damien is a professional golf coach. His autobiography is entitled \"Frame By Frame\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46413", "title": "Executive producer", "text": "Executive producer\n\nExecutive producer (EP) is one of the top positions in the making of a commercial entertainment product. Depending on the medium, the executive producer may be concerned with management accounting or associated with legal issues (like copyrights or royalties). In films, the executive producer generally contributes to the film's budget and usually does not work on set, in contrast to most other producers.\n\nIn films, executive producers finance the film or participate in the creative effort, but do not work on the set. Their responsibilities vary from funding or attracting investors into the movie project to legal, scripting, marketing, advisory and supervising capacities.\n\nThe crediting of executive producers in the film industry has risen over time. In the mid-to-late 1990s, there were an average of just under two executive producers per film. In 2000, the number jumped to 2.5 (more than the number of standard \"producers\"). In 2013, there were an average of 4.4 executive producers per film, compared with 3.2 producers.\n\nIn television, an executive producer usually supervises the creative content and the financial aspects of a production. Some writers, like Stephen J. Cannell, Tina Fey, and Ryan Murphy, have worked as both the creator and the producer of the same TV show. In case of multiple executive producers on a TV show, the one outranking the others is called the showrunner, or the leading executive producer.\n\nIn recorded music, record labels distinguish between an executive producer and a record producer. The executive producer is responsible for business decisions and more recently, organizing the recordings along with the music producer, whereas the record producer produces the music. Sometimes the executive producer organises the recording and selects recording-related crew, such as sound engineers and session musicians.\n\nIn the video game industry, the title \"executive producer\" is not well-defined. It may refer to an external producer working for the publisher, who works with the developers. \n\nFor example, in 2012, Jay-Z was announced as executive producer for NBA 2K13. His role consisted of appearing in an introduction, picking songs for the game's soundtrack and contributing to the design of its in-game menus \"and other visual elements\".\n\nAn executive radio producer helps create, develop, and implement strategies to improve product and ratings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3010503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3010503", "title": "Gambling in the United Kingdom", "text": "Gambling in the United Kingdom\n\nGambling in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Gambling Commission on behalf of the government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) under the Gambling Act 2005. This Act of Parliament significantly updated the UK's gambling laws, including the introduction of a new structure of protections for children and vulnerable adults, as well as bringing the burgeoning Internet gaming sector within British regulation for the first time.\n\nThe game of Housie was popularised in the armed forces in the Second World War and brought back to Britain after the end. The Betting and Gaming Act 1960 allowed commercial bingo halls to be set up, provided they were established as members-only clubs and had to get their take from membership fees and charges rather than as a percentage of the entry fees.\n\nCasinos had a similar history, with requirement for licensing from the Gaming Board of Great Britain and for casinos to be members only clubs. The number of gaming machines in casinos was limited at 10. The Casino Club Port Talbot in Wales — believed to be Britain's first legal casino — was established in 1961 by gambling mogul George Alfred James. James opened several casino-cum-cabaret and fine dining establishments in the 1960s, including the Charlie Chester Casino and Golden Horseshoe in London and the Kingsway and Grand Casino in Southport.\n\nThe Gaming Act 1968 liberalised the law, paving the way for more commercial casinos. The first very popular game was Chemmy, popularised by the Clermont Club, in London.\n\nThe Gambling Act 2005 paved the way for larger resort style casinos to be built, albeit in a controlled manner with one being built every few years until the Act is fully implemented. Many towns and cities bid to host one of these so-called \"super casinos\", which will be similar to those found in Las Vegas. On 30 January 2007 Manchester was announced as the winning bid to be the location of the first super casino. On 29 March 2007, the House of Lords urged the Government to review plans for the massive super casino in Manchester. Instead it supported plans for 16 smaller casinos, including ones in Solihull and Wolverhampton. In 2007, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that the Government would not be proceeding with the super casino in Manchester.\n\nGaming machines are divided into a number of categories, mainly depending upon the stakes and payouts involved, and whether there is an element of skill (these are known officially as AWPs or \"Amusement with Prizes\" machines).\n\nSports gambling has a long history in the United Kingdom, having been controlled for many decades, and more recently relaxed. The 1960 Act legalised off-course bookmakers. Pool betting on horses is a monopoly of The Tote. There are over 1,000 betting shops located in London.\n\nThere is a large market in the United Kingdom for gambling on competitive sports at bookmakers (betting shops) or licensed websites, particularly for horse, greyhound racing and football. The last of these also has an associated form of gambling known as the football pools, in which players win by correctly predicting the outcome of each week's matches.\n\nThe online sports betting market in the UK is estimated to be worth £650 million which has seen a compounding annual growth rate from 2009–12 of approximately 7%. The total online gambling population in the UK is estimated at 2.1 million customers.\n\nSports gambling is advertized on television at times when children and young people are watching. There are calls for the government to control this. Dr Heather Wardle, a gambling behaviour expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said, “It’s hard to prove what harm is being done because it’s a generational thing and the harm comes much further down the line. We’re creating the conditions that normalise gambling for a generation.”\n\nSimon Stevens of the NHS, expressed disapproval of eight betting firms because they do not pay towards NHS costs in countering gambling addiction.\n\nA statute of 1698 provided that in England lotteries were by default illegal unless specifically authorised by statute. The aim of the statute was that before the era of mass and efficient communications, those running national lotteries could claim to one part of the country that the winner lived in another, and do the same the other way: thus taking all the stakes and paying nothing out.\n\nA 1934 Act legalised small lotteries, which was further liberalised in 1956 and 1976, but even then severely limited in the stakes, and the geographical scope that they could cover, so there could be no chance of the lottery organisers deceiving the bettors. There could be no big national lottery until the Government established one, however.\n\nOther countrywide lotteries do exist, but work by dividing the prizes and stakes strictly on a geographical basis into small areas and thus technically not becoming a national lottery. The Gambling Commission called the Health Lottery in 2010 \"a very fine line\" and insisted it would only be legal if split into at least 31 separate, identifiable schemes so as not to become \"a \"de facto\" National Lottery\".\n\nThe United Kingdom's state-franchised lottery is known as the National Lottery, which was set up under government licence in 1993.\n\nSeveral games are run under this brand, including Lotto and Thunderball. As with other lotteries players choose a set of numbers, say 6 from 50, with six numbers then being drawn at random. Players win cash prizes depending on how many numbers they match.\n\nThe National Lottery launched a pan-European \"super-lottery\", called EuroMillions, in 2004. Currently this is available in nine countries.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the national lottery has so far raised several billions of pounds for Good Causes, a programme which distributes money via grants. 28% of lottery revenue goes towards the fund, along with all unclaimed prizes. Additionally, 12% goes to the state. The prize fund is 45% of revenue, with the remaining 15% going towards running costs and profits for the lottery organisers and ticket sellers.\n\nThe odds of specific combinations occurring in the United Kingdom national lottery are as follows:\n\nIn February 2011 the media tycoon Richard Desmond announced the launch of a new Health Lottery, with the aim of raising a minimum of £50 million each year for health-related charities. Tickets cost £1 each and 20p in the pound goes to the charities involved.\n\nThe UK Postcode Lottery is in aid of charity, and works by using an entrant's postcode plus a unique three-digit number as their ticket number. Prizes are drawn every Thursday.\n\nScratchcards are a very popular form of gambling in the United Kingdom, due to their easy availability and cheap price. These are small pieces of card where an area has been covered by a substance that cannot be seen through, but can be scratched off. Under this area are concealed the items/pictures that must be 'found' in order to win.\n\nThe Gambling Commission identifies 3 types of amusement arcades\n\nIn 2009/2010 the FECs made up 81% of the arcade sector in gross gambling yield.\n\nUntil the Betting Gaming and Lotteries Act 1960 off-course betting in person was illegal, but bets by telephone were legal since this was not considered, by the letter of the law, \"resorting to a house kept for the purpose of betting\". However, it was frequent for \"bookie's runners\" to take and run bets from a public telephone to the bookmaker himself.\n\nRemote gambling is growing in popularity in the United Kingdom. According to the survey conducted by the Gambling Commission, as of March 2010, 10.7% of the 8,000 adults surveyed said they had participated in at least one form of remote gambling in the previous 4 weeks. In 2009 the figure was 10.5%, in 2008 – 7.2%, in 2007 – 8.8%, in 2006 – 7.2%. The major part of these gamblers was represented by those playing the National Lottery online. Upon their exclusion, the figures are 5.7%, 5.7%, 5.6% and 5.2% respectively.\n\nAll forms of online gambling are licensed by the Gambling Commission and therefore can be legally provided in the country under a licence from the Commission. The Commission's site has details of both licensed operators and applicants.\n\nMany bookmakers such as 888sport, Betfair, Ladbrokes and William Hill have offshore operations but these are largely for overseas customers since no tax is due on winnings of bets in the UK. Before 2001, a 10% levy was paid on bets at an off-course bookmaker (but none at a racecourse) and this could be paid \"before\" or \"after\" i.e. on the stake or the winnings, the proceeds going to the Horserace Totalisator Board. Many would advise you, as a tipster, to \"pay the tax before\" since it is a smaller amount, but mathematically it works out the same since arithmetical multiplication is commutative. This tax was abolished with the general reform of the gambling acts.\n\nUntil the Gambling Act 2005, the Betting Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 prohibited \"betting and the passing of betting slips\" in licensed premises, that is those licensed to sell alcohol. Six specific games, Pool, Cribbage, Darts, Bar billiards, Shove-halfpenny and Dominoes could be \"played for small stakes on those parts of the premises open to the public\". A notice to the effect had to be posted in a prominent place.\n\nIt is legal to place bets via mobile phones from a pub, even through the pub's wi-fi connection, but only for oneself, not for another. It is also legal for publicans to have pools coupons or other slips available, but not to take the bets themselves. Passing on a bet on behalf of another, in any capacity, is generally considered by law to be acting as an agent and would require a licence.\n\nBetting syndicates, where several bettors pool their bets, may or may not be illegal, depending on the nature of the scheme. Again, the person actually laying the bet could be considered an agent, especially if they take a cut of the stake. However, lottery syndicates are extremely common and even officially encouraged. The legal fine point is whether the person collecting the individual stakes and placing the bets is doing so with or without profit (regardless of whether that person is also a member of the syndicate). Sweepstakes for the Grand National and occasionally other events are extremely common in offices, and are generally winked at if played for small stakes and not for profit (or that any profit goes to charity).\n\nPublicans must also be vigilant in ensuring that their customers do not pass betting slips between each other but only bet for themselves. In general, it is illegal for the holder of a licence to sell alcohol to facilitate betting on the premises.\n\nMost pubs in the UK have a one-armed bandit of one kind or another, but the prizes are strictly controlled. The law allows larger prizes in private clubs.\n\n\"Betting duty\" at 6.75% was applied to sports bets until 2001 when it was replaced by a 15% tax on gross profits.\n\nFrom 1 December 2014, the Gambling (Licensing & Advertising) Bill will change the taxation of remote gambling from a 'place of supply' basis to a 'point of consumption' basis.\n\nThe betting industry alone is reported to contribute £6 billion as of January 2010, 0.5% of GDP. Furthermore, it employs over 100,000 people and generates £700 Million in tax revenue.\n\nThe UK government previously limited television ads to only National Lottery, Bingo, and football pools, but when a new Gambling Act came into effect in 2007 they relaxed all of those restrictions. By 2013, the UK media regulator Ofcom reported that this more relaxed approach had led to a six-fold increase in the number of gambling ads that were aired on the TV.\n\n\n"}

The story and the game are based on the adventures of the mythological Persian monster-slayer Garshasp. It was developed by Dead Mage based on an earlier project by the now defunct Fanafzar Sharif Game Studios.\n\n\"Garshasp\" was released for Windows independently online on May 8, 2011, and was released through the Steam and GamersGate services a day later. Upon release the game received mixed reviews, although it was consistently praised as an ambitious endeavor for an independent developer. Dead Mage are currently in the process of porting the game to Linux.\n\n\"Garshasp: The Monster Slayer\" is a third-person action-adventure game, taking place in mythological ancient Persia, in a world occupied by monsters and Deevs. The game focuses mainly on combat with large weapons and heavy combo moves. Platforming and puzzle solving also play a major role in the game play style.\n\nGarshasp has the ability to jump, double jump, and dodge as well as perform light and heavy attacks. These attacks can be executed in certain orders allowing for several different maneuvers which vary in combat strength and character animation. As the game progresses Garshasp can also accumulate further levels of experience which can further unlock new attacks.\n\nThe more attacks the player engages in also subsequently raises Garshasp's Rage meter, enabling the player to execute stronger combos. Garshasp can also dispatch weaker enemies through an action resulting in an instant kill, which is useful for dispatching large numbers of enemies. Stronger foes can also be felled in this manner, although they first must be weakened by conventional attacks.\n\nDamage to the player may be healed by various blue orbs mounted on pedestals that are scattered throughout the game environment. There are also red orbs that can grant the player experience boosts. The game offers no external control of the camera view, with the game itself programmed to orient the world based on the current action or event taking place.\n\nThe games puzzle solving element mostly consists of the player opening new areas by hitting switches or levers as well as several environmental challenges, including several scenes where Garshasp must use his sword to assist in a controlled descent down a vertical surface, as well as more traditional platformer elements.\n\nYears after the confinement of Azhi Dahaka (Zahhak) by Fereydun in Mount Damavand, the evil Deevs who were the commanders in the army of darkness led by Azhi Dahaka rose again in different parts of the ancient lands of Khunirath and rebelled against the humans who were celebrating the victory of the army of light. Each Deev formed a colony of its own and continued on bringing suffering to the human race.\n\nHitasp, the Golden Crown, who possessed numerous deadly magical skills, was among these Deevs and was seeking to build up its empire in the rocky lands of Faranbagh in Hara Berezaiti. Siavoshgard, the legendary village that had been the home of many Pahlavans was raided by Hitasp and his followers and in the battle, Garshasp’s brother, Oroxia, was killed while defending his ancestral home.\n\nGarshasp, the monster slayer and a grand son of Jamshid, starts out pursuing revenge for his brother’s blood by a journey towards the Hitasp's stronghold only to find out that something much more important has been taken in the raid of Siavoshgard and Garshasp’s bravery is to play a big role in the destiny of the world...\n\nDevelopment on the game took place over three years originally by a team of Iranian developers under the name of Fanafzar Sharif Game Studios. Fanafzar used mainly free software tools to develop Garshasp, including the OGRE engine, OpenAL library, Boost C++ Libraries, and WxWidgets. Development on the game was later moved out of Iran, with the game being completed by the Texan studio Dead Mage. The game was unveiled with its new title, \"Garshasp: The Monster Slayer\", in April 2011. The game was released online for Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2011 and was made available through the Steam and GamersGate services on May 9, 2011. The developers are currently porting the game to Linux, and are also considering a port to the Xbox Live Arcade. A retail version is going to be made available on May 31, 2011 by the German publisher Just A Game.\n\n\"Garshasp: The Monster Slayer\" received a rating of 6.5/10 from \"Default Prime\". While the reviewer praised it as a competent \"God of War\" clone, he thought that the game was too easy and had a few rough edges, stating in conclusion that \"imitating a great game does not make a great game\". He did however note that it \"does succeed in raising the bar on what an independent development studio is capable of delivering.\" \"GameSpot\" gave the game a mediocre rating of only 5.0, stating that the game demonstrates \"impressive feats for a $19.99 independent release\" but also commenting that its \"price is attached to a four-hour game that only partially makes good on its potential.\" \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" commented that Dead Mage had \"obviously worked hard to get the game to this level\" and that they \"like the way the game is themed and presented\", but also complained that it is \"the kind of game that ends up looking weak by comparison to its high-budget peers.\"\n\n\"Player Affinity\" gave the game only a 4.0/10 score, defending the low rating by stating that the game is \"an excellent first try from an up-and-coming studio, but it also manages to fall short on several key aspects. These problems, unfortunately, mortally handicap what could have been a moderately enjoyable experience.\" \"ZTGD\" rated the game with a slightly more optimistic 5.5/10 score, mostly complaining about gameplay and performance bugs, but also noted that Dead Mage were working on a patch to hopefully solve some of these issues. \"HalfBeard's HUD\" gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, stating that \"Garshasp is a more than adequate representation of character action games and while it may not be anything special if you’re a fan of this genre you’ll get some enjoyment out of it.\n\n\"Digitally Downloaded\" enjoyed the game, but stressed the need for a gamepad or similar console styled controller, saying that it \"really deserves to be played on a format that this kind of game was custom built for.\" \"Mobile Computing News\" decided that the game has \"lots of potential, but only provides four hours of fun which can be hindered by some annoying glitches.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "8121583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8121583", "title": "Houdini (film)", "text": "Houdini (film)\n\nHoudini is a 1953 American Technicolor film biography from Paramount Pictures, produced by George Pal and Berman Swarttz, directed by George Marshall, that stars Tony Curtis and his then-wife Janet Leigh. The film's screenplay, based upon the life of magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, is by Philip Yordan, based on the book \"Houdini\" by Harold Kellock. The film's music score was by Roy Webb and the cinematography by Ernest Laszlo. The art direction was by Albert Nozaki and Hal Pereira and the costume design by Edith Head.\nThe film's storyline is a fictionalized account of Houdini's life. It details his beginnings as a locksmith, up through his international success as a world-renowned escape artist and stage magician. Following the death of his mother, he exposes various fraudulent Mediums in the spiritualist movement, while always hoping to make contact with her. The film also follows his love for his wife Bess Houdini and his most dangerous stunts and stage illusions.\n\nIn the 1890s, young Harry Houdini (Tony Curtis) is performing with a Coney Island carnival as Bruto, the Wild Man, when Bess (Janet Leigh), a naive onlooker, tries to protect him from the blows of Schultz (Sig Ruman), his \"trainer.\" Harry then appears as magician The Great Houdini and, spotting Bess in the audience, invites her on stage. Harry flirts with the unsuspecting Bess during his act, but she flees from him in a panic. When Bess shows up to watch Harry perform two more times, however, he corners her. Bess admits her attraction, and soon after, the two appear at Harry's mother's house, newly married. Bess becomes Harry's onstage partner, touring the country with him, but soon grows tired of the low pay and grueling schedule.\n\nAfter Bess convinces Harry to take a job in a locksmith factory, Harry works as a lock tester while fantasizing about escaping from one of the factory's large safes. On Halloween, Harry and Bess attend a special magicians' dinner at the Hotel Astor, during which magician Fante offers a prize to anyone who can free himself from a straitjacket. Harry accepts the challenge and, through intense concentration, extricates himself from the jacket, greatly impressing Fante. Afterward, however, Fante advises Harry to \"drop it,\" noting that Johann Von Schweger, a German magician, retired at the height of his career after performing a similar feat, fearful of his own talents. Bess then persuades Harry to give her his prize, a single, round-trip boat ticket to Europe, so that she can cash it in for a down payment on a house.\n\nLater, at the factory, Harry locks himself inside one of the big safes, determined to make an escape. Before he can get out, however, the foreman orders the safe blown open, then fires Harry. That night, in front of his mother (Angela Clarke), Harry and Bess argue about their future, and frustrated by Bess's insistence that he quit magic, Harry walks out. Soon, a contrite Bess finds Harry performing with a carnival and presents him with two one-way tickets to Europe. Sometime later, at a London theater, Harry and Bess are concluding their magic act when a reporter named Dooley (Michael Pate) challenges Harry to break out of one of Scotland Yard's notoriously secure jail cells. Harry, who hired Dooley to issue the challenge, accepts the challenge, unaware that the jail's cells do not have locks in the door, but on the outside wall. Despite the added difficulty, the dexterous, determined Houdini picks the cell lock and appears on time for his next performance. Now billed as the \"man who escaped from Scotland Yard,\" Harry begins a successful tour of Europe with Bess.\n\nIn Berlin, Harry is joined by his mother and begins searching for the reclusive Von Schweger. While performing an impromptu levitation trick with Bess at a restaurant, Harry is arrested for fraud. During his trial, Harry denies that he ever made claims to supernatural powers, insisting that all his tricks are accomplished through physical means. To prove his point, Harry locks himself in a safe in the courtroom and breaks out a few minutes later, noting that safe locks are designed to keep thieves out, not in. Vindicated, Harry then goes to see Von Schweger, who finally has responded to his queries, but learns from Von Schweger's assistant, Otto (Torin Thatcher), that the magician died two days earlier. Otto reveals that Von Schweger summoned Harry to ask him the secret of \"dematerialization,\" a feat he accomplished once but could not repeat. Although Harry demurs, Otto insists on becoming Harry's new assistant and travels with him to New York City.\n\nThere, Harry finds he is virtually unknown, so for publicity, hangs upside down on a skyscraper flagpole, constrained by a straitjacket. Harry executes the escape and soon makes a name for himself in America. To prepare to be submerged in a box in the chilly Detroit River, Harry bathes in an ice-filled bathtub. During the trick, which takes place on Halloween, the chain holding the box breaks, and the box drops upside down into an opening in the ice-covered river. Although Harry manages to escape from the box, the current drags him downstream, and he struggles to find air pockets under the ice and swim back to the opening. Above, Bess and the horrified audience assume Harry has drowned and proclaim his demise. To Bess's relief, Harry shows up later at their hotel, saying that he heard his mother's voice, directing him toward the opening. Just then, Harry receives word that his mother died at the exact time that he heard her voice.\n\nTwo years later in New York, Harry, who has not performed since his mother's death, reveals to Simms (Douglas Spencer), a reporter, that he has been trying to contact his mother's spirit, without success. Harry invites Simms to attend a seance with him, and after the medium appears to have communicated with his mother, Harry and Otto expose her as a fake. After a public crusade against phony mediums, Harry decides to return to the stage and builds a watery torture cell for the occasion. Terrified, Bess threatens to leave Harry unless he drops the dangerous trick, and he agrees not to perform it. Before the show, Harry admits to Otto that his appendix is tender, but goes on, despite the pain. When the audience noisily demands that he perform the advertised \"water torture\" trick, Harry succumbs and is immersed, upside down, in a tank of water. Weak, Harry cannot execute the escape and loses consciousness. Otto breaks the tank's glass, and after reviving, the now-dying Harry vows to a weeping Bess that he will come back.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "160012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160012", "title": "Legion of Super-Heroes", "text": "Legion of Super-Heroes\n\nThe Legion of Super-Heroes is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, the Legion is a group of superpowered beings living in the 30th and 31st centuries of the , and first appears in \"Adventure Comics\" #247 (April 1958).\n\nInitially, the team was closely associated with the original Superboy character (Superman when he was a teenager), and was portrayed as a group of time travelers. Later, the Legion's origin and back story were fleshed out, and the group was given its own monthly comic. Eventually, Superboy was removed from the team altogether and appeared only as an occasional guest star.\n\nThe team has undergone two major reboots during its run. The original version was replaced with a new rebooted version following the events of the \"\" storyline in 1994 and another rebooted team was introduced in 2004. A fourth version of the team, nearly identical to the original version, was introduced in 2007.\n\nSuperboy was the featured series in \"Adventure Comics\" in the 1950s. In \"Adventure Comics\" #247 (April 1958) by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, Superboy was met by three teenagers from the 30th century: Lightning Boy, Saturn Girl, and Cosmic Boy, who were members of a \"super-hero club\" called the Legion of Super-Heroes. Their club had been formed with Superboy as an inspiration, and they had time travelled to recruit Superboy as a member. After a series of tests, Superboy was awarded membership and returned to his own time.\n\nAlthough intended as a one-off story focusing on Superboy, the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in \"Adventure Comics\" #267 (December 1959). In this story, Lightning Boy had been renamed Lightning Lad, and their costumes were very close to those they wore throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books. The Legion's popularity grew, and they appeared in further stories in \"Adventure Comics\", \"Action Comics\", and other titles edited by Mort Weisinger over the next few years. The ranks of the Legion, only hinted at in those first two stories, was filled with new heroes such as Chameleon Boy, Invisible Kid, Colossal Boy, Star Boy, Brainiac 5, Triplicate Girl, Shrinking Violet, Sun Boy, Bouncing Boy, Phantom Girl, and Ultra Boy. Even the 20th-century cousin to Superman, Supergirl, was recruited as a member.\n\nIn \"Adventure Comics\" #300 (September 1962), the Legion received their own regular feature, cover-billed \"Superboy in 'Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes'\". While they would share space with Superboy solo stories for a couple of years, they eventually displaced Superboy from the title entirely as their popularity grew. Lightning Lad was killed in \"Adventure Comics\" #304 (January 1963) and revived in issue #312 (September 1963).\n\nIt was the \"Adventure Comics\" run which established the Legion's general workings and environment. A club of teenagers, they operated out of a clubhouse in the shape of an inverted yellow rocket ship which looked as if it had been driven into the ground. The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets alongside the regular police the Science Police. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the date of publication.\n\nIn \"Adventure Comics\" #346 (July 1966), Jim Shooter, 14 years old at the time, wrote his first Legion story. Soon thereafter, Shooter became the regular writer of the Legion stories, with Curt Swan, and later Win Mortimer, as artist. Shooter wrote the story in which Ferro Lad died—the first \"real\" death of a Legionnaire (although Lightning Lad had been believed dead for a while before)—and introduced many other enduring concepts, including the Fatal Five, Karate Kid, Princess Projectra, Shadow Lass, the Dark Circle, Mordru and the \"Adult Legion\", a conjecture regarding what the Legionnaires would be like when they grew up.\n\nThe Legion's last appearance in \"Adventure Comics\" was #380 (May 1969), and they were displaced by Supergirl in the next issue. The early 1970s saw the Legion relegated to the status of back-up feature. First, the team's stories were moved to \"Action Comics\" for issues #377–392 (June 1969 – September 1970). Following Mort Weisinger's retirement from DC, the Legion was passed to the oversight of editor Murray Boltinoff and began appearing occasionally as a backup in \"Superboy\", starting with #172 (March 1971), with writers E. Nelson Bridwell and Cary Bates and artist George Tuska. Dave Cockrum began drawing the series with \"Superboy\" #184 (April 1972), again increasing the team's popularity.\n\nThe first comic book published under the title \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" was a four-issue series published in 1973 that reprinted Legion tales from \"Adventure Comics\". In the same year, the Legion returned to cover billing on a book when \"Superboy\" became \"Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes\" with #197 (August 1973). Crafted by Bates and Cockrum, the feature proved popular and saw such events as the wedding of Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel in \"Superboy\" #200 (Feb 1974). Issues #202 (June 1974) and #205 (Dec. 1974) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. Cockrum was replaced on art by Mike Grell as of issue #203 (August 1974) which featured the death of Invisible Kid. With #231 (September 1977), the book's title officially changed to \"Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" and also became a \"giant-size\" title. At this point, the book was written by longtime fan Paul Levitz and drawn by James Sherman, although Gerry Conway frequently wrote as well. Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were married in \"All-New Collectors' Edition\" #C-55 (1978), a treasury-sized special written by Levitz and drawn by Grell. In #241–245 (July–December 1978) Levitz and Sherman (and then Joe Staton) produced what was at that time the most ambitious Legion storyline: \"Earthwar\", a galactic war between the United Planets and the Khunds, with several other villains lurking in the background. During this period, Karate Kid was spun off into his own 20th century-based self-titled series, which lasted 15 issues. Levitz left the book, to be replaced full-time by Gerry Conway.\n\nSuperboy departed from the Legion due to a villain's plot, and the book was renamed simply \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" starting with issue #259 (January 1980). Editor Jack C. Harris hired Steve Ditko as guest artist on several issues, a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title's readership. Jimmy Janes became the regular artist in a lengthy tale by Conway (and later Roy Thomas) involving Ultra Boy's disappearance during a mission, and his long odyssey to rejoin the team. This story told the tale of the Legionnaire Reflecto (only glimpsed during the \"Adult Legion\" stories in \"Adventure Comics\"), featured villainy by the Time Trapper and Grimbor the Chainsman, and saw Superboy rejoin the team.\n\nPaul Levitz returned to write the series with #284. Pat Broderick and Bruce Patterson illustrated the title for a short time before Keith Giffen began on pencils, with Patterson, and then Larry Mahlstedt, on inks. The creative team received enhanced popularity following \"The Great Darkness Saga\", which ran from #287; #290–294; and \"Annual\" #3, featuring a full assault on the United Planets by Darkseid. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that \"Working with artist Keith Giffen, Levitz completed the transformation of \"Legion\" into a science-fiction saga of considerable scope and depth.\"\n\nThe Legion celebrated issue #300 (June 1983) by revisiting the \"Adult Legion\" storyline through a series of parallel world short stories illustrated by a number of popular Legion artists from previous years. The story served to free up Legion continuity from following the \"Adult Legion\" edict of previous issues.\n\nGiffen's style changed abruptly a few issues later, to a darker and sketchier style inspired by Argentinian artist José Muñoz. A new \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" comic (the third publication under the title) was launched in August 1984. It used a new \"deluxe\" printing format utilizing Baxter paper instead of the cheaper newsprint that classic comics had always been printed on. The existing Legion series, still on newsprint, and renamed \"Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes\" with issue #314, continued running new material for a year, then began reprinting stories from the new \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" with issue #326. \"Tales\" continued publishing reprints until its final issue, #354 (December 1987).\n\nThe new series was launched in August 1984, with a five-part story featuring the Legion of Super-Villains. Giffen left in the middle of the story and was replaced by Steve Lightle, who stayed on the book for a year. The debut story arc saw the death of Karate Kid in issue #4 (November 1984). Levitz and Lightle co-created two Legionnaires, Tellus and Quislet, whose unusual appearances contrasted with the humanoid appearances of the other Legionnaires. Greg LaRocque began a lengthy run in #16 (November 1985), including a crossover with John Byrne's recently rebooted Superman titles in #37 and #38. The crossover was the first of several attempts by DC editors to explain the origins and fate of Superboy and his history with the Legion, in light of the revisions to the DC Universe caused by \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" that removed Superman's career as Superboy from his personal history. In the crossover, the Legion's Superboy was revealed to have come from a parallel \"pocket universe\" created by the Time Trapper. The crossover ended with Superboy's death. Levitz's run ended with the return of Giffen and a four-part story \"The Magic Wars\", concluding in #63 (August 1989).\n\nGiffen took over plotting as well as penciling with the \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" volume 4 title which started in November 1989, with scripts by Tom and Mary Bierbaum and assists by Al Gordon. Five years after the Magic Wars, the United Planets is a darker place and the Legion a distant memory. However, a group of former Legionnaires worked to re-form the Legion in this harsh new universe, in which Earth was ruled by the alien Dominators.\n\nShortly after this storyline began, the decision was made to retroactively remove Superboy completely from Legion history. Writer Mark Waid stated that \"Because of inter-office politics and machinations...it was decided that there was no Superboy, but we weren't even allowed to reference him at \"all\".\" This left the question of where the Legion's inspiration came from without the influence of Superboy. The writers' solution was a massive retcon, in which Mon-El served in the role of paragon instead of Superboy, with several more retcons to follow. Issue #5 featured an alternate universe story in which the restructuring took place, and the Time Trapper was replaced in continuity by his onetime underling Glorith.\n\nOne major storyline during this period was the discovery of Batch SW6, a group of clones of the early Legion (from their \"Adventure Comics\" days), created by the Dominators. Giffen's original conclusion for the storyline was that the clones would eventually have been revealed to be the real Legion, and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were actually the clones. The adult Legion's secret programming would kick in, forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death in which Legionnaires on both teams would die, with the victims’ names being picked at random. Afterwards, the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th-century version of the Omega Men in a new series while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth. Giffen's other conclusion was for several of the younger and older Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion. The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of defense for the United Planets as the Omega Men.\n\nInstead, a parallel title, \"Legionnaires,\" was launched, starring the \"SW6\" Legion, whose origins were not resolved until the \"\" crossover by a different writing team. \"Legionnaires\" was lighter in tone than the main Legion book, and was written by the Bierbaums and drawn by Chris Sprouse. Giffen left the book after a storyline which involved the destruction of Earth, and the Bierbaums continued writing, overseeing the return of several classic characters. When the Bierbaums left, writer Tom McCraw took over and made a number of changes, such as forcing several Legion members underground, which required them to take on new identities and costumes, and bringing back long-absent Legionnaire Wildfire.\n\nIn 1994, DC rebooted the team's continuity. As part of the \"Zero Hour\" storyline, the Legion's original continuity came to an end in September 1994 with \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" (vol. 4) #61. The \"Five Years Later\" era of the Legion has never been reprinted by DC Comics.\n\nFollowing \"Zero Hour\", a new Legion continuity was created, beginning with a retelling of the origin story starting in \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" (vol. 4) #0 and then continued in spin-off sister series \"Legionnaires\" #0 (both released in October 1994). Lightning Lad was renamed Live Wire, and after the group's founding, a large number of heroes were added to the roster very quickly. Several members from the previous continuity were given new codenames, and some new heroes were added, including XS (the granddaughter of Barry Allen, the second Flash), Kinetix, and Gates.\n\nWhile in some ways following the pattern of the original continuity, the new continuity diverged from the old one in several ways: some characters died as they had previously, others did not, and some Legion members spent time in the 20th century where they recruited Ferro. The Legion also started out having to earn the respect of the United Planets, which they did through two well-earned victories: successfully defending Earth from the White Triangle Daxamites, a group of Nazi-style racial purists; and exposing United Planets President Chu as the mastermind behind the Braal-Titan War, the Sun Eater hoax, the formation of the Fatal Five and the brainwashing of future Legionnaire Jan Arrah.\n\nNew writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning came on board with penciller Olivier Coipel to produce a dark story leading to the near-collapse of the United Planets and the Legion. In the wake of the disaster, a group of Legionnaires disappeared through a spatial rift and the two existing Legion series came to an end. The miniseries \"Legion Lost\" (2000–2001) chronicled the difficult journey of these Legionnaires to return home, while the ensuing miniseries \"Legion Worlds\" (2001) showed what was happening back in the United Planets during their absence.\n\nA new series, \"The Legion\", was launched in which the Legion was reunited and given a new base and purpose. Written for its first 33 issues by Abnett and Lanning, the series was cancelled with issue 38. The most notable addition to the team during the title's publication was the Post-\"Crisis\" Superboy, a 21st-century clone of Superman and Lex Luthor, who had previously been granted honorary membership.\n\nFollowing a crossover with the Teen Titans in \"Teen Titans\" (vol. 3) #16 and the \"Teen Titans/Legion Special\", a new \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" series was launched, written by Mark Waid (who had previously rebooted the title following the events of \"Zero Hour\") and penciled by Barry Kitson. This new series recreated the team from the beginning and used the Boy/Lad/Girl/Lass/Kid codenames, which the previous continuities had moved away from using.\n\nInitial issues of this series reintroduced the characters, and provided new and divergent origins for them. Most characters resemble their previous counterparts in costume and powers, with the most notable exceptions including Chameleon Boy, now called simply Chameleon and depicted as an androgynous creature; Star Boy, who in this version of the Legion is black; Colossal Boy, who is now a giant who shrinks to human size; and Phantom Girl, who exists in two universes at once and has conversations with people in her own dimension while talking to Legionnaires at the same time.\n\nThe future universe of this Legion is an emotionally and mentally repressive society which involves human sexuality and contact being kept at arms' length as well as Orwellian surveillance of minors. The Legion's main goal is social reform as well as protecting people and inspiring them with the legends of superheroes of old, even though the team isn't appreciated by government authorities.\n\nThe Legion is worshiped by thousands of young people on different worlds, collectively known as the \"Legionnaires\", who follow the group in a cult-like manner. The Legionnaires based on Earth keep a constant vigil outside Legion headquarters.\n\nBeginning with issue #16, \"The Legion of Super-Heroes\" (vol. 5) was retitled \"Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" with Supergirl traveling to the future and joining the Legion. With issue #31, Tony Bedard replaced Waid as writer. The title reverted to \"The Legion of Super-Heroes\" with issue #37 and Jim Shooter became the writer. The series ended with issue #50, in which the script was credited to \"Justin Thyme\", a pseudonym previously used by uncredited comic book artists.\n\nThe \"Lightning Saga\" crossover in \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 2) #8–10 and \"Justice Society of America\" (vol. 3) #5–6 featured the return of the original versions of Star Boy (now called Starman), Dream Girl, Wildfire, Karate Kid, Timber Wolf, Sensor Girl, Dawnstar, and Brainiac 5. Though several differences between the original and \"Lightning Saga\" Legions exist, Geoff Johns stated that this incarnation of the Legion shares the same history as the original Legion up to the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", with Clark Kent having joined the team as the teenage Superboy prior to the start of his career as Superman.\n\nThis version of the Legion next appeared in the \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" storyline in \"Action Comics\" #858–863. In the year 3008, the Earth's sun has turned red and several failed Legion applicants who were born on Earth have banded together to form the Justice League of Earth under the leadership of Earth-Man after he claims that Superman was a human who gained his powers from \"Mother Earth\". Earth-Man uses the claim to have Earth secede from the United Planets and ban all aliens from Earth, resulting in several Legionnaires going underground. With the help of Superman, the Legion eventually restores the sun to its normal state, and defeats Earth-Man and the Justice League of Earth just as the United Planets is about to attack the Earth.\n\nThis version of the Legion next appeared in the 2008 \"\" limited series, written by Johns and drawn by George Pérez. The mini-series features the post-\"Infinite Crisis\" Legion and Superman teaming up with the \"Reboot\" and \"Threeboot\" incarnations of the Legion to fight Superboy-Prime, the Legion of Super-Villains, and the Time Trapper. It was revealed in the mini-series that the \"Reboot\" Legion came from Earth-247 (a metafictional homage to the Legion's first appearance in \"Adventure Comics\" #247), which was destroyed in \"Infinite Crisis\", and the \"Threeboot\" Legion came from the reconstructed Earth-Prime. Johns stated that the intent of the mini-series was to validate the existence of all three versions of the team while simultaneously restoring the pre-\"Crisis\" Legion's continuity. The incorporation of the three teams into mainstream DC continuity was shown in \"Action Comics\" #864 (June 2008). In the story, Batman recounts the Justice League of America and Justice Society of America's battle alongside the original Legion to defeat Mordru, the \"Reboot\" team's assistance in destroying a Sun-Eater in the 20th century, and his own recent encounter with the \"Threeboot\" team.\n\nThis version of the Legion was featured in the second \"Adventure Comics\" series from September 2009 to October 2011, with the feature focusing on the Legion Academy from April 2011 onwards. This Legion played a part in the \"\" storyline in 2010, where the ongoing continual events of \"The Lightning Saga\" concluded in its entirety. A new \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" ongoing series was published from May 2010 to August 2011, written by Paul Levitz and drawn by Yildiray Cinar, featuring the Retroboot version of the team.\n\n\"Legion of Super-Heroes\" was relaunched in September 2011 with issue #1. Simultaneously, DC Comics cancelled \"Adventure Comics\" and replaced it with a new volume of \"Legion Lost\". While \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" continued the adventures of the team from that title's previous volume, \"Legion Lost\" featured Wildfire, Dawnstar, Timber Wolf, Tyroc, Tellus, Gates and Chameleon Girl. The Legion Lost characters are stranded on 21st century Earth during a mission to save the future, and they are forced to remain there after contracting a pathogen that could destroy the 31st century if they returned. The \"Legion Lost\" series ended with the time-lost Legionnaires still stranded in the 21st century.\n\nThis era of the Legion's publication concluded with issue #23 in August 2013, with the title's cancellation. In the final issue, the United Planets disbanded the Legion after a cataclysmic battle with the Fatal Five, and the individual Legionnaires retired to their homeworlds or the Science Police. The entire Legion was remobilized to battle Infinitus in the six-issue \"Infinitus Saga\" in \"Justice League United,\" written by Jeff Lemire (December 2014 – May 2015). The \"Infinitus Saga\" featured Brainiac 5 as leader, the return of the \"Legion Lost\" team to active Legion status and the inclusion of a number of Legionnaires from other continuities in the Legion's active ranks.\n\nAlternative versions of the Legion of Super-Heroes have appeared in various DC comic books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "272479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272479", "title": "Low-power broadcasting", "text": "Low-power broadcasting\n\nLow-power broadcasting refers to a broadcast station operating at a low electrical power to a smaller service area than \"full power\" stations within the same region, but often distinguished from \"micropower broadcasting\" (more commonly \"microbroadcasting\") and broadcast translators. LPAM, LPFM and LPTV are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the laws and their enforcement.\nRadio communications in Canada are regulated by the Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, a branch of Industry Canada, in conjunction with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Interested parties must apply for both a certificate from Industry Canada and a license from CRTC in order to operate a radio station. Industry Canada manages the technicalities of spectrum space and technological requirements whereas content regulation is conducted more so by CRTC.\n\nLPFM is broken up into two classes in Canada, Low (50 watts) and Very Low (10 watts). The transmitters therefore range from 1 to 50 watts, as opposed to 1 to 100 watts in the U.S. , 500 licenses (very low and low-power FM) have been issued. These transmitters are generally only allowed in remote areas.\n\nStations in the low-power class are subject to the same CRTC licensing requirements, and will generally follow the same call sign format, as full-power stations. Stations in the very low-power class formerly had to have CRTC licenses as well, although a series of CRTC regulation changes in the early 2000s exempted most such stations from licensing; a station in this class will usually not have a conventional call sign, but will instead be identified in a naming format consisting of a four-digit number preceded by the letters CH for a television station or VF for a radio station.\n\nThe regulation of spectrum space is strict in Canada, as well having restrictions on second and third adjacent channels, along with other protections for AM and FM commercial radio. In addition, because there have been a few cases that found that FM frequencies have caused interference to the aeronautical navigation and communications (NAV/COM) spectrum (though evidence is not very concrete presently), pirate radio regulation has remained very strict as well. However, the two regulating bodies do have certain exemptions. For example, low-power announcement transmitters that meet the requirement of Broadcasting Equipment Technical Standards 1, Limited Duration Special Events Distribution Undertakings, Temporary Resource Development Distribution Undertakings, and Public Emergency Radio Undertakings are a few instances, which according to certain criteria, may be exempt from certificate/license requirements.\n\nIn Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which a television transmitter is broadcasting at low power. Industry Canada, in most cases, considers a television transmitter to be low-power if the noise-limited bounding contours are less than 20 km from the antenna.\n\nIn New Zealand residents are allowed to broadcast licence free-of-charge at a maximum of 1 watt EIRP in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7 MHz under a General User Radio License (GURL), which is issued by Radio Spectrum Management, managed by the Ministry of Economic Development. Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500 mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour.\n\nFurther restrictions are in place for the protection of aeronautical services. Use of the following frequencies is not permitted within certain boundaries approaching Auckland and Wellington airports: 107.5 to 107.7 FM and 107.0 to 107.3, respectively.\n\nThere exists a 25 km broadcast translator rule: one licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25 km away from at least one of the first two transmitters.\n\nThere are efforts on self-regulation of the broadcasters themselves. The NZRSM Radio Inspectors do, however, regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection.\n\nTemporary low-power stations are allowed at times via a Restricted Service Licence. Since 2001, long-term LPFM licences have been available in remote areas of the country. These are currently used for many establishments, including military bases, universities and hospitals with fixed boundaries.\n\nLow Power FM (LPFM) is a non-commercial educational broadcast service. LPFM licenses may be issued to non-commercial educational entities, and public safety and transportation organizations. Individuals and holders of other types of broadcast licenses are not eligible to hold an LPFM license.\n\n\nIn addition, Class D educational licenses exist for stations of 10 watts transmitter power output (TPO) or less, regardless of ERP. These stations are all grandfathered operations, as no new licenses of this type have been issued since 1978, except in Alaska. They are not considered to be LPFM stations, although they operate noncommercially and have similar coverage areas to Class L2 stations.\n\nIn January 2000, the Federal Communications Commission established Low Power FM (LPFM) as a new designated class of radio station. These stations were allowed to operate at 1–10 or 50–100 watts of power, compared to the minimum requirement for commercial stations at 100 watts. (). Originally, it was supported by activists and groups and figures associated with American progressivism; music artists (such as Bonnie Raitt); religious leaders/churches (such as the United Church of Christ); and educators (for example, American Library Association, the Communication Workers of America labor union, the National League of Cities.\n\nThe original purpose of LPFM was to serve as an alternative to \"radio homogenization\", as described in the \"J&MC Quarterly Journal\", as \"... Necessary to offset the growing consolidation of station ownership in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed caps on radio ownership, as well as the decline of locally produced radio programming.\" The main opposition to LPFMs came from the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), which opposed the act on grounds to \"maintain spectrum integrity\" for commercial broadcasting, according to NAB President Edward O. Fritts.\n\nPressure from the National Association of Broadcasters urged Congress to slip the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 into a general spending bill that circulated through Congress. President Bill Clinton signed the bill in December 2000, albeit reluctantly. The actual bill that went through Congress was meant to tighten standards for LPFM stations, in an effort to make it harder for stations to be approved in order to protect full-power FM stations had these provisions:\n\nThis act basically shifted policy making from the FCC to Congress, which was considered an insult against the FCC. (Stavisky, Alan G., Robert K. Avery, and Helena Vanhala. \"From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio.\" Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 78 (2001): 340–54.)\n\nThe Local Community Radio Act of 2005 was introduced by Senators John McCain, Maria Cantwell and Patrick Leahy. After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning the MITRE Report to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full-power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and would not have a significant effect on other stations. According to Sen. Leahy, \"This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind.\"\n\nSponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressmen Mike Doyle and Lee Terry and in the United States Senate by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007. Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as \"Never Passed\".\n\nThis bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It would have required the FCC to alter current rules in order to get rid of the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent channel stations. Previously, there was a minimum distance requirement; however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.\n\nThe Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also would have required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a radio reading service (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired). This protection will ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.\n\nThe final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make sure that these licenses are also available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions are made with regard to local community needs. The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership. It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.\n\nThe Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon the legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011 as , after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski said, \"Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country.\" The Act states that the Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, should ensure that licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.\n\nIn general, the FCC was to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations; and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.\n\n\nA \"New York Times\" article focusing on a LPFM station called KOCZ highlights a number of key arguments for LPFM:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton is a known advocate of LPFM saying it is \"giving voice to the voiceless\", including schools, community groups, churches, and ethnic groups.\n\nBrown Paper Tickets CEO Steve Butcher supports LPFM, stating in a letter to the FCC, \"We hear from event producers frequently who can't afford radio ad buys on commercial stations. These local entrepreneurs can afford underwriting on smaller stations that can help build awareness about their events.\"\n\nLPFM stations are considered to be affordable compared to an average FM station, whose operating costs can run up to a million dollars, and could only afforded by businesses and the very wealthy. An antenna and transmitter can cost between $2,000 and $5,000.\n\n\nUnlike the former FM class D license, an LPFM station has no priority over broadcast translators in the allocation of available spectrum. This is problematic insofar as the regulations for broadcast translators exempts non-commercial stations from the requirement that translators be within the coverage area of the original station that they rebroadcast. However, this provision only affects translators in the non-commercial portion of the band. Stations in the commercial part of the spectrum must be fed over the air unless they are within the actual service area of the primary station. Since the translator window of 2003 was only open for commercial channels, the use of directly-fed via satellite FM translators, commonly called \"Satellators\", was never a factor in the 2003 window.\n\nThe FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed, most of them coming from a few religious broadcasters. However even though all translators on commercial frequencies must be fed by a direct, over-the-air source, regardless of who owns the translator per FCC rule 74.1231(b), the actual over-the-air source (the primary station) can be satellite fed, just as commercial stations can be fed by satellite. This leads to programming from a single station (retransmitted by many others) ending up on several hundred different translators. One station cannot apply for hundreds or thousands of translators nationwide, using automated means to generate license applications for all available channels, unless all of their applications are exclusively on the non-commercial part of the broadcast band (88–91.9 MHz). () As with any new service that shares the FM spectrum, when translators are added to an area, they can reduce or eliminate the availability of channels both for new LPFM applicants and for relocation of any existing LPFM stations displaced by full-service broadcasters. Unlike an LPFM station, a translator is not required to (and legally not authorized to) originate any local content except as permitted by . Thus there is competition for spectrum in some locations between the LPFM service and the FM translator service.\n\nIn May 2018, several groups supporting community-based low-power FM stations filed objections with the FCC, citing the Local Community Radio Act, accusing it of favoring existing station coverage expansion with translator licenses - \"a spectrum grab\" - over new LPFM spectrum licenses.\n\nThe acronym 'LPAM' is not a legal term in the United States and is only used in this article as a (conventional) abbreviation. Unlike LPFM stations, which have legal and regulatory status, FCC rules do not define \"LPAM\" nor issue licenses for low-power AM transmission. LPAM is only an acronym applied to licensed low-power AM operations and to Part 15 transmissions as well.\n\nAny \"low power AM\" in FCC licensing for stations in the United States is the requirement for higher-power licensed AM stations to reduce their transmit power at nighttime or post-sunset / pre-sunrise as part of their FCC broadcast authorization. There is a category \"Class D\" for AM broadcast licenses, which limited stations to daytime-only transmission before regulations changed in the 1980s. Many, but not all, Class D stations have been granted authority to broadcast at night with enough power to be heard within a few miles of their transmitters.\n\nOther LPAM operations are known as Travelers' Information Stations (TIS), sometimes also called highway advisory radio (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as national parks. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations.\n\nMusic is not allowed on TIS/HAR stations and they are restricted to only 3 kHz wide, \"low-fidelity audio\" as well, compared to the 10 kHz audio for standard AM broadcasters and 15 kHz audio permitted on FM stations. (Modern AM stations in the US actually restrict their audio to 5 kHz down to 2.5 kHz - roughly the same as to TIS stations. TIS transmissions are normally authorized for 10 Watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60 Watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680 kHz at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport have the highest licensed power among full-time TIS stations.\n\nThere are more than 2,450 licensed low-power television (LPTV) stations in the U.S., which are located in markets of all sizes, from New York City (five stations, though more exist in the market from other cities of license) down to Junction City, Kansas (two stations).\n\nLPTV (-LP) and LPTV Digital (-LD) are common in the U.S., Canada and most of the Americas, where most stations originate their own programming. Stations that do not originate their own programming are designated as translators (-TX). The Community Broadcasters Act of 1998 directed the FCC to create a classification of LPTV licenses called Class A (-CA). Digital low-power and Class-A television stations have an ERP limit of 3,000 watts (3 kW) for VHF, and 15 kilowatts for UHF.\n\nThe LPTV service is considered a secondary service by the FCC, which means the licensee is not guaranteed protection from interference or displacement. An LPTV station must accept harmful interference from full-service television stations and may not cause harmful interference to any full-service television station (the FCC defines interference levels deemed to be \"harmful\"). The problem with potential displacement was made evident during the transition of broadcasting in the United States from analog to digital. All television stations operating on UHF channels 52 and above were required to move to channel 51 or below. Full-service stations were guaranteed a place to land in the new compressed band while LPTV stations operating on channels 52 and above were required to either find their own channel or lose their license.\n\nThe FCC provided a one-time filing opportunity for existing LPTV stations to become Class A stations. The designation was only available to LPTV stations that were producing two hours per week of local programming. Class A stations had to maintain a production studio within their Grade B contour, and comply with many of the requirements placed on full-service television stations. This allowed them to obtain protected channel status.\n\nOne of the key distinctions between full-service television stations and low-power stations is cable television and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) carriage. Full-service stations are guaranteed carriage in their local television market through \"must-carry\" whereas LPTV stations are not. In 2008, there was an effort put forward by FCC chairman Kevin Martin to grant must-carry rights to Class A LPTV stations. The effort failed due to a lack of support from the other FCC Commissioners.\n\nThough many low-power television stations are either unaffiliated, or broadcast programming from small networks meant for their use, some LPTV stations are affiliated with major broadcast networks like Fox, The CW or MyNetworkTV. Examples include in Boston, Massachusetts with NBC on WBTS-LD, Youngstown, Ohio, where a pair of LPTV stations based at WYFX-LD broadcast Fox programming, along with the digital subchannel of the co-owned CBS affiliate, WKBN-TV, or in the Lima, Ohio area, whose low-power stations are affiliates of major networks, such as CBS and ABC.\n\nOn July 15, 2011, the FCC issued an order to low-power broadcasters that effectively requires all remaining television transmitters to vacate channels 52 to 69 by December 31, 2011. In that same order, the FCC effectively required all remaining analog transmitters to have shut down by March 29, 2016.\n\nUnlike AM and FM, unlicensed use of television bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The amateur television channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some repeaters airing NASA TV during Space Shuttle missions when they are not in local use.\n\nThe low-power television industry was represented by the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), which held its annual convention each year in October and an annual meeting each year in April at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention in Las Vegas. The meeting was always held on the Monday night of the NAB convention in Ballroom B of the Las Vegas Hilton and was open to anyone interested in the low-power television industry. On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the \"restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential\". Another was the inability to reach most viewers, partly due to Multichannel Video Programming Distributors refusing to carry these channels. In addition, Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, \"some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition.\"\n\nIn February 2006, the FCC released its Notices of Proposed Rules for Digital Radio. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to provide broadcasters with the opportunity to take advantage of digital audio broadcasting (DAB) technology, proposed criteria for evaluating models and systems, such as the In Band On Channel (IBOC) system, and inquired on the needs for a mandatory DAB transmission standard.\n\nIn section 39 of the Notice, the FCC inquires as how to balance incentives for broadcasters to switch to digital systems with incumbents of new entrance opportunities, stating that they “seek analyses of the minimum power levels that would preserve service within protected service areas in an all-digital environment, and alternatively, the levels that would not result in significant disruptions to current listening patterns.”\n\nThe DAB system that has been identified as the best fit for LPFM is IBOC system. This is a hybrid system that uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the digital carriers require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. Currently, imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "631061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=631061", "title": "Minstrel", "text": "Minstrel\n\nA minstrel was a medieval European entertainer. Originally describing any type of entertainer such as a musician, juggler, acrobat, singer or fool, the term later, from the sixteenth century, came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments.\n\nMinstrels performed songs which told stories of distant places or of existing or imaginary historical events. Although minstrels created their own tales, often they would memorize and embellish the works of others. Frequently they were retained by royalty and high society. As the courts became more sophisticated, minstrels were eventually replaced at court by the troubadours, and many became wandering minstrels, performing in the streets; a decline in their popularity began in the late 15th century. Minstrels fed into later traditions of travelling entertainers, which continued to be moderately strong into the early 20th century, and which has some continuity in the form of today's buskers or street musicians. \n\nInitially, minstrels were simply treats at court, and entertained the lord and courtiers with \"chansons de geste\" or their local equivalent. The term \"minstrel\" derives from Old French \"ménestrel\" (also \"menesterel, menestral\"), which is a derivative from Italian \"ministrello\" (later \"menestrello\"), from Middle Latin \"ministralis\" \"retainer\", an adjective form of Latin \"minister\", \"attendant\" from \"minus\", \"lesser\".\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest, the professional poet was known as a \"scop\" (\"shaper\" or \"maker\"), who composed his own poems, and sang them to the accompaniment of a harp. In a rank much beneath the \"scop\" were the \"gleemen\", who had no settled abode, but roamed about from place to place, earning what they could from their performances. Late in the 13th century, the term \"minstrel\" began to be used to designate a performer who amused his lord with music and song. Following a series of invasions, wars, conquests, etc., two categories of composers developed. Poets like Chaucer and John Gower appeared in one category, wherein music was not a part. Minstrels, on the other hand, gathered at feasts and festivals in great numbers with harps, fiddles, bagpipes, flutes, flageolets, citterns, and kettledrums. Additionally, minstrels were known for their involvement in political commentary and engaged in propaganda. They often reported news with bias to sway opinion and revised works to encourage action in favor of equality.\n\nThe music of the troubadours and trouvères was performed by minstrels called \"joglars\" (Occitan) or \"jongleurs\" (French). As early as 1321, the minstrels of Paris were formed into a guild. A guild of royal minstrels was organized in England in 1469. Minstrels were required to either join the guild or abstain from practicing their craft. Some minstrels were retained by lords as jesters who, in some cases, also practiced the art of juggling. Some were women, or women who followed minstrels in their travels. Minstrels throughout Europe also employed trained animals, such as bears. Minstrels in Europe died out slowly, having gone nearly extinct by about 1700, although isolated individuals working in the tradition existed even into the early 19th century.\n\nMinstrelsy became a central concern in English literature in the Romantic period and has remained so intermittently.\n\nIn poetry, \"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\" (1805) by Sir Walter Scott, \"Lalla Rookh\" (1817) by Thomas Moore, and \"The Village Minstrel\" (1821) by John Clare were three of many. Novels centring on minstrelsy have included Helen Craik's \"Henry of Northumberland\" (1800), Sydney Owenson's \"The Novice of St. Dominick's\" (a girl using a minstrel disguise, 1805), Christabel Rose Coleridge's \"Minstrel Dick\" (a choirboy turned minstrel becomes a courtier, 1891), Rhoda Power's \"Redcap Runs Away\" (a boy of ten joins wandering minstrels, 1952), and A. J. Cronin's \"The Minstrel Boy\" (priesthood to minstrelsy and back, 1975).\n\n\n"}

Nightlife entertainment is often more adult-oriented than daytime entertainment. People who prefer to be active during the night-time are called night owls.\n\nNightlife has been a vibrant area of research for sociologists. Nightlife establishments including pubs, bars, and nightclubs function as third places, according to Ray Oldenburg in \"The Great Good Place\".\n\nSome sociologists have argued that vibrant city nightlife scenes contribute to the development of culture as well as political movements. David Grazian cites as examples the development of beat poetry, musical styles including bebop, urban blues and early rock, and the importance of nightlife for the development of the gay rights movement in the United States kicked off by the riots at the Stonewall Inn nightclub.\n\nThere is debate about the degree to which nightlife contributes positively to social capital and the public goods of society.

Analysts attributed the change of name partly to the imminent loss of the town of Dabiq to a Turkish-led military offensive, which occurred in October 2016.\n\nThe name \"Rumiyah\" (Rome) is a reference to a hadith in which Muhammed said that Muslims would conquer both Constantinople and Rome in that order.\n\nLike \"Dabiq\", each issue opens with a quote attributed to Abu Hamza al Muhajir: \"O muwahhidin, rejoice, for by Allah, we will not rest from our jihad except beneath the olive trees of Rumiyah (Rome).\"\n\nThe first issue was released after the death of ISIL's spokesman, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who was featured heavily in the magazine.

Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and surrealistically is a form of bathos. In general, self-referential humor often uses hypocrisy, oxymoron, or paradox to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience. \n\nSelf-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the fourth wall to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.\n\nOld Comedy of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. Aristophanes, whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.\n\nRAS syndrome refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. However, \"RAS\" stands for Redundant Acronym Syndrome; therefore, the full phrase yields \"Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome\" and is self-referencing in a comical manner. It also reflects an excessive use of TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms).\n\nMeta has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential.

{"id": "356311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356311", "title": "Soarin'", "text": "Soarin'\n\nSoarin, also known as Soarin' Around the World and Soaring Over the Horizon, is a flight motion simulator attraction at Disney California Adventure, Epcot, and Shanghai Disneyland. The ride employs a mechanical lift system, a \nprojected presentation on an concave 180-degree dome screen, artificial scents and wind to simulate a hang gliding flight over several locations across six continents around the world.\n\nThe original iteration of the attraction, known as Soarin Over California, was an opening day attraction at Disney California Adventure on February 8, 2001. The initial version took guests over several locations in California, and included a pre-show tribute to the history of California's aviation industry. Due to its consistent popularity, \"Soarin Over California\" was duplicated at Epcot in Walt Disney World as \"Soarin\" in 2005.\n\nThe current global version of the ride debuted at Shanghai Disneyland Park as \"Soaring Over the Horizon\" on June 16, 2016. Concurrently, the American versions were also replaced with the new film as \"Soarin Around the World\" on the next day, June 17. A fourth attraction was announced in 2016 for Tokyo DisneySea, and is expected to open in 2019.\n\n\"Soarin\" was first conceptualized in 1996 as \"Ultra Flight,\" a name which can still be seen on the tower consoles of the California Adventure attraction. It was to feature an OMNIMAX screen with an inverted track allowing guests to fly over California's landmarks. The attraction would have three load levels and the system would operate on a horizontal cable, much like a dry cleaner's rack. This plan was abandoned, however, when it was determined that the construction and labor costs for that design would be prohibitive. It seemed that \"Soarin\" wouldn't become a reality until engineer Mark Sumner developed a different idea for the ride vehicles, using an Erector Set and string to create a working model. This design would allow Disney to efficiently load guests on one level instead of three, thus cutting construction and labor costs greatly.\n\nEach ride vehicle consists of three rows of seats under a wing-like canopy, and has a capacity of 87 guests at a time. After guests have been safely restrained in the vehicle using standard lap belts, the canopy descends slightly and a cantilever system lifts the chairs forward and into the air with the guests' feet dangling freely. The vehicle is lifted forward so that guests look into a large, concave movie screen onto which aerial views are projected. The scenes for the original film were shot with an IMAX HD frame rate - 48 frames per second, twice the conventional output for regular films. Since the vehicle is moved forward toward the center of the dome, guests can only see the images projected on the screen and experience the sensation of flight. The ride structure contains about one million pounds (454,000 kg) of steel, and 37 tons (33.5 metric tonnes) are lifted during each ride cycle.\n\nTo enhance the illusion of flight, subtle vertical movements of the seats are synchronized to the film. Sensations of horizontal motion are created using a combination of vertical carriage movement and turning the image on the screen. In addition, scents complementing the various scenes are injected into the air streams blowing on riders. These scents now include rose blossoms in the Taj Mahal scene, the aroma of grass in the Africa scene, and a sea breeze scent in the South Pacific scene in the updated show.\n\n\"Soarin Around the World\" is located in the Grizzly Peak Airfield section of Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort. It is one of the most popular attractions in the resort and usually has wait times ranging from 30 to 150 minutes. However, the attraction is tied into the park's FASTPASS system, allowing guests the option of bypassing a long wait.\n\nWhile waiting in line, guests pass the Wings of Fame, an homage to significant aircraft in the history of aviation in California. Some of these include the P-51 Mustang, SR-71 Blackbird, and the Bell X-1. There is also a section dedicated to individuals such as John J. Montgomery, Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Doolittle, Charles Lindbergh, Jack Northrop, the Wright brothers, Howard Hughes, Jacqueline Cochran, Kelly Johnson, Paul MacCready, and Chuck Yeager. Inspirational music from a variety of films, many of them war- or flight-themed, is played in the queue hallways. Some film scores featured include \"Patton\", \"MacArthur\", \"Air Force One\", \"The Blue Max\", \"Explorers\", (all by Jerry Goldsmith), \"The American President\" (by Marc Shaiman), \"DragonHeart\", \"\" (both by Randy Edelman), \"The Last Starfighter\" (by Craig Safan), \"Apollo 13\" and \"The Rocketeer\" (both by James Horner), \"Always\" (by John Williams) and the HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\" (by Michael Kamen). \"The Air Force Song\" and \"Jupiter\" from Gustav Holst's orchestral suite \"The Planets\" are also included, based on their use in \"The Right Stuff\".\n\nBefore entering the theater area, guests are placed in one of three preshow areas, called \"Alpha Gate\", \"Bravo Gate\", or \"Charlie Gate,\" (named for the first three letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet). Just before boarding, guests watch a pre-boarding video hosted by their chief flight attendant, Patrick, portrayed by actor Patrick Warburton.\n\nThe attraction opened in 2001 as \"Soarin Over California\" in what was then the Condor Flats area of the park. In early 2015, the attraction closed for refurbishment as the surrounding area was transformed into Grizzly Peak Airfield. It reopened on May 15, 2015, with new exterior theming and with updates to its screen and projection system. The attraction now features the a Laser Illuminated digital projection array which replaces the original Imax systems. In addition to the projection system changes, several exterior changes occurred, including a replacement of the mock-up RS-25 rocket engine with a fire lookout tower.\n\nFrom January to March 2016, the attraction operated as \"Soarin Over California\" intermittently in order to prepare for the introduction of the \"Soarin Around the World\" ride film. The original film was shown until June 15, with the attraction being closed on June 16 to prepare for the new film debuting on June 17, 2016.\n\nThe attraction was duplicated, simply as \"Soarin\", and officially opened inside \"The Land\" pavilion at Epcot in Walt Disney World on May 5, 2005. Unlike the Disney California Adventure version, the idea is that guests are taking flights \"to\" California, rather than already being there. This is further reinforced in the theming that you are loaded into \"gates\" and with airport-themed spiels which reference \"Flight 5505\", which is a homage to the opening day of the attraction. Its cast members wear costumes that resemble flight attendant costumes, whereas the California version uses airfield crew costumes.\n\nThe Epcot standby queue originally featured pictures of natural wonders from around the world, not just California. There was very little reference to the fact that the ride only featured California at the time. The queue currently utilizes a new infrared technology that allows guests to participate in interactive games. In 2009, this interactive game technology appeared in the Magic Kingdom as part of a seven-month overhaul of Space Mountain.\n\nThe attraction closed for refurbishment on January 4, 2016, originally slated to reopen on June 17, with a third theater to coincide with the release of the new \"Soarin Around the World\" film. The ride reopened with the original film on May 27, with the change to the new film occurring on June 17, 2016.\n\nThe attraction was retooled as \"Soaring Over the Horizon\" for Shanghai Disneyland Park. The attraction was not part of the park's original design plans, and was added only after Walt Disney Imagineering began development on it for the American parks. Located in the Adventure Isle section, the ride opened with the park on June 16, 2016.\n\nEmbedded into the Adventure Isle setting, the attraction is depicted here as an ancient observatory and temple to the Arbori tribe's Condor god. The preshow and safety spiel is hosted by a shaman of the tribe who grants you the ability of flight, but has trouble controlling her own shapeshifting abilities. \n\nOn April 27, 2016, officials with Tokyo Disney Resort announced a number of new attractions for both Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea parks in the coming years. Included in the announcement was a proposed version of \"Soarin\" to be located in the Mediterranean Harbor section of Tokyo DisneySea. The announcement revealed that this version will have a different theme, with the ride vehicles resembling Renaissance-era flying machines envisioned by Leonardo da Vinci, and that it was planned to open during the 2019 fiscal year for the resort.\n\nThe original ride film, which lasted about four minutes and 51 seconds, took guests on a simulated hang glider tour of California. Appropriate scents (citrus, pine, sagebrush, ocean mist) filled the air as the ride vehicles themselves moved gently to simulate the sensations of flight. In addition to the state's various landscapes, the ride also highlighted its diverse recreation, including snow skiing, river rafting, kayaking, golf, horseback riding, hot air ballooning, surfing and of course, hang gliding. The locations visited were: \n\nThe original \"Soarin Over California\" ride film at both Disney California Adventure and Epcot used an orchestral score by composer Jerry Goldsmith, who is said to have come down from his first ride in tears. In addition to finding the ride visually beautiful and magical, he said that his father was a pilot who loved all things Californian. \"I'd do anything to be part of this project,\" Goldsmith said. \"I'd even score the film for free.\" The soundtrack he wrote played throughout the entire attraction, starting with a crescendo in the low strings while the screen was still dark. Numerous variations of a serene theme for horn and strings could be heard, as well as several statements of a fanfare that accompanied the film's grandest vistas. The entire original ride score can be found on recent Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World official albums, including \"\". The original score also continues to be played as part of a loop in the Disneyland Resort Esplanade and Epcot's entrance plaza.\n\nAn updated version of the \"Soarin\" attraction debuted at the Adventure Isle section of Shanghai Disneyland Park as \"Soaring Over the Horizon\", on June 16, 2016. On August 15, 2015 at the D23 Expo, it was announced that the attractions at Epcot and Disney California Adventure would debut versions of the new \"Soaring Over the Horizon\" ride film, titled \"Soarin Around the World\". This new ride film features locations, landscapes, and landmarks across six continents of the world. Unlike the original ride film, the updated version heavily features computer generated imagery. This includes animated transitions between scenes, such as close encounters with a seaplane, a kite, and an eagle. The updated attractions opened on June 17, 2016 at Disney California Adventure and Epcot, along with a third theater for the latter location. The locations visited are:\n\n\"Soarin Around the World\" and \"Soaring Over the Horizon\", received a new score, composed by Bruce Broughton, which was heavily based on Goldsmith's original score. The new score was performed by the London Studio Orchestra.\n\n\n\n"}

Some popular sports in Indonesia are badminton, football, and the native Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat. Badminton is arguably Indonesia's most successful sport. Indonesia has won gold medals in badminton in every Olympic Games since the sport was first introduced to the Olympics in 1992 except in 2012 Summer Olympics. Indonesia is regularly a participating in Thomas Cup, Uber Cup, and Sudirman Cup Badminton championships. Indonesia is regularly participating in regional multi-events sport, such as Southeast Asian Games, Asian Games, and Olympic Games. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the major sport powerhouses in the region by winning the Southeast Asian Games 10 times since 1977.\n\nSporting events in Indonesia are organised by the Indonesian National Sport Committee (\"Komite Olahraga Nasional Indonesia\" or \"KONI\"). The organisation, along with the Indonesian government have set the National Sports Day on 9 September. Indonesia hosts the Pekan Olahraga Nasional multi-sport event every four years. The participants of this event is the athletes from all provinces of Indonesia with hosting tally are distributed among Indonesian provinces.\n\nIn traditional Indonesian culture, there is no actual concept for physical exercise as the counterpart of modern sport. Native Indonesians usually linked the physical activities to tribal practices; mainly for ritual, art, physical fitness and martial purposes. The war dances and ritual combat among Indonesian tribes are the earliest example of ritualised physical exercise in Indonesia. Some of native Indonesian rituals are resembling sport, such as \"lompat batu\" (leaping the stone) tradition among Nias male youth as part of coming of age ritual, that resembles hurdling and long jump in athletics. Also Madurese \"karapan sapi\" and Minang \"pacu jawi\" (bull racing) that are similar to chariot race. Dragon boat, canoe and kayak race are virtually everyday activities among Indonesians that lives on the bank of major rivers or on distant islands.\n\nIn the 9th century the images of archery, described as princely court activities among nobility in ancient Java, can be found on bas-reliefs of Javanese candis. Archery is suggested as one of Indonesia's classical sport, and one of its famous rendering came from Prambanan temple as part of Ramayana story and later rendered as one of the icon of the Jakarta's 1962 Asian Games, also as the symbol of Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.\n\nPencak Silat is the example of Indonesian native martial art that turned into competitive combat sport. Several Indonesian dances demonstrated repetitive movements that similar to physical exercise. Indonesian traditional social dances such as \"poco-poco\" dance from North Sulawesi and \"sajojo\" from Papua are adopted as \"senam kesegaran jasmani\" (musical calisthenics) today popular across Indonesia.\n\nThe modern concept of sport was introduced during colonial Dutch East Indies period. During these times football and badminton has reached Indonesia and become popular sport among Indonesian people ever since. After Indonesian independence, National Sports Committee of Indonesia was established in 1946 to unite the various satellite sports associations that was created within the regencies, then sports facilities were constructed in Indonesia, such as Ikada Stadium (1951—1962). During Sukarno reign, there is a desire to utilise sport as the means for uniting Indonesian people, establishing national pride as well as promoting sports in Indonesia. As the result the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium surrounded by sporting complex facilities were constructed in 1962 to host the fourth Asian Games held in Jakarta. Today in international stage, Indonesia is successful in badminton and also has been one of the major multi-event sports powerhouse in Southeast Asia.\n\nMany sports were imported, some were developed from native Indonesian traditional sports and became popular in Indonesia.\n\nFootball has become the most popular sports in Indonesia since the country's independence, even though it had virtually no presence in the country before then. in Indonesia, this phenomenon is most often ascribed to general worldwide popularity of the sport, which carried over into Indonesia following its rapid urbanization.

A sequel to the off-Broadway production \"The Boys in the Band\", \"The Men From The Boys\" takes place in a New York City apartment, where friends are in for more than they expected after a friend's memorial service.\n\nThe plot follows the characters of \"The Boys in the Band,\" revisiting them 35 years later. The group is brought back together at the funeral of Larry, who died of pancreatic cancer. They revisit the same apartment in Manhattan as the first play, and again begin talking and arguing. The dialog and story is relayed in \"real time.\" New characters include Scott, a younger man dating Michael, who is poorly received by the group. Michael angrily defends Scott, and yells at the new character Jason, a \"strident young activist\" who had been romantically involved with Larry. Emory and Harold get involved in the arguments, while non-combative characters include Donald, Bernard, and Rick, a male nurse who had been harboring feelings for Larry. Among other details, three of the characters have joined Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nThe play was written by Mart Crowley, famous for writing \"The Boys in the Band\", which was groundbreaking for its frank portrayal of gay perspectives and lives in a repressive time, prior to the cultural acceptance of gay rights later in the 1960s. Crowley stated that he had always declined recommendations to write a sequel, until he felt enough time passed where he knew what had likely happened to the characters. It was his first play since \"Avec Schmaltz\" in 1984. The original score was composed by Larry Grossman, known for \"A Doll's Life\".\n\nIts world premiere was on October 26, 2002 at San Francisco's New Conservatory Theater Center, under artistic direction by Ed Decker. It was billed as a \"sequel play.\" Actors included: \n\nOpening officially for review on November 9, 2002, it was presented in two acts with a running time of two hours and twenty minutes. Rick Sinkkonen and Sarah Ellen Joynt handled set. It ran until December 8.\n\nAbout the 2002 premiere, \"Variety\" noted that a \"lack of significant change\" in the characters' demeanor was one of several major problems in the play, wondering why Michael, Harold, Emory, and the other character had remained friends despite their years of backstabbing. Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" complained that the characters seemed to have \"resisted 35 years of social potential personal change,\" and that they remained single, \"predatory,\" and ill-suited for long-term relationships. It also criticized what it perceived as the use of characters as \"authorial mouthpieces\" for outdated and racist sentiments.

It became the replacement in the professional video and broadcast television industries for the then-incumbent 2 inch quadruplex videotape (2 inch Quad for short) open-reel format, due to the smaller size, comparative ease of operation (vs. 2 inch) and slightly higher video quality of 1 inch type C video tape recorder (VTR). 1 inch type C required less maintenance downtime than quadruplex videotape, and did not require time base correction to produce a stable video signal.\n\n1 inch Type C is capable of \"trick-play\" functions such as still, shuttle, and variable-speed playback, including slow motion. 2 inch quadruplex videotape machines lacked these capabilities, due to the segmented manner in which it recorded video tracks onto the magnetic tape. Also, 1 inch Type C VTRs required much less maintenance (and used less power and space) than did 2 inch machines.\n\n1 inch Type C records composite video at a very high video quality that is superior to contemporary color-under formats such as U-matic, and of comparable quality to analog component video formats like Betacam and MII. Both analog component formats were notoriously fussy and trouble-prone, so in practice Type C gave a stable, more reliable picture than the broadcast quality analog cassette-based videotape formats. Because television was broadcast as a composite signal, there was no real downside to Type C in television broadcasting and distribution.\n\n1 inch tape gained numerous uses in television production including outside broadcasts where it was used for instant replays and creating programme titles. 1 inch machines were considerable smaller and more reliable than preceding two inch versions and were seen by operators as a major technological breakthrough. Due to this smaller size, it was possible for OB crews to transport and use multiple machines, allowing for much more complex editing to be done on site for use within the programme.. The quality and reliability of 1 inch Type C made it a mainstay in television and video production in television studios for almost 20 years, before being supplanted by more reliable digital videocassette formats like DVCAM, D-1, D-2, and DVCPro. 1 inch Type C was also widely used for the mastering of early LaserDisc titles.

{"id": "11713533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11713533", "title": "Vocal pedagogy", "text": "Vocal pedagogy\n\nVocal pedagogy is the study of the art and science of voice instruction. It is used in the teaching of singing and assists in defining what singing is, how singing works, and how proper singing technique is accomplished.\n\nVocal pedagogy covers a broad range of aspects of singing, ranging from the physiological process of vocal production to the artistic aspects of interpretation of songs from different genres or historical eras. Typical areas of study include:\n\nAll of these different concepts are a part of developing proper vocal technique. Not all vocal teachers have the same opinions within every topic of study which causes variations in pedagogical approaches and vocal technique.\n\nWithin Western culture, the study of vocal pedagogy began in Ancient Greece. Scholars such as Alypius and Pythagoras studied and made observations on the art of singing. It is unclear, however, whether the Greeks ever developed a systematic approach to teaching singing as little writing on the subject survives today.\n\nThe first surviving record of a systematized approach to teaching singing was developed in the medieval monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church sometime near the beginning of the 13th century. As with other fields of study, the monasteries were the center of musical intellectual life during the medieval period and many men within the monasteries devoted their time to the study of music and the art of singing. Highly influential in the development of a vocal pedagogical system were monks Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia who were the first to develop a concept of vocal registers. These men identified three registers: chest voice, throat voice, and head voice (pectoris, guttoris, and capitis). Their concept of head voice, however, is much more similar to the modern pedagogists understanding of the falsetto register. Other concepts discussed in the monastic system included vocal resonance, voice classification, breath support, diction, and tone quality to name a few. The ideas developed within the monastic system highly influenced the development of vocal pedagogy over the next several centuries including the Bel Canto style of singing.\n\nWith the onset of the Renaissance in the 15th century, the study of singing began to move outside of the church. The courts of rich patrons, such as the Dukes of Burgundy who supported the Burgundian School and the Franco-Flemish School, became secular centers of study for singing and all other areas of musical study. The vocal pedagogical methods taught in these schools, however, were based on the concepts developed within the monastic system. Many of the teachers within these schools had their initial musical training from singing in church choirs as children. The church also remained at the forefront of musical composition at this time and remained highly influential in shaping musical tastes and practices both in and outside the church. It was the Catholic Church that first popularized the use of castrato singers in the 16th century, which ultimately led to the popularity of castrato voices in Baroque and Classical operas.\n\nIt was not until the development of opera in the 17th century that vocal pedagogy began to break away from some of the established thinking of the monastic writers and develop deeper understandings of the physical process of singing and its relation to key concepts like vocal registration and vocal resonation. It was also during this time, that noted voice teachers began to emerge. Giulio Caccini is an example of an important early Italian voice teacher. In the late 17th century, the bel canto method of singing began to develop in Italy. This style of singing had a huge impact on the development of opera and the development of vocal pedagogy during the Classical and Romantic periods. It was during this time, that teachers and composers first began to identify singers by and write roles for more specific voice types. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that more clearly defined voice classification systems like the German Fach system emerged. Within these systems, more descriptive terms were used in classifying voices such as coloratura soprano and lyric soprano.\nVoice teachers in the 19th century continued to train singers for careers in opera. Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García is often considered one of the most important voice teachers of the 19th century, and is credited with the development of the laryngoscope and the beginning of modern voice pedagogy.\n\nThe field of voice pedagogy became more fully developed in the middle of the 20th century. A few American voice teachers began to study the science, anatomy, and physiology of singing, especially Ralph Appelman at Indiana University, Oren Brown at the Washington University School of Medicine and later the Juilliard School, and William Vennard at the University of Southern California. This shift in approach to the study of singing led to the rejection of many of the assertions of the bel canto singing method, most particularly in the areas of vocal registration and vocal resonation. As a result, there are currently two predominating schools of thought among voice teachers today, those who maintain the historical positions of the bel canto method and those who choose to embrace more contemporary understandings based in current knowledge of human anatomy and physiology. There are also those teachers who borrow ideas from both perspectives, creating a hybrid of the two.\n\nAppelman and Vennard were also part of a group of voice instructors who developed courses of study for beginning voice teachers, adding these scientific ideas to the standard exercises and empirical ways to improve vocal technique, and by 1980 the subject of voice pedagogy was beginning to be included in many college music degree programs for singers and vocal music educators.\n\nMore recent works by authors such as Richard Miller and Johan Sundberg have increased the general knowledge of voice teachers, and scientific and practical aspects of voice pedagogy continue to be studied and discussed by professionals. In addition, the creation of organisations such as the National Association of Teachers of Singing (now an international organization of Vocal Instructors) has enabled voice teachers to establish more of a consensus about their work, and has expanded the understanding of what singing teachers do.\n\nThere are basically three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related to how the mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach that believes that singing is largely a matter of getting the right physical parts in the right places at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought that believes that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism—that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches.\n\nThere are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: respiration, phonation, resonation, and articulation. These processes occur in the following sequence: \nAlthough these four processes are to be considered separately, in actual practice they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.\n\nIn its most basic sense, respiration is the process of moving air in and out of the body—inhalation and exhalation. Breathing for singing and speaking is a more controlled process than is the ordinary breathing used for sustaining life. The controls applied to exhalation are particularly important in good vocal technique.\n\nPhonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract. It takes place in the larynx when the vocal folds are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them in such a way that vibration ensues causing an audible source of acoustic energy, i.e., sound, which can then be modified by the articulatory actions of the rest of the vocal apparatus. The vocal folds are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the arytenoid cartilages together.\n\nVocal resonation is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.\n\nThere are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.\n\nResearch has shown that the larynx, the pharynx and the oral cavity are the main resonators of vocal sound, with the nasal cavity only coming into play in nasal consonants, or nasal vowels, such as those found in French. This main resonating space, from above the vocal folds to the lips is known as the vocal tract. Many voice users experience sensations in the sinuses that may be misconstrued as resonance. However, these sensations are caused by sympathetic vibrations, and are a result, rather than a cause, of efficient vocal resonance.\n\nArticulation is the process by which the joint product of the vibrator and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication. In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip (\"labial consonants\"), the flexible front of the tongue (\"coronal consonants\"), the middle/back of the tongue (\"dorsal consonants\"), the root of the tongue together with the epiglottis (\"pharyngeal consonants\"), and the glottis (\"glottal consonants\"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called \"coarticulation\".\n\nUnlike active articulation, passive articulation is a continuum without many clear-cut boundaries. The places linguolabial and interdental, interdental and dental, dental and alveolar, alveolar and palatal, palatal and velar, velar and uvular merge into one another, and a consonant may be pronounced somewhere between the named places.\n\nIn addition, when the front of the tongue is used, it may be the upper surface or \"blade\" of the tongue that makes contact (\"laminal consonants\"), the tip of the tongue (\"apical consonants\"), or the under surface (\"sub-apical consonants\"). These articulations also merge into one another without clear boundaries.\n\nInterpretation is sometimes listed by voice teachers as a fifth physical process even though strictly speaking it is not a physical process. The reason for this is that interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although teachers may acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it from someone else. Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly.\n\nVocal sounds are divided into two basic categories-vowels and consonants-with a wide variety of sub-classifications. Voice Teachers and serious voice students spend a great deal of time studying how the voice forms vowels and consonants, and studying the problems that certain consonants or vowels may cause while singing. The International Phonetic Alphabet is used frequently by voice teachers and their students.\n\nDescribing vocal sound is an inexact science largely because the human voice is a self-contained instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced is complicated by the vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it \"sounds\" and more on how it \"feels\". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.\n\nAnother problem in describing vocal sound lies in the vocal vocabulary itself. There are many schools of thought within vocal pedagogy and different schools have adopted different terms, sometimes from other artistic disciplines. This has led to the use of a plethora of descriptive terms applied to the voice which are not always understood to mean the same thing. Some terms sometimes used to describe a quality of a voice's sound are: warm, white, dark, light, round, reedy, spread, focused, covered, swallowed, forward, ringing, hooty, bleaty, plummy, mellow, pear-shaped, and so forth.\n\nThe singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body exist. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the body alignment of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good body alignment allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good body alignment also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Voice Instructors have also noted that when singers assume good body alignment it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good body alignment. Habitual good body alignment also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.\n\nIn the words of Robert C. White, who paraphrased a \"Credo\" for singing:\n\nIn the Beginning there was Breath, and Singing was with Breath, and Singing was Breath, and Singing \"was\" Breath. And all singing was made by the Breath, and without Breath was not any Singing made that was made. (White 1988, p. 26)\nAll singing begins with breath. All vocal sounds are created by vibrations in the larynx caused by air from the lungs. Breathing in everyday life is a subconscious bodily function which occurs naturally, however the singer must have control of the intake and exhalation of breath to achieve maximum results from their voice.\n\nNatural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing-out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing there are four stages of breathing:\nThese stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.\n\nIn European classical music and opera, voices are treated like musical instruments. Composers who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. Voice classification is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into voice types. These qualities include but are not limited to: vocal range, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. The science behind voice classification developed within European classical music and has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including: the German \"Fach\" system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.\n\nHowever, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men are usually divided into four groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. When considering children's voices, an eighth term, treble, can be applied. Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices.\n\nIt should be noted that within choral music, singers voices are divided solely on the basis of vocal range. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB). As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur. Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.\n\nWithin contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as Contemporary Commercial Music), singers are classified by the style of music they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. can be misleading or even inaccurate.\n\nMany voice teachers warn of the dangers of quick identification. Premature concern with classification can result in misclassification, with all its attendant dangers. Vennard says:\n\n\"I never feel any urgency about classifying a beginning student. So many premature diagnoses have been proved wrong, and it can be harmful to the student and embarrassing to the teacher to keep striving for an ill-chosen goal. It is best to begin in the middle part of the voice and work upward and downward until the voice classifies itself.\"\n\nMost voice teachers believe that it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice. When techniques of posture, breathing, phonation, resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop. Many acclaimed voice instructors suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The reason for this is that the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to misclassify or damage the voice.\n\nVocal registration refers to the system of vocal registers within the human voice. A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in laryngeal function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds. The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:\n\n\nIn linguistics, a register language is a language which combines tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological system.\n\nWithin speech pathology the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is also adopted by many teachers of singing.\n\nSome voice teachers, however, organize registers differently. There are over a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.\n\nIf a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, his laryngeal function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a passaggio or a ponticello. Vocal instructors teach that with study a singer can move effortlessly from one register to the other with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who like to use this theory of \"blending registers\" usually help students through the \"passage\" from one register to another by hiding their \"lift\" (where the voice changes).\n\nHowever, many voice instructors disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has effected the different views on vocal registration.\n\nSinging is an integrated and coordinated act and it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.\n\nOnce the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:\n\nSome consider that singing is not a natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others consider that some ways of singing can be considered as natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.\n\nThere are several purposes for vocal exercises, including:\n\nAn important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Voice instructors teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most voice teachers believe that the first step in coordinating these processes is by establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice first before slowly expanding the range beyond that.\n\nThere are three factors which significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:\n\nMcKinney says, \"These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.\"\n\nSome voice teachers will spend time working with their students on general music knowledge and skills, particularly music theory, music history, and musical styles and practices as it relates to the vocal literature being studied. If required they may also spend time helping their students become better sight readers, often adopting solfège, which assigns certain syllables to the notes of the scale.\n\nSince singing is a performing art, voice teachers spend some of their time preparing their students for performance. This includes teaching their students etiquette of behavior on stage such as bowing, addressing problems like stage fright or nervous tics, and the use of equipment such as microphones. Some students may also be preparing for careers in the fields of opera or musical theater where acting skills are required. Many voice instructors will spend time on acting techniques and audience communication with students in these fields of interest. Students of opera also spend a great deal of time with their voice teachers learning foreign language pronunciations.\n\n\n"}
