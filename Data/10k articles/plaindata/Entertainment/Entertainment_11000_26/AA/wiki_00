{"id": "35210892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35210892", "title": "2:22 (2017 film)", "text": "2:22 (2017 film)\n\n2:22 is an American-Australian science fiction thriller film directed by Paul Currie, written by Nathan Parker and Todd Stein, and starring Michiel Huisman, Teresa Palmer and Sam Reid. Its plot involves air traffic controller Dylan Branson, who, thanks to a mysterious outbreak at 2:22, prevented the collision of two aircraft and met Sarah, with whom he opened the cruel mystery of the crossing of destinies. The film was released in theaters and on VOD on June 30, 2017.\n\nThe film starts with Dylan Branson (Michiel Huisman) having a dream about a murder at the Grand Central Station that feels very real. He wakes with a start and progresses with his routine while watching news about a star called Hamlin that died out 30 years ago, but its light is reaching the Earth 30 years later and that this supernova will have effects on the Earth and its inhabitants. Dylan is an air traffic controller who possess a unique ability to visualize patterns.\n\nDylan is then shown on his way to work, riding a bike and heading to the Grand Central Station to take the train. He works as air traffic controller with a serious talent in visualizing patterns. After work, he goes to a club drinking with his co workers and receives a ticket to an aerial ballet as a gift for his upcoming birthday. The following day at exactly 2:22pm, his world stops after he almost causes a mid air collision of the two aircraft as he was actually attempting to avoid the mid-air collision, resulting in him being suspended from his job for nearly killing over 900 people.\n\nThe day after he was suspended, he attends the aerial ballet and meets Sarah (Teresa Palmer). They go to a restaurant and start talking, Dylan tells Sarah that his father was a pilot and that he also trained to be a pilot but could never become one as he was afraid of flying. Sarah tells him that she works at the Howard Pace Art Gallery. He also tells her about his being suspended from work, and he finds out that Sarah was on the plane that almost collided with the other aircraft at 2.22pm. Dylan felt apologetic about the incident but Sarah was instead thankful towards Dylan for saving her life. As they depart, they admit to each other that for a \"first date\" they felt a deep connection and it felt like they had known each other forever.\n\nThe following day, while on the way to the Grand Central, Dylan notices the same happenings (siren, a woman laughing, construction sounds, \"Can I help you with\", glass breaking) and at 2:21pm, he hears the announcement of the boarding of the Millhurst express, sees a business man reading his newspaper, a couple hugging each other, a line of preschoolers where the last child in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clock. At exactly 2:22pm, the window of the station shatters. He goes to meet Sarah and asks her out to an early dinner, going to the Central Park with her. Sarah tells Dylan that she was a ballet dancer student before she landed awkwardly and tore two of her knee ligaments. Cheering her up, Dylan creates an improvised speaker using a paper cup and ice cream cone holder, lifting Sarah's mood, then dancing and kissing. They go to Dylan's apartment and make love. The next morning, Dylan asks Sarah where she got her necklace from, to which Sarah replies that it was from her ex-boyfriend; Jonas (Sam Reid) who happens to be the main artist of the gallery at which she works. Dylan asks when is Sarah's birthday and they find out that both of them were born on the same day; April 18, 1986 and they are both turning 30 within a week's time. Dylan suddenly hears a car crash on the road below his apartment at exactly 9:15am, and he tells Sarah that it was 3rd day in a row that the same incident had happened.\n\nDylan takes a cab with a reckless driver going to Grand Central. As the driver takes the shorter route, Dylan tells him to stop the cab and notices again the same pattern of siren, a woman laugh, construction sounds, and a man saying \"Can I help you with\". Dylan then shouts for the cab to stop and this infuriates the cab driver, who turns around to tell Dylan off for shouting at him. Just then, another car hits them both, causing the breaking of the cab's glass windows. Even though Dylan is injured, he goes to the Grand Central Station and sees the exact same pattern of events. He tells Sarah of these repeating patterns, but with different people carrying out the same actions. Sarah does not believe Dylan, but helps to clean his wounds from the car accident. Dylan goes home and starts writing all the events of his day starting from 9.10am (water drop, a bug dying, a plane flying overhead etc) and realizes that everything has a pattern thats repeating itself.\n\nDylan goes to the gallery looking for Sarah, and realises that the gallery was having an exhibition with Jonas' art piece as the main exhibition. Jonas has created a light hologram exhibition about the Grand Central Station, and Dylan sees that it is exactly like the events that he has experienced the past few days (announcement of the boarding of Millhurst Express, a business man reading his newspaper, a couple embracing each other, a line of preschoolers where the last one in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clocks). Dylan assumes that Jonas is stalking him as only Dylan knows about these events. He attacks Jonas, resulting in a brawl and questions Jonas on whether he was stalking him. In the audience is the owner of the Keifer Gallery and he applauds saying it was a great idea to enact the murder at the Grand Central Station that happened 30 years ago and that he has an exhibit related to it at his gallery. Sarah apologises to Jonas about Dylan's attack and puts her relationship with Dylan on hold.\n\nLater that night, Dylan texts Sarah to beg for her forgiveness. In the mean time, he finds a stack of envelopes hidden in his home. He finds out a man named Jake Redman (Duncan Ragg) had written these letters to a woman named Evelyn. Upon investigation, Dylan finds out that Jake was a criminal, although he was never convicted for his crimes as the police could not find enough evidence to pin him down, while Evelyn was a singer, and they both were lovers. Dylan also finds an article online stating that Jack had shot Evelyn and another policeman, Noah (Jack Ellis), down in the Grand Central Station in a fit of jealous rage before being gunned down by other policemen on 18 April 1986, which was the day both Dylan and Sarah were born.\n\nDylan then visits Evelyn's sister, and she gives Dylan a stack of letters that Jack wrote to Evelyn as she could never bear to read them and shows him the necklace she is wearing saying that it was all she needs to remember her. The necklace is identical to the one that Dylan had seen Sarah wear. She also tells him that Noah; the policeman was taking Evelyn to Millhurst to keep her safe from Jake and that it seemed that he was also in love with Evelyn. Noah goes to the Grand Central Station to buy a ticket for the Millhurst Express, but is told that the service was terminated 30 years ago and now the train is known as the Poughkeepsie Express. At exactly 2:22pm the chandelier crashes to the floor.\n\nDylan connects the dots and realises that Dylan was Jake in his past life, while Sarah was Evelyn, and that he would kill her at Grand Central Station on their birthday, 18 April at 2.22pm. He realises that the pattern of events that has been happening was leading up to the day they both would die. He tells Sarah this and she does not believe him. As she tries to calm Dylan down, Dylan insists that they both should break up as he would soon kill Sarah, which he does not want to as he knows that they are soulmates.\n\nDylan contemplates suicide, which was unsuccessful, while a distraught Sarah looks for Jonas in his apartment. Jonas offers to bring Sarah to Millhurst to help her feel better about the breakup. The next day, both Jonas and Sarah's flight to Millhurst gets canceled and they have to go to Grand Central Station to take a train there. Meanwhile, Dylan looks for Sarah and in the midst of it, he breaks into Jonas' apartment and sees that Jonas recognises Sarah as Evelyn in his past life and that he was Noah. Dylan figures out that Jonas/Noah is obsessed with Sarah/Evelyn and that Jonas/Noah had a gun with him and races to the Grand Central Station to see her. On his way he attracts the attention of the police and leads them there.\n\nAt the Grand Central Station, Sarah realises that the patterns Dylan saw were true and she tries to leave but is stopped by a crazed Jonas calling her Evelyn. He wants Sarah to admit that she loves him, while Sarah refuses just as Dylan arrives at the Station. Jonas thinking that Sarah called him there gets enraged and makes his way towards Dylan with a gun while Sarah sees the events unfold as Dylan had described them to her, and realizes that she is the pregnant woman standing under the clock. Jonas first points his gun towards Dylan and then Sarah saying that \"she'll never be yours\" intending to kill her so that if he couldn't have her neither could Dylan but Dylan shields Sarah just in time but himself gets shot at 2:21pm.\n\nThe events from 30 years ago plays out with Jake/Dylan protecting Sarah/Evelyn from Noah/Jonas and at exactly 2:22pm. Jonas gets shot by the police who have followed Dylan there. Dylan also falls in Evelyn's arms and momentarily closes his eyes having visions of Jake and Evelyn being affectionate. He does not die and Sarah then looks at the clock, saying it was 2.23pm and they managed to survive. Turns out that the Jake was framed for murdering Noah and Evelyn as the police had wanted to save the reputation of Noah since he was a police detective and one of them. Also the dying star; Hamlin mentioned at the start of the movie finally disappears but a new star is immediately reborn.\n\nIn the ending scene, it is shown that Dylan and Sarah are living happily, with Dylan having finally overcome his fear of flying and is now a pilot and Sarah smiling affectionately at their baby in the cradle.\n\n\"2:22\" was produced by Pandemonium's Bill Mechanic, Walk The Walk Entertainment's Steve Hutensky and Lightstream Pictures' Paul Currie. Garrett Kelleher of Lightstream, David Fountain and Kel West of Flywheel Entertainment and Jackie O’Sullivan served as executive producers. Though the film is set in New York City, the actual filming location was in Fox Studios Australia and Moore Park in Sydney, Australia.\n\nReleased on June 30, 2017, \"2:22\" grossed 3.6 million worldwide. <ref>\n"}

Paul Zehr. The book was first published on November 7, 2008 through Johns Hopkins University Press and covers how much an ordinary person would need to train and adapt to become Batman. \"Becoming Batman\" is unique in its explicit analysis of whether or not it is actually possible for a human being to achieve Batman status through training.\n\nIn the book Zehr goes over the amount of physical training that would be necessary for someone to become Batman. Zehr draws upon his knowledge as a neuroscientist, kinesiologist, and martial artist to do this, and covers topics such as what it would be like to fight in a superhero uniform as well as what a person's daily dietary requirements would be. \"Becoming Batman\" is unique in its explicit analysis of whether or not it is actually possible for a human being to achieve Batman status through training.\n\n\"The Guardian\" gave a mostly positive review for \"Becoming Batman\", remarking that Zehr's \" grasp of Chinese martial arts is somewhat loose, but the physiological material is fascinating and well explained.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" also gave a positive review, remarking that the book would have an obvious appeal to fans of Batman.\n\nZehr’s work has also had a reciprocal impact on the way the comics are viewed and even written, providing reference material regarding the “physical reality of Batman” as recognized by Scottish \"Batman, Incorporated\" writer Grant Morrison.\nMore recently, because of \"Becoming Batman\", media articles discussing Batman and the DC Universe have included commentary by Zehr as a relevant authority, or referred to ideas from his book, weaving his scientific perspective into the Batman conversation.\n\n"}

The game was released on April 19, 2012, for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The game was later ported to iOS and Android. Botanicula is helping the World Land Trust to protect hundreds of acres of rainforest.\n\nLike the previous games from Amanita Design, in \"Botanicula\" the player controls a protagonist (or multiple protagonists) while exploring the environment, solving puzzles and collecting items that are required for the obstacles that come in their way. The player is able to interact with other creatures and find easter eggs that are present in the lush environment. Like \"Machinarium\", the game has no spoken or written dialogue.\n\n\"Botanicula\" follows the adventure of five botanical creatures (named Mr. Lantern, Mr. Twig, Mr. Poppy Head, Mr. Feather and Mrs. Mushroom) who are trying to save the last seed of their home tree from evil parasitic creatures that have infested their home.\n\n\nThe game received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. It was praised for its music and visuals, as well as gameplay. However, other reviews noted a lack of replay value.\nBotanicula won the 14th annual award in 'Excellence in Audio' at Independent Games Festival 2012.

{"id": "18950040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18950040", "title": "Brass Eye", "text": "Brass Eye\n\nBrass Eye is a British television comedy series parodying the current affairs news programming. A series of six episodes aired on Channel 4 in 1997, and a further episode in 2001. The series was created and presented by Chris Morris, written by Morris, David Quantick, Peter Baynham, Jane Bussmann, Arthur Mathews, Graham Linehan and Charlie Brooker and directed by Michael Cumming.\n\nOriginally planned as a spin-off from \"The Day Today\" (1994), the pilot (then called \"Torque tv™\") was passed on by the BBC. Channel 4 commissioned a new pilot, which would become called \"Brass Eye\" (mixing together the titles of two popular current affairs shows, \"Brass Tacks\" and \"Public Eye\"). \n\nThe series satirised media portrayal of social ills, in particular sensationalism, unsubstantiated establishmentarian theory masquerading as fact, and creation of moral panics, and is a sequel to Morris's earlier spoof news programmes \"On the Hour\" (1991–92) and \"The Day Today\" (1994). The series stars Morris's \"The Day Today\" colleague Doon Mackichan, along with Gina McKee, Mark Heap, Amelia Bullmore, Simon Pegg, Julia Davis, Claire Skinner, John Guerrasio, Hugh Dennis and Kevin Eldon.\n\n\nThe second episode, \"Drugs\", has been described by professor Michael Gossop as illustrative of the ease in which anti-drug hysteria can be evoked in the United Kingdom. In the opening scene of this episode, a voiceover tells viewers that there are so many drugs on the streets of Britain that \"not even the dealers know them all\". An undercover reporter (Morris) asks a purportedly real-life drug dealer in London for various fictitious drugs, including \"Triple-sod\", \"Yellow Bentines\" and \"Clarky Cat\", leaving the dealer puzzled and increasingly irritated until he tells the reporter to leave. He also explains that possession of drugs without physical contact and the exchange of drugs through a mandrill are perfectly legal in English law.\n\nOne drug mentioned was a fictitious drug called \"Cake\", described as being from Czechoslovakia, despite the country no longer existing when the episode was screened. The drug purportedly affected an area of the brain called \"Shatner's Bassoon\" (altering the user's perception of time), while also giving them a bloated neck due to \"massive water retention\", a \"Czech neck\", and was frequently referred to as \"a made-up drug\" during the show. Other celebrities such as Sir Bernard Ingham, Noel Edmonds, and Rolf Harris were shown holding the bright-yellow cake-sized pill as they talked, with Bernard Manning telling viewers a fictitious story about how one girl threw up her own pelvis and describing how \"One kiddy on Cake cried all the water out of his body. Just imagine how his mother felt. It's a fucking disgrace\".\n\nDavid Amess, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Basildon, was fooled into filming an elaborate video warning against the dangers of this drug, and went as far as to ask a question about \"Cake\" in the UK Parliament, alongside real substances khat and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. In response, the Home Office minister incorrectly identified the fictitious drug \"Cake\" as a pseudonym for the hallucinogenic drug methylenedioxybenzylamphetamine. \n\n\nIn one scene of the \"Sex\" episode, Morris posed as a talk show host who took a starkly discriminatory attitude in favour of those with \"Good AIDS\" (e.g. from a contaminated blood transfusion) over those with \"Bad AIDS\" (caught through sexual activity or drug abuse).\n\nA special one-off edition of the show aired four years after the series had ended. Originally scheduled to broadcast on 5 July 2001, it was delayed as Channel 4 were unhappy with the timing in connection to the disappearances of 15-year-old Danielle Jones in June and 11-year-old Bunmi Shagaya in early July. It eventually aired on Thursday 26 July 2001, and was repeated on Friday 27 July 2001.\n\nIt tackled paedophilia and the moral panic in parts of the British media following the murder of Sarah Payne, focusing on the name-and-shame campaign conducted by the \"News of the World\" in its wake. This included an incident in 2000 in which a paediatrician in Newport had the word \"PAEDO\" daubed in yellow paint on her home. \"News of the World\"'s then Editor Rebekah Brooks would years later discuss this campaign at the Leveson Inquiry.\n\nTo illustrate the media's knee-jerk reaction to the subject, various celebrities were duped into presenting fatuous and often ridiculous pieces to camera in the name of a campaign against paedophiles. Gary Lineker and Phil Collins endorsed a spoof charity, Nonce Sense, (pronounced \"nonsense\"—\"nonce\" being British slang for people convicted or suspected of molestation or sexual crimes), with Collins saying, \"I'm talking Nonce Sense!\" \"Tomorrow's World\" presenter Philippa Forrester and ITN reporter Nicholas Owen were shown explaining the details of fictional \"Hidden Online Entrapment Control System\", or HOECS (pronounced \"hoax\") computer games, which online paedophiles were using to abuse children via the internet. Capital Radio DJ Neil \"Doctor\" Fox told viewers that \"paedophiles have more genes in common with crabs than they do with you and me\", adding \"Now that is scientific fact—there's no real evidence for it—but it \"is\" scientific fact\". At one point, bogus CCTV footage was shown of a paedophile attempting to seduce children by stalking the streets while disguised as a school.\n\nLineker described paedophile text slang, stating that \"BALTIMORA\" translates to \"literally, I'm running at them now with my trousers down\". Labour MP Syd Rapson related that paedophiles were using \"an area of internet the size of Ireland\". Richard Blackwood stated that internet paedophiles could make computer keyboards emit noxious fumes to subdue children, subsequently sniffing a keyboard and claiming that he could smell the fumes, which made him feel \"suggestible\". Blackwood also warned watching parents that exposure to the fumes would make their children \"smell like hammers\". Other notable figures appearing as themselves were Sebastian Coe, Michael Hames, Andy McNab, Kate Thornton, Barbara Follett MP and Gerald Howarth MP.\n\nMorris reported that convicted child murderer Sidney Cooke had been sent into space to keep him away from children. Prior to the launch, an eight-year-old boy had been placed on board the spaceship with Cooke by mistake. During the programme, the studio was \"invaded\" by a fictional militant pro-paedophile activism organisation called \"Milit-pede\", and the programme appeared to suffer a short technical disturbance. When it returned, presenter Chris Morris confronted a spokesman, Gerard Chote (played by Simon Pegg), who had been placed in a pillory, asking if he wanted sex with Morris's six-year-old son (actually a child actor). Hesitantly, the spokesman refused, apologetically explaining \"I don't fancy him\".\n\nThe episode won a \"Broadcast\" magazine award in 2002.\n\nIn 2017, series director Michael Cumming released a 60-minute film of unbroadcast material from the making of Brass Eye between 1995 and 1997. The film is intended to mark the 20th anniversary of the series's original broadcast and includes scenes previously edited from the series due to time constraints or legal difficulties. It also includes extended or alternative versions of scenes that made the final cut, together with humorous outtakes of several scenes. Cumming also narrates the film and details his first meeting with Chris Morris and the difficulties involved in making the series. Comedy website Chortle described the film as \"a thoughtful, curiously touching time capsule which pays fulsome tribute to, and certainly never cheapens, the spirit of the original show\". \n\nThe film premiered at the Pilot Light TV festival in May 2017 and toured to perform at selected UK cinemas throughout 2017. Each performance was followed by a Q&A with the director.\nCumming has indicated that the film will only be viewable at such public events and will never be broadcast, made available on the internet, or commercially released, due to legal and rights issues. He has also praised the positive experience of travelling to a cinema to enjoy an exclusive film and implored cinema-goers not to film or share excerpts from the performance.\n\nThe series was repeated in 2001 to tie in with the paedophilia special (see below), and released on DVD in a revised form. This new version reinstated most of the material cut from the original, although a few items were removed, most notably the subliminal message (see below) and an interview with Graham Bright MP in the \"Drugs\" episode. A disclaimer was also added to the \"Drugs\" episode at the request of David Amess.\n\nThe screening of the 1997 series was postponed for nearly six months as it made comic reference to murderer Myra Hindley, who was back in the news at the time after her portrait was vandalised in the Royal Academy exhibition \"Sensation\". In a particularly infamous portrayal, Hindley was the topic of a farcical song by a fictitious indie band called Blouse (whose appearance and style closely resembled that of Pulp). The lyrics to part of the song read: \"Every time I see your picture, Myra/I have to phone my latest girlfriend up and fire her/And find a prostitute who looks like you and hire her/Oh, me oh Myra.\" The \"leader singer\" of Blouse, Purves Grundy (who resembles Pulp's Jarvis Cocker), is then shown commenting on the song; \"Myra is a very complex woman, you know, and this song is about her hair. I don't think there's a single reference in the song to her brain, which I think maybe, had a slight problem. I do think [if] someone's gone and bought this record just because of the fuss that's been made about it, I think they should throw it away. And then they should go and buy another copy, because they liked the song.\"\n\nMichael Grade, then chief executive of Channel 4, repeatedly intervened to demand edits to episodes of \"Brass Eye\". The final episode included a single-frame subliminal message reading \"Grade is a cunt\". As part of the 25th anniversary of Channel 4, this sequence was shown again, twice, including a freeze frame for anyone who did not catch it originally. When Grade was interviewed on this he pointed out that subliminal messages are illegal under British law.\n\nAround 3,000 complaints were received concerning \"Paedogeddon!\", making it reportedly the most objected-to episode in British television history at the time, and politicians spoke out against Morris. Minister for Child Protection Beverley Hughes described the show as \"unspeakably sick\" based on clips of the episode, and Home Secretary David Blunkett was described by a spokesman as \"dismayed\", although he may have been relying on a description of the episode. Tessa Jowell, after watching, asked the Independent Television Commission to change its procedures so it could rule more swiftly on similar programmes.\n\nThere was also a tabloid campaign against Morris, who refused to discuss the issue. The \"Daily Star\" decried Morris and the show, and the \"Daily Mail\" ran a headline describing \"Brass Eye\" as \"Unspeakably Sick\" (quoting Beverley Hughes). \"The Observer\" accused both papers of hypocrisy; it noted that the \"Star\" article was positioned adjacent to an article about developing bust of 15-year-old singer Charlotte Church, and that the \"Mail\"s coverage was preceded by \"close-ups\" of the \"bikini princesses\" Beatrice and Eugenie, who were 13 and 11 at the time.\n\n\"Guardian\" columnist Ros Coward wrote at the end of July 2001: \"What's so dishonest about Channel 4's defence of \"Brass Eye\" as a satire of media forms is the implication that they (and the liberal left in general) have a better truth than the tabloids. They don't. ... [I]t suggests concern about sex abuse is exaggerated and that victims' shame and humiliation doesn't matter. That's why there were so many complaints.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29560406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29560406", "title": "Bud Light Daredevils", "text": "Bud Light Daredevils\n\nThe Bud Light Daredevils were an American acrobatic basketball show that performed during the halftime of college and NBA basketball games from 1983 to 1998. The show combined gymnastics, trampoline, acrobatics, and basketball. The team was started by University of Mississippi cheerleaders Ty Cobb, Sam Martin, Robert Kirby, Tyler Hubbard, John White, and Ty Cobb's younger brother Guy Cobb.\n\nIn 1980, Ty Cobb, along with fellow cheerleaders Sam Martin, John White, and Jeff Hubbard (as Ole Miss Rebels mascot Colonel Reb) began performing ball handling skits and acrobatics which incorporated a mini-trampoline during the time-outs and half-time of Ole Miss basketball games. Using his previous trampoline and diving skills and the cheerleader's mini-trampoline, Ty Cobb, on a dare performed the first successful acrobatic \"flip dunk\" at the Ole Miss vs. Alabama basketball game in 1980 and received a standing ovation by Alabama fans. Ole Miss Head Basketball Coach Bob Weltlich, recognizing the group's potential to soften up an opposing team's crowd, began flying the foursome with the Ole Miss Basketball team to away games.\n\nIn 1980, Ty Cobb's fraternity brother and fellow Ole Miss cheerleader Walt Shinault was practicing stunts using a mini-trampoline in the yard of his apartment complex in Oxford when he fell and broke his neck. The fall left him a quadriplegic. After the accident the Southeastern Conference (SEC) banned the use of mini-trampolines by all cheerleaders at SEC games.\n\nWith the banning of the use of mini-trampolines by cheerleaders throughout the SEC, Ty Cobb began looking for other ways for the group to continue performing their developing halftime show. Working on a marketing class project which had asked that students create their own company, Ty Cobb created a company called \"The Ole Miss Cheerleaders Half Time Show\". He designed marketing brochures and advertising materials that he then sent to National Basketball Association (NBA) promotional directors as part of a direct marketing campaign. The concept worked as the promotional directors at many of the NBA teams were looking for new ways to increase attendance and contacted Ty to schedule the \"Ole Miss Cheerleaders\" to perform during the time outs and halftime of their home games. The first professional NBA performance by The Ole Miss Cheerleaders was for the San Antonio Spurs in 1980, followed by shows for the Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nStill in high school in 1981, Ty Cobb's younger brother Guy Cobb joined the show for performances at NBA games. With the addition of Guy, the team began experimenting with different ways to acrobatically pass the basketball. These passes were mixed and matched with each other to not only allow for more complex acrobatic dunks to be performed but also to provide a way for the team to incorporate more passes into the dunk sequences without having to stop the show. One example was the \"flip-pass\" off the basketball backboard. This pass could be followed by another flip-pass and another and then a dunk (\"Congo Dunk\" 1987).\n\nFollowing his graduation from Ole Miss in the Fall of 1983, Ty Cobb began planning to create a professional half-time show that would travel and perform during the college and NBA basketball season.[10] Guy Cobb, having just completed his freshman year at Ole Miss, dropped out of school to join his brother.[13]\n\nIn 1983 Cobb's father became President of Colonial Baking Company in St. Louis.[2] The two Cobb brothers relocated with their parents to the small community of Columbia, Illinois located southeast of St. Louis. They set up an office in their parent's basement and began organizing a performance schedule for the 1983-84 basketball season. Charles Cobb came up with the team's new professional name of \"Dixie Daredevils\". Steve Cliffe, a former Mehlville High School school mate of Ty Cobb's also joined the Dixie Daredevils at this time.[2] [14]\n\nIn the Summer of 1983, Cobb's father scheduled the Dixie Daredevils as a Colonial Bread promotion. He sponsored the Dixie Daredevils for performances in grocery store parking lots and at high school assemblies throughout the metro St. Louis and central Illinois areas.[2] [14]\n\nDuring the 1983-84 basketball season, Ty and Guy Cobb performed 45 shows throughout the United States. At the end of the season they received a call from Anheuser-Busch to discuss a sponsorship of the Dixie Daredevils to be associated with a new beer called \"Budweiser Light\".[2]\nBoth Cobb brothers worked for Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) during the Summer of 1982 as cheerleading instructors. Ty Cobb had met Mack Hirshberg at UCA's college cheerleading camp the previous Summer. Hirshberg was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina and had just graduated. In the Summer of 1983 Anheuser-Busch changed the name of their new beer \"Budweiser Light\" to \"Bud Light\". Mack Hirshberg joined the group for the 1984-85 premiere season and the team's name was changed from The Dixie Daredevils to The Bud Light Daredevils.[10] [15]\n\nFrom 1984 to 1998 the Bud Light Daredevils performed at universities and NBA games throughout all 50 United States.[16] When they were not performing during the American basketball season, they found sponsors for tours of the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, China, Norway, South America, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rico. Corporate sponsors included Boeing, Converse, Wang Laboratories, SportLife Chewing Gum, and Gordon's Gin. The group was also featured on national television shows such as ABC's That's Incredible!, Incredible Sunday, Showtime's Super Dave (TV series), Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club, and most recently, former Bud Light Daredevil Mark Odgers was featured performing a flip dunk over a New York City Cab live on Late Night with David Letterman.[10]\n\nAnheuser-Busch ended their fourteen-year sponsorship of the Bud Light Daredevils in 1998 in response to both governmental and social pressure to eliminate all alcohol marketing to college students.[17] [18]\n\n"}

It is housed in Special Collections and Archives of the UCR Libraries at the University of California, Riverside. It consists of more than 300,000 items, including hardcover and paperback books, SF fanzines, film and visual material, and comic books, including manga and anime, as well as a variety of archival materials.\n\nJ. Lloyd Eaton was a pulmonologist specializing in the treatment of tuberculosis. While still in high school he collected science fiction and fantasy pulp literature. By the 1940s he communicated with book dealers in London and New York to acquire more books, expanding to the detective and western genres at a time when science fiction was an obscure interest. Eaton had particular interest in stories of \"future war\" or \"lost race\" from before the 1920s by authors such as John Polidori, Frank Aubrey, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Eaton was also the first president of the Elves, Gnomes, and Little Men's Science Fiction, Chowder, and Marching Society, and served as the editor of the group's sercon fanzine, \"The Rhodomagnetic Digest\". When Eaton's family sought a home for his collection, science fiction was considered an inferior literary product—pleasant enough as a diversion, but unworthy of serious academic study. As even public libraries did not regularly acquire science fiction, there was no comprehensive collection available anywhere outside of private hands.\n\nDr. Eaton's collection, acquired by UCR's University Librarian Donald Wilson in 1969, consisted of about 7,500 hardback editions of science fiction, fantasy, and horror from the late nineteenth century to 1955. The development of the collection continued under University Librarian Eleanor Montague, who created the position of Eaton Curator, hiring for the position George Slusser, a Harvard-trained literary scholar. When Hal W. Hall catalogued the growing Eaton Collection in 1975 for his then-upcoming \"Anatomy of Wonder\" bibliography, he determined the collection consisted of \"over 8,500 volumes, and is particularly rich in early and scare items published from 1870 to 1930, along with some important eighteenth-century titles.\"\n\nDuring Slusser's 25-year curatorship, the Eaton collection grew to more than 100,000 volumes, ranging from the 1517 edition of Thomas More's \"Utopia\" to the most recently published titles. The collection includes first editions of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", H. G. Wells's \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"The Time Machine\", Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Fantastic Four #1, and Action Comics #1. Foreign works of science fiction have been added systematically, including works in Chinese, Czech, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. The collection also includes journals, comic books, and fanzines, primarily acquired as donations from collectors Terry Carr, Bruce Pelz, Fred Patten, and Rick Sneary. Some of the extensive texts maintained by the collection were used in the 1970s by Arno Press for reprints of \"Supernatural and Occult Fiction\" and \"Lost Race and Adult Fantasy Fiction\".\n\nIn recent years, films, videos, DVDs, scripts and storyboards from TV series including \"Alien Nation\" and \"The X-Files\", and other illustrated narratives have been added, most of which were donated. The archival holdings comprise the papers of leading science fiction and fantasy authors, including Gregory Benford, David Brin, F. M. Busby, Michael Cassutt, Robert L. Forward, Anne McCaffrey, William Rotsler, James White, and Colin Wilson. From 1986-1991, one of Slusser's students, author Daryl F. Mallett was instrumental in reaching out to authors and fans and asking if they would donate their archives, as well as starting a duplicate-asset trading program with the University of Michigan, which provided the Eaton Collection with its massive comic book collection.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1990, the Collection published three issues of \"J. Lloyd Eaton Collection Newsletter\" \"designed to alert scholars of new acquisitions and happenings in the Eaton Collection\".\n\nIn 2014, George Slusser was asked how he assembled the world's largest SF collection: \"By silence, exile and cunning\", he replied. \"And I did have allies in the library, who found funds to buy books, even when academics sought to block purchases. Librarians love books, and SF had a lot of them, with interesting covers and formats.\"\n\nAs part of its scholarly mission, the Eaton Collection hosts the Eaton Science Fiction Conference, which is biennial in odd-number years from 2009. It was inaugurated in 1979 as the J. Lloyd Eaton Science Conference, annual for many years, including some at other sites. As of 2013, some 21 conferences have been held at UC Riverside, while others have taken place at international venues, co-sponsored by UCR and various host institutions: London Polytechnic University,1984; the , 1986; University of Leeds, 1989; Texas A&M University, 1990; the Maison d'Ailleurs, Yverdon-les-bains, and the Université de Neuchâtel, 1991; Imperial College, London, 1995; the Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2000, and the Science Fiction Museum in Seattle in 2005. Conference attendees have included writers such as Brian Aldiss, Ray Bradbury, David Brin, Samuel R. Delany, Larry Niven, Kim Stanley Robinson, Robert Silverberg, Theodore Sturgeon and Roger Zelazny as well as well-known critics of the genre and scientists like Harold Bloom, Leslie Fiedler, Harry Levin, Marvin Minsky and Robert Scholes. The Conference has produced more than twenty volumes of critical essays, published by various university presses.\n\nAfter a three-year gap, the conference resumed at UCR with the theme \"Chronicling Mars\", May 16–18, 2008. The 2009 conference, \"Extraordinary Voyages: Jules Verne and Beyond\" was held April 30 – May 3, 2009. The 2011 conference on \"Global Science Fiction\" was held February 11–13, 2011 at Riverside's historic Mission Inn Hotel & Spa. The most recent conference was held April 11–14, 2013, on the subject \"Science Fiction Media\".\n\nThe now biennial conference sponsors the J. Lloyd Eaton Memorial Award. From 1979 to 2001 it recognized the \"best critical book of each year\", although it was not precisely annual. From 2008 it is a lifetime achievement award, in full the J. Lloyd Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award in Science Fiction, recognizing \"contributions of lasting significance to the field\". The four recipients to 2011 were Ray Bradbury, Frederik Pohl, Samuel R. Delany, and Harlan Ellison. Ursula K. Le Guin is the Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award winner for 2012. Both Ray Harryhausen and Stan Lee have been named for 2013 \"to honor both science fiction film culture and science fiction comic book culture\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53366398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53366398", "title": "Effects of sex in the media", "text": "Effects of sex in the media\n\nIn the past several decades, researchers have spent continuous efforts on exploring how sexual content in the media influence individuals' perceptions of sex, marriage, and rape. Among these sexual content in the media, pornography has been a big business, generating $13 billion just in the U.S. in 2006. Researchers have reached agreement on some effects of sexual content in the media, such as arousal and some attitudinal effects. However, there is still an argument on whether the Catharsis effects resulting from the sexual media content.\n\nScholars analyzed the violent sexual content based on different types of sexual content, which sexual content portray rape, bondage, torture, sadomasochism, hitting, spanking, hair pulling, and genital mutilation, and nonviolent sexual material. Nonviolent sexual material is much harder to categorize. Some nonviolent sexual material is entirely mutually consenting and affectionate, depicting vagina or oral intercourse in a loving, or at least non-coercive, fashion. On the other hand, some nonviolent sexual material is sexually dehumanizing, depicting degradation, domination, subordination or humiliation. Nonviolent sexual material presents the woman with few human attributes besides body parts and sexual appetite.\n\nOne crucial effect of consuming sexual media is sexual arousal, \"the heightened physiological state that energizes sexual behavior. Arousal can be measured in two methods. One method is self-ratings of participants and the other is that physiological measures such as electronic sensors measuring penile tumescence, vaginal lubrication, or temperature (thermography).\n\nSome researchers found that men are more aroused by sexual media than are women, especially in response to sexually violent or dehumanizing materials. Also, sexual violence may only appeal to sex offenders and other violence-prone men and even to \"normal\" men if the victim is portrayed as being aroused by the assault. Slides or verbal descriptions of coercive sex are more appealing to sexually coercive men physiologically than \"normal\" men.\nSince the Internet provides unlimited number of websites that feature any sexual desire that the user wants, it results in sexual arousal because the stimuli are new. Carnes think that the Internet can allow people to see any of their fantasy, which usually do not exist in most people's daily lives. These images can be reactivated during the sexual intercourse.\n\nOne of the major criticism from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexual explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared. Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects are not limited to men. Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of premarital and extramarital sex. They placed less values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing about sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors.\n\nDifferent people have different reactions to sexual content in the media. Men are more likely to be aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves. It does not mean that men are more interested in sex videos than women. Women have been found to be more interested in written and directed by women and for women, while men appear to be more interested in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it. Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.\n\nPersonality can also be an indicator of individuals' different reactions to sexual content. Bushman, Bonacci, van Dijk, and Baumeister found that narcissistic men will be more likely to enjoy the rape scene preceded by affection between the parties than low narcissists did. Borgaert's study considered intelligence is a mediator between personality and arousal attitudes. Men, who have lower intelligence and higher aggressive/antisocial inclinations, are more likely to prefer violent sexual stimuli than men higher in intelligence and lower in aggressive/antisocial tendencies.\n\nBryant and Zillmann concluded that potential behavioral effects of violent sexual media content include: catharsis, disinhibition, imitation, and desensitization.\n\nCatharsis holds that \"vicariously participating in others' fictionalized hostility or aggression enables drama watchers, readers, or listeners to be purged of their anger and hostility and there by become less aggressive.\" This popular idea comes directly from psychodynamic models of personality. The Catharsis effect has been applied to support loosening restrictions on pornography and it has also been reported by sex offenders as a strategy for reducing impulses for committing an offense. However, very few empirical studies support the catharsis effect.\n\nDisinhibition is that after being repetitive exposed to sexual materials may undermine learned social sanctions against using violence that usually inhibit aggressive behaviors. People may become more aggressive after watching, reading or listening to media violence because they may tend to legitimize using violence in real life. A dozen experimental investigations have explored the disinhibition effects and provided support for this hypothesis.\n\nImitation is explained in terms of social learning theory, which argues that \"humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences\". Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is attentional process, which people must have seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is production process, which the learner must have the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is motivational process, which people must have sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.\n\nThe desensitization effects have been touted by some researchers. The desensitization hypothesis argues that the repeated exposure to sexual violent materials can result in less emotional responsiveness to violence in fiction, news, and reality fare, which could in turn result in an increased acceptance of violent behaviors. However, this notion was touted a lot and limited research evidence available supports disinhibition effects.\n\nHarris and Barlett concluded that a few studies have developed extensive pre-exposure training and/or post-exposure debriefing procedures to lessen the desensitizing effects. Linz found that by offering pertinent educational information about rape myths reduced the effect of desensitization, which means experimental participation can also help reduce the rape myth acceptance. Wilson, Linz, Donnerstein, and Stipp conducted a field experiment, they found that men who are older than 50 had preexisting attitudes reinforced and actually blamed women for rape after seeing the film. In other words, preexisting attitudes and personal experience should be considered when conducting research studies.\n\nAllen, Emmers, Gebhardt, and Giery concluded that experimental studies show positive significant effect between pornography exposure and rape myth acceptance, whereas correlational field studies how a very small effect or nonexistent effect. But the relationship consistently stronger when the sexual materials was violent than it was nonviolent.\n"}

Between 1935 and 1939, they were published in six volumes as \"Essays in Musical Analysis\". Each volume focused on a certain genre of orchestral or choral music (for example, Volumes I and II were devoted to Symphonies; Volume III to Concertos), with many of the works discussed with the help of music examples. In 1944, a posthumous seventh volume appeared on chamber music.\n\nTovey's \"Essays\" were written as introductory notes for the concert-going public and are occasionally light-hearted in tone. Nevertheless, they analyse the pieces and describe their structure in much more depth than standard programme notes, even in a few pages each. Tovey saw his role as being \"counsel for the defence\" (Introduction to Volume I): in speaking up on behalf of the work about to be performed, he was seeking to facilitate the listener's appreciation of its artistic content and technical merits. As a result, his approach tends to 'track' the structure of a work as it unfolds through time before the ear of his imaginary 'naive listener'.\n"}
{"id": "667371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=667371", "title": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)", "text": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a 2004 fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is based on J. K. Rowling's 1999 novel of the same name. The film, which is the third instalment in the \"Harry Potter\" film series, was written by Steve Kloves and produced by Chris Columbus (director of the first two instalments), David Heyman, and Mark Radcliffe. The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban intending to kill him.\n\nThe film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. It also features well-known actors in supporting roles, including Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Michael Gambon (in his debut in the role of Albus Dumbledore), Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney and Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew. It is the sequel to \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and is followed by \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\".\n\nThe film was released on 31 May 2004 in the United Kingdom and on 4 June 2004 in North America, as the first \"Harry Potter\" film released into IMAX theatres and to be using IMAX Technology. It was also the last \"Harry Potter\" film to be released on VHS in the U.S. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Original Music Score and Best Visual Effects at the 77th Academy Awards in 2005.\n\n\"Prisoner of Azkaban\" grossed a total of $796.7 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 and received praise for Cuarón's direction and the performances of the lead actors. It marked a notable change in the film series' tone and directing, and is considered by many critics and fans to be one of the best \"Harry Potter\" films.\n\nHarry Potter has been spending another dissatisfying summer with The Dursleys. When Harry's Aunt Marge insults his parents, he loses his temper and silently wills her to bloat up and float away. Fed up, Harry then flees the Dursleys with his luggage. The Knight Bus delivers Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where he is pardoned by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge for using magic outside of Hogwarts. After reuniting with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a convicted supporter of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban prison and intends to kill Harry.\n\nThe trio return to Hogwarts for the school year on the Hogwarts Express, only for dementors to suddenly board the train, searching for Sirius. One enters the trio's compartment, causing Harry to pass out, but new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin repels the dementor with a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that dementors will be guarding the school while Sirius is at large. Hogwarts groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher; his first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the hippogriff Buckbeak, who attacks him. Draco exaggerates his injury, and his father Lucius Malfoy later has Buckbeak sentenced to death.\n\nThe Fat Lady's portrait, which guards the Gryffindor quarters, is found ruined and empty. Terrified and hiding in another painting, she tells Dumbledore that Sirius has entered the castle. During a stormy Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, dementors attack Harry, causing him to fall off his broomstick. At Hogsmeade, Harry is shocked to learn that not only had Sirius been his father's best friend and apparently betrayed them to Voldemort, but is also Harry's godfather. Lupin privately teaches Harry to defend himself against dementors, using the Patronus Charm.\n\nAfter Harry, Ron, and Hermione witness Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat Scabbers bites him and escapes. When Ron gives chase, a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the Whomping Willow's base. This leads the trio to an underground passage of the Shrieking Shack, where they discover that the dog is actually Sirius, who is an Animagus. Lupin arrives and embraces Sirius as an old friend. He admits to being a werewolf, and explains that Sirius is innocent. Sirius was falsely accused of betraying the Potters to Voldemort, as well as murdering twelve Muggles and their mutual friend, Peter Pettigrew. It is revealed that Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, an Animagus who betrayed the Potters and committed the murders. After forcing him back into human form, Lupin and Sirius prepare to kill him, but Harry convinces them to turn Pettigrew over to the dementors.\n\nAs the group departs, the full moon rises and Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Sirius transforms into his dog form to fight him off. In the midst of the chaos, Pettigrew transforms back into a rat and escapes. Harry and Sirius are attacked by dementors, and Harry sees a figure in the distance save them by casting a powerful Patronus spell. He believes the mysterious figure is his deceased father before passing out. He awakens to discover that Sirius has been captured and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss.\n\nActing on Dumbledore's advice, Harry and Hermione travel back in time with Hermione's Time Turner, and watch themselves and Ron repeat the night's events. They save Buckbeak from execution and witness the Dementors overpower Harry and Sirius. The present Harry realises that it was actually him who conjured the Patronus, and does so again. Harry and Hermione rescue Sirius, who escapes with Buckbeak. Exposed as a werewolf, Lupin resigns from teaching to prevent an uproar from parents. Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, who happily takes it for a ride.\n\nWith \"Prisoner of Azkaban\", production of the \"Harry Potter\" films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was \"to give each [film] the time it required.\" Chris Columbus, the director of the previous two films, decided not to return to helm the third instalment as he \"hadn't seen [his] own kids for supper in the week for about two and a half years.\" Even so, he remained on as a producer alongside Heyman. Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct but considered the film \"so bright and happy and full of light, that [he] wasn't interested.\" Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made \"Finding Neverland\" and did not want to direct child actors again. M. Night Shyamalan was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, \"The Village\". Warner Bros. then composed a three-name short list for Columbus's replacement, which comprised Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in \"Chamber of Secrets\") and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting, as he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story. Cuarón's appointment pleased J. K. Rowling who loved his film \"Y Tu Mamá También\" and was impressed with his adaptation of \"A Little Princess\". Heyman found that \"tonally and stylistically, [Cuarón] was the perfect fit.\" As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, \"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on \"Prisoner of Azkaban\", because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began on 24 February 2003, at Leavesden Film Studios, and wrapped in October 2003.\n\nThe third film was the first to extensively utilise real-life locations, as much of the first two films had been shot in the studio. Some sets for the film were built in Glen Coe, Scotland, near the Clachaig Inn. The indoor sets, including ones built for the previous two films, are mainly in Leavesden Film Studios. The Hogwarts Lake was filmed from Loch Shiel, Loch Eilt and Loch Morar in the Scottish Highlands. Incidentally, the train bridge, which was also featured in the \"Chamber of Secrets\", is opposite Loch Shiel and was used to film the sequences when the Dementor boarded the train. A small section of the triple-decker bus scene, where it weaves in between traffic, was filmed in North London's Palmers Green. Some parts were also filmed in and around Borough Market and Lambeth Bridge in London.\n\nHogwarts grew and expanded significantly with the third film. For the first time, the Hogwarts courtyard and bridge were seen. At the end of the bridge, rock monoliths were placed onto the hillside to evoke a Celtic feeling. The use of live-action also significantly changed the look of Hagrid's hut. In the first two films, it appeared at the end of a flat stretch, right in front of the Forbidden Forest. The third film utilised the more rugged Scottish locations to place Hagrid's hut at the bottom of a steep hillside. A large pumpkin patch was added behind the hut.\n\nThe Honeydukes set in this film is a redress of the set of Flourish & Blotts that was seen in \"Chamber of Secrets\", which, in turn, was a redress of the Ollivanders set from the first film.\n\nRowling allowed Cuarón to make minor changes to the book, on the condition that he stuck to the book's spirit. She allowed him to place a sundial on Hogwarts' grounds, but rejected a graveyard, as that would play an important part in the then unreleased sixth book. Rowling said she \"got goosebumps\" when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated \"people are going to look back on the film and think that those were put in deliberately as clues.\" When filming concluded, Cuarón found that it had \"been the two sweetest years of my life,\" and expressed his interest in directing one of the sequels.\n\nCuarón originally wanted to move away from CGI toward puppetry. He hired master underwater puppeteer Basil Twist to help, using puppets to study the potential movement of the Dementors. Once it became apparent that puppetry would be too expensive and unable to portray the specific elements of the Dementors, Cuarón turned to CGI; however, he and his team did use footage of Dementor puppets underwater as a basis for the flowing movements of the computer-generated Dementors.\n\nThe Knight Bus segment when Harry is being taken to The Leaky Cauldron uses the technique known as bullet time, popularised in \"The Matrix\" series of films. This segment takes humorous advantage of the magic quality of the Harry Potter world by having the Muggle world go into bullet time while inside the Knight Bus, Harry, Stan Shunpike and Ernie Prang (and the talking shrunken head) keep moving in real time.\n\nThe Academy Award-nominated score was the third and final score in the series to be composed and conducted by John Williams. It was released on CD on 25 May 2004. In general, this film's music is not as bright as that of the previous films, with distinct medieval influences in the instrumentation. One of the new themes, \"Double Trouble,\" was written during production so that a children's choir could perform it in Hogwarts's Great Hall in one of the film's earlier scenes. The lyrics of \"Double Trouble\" are from a ritual performed by the Weïrd Sisters in Act 4, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The film's trailer prominently features the cues \"Anticipation\" and \"Progeny\" by Brand X Music, a trailer music band.\n\n\"Prisoner of Azkaban\" was, at the time of publication, the series' longest book. The increasing plot complexity necessitated a looser adaptation of the book's finer plot lines and back-story. The film opens with Harry using magic to light his wand in short bursts, whereas in the same scene in the book, he uses a torch/flashlight, as performing magic outside the wizard world is illegal for wizards under the age of seventeen. The connection between Harry's parents and the Marauder's Map is only briefly mentioned, as is Remus Lupin's association to both the map and James Potter. Additionally, it was never mentioned who the Marauders were or who the nicknames Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs referred to. Some exposition was removed for dramatic effect: both the Shrieking Shack and Scabbers the rat are mentioned only very briefly in the film, while they receive a more thorough coverage in the novel. Most of Sirius Black's back story is also cut, with no mention of the manner of his escape from Azkaban. Only the first Quidditch game was kept in the film, due to its importance to the storyline; the second (Gryffindor/Ravenclaw) and third (Gryffindor/Slytherin) were cut. Thus, Harry receives the Firebolt at the film's end, while in the book he receives it anonymously at Christmas and it is confiscated for a few weeks to be checked for possible jinxes by Professor Flitwick and Madam Hooch.\n\nOn account of pace and time considerations, the film glosses over detailed descriptions of magical education. Only one Hippogriff, Buckbeak, is seen, and only Malfoy and Harry are seen interacting with the Hippogriff during Care of Magical Creatures lessons, and most other lessons, including all of Snape's potions classes, were cut from the film. The Fidelius Charm's complicated description is removed entirely from the film, with no explanation given of exactly how Black \"betrayed\" the Potters to Lord Voldemort. Many of this scene's lines are redistributed amongst Cornelius Fudge and Minerva McGonagall; in compensation, McGonagall's exposition of the Animagus transformation is instead given by Snape.\n\nIn the film, where Harry and Hermione have travelled back in time and are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it will take some time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.\n\nThe embryonic romantic connection between Ron and Hermione is more prominent in the film than the book; in response to criticism of the first two films for sacrificing character development for mystery and adventure, the emotional development of all three lead characters is given more attention in the third film. That said, any mention of the beginnings of Harry's crush on Cho Chang is removed. Chang herself is not even seen until the next film. Harry's darker side is first glimpsed in this film, when Harry proclaims, \"I hope he [Black] finds me. Cause when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does, I'm going to kill him!\"\n\nAs with the series' previous instalments, \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" was a large merchandising opportunity. The video game version, designed by EA UK, was released 25 May 2004 in North America and 29 May 2004 in Europe. Mattel released film tie-ins that included the \"Harry Potter Championship Quidditch\" board game and character action figures. Lego also expanded on its previous merchandising for the first two films with the release of sets ranging from the Knight Bus to the Shrieking Shack.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" held its New York premiere at Radio City Music Hall on 23 May 2004, followed by its London premiere at Leicester Square on 30 May 2004. The film then opened in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2004 and on 4 June 2004 in the United States. It was the first film in the series to be released in both conventional and IMAX theatres.\n\nUpon release, the film broke the record for biggest single day in the United Kingdom's box office history making £5.3 million on a Monday. It went on to break records both with and without previews, making £23.9 million including previews and £9.3 million excluding them. \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" had the highest-opening weekend at the UK's box office, until \"Spectre\" beat the record in 2015. It went on to make a total of £45.6 million in the UK. The film made $93.7 million during its opening weekend in the United States and Canada at 3,855 theatres, achieving, at the time, the third biggest-opening weekend of all time. This opening also broke \"Hulk\"s record ($62.1 million) for the highest-opening weekend for a film released in June. \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" held this record for five years until \"\" topped it in 2009 with $108.9 million. The film was also No. 1 at the North American box office for two consecutive weekends.\n\n\"Prisoner of Azkaban\" made a total of $796.7 million worldwide, which made it 2004's second-highest-grossing film worldwide behind \"Shrek 2\". In the U.S. and Canada, it was only the year's sixth-highest-grossing film, making $249.5 million. Everywhere else in the world, however, it was the year's number one film, making $547 million compared to \"Shrek 2's\" $478.6 million. Despite its successful box office run, \"Azkaban\" is the lowest-grossing \"Harry Potter\" film (all the others have grossed more than $800 million worldwide) and the second lowest-grossing film of \"J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World Series\" (behind \"\").\n\n\"Prisoner of Azkaban\" is often regarded by critics and fans as one of the best films in the franchise. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuarón, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" lauded the film's more mature tone and said it was \"darker, more complex, rooted in character.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the film \"a deeper, darker, visually arresting and more emotionally satisfying adaptation of the J.K. Rowling literary phenomenon,\" especially compared to the first two installments. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars: \"Not only is this dazzler by far the best and most thrilling of the three Harry Potter movies to date, it's a film that can stand on its own even if you never heard of author J.K. Rowling and her young wizard hero.\" Stephanie Zacharek of \"Salon.com\" asserts it to be \"one of the greatest fantasy films of all time.\" Nicole Arthur of \"The Washington Post\" praised the film as \"complex, frightening, [and] nuanced.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that the film was not quite as good as the first two, but still called it \"delightful, amusing and sophisticated\" Claudia Puig from \"USA Today\" found the film to be \"a visual delight,\" and added that \"Cuarón is not afraid to make a darker film and tackle painful emotions.\" while Richard Roeper called the film \"a creative triumph.\" Sean Smith from \"Newsweek\" said: \"\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" boasts a brand-new director and a bold new vision,\" he also called the film \"moving,\" praising the performances by the three main leads, while \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the film for being more mature than its predecessors.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" was nominated for Best Original Music Score (John Williams) and Best Visual Effects at the 77th Academy Awards held in 2005. This was the second film in the series to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\nThe film also ranks at 471 in \"Empire\" magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. IGN designated \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" as the fifth best fantasy film. Additionally, Moviefone designated the film as the tenth best of the decade. In 2011, the film was voted Film of the Decade at the First Light Awards by children aged 5–15.\n\n\n"}

The film, which is animated by R.C. Hamilton, Bill Nolan and Tom Palmer, features Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, who is substituted for the organ grinder's dancer, after the original one is comically swallowed up by Oswald's bubblegum. \n\nThe title is another name for the instrument (that instrument being a barrel organ) which the street performer plays throughout the film, as the informal meaning of the term 'Hurdy Gurdy' is a \"barrel organ\".\n\nThe film is recorded on Western Electric apparatus, which was an early sound-on-film recording system. This same system was also used on another Oswald short film entitled \"Permanent Wave\", which was released in the same year.\n\nCopyrighted on 3 January 1930, but released the year prior, the film was released by Universal Pictures. Thus, the film is part of the Universal series of Oswald The Lucky Rabbit films.\n\nThe film opens with a bear (who is the street performer) using a barrel organ, and a monkey dancing to the music made by it. They do this until Oswald throws his bubblegum onto the floor and the monkey steps on it. In an attempt to free himself, the monkey comically gets himself swallowed up by the gum. The street performer, who is angered by the events, grabs Oswald and drags him by the neck with a leach through whilst playing the barrel organ. He does this until he descends onto a street with a girl who is seen using her clothes and her washing line comically like a swing. The girl think positively about the music, who attempts to give money to them. The street performer notices this and asks Oswald to get the money, by comically using a mouse trap in order to get up to her house. However, when Oswald gets into the house, he and the girl passionately kiss. The street performer, then tries to pull Oswald back with the leach. So Oswald free himself by comically takes off his head and removing the leach. He places the leach onto one of the legs of a hippo's bathtub. Oswald then blows a raspberry in order to gather the street performer's attention. This angers the street performer, who pulls at the leach in order to retrieve Oswald. This comically sends the hippo's bathtub crashing through the window, and hitting the street performer on the ground. This makes the hippo scream, and comically run away with her legs in the bathtub. After that, The street performer sees both Oswald and the girl, and comically scales up a pipe in order to reach them. However, once the street performer is on top of the roof and tries to grab Oswald and the girl, Oswald and the girl both use a piece of clothing as a parachute, which catches the street perform off-guard, and also makes the street performer fall off the building and slam into the ground. After falling, the street performer realises that Oswald and the girl are stealing his barrel organ. So, in response, the street performer throws a brick at them both. The brick hits Oswald, who falls off the organ. The street performer then throws another brick. Oswald, then comically uses the organ to bat it away, like a baseball bat. He does this until one of the bricks hits the street performer on the head. This makes the street performer hallucinate, with the buildings comically dancing in his hallucination. The street performer hallucinates until he collapses. Oswald and the girl both laugh at the events, and the film ends with them both kissing.\n\nThe film has three main characters, one of them is Oswald. Oswald is substituted as the dancer for the street performer, after the original one is comically swallowed up by bubblegum. Another character is the street performer, he plays the barrel organ throughout the film, and also fights with Oswald near the end of the film. That fight results in a brick being thrown at the street performer's head,which makes him hallucinate and collapse at the end of the film. The other main character is the girl. She falls in love with Oswald and runs away with him at the end of the film.\n\n\"Hurdy Gurdy\" was reviewed by the cinema magazines at that time. \"The Motion Picture News\" said that the film includes \"Good Sound Cartoonantics\", and also said that the film developed \"some good cartoon stunts\".\n\n"}

{"id": "937744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=937744", "title": "Kingdom of Loathing", "text": "Kingdom of Loathing\n\nKingdom of Loathing (abbreviated KoL) is a browser-based multiplayer role-playing game designed and operated by Asymmetric Publications, including creator Zack \"Jick\" Johnson with a small team. The game was released in 2003, with ongoing small updates continually released.\n\nIt uses hand-drawn stick figure graphics and writing characterized by surreal humor, word play, parody and references to popular culture. In \"KoL\", a player's character fights monsters for experience, and acquiring meat (the game's currency), and/or items, through a turn-based system. Players may also interact with each other through player versus player competition, participate in the in-game economy by trading goods and services, organize their characters into clans, work together to complete clan dungeons, and speak to each other in many different chat channels.\n\nThe game is also particularly notable for managing to be financially successful purely from donations and the purchase of merchandise rather than from advertising or subscription fees, which are used by many online games. In 2008, the game had between 100,000 and 150,000 regular players. These players form an active community which frequently organizes fan meet-ups and runs an internet radio station. The game has been generally well received by critics. In 2012, \"Mr. Card Game\", a tabletop game based on \"Kingdom of Loathing\", was launched on Kickstarter.\nOn August 10, 2017, Asymmetric launched \"West of Loathing\", a \"Kingdom of Loathing\" spin-off single-player role-playing video game for Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\nGameplay involves fighting monsters, completing quests, gaining skills and stats, and accumulating items and meat.\n\nIn \"KoL\"'s turn-based gameplay, a player's character is supplied with a number of adventures each day, at a base of 40, although this can be increased. The game day resets at a time called \"rollover\". Characters are allotted forty adventures every rollover, though they can increase that number with various equipment and items. Additional adventures can be acquired by consuming food and booze. However, only a limited amount of each can be consumed each day, and drinking too much booze puts the character into a drunken stupor for the remainder of the day. During rollover, drunkenness and fullness levels are reset, and minor amounts of health points and magic points are restored. Although a character can accumulate a large number of adventures, the number is reduced to 200 at rollover.\n\nMost actions in the game use up adventures, including crafting items and exploring the game world (adventuring). When exploring, players experience combat encounters, in which they fight monsters, as well as non-combat encounters. Combat is turn-based, meaning that the player and the monster take turns attacking one another using weapons, skills and items. Players who successfully defeat a monster receive experience points, pieces of meat (the game's currency), and various items. Non-combat encounters simply present the reader with a text description of an event, occasionally allowing the player to choose how to respond to that event.\n\nAfter gaining enough experience points, players will gain levels, allowing them to access new areas and quests. Characters can combine items by using \"meat paste\" (a substance analogous to glue), and can also cook food, mix cocktails and smith weapons and armor. Characters may also earn trophies or tattoos for various in-game achievements. Puzzle-solving is an important part of the game, with the solutions often involving a certain item combination or the completion of tasks in different zones.\n\nWhile \"Kingdom of Loathing\"s player versus environment content is largely single-player, some features allow multiplayer interaction.\n\nPlayer versus player (PvP) combat is voluntary, features a randomized selection of non-interactive minigames, and is subdivided into seasons. The winner of the PvP battle can take fame or items from the loser.\n\nThe game features an integrated chat system which is available only after completing a basic test of English grammar and spelling. There are many chat channels, including a channel in which all chat must follow the syllabic conventions of English haiku. Most of the chat channels are moderated; those who violate the chat rules are banned. Players can also send messages and gift packages to each other in-game, and the official \"Kingdom of Loathing\" forums are another active venue for discussion among players.\n\nUpon reaching level 3, characters may join a clan, a band of cooperating characters. A clan has a clan hall which can be furnished with beneficial equipment as well as a clan stash for sharing useful items. Clan members can chat with each other in a private chat channel. In 2008, a multiplayer dungeon was added which allows clan members to raid cooperatively in Hobopolis, the underground city of hobos. Eurogamer likened Hobopolis to World of Warcraft instances. Additional clan dungeons have since been added, including the Slimetube, Dreadsylvania, and the limited-time Haunted Sorority House.\n\nPlayers can buy a store in The Mall of Loathing and sell their character's items to other players. Direct trading between two players is also possible, and in the trade chat channel users can auction items and advertise shops. This functionality has created a complex in-game economy which author Ted Friedman, in his book \"Electric dreams: computers in American culture\", described as \"vibrant\". The \"Kingdom of Loathing\" economy was the subject of an academic study, \"Economics in the Kingdom of Loathing: Analysis of Virtual Market Data\" in 2011.\n\nPlayers choose from six classes when they create a character. Each class has various items that characters obtain by completing class-specific quests. Characters also receive non-tradable class-dependent items as a reward for completing harder ascensions. The classes can be split into groups based on the primary character attribute associated with them.\n\n\nFamiliars are creatures that can accompany players in combat, performing (usually) helpful actions. Familiars are often instrumental in the completion of quests. Familiars possess many abilities; for example, a Sabre-Toothed Lime attacks monsters, a Leprechaun grants extra meat after combat, and a Hovering Sombrero increases stat gains from combat. Some familiars, such as the Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot, are very difficult to acquire.\n\nAscension is a feature that allows characters to start the game over and play through it again from the beginning, similar to a New Game Plus feature. This feature becomes available after the game's final quest is completed. Players who ascend have their character's experience levels reset to one, but they retain their currency and items. Ascending players can also choose to make their ascension more difficult by taking on various restrictions, such as not being able to eat or drink, in exchange for special rewards. In addition, the game features a leaderboard system which allows players to see one another's ascension speeds and compete for the fastest ascensions.\n\nThe player takes on the role of an adventurer who is tasked with solving problems and killing monsters in a fantasy-based kingdom. The game is humorous in nature, and most quests, battles and individual item descriptions include jokes, witticisms, or references to popular culture. Many quests parody the tropes found in other role-playing games.\n\nThe premise is that the Naughty Sorceress has captured and \"imprismed\" (imprisoned in a prism) the Kingdom's ruler, King Ralph XI. The ultimate objective of the game is to defeat the Naughty Sorceress and free King Ralph. In King Ralph's absence, most of the power in the Kingdom of Loathing is held by the Council of Loathing, which gives quests to characters as they increase in level, with the final quest given when the character has reached level 13 and finished the other quests. Players can also unlock quests from other sources, some of which are available only after ascending.\n\nZack Johnson, the game's creator, developed several games before \"Kingdom of Loathing\" but did not feel that they were good enough to release online. Deciding that he was taking the games he created too seriously, Johnson then set himself the challenge of creating one within a week and publishing the result online. The result was more of a joke than a game, and the initial content including classes and even the name of the game were stream of consciousness. The game was released in early 2003, and Johnson soon invited his childhood friend Josh Nite to contribute content as a writer and designer. Within a year, 300,000 player accounts had been created, far exceeding Johnson and Nite's expectations; Johnson has referred to the game's success as \"a never ending series of astonishments\". In 2008, the game had between 100,000 and 150,000 regular players.\n\nIn the game's early days, Johnson would work on the game during breaks while at work, but eighteen months or so after launch, the game was bringing in enough money for Johnson to quit his day job as a programmer and develop the game full-time. He then began to pay Nite for his work and after approximately two years hired two more developers. There are currently eight full-time employees working on \"Kingdom of Loathing\", as well as three other employees who are working on a separate game.\nThe game's creative process is fluid and loosely structured. According to Johnson, \"At this point, I provide the overall direction. I do about a quarter of the writing, a quarter of the coding, and almost all of the artwork.\" The bulk of the writing is done by Nite, who also contributes design ideas, while two other developers, known in the game as Riff and HotStuff, work on writing, design, and coding.\n\nAccording to Nite, the game's writing style owes itself to a humorous email exchange between himself and Johnson that began when the two separated after high school. These emails \"helped us develop the shared comedic voice that \"KoL\"'s written in\". The game's developers cite text-based games such as Zork and Legend of the Red Dragon as creative influences, and Nite has compared the game to the Choose Your Own Adventure series of children's books.\n\nThe game has been in open beta since its initial release, and is continuously being worked on. New content is released weekly or monthly, and there is also unique holiday-themed content every Christmas, known as Crimbo. Occasionally, the developers stage world events such as the Gray Plague, which was similar to the Corrupted Blood incident in \"World of Warcraft\".\n\nIn November 2014, Nite left Asymmetric Publications.\n\n\"Kingdom of Loathing\" is advertising-free and does not charge subscription fees.\n\nMaintenance and development of the game is supported primarily through donations and players who donate US$10 to the game receive a powerful item known as a Mr. Accessory. Mr. Accessories can be equipped to give stat boosts or spent in the \"Mr. Store\" to buy powerful items (including special monthly items). Mr. Accessories and Mr. Store items may be traded freely between players. According to an interview with Zack Johnson from 2010, Johnson originally established the Mr. Accessory revenue model as \"kind of an afterthought\", but it became lucrative enough to allow him to work on the game full-time and eventually to hire several permanent employees.\n\n\"Kingdom of Loathing\" has been praised for its welcoming and active player community. One of the most unusual aspects of the community is the large number of female players: according to Johnson, approximately 40% of players are female. Fans often gather at both official conventions, run by Asymmetric, and unofficial player-organized meet-ups, including the annual KoLumbus event. Players support the game by writing scripts to perform various in-game functions, using Greasemonkey, Java, Perl, and Lua, and have also developed a player-run wiki which offers puzzle solutions and walkthroughs. Longtime player and nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot is active in the community and included a \"Kingdom of Loathing\"-themed song on his 2010 album \"Zero Day\".\n\nBrett Bixler, founder of the Educational Gaming Commons at Pennsylvania State University, has hypothesized that the \"Kingdom of Loathing\" community is successful because it accounts for Richard Bartle's model of player personality types in massively multiplayer online roleplaying games, creating a balanced gameplay system that appeals to a wide variety of players. Researcher Martin Oliver addressed similar issues in a 2009 study of the \"Kingdom of Loathing\" player community, \"Playing Roles in the MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing\".\n\nA Web-based SHOUTcast radio station, \"Radio KoL\", is the \"official unofficial\" radio station of \"KoL\". It is a 24/7 DJ-hosted station, with volunteer DJs drawn from the \"KoL\" user base. Twice weekly, development team members host shows on Radio KoL in which they discuss the state of the game and answer questions from players.\n\nCritical response for \"Kingdom of Loathing\" has been generally positive, with consistent praise for the game's humor and surrealism. The gameplay and content have been praised as \"well designed\" and having a \"huge amount of content\". Matt Gallant of Gizmodo said that the game is \"actually very full-featured\" with \"a lot of content\", and according to Worlds in Motion, \"\"Kingdom of Loathing\" isn't just a great game, but a really unique and interesting MMO.\" Jay Is Games called it \"a 'must play' game for RPG fans who want something different\". Gamezebo criticized the interface, calling it \"clunky\", and several reviewers expressed concern that the game might be confusing to new players.\n\n\n"}

The original gamebook series, and the bulk of subsequent Lone Wolf media, was written by Joe Dever. The success and cult status of the original gamebooks helped in the creation of a spin-off called The World of Lone Wolf, written by Ian Page, a series of novelizations, a collection of role-playing games, and a number of video games and other derivative works.\n\nAlthough they form one full series numbered 1 to 29, the Lone Wolf gamebooks are in fact subdivided in four subseries. In the Kai Series (books 1 to 5), we follow Lone Wolf as he climbs the steps to become a Kai Lord of the Magnakai level. In the Magnakai Series (books 6 to 12), Lone Wolf collects the Lorestones so he could reach the Grand Master level, the highest level a Kai Lord could achieved in the First Kai Order. In the Grand Master series (books 13 to 20), Lone Wolf discovers that there are even higher levels a Kai Lord could achieved, up to the point of Supreme Kai Master. In the New Order series (books 21 to 29), we play as a member of the Second Kai Order already at the level of a Grand Master. The yet to be published books 30 to 32 will belong to this subseries.\n\nAll four \"World of Lone Wolf\" books were written by Ian Page and edited by Joe Dever. In 2005 the gamebooks were made available for free download at Project Aon .\n\nThe series plays for the most part at the tip of south-eastern Magnamund, in the land then known as the Shadakine Empire, and features Grey Star, a human that was raised by the Shianti, a race of demi-gods.\n\nAccording to a 2008 interview with Joe Dever, Grey Star was actually the principal character that Ian Page played in Dever's D&D campaign in the late 1970s. Since Ian Page had created a detailed backstory for Grey Star and fleshed out many aspects of southern Magnamund, Joe Dever convinced him to write a four-book story arc centered on this character, and to include his contributions in the Magnamund setting.\n\nIn February 2015, Joe Dever announced on Facebook that the \"World of Lone Wolf\" series will be republished in deluxe edition by Mantikore Verlag in German. In November 2016, Megara Entertainment launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to republish the first book of this series in English. Similar campaigns will be made for each of the remaining books.\n\nIn the years 2010-2011, the French associative editor Scriptarium published original adventures in its webzine \"Draco Venturus\". These adventures formed the \"Autumn Snow\" series, featuring the eponymous female Kai Lord from the Second Kai Order, and is written by French-Canadian author Martin Charbonneau. In September 2014, Megara Entertainment announced that it would publish these adventures in a gamebook format, both in French and English. Joe Dever approved the series which features artwork by Gary Chalk.\n\nWith the republication of the Lone Wolf series, Mongoose Publishing decided to add a bonus adventure at the end of each gamebook, except for \"Flight from the Dark\". These bonus adventures feature a supporting character of the main story of the gamebook and have their own set of rules. They are written by different authors with the approbation of Joe Dever who edits and augments their work. Contrary to the main adventures which nearly all have 350 sections, these bonus stories don't have a fixed number of sections.\n\nA series of novelizations by John Grant (the nom de plume of Paul Barnett) were released entitled \"Legends of Lone Wolf\". They expanded on the adventures by introducing new characters (or fleshing out old ones from the book series), events and whole new stories.\nDark Quest Books announced plans to release five omnibuses containing all twelve novels. , three omnibuses can be ordered on the Dark Quest Books website.\n\nWhen Mongoose Publishing announced that it would republish the Lone Wolf series of gamebooks, it was also announced that two new trilogies of novels would be written under the generic name of \"Chronicles of Magnamund\". The first novel, \"The Dragons of Lencia\", is part of the \"Lencian Trilogy\", written by Richard Ford. The second novel, \"Glory & Greed\", is part of the trilogy named \"Rise of the Agarashi\" and is written by August Hahn, author of the first official version of the Lone Wolf Roleplaying Game. Both trilogies are set in the year MS 5100, 50 years after the events described in the first gamebook of the Lone Wolf series, \"Flight from the Dark\". Since the cancellation of the Lone Wolf line by Mongoose Publishing, nothing is known about the fate of both trilogies.\n\n\n\nThe first version of \"\", published by Mongoose Publishing. All the books are authored by August Hahn.\n\n\nA new version of the roleplaying game, \"Lone Wolf Multiplayer Game Book\", was released in March 2010 by Mongoose Publishing. The rules for this new version are simpler and closer to the ones of the regular gamebook series. Numerous expansions were made available in the months after the original release. Other supplements were planned and announced by Mongoose Publishing but, on February 27, 2013, it was announced that the publisher had lost its licensing rights on these books. Cubicle 7 soon picked up the rights to make a Lone Wolf roleplaying game. According to Joe Dever, Cubicle 7 will republish the original Multiplayer Gamebook and its supplements, along with the ones that were announced by Mongoose, but with additional data and a completely revised set of rules.\n\nAnnounced but not released:\n\nIn April 2013, Cubicle 7 announced that they were picking up the rights to publish a Lone Wolf RPG. This new version was called \"The Lone Wolf Adventure Game\" and it contains a new version of the \"Lone Wolf Multiplayer Gamebook\" that have been \"extensively reviewed, revised, and expanded upon with new material from Joe Dever, the Scriptarium team, and the Cubicle 7 team\". In August 2014, a successful Kickstarter campaign took place and raised £68,005 to help funding the creation of the game. This new version was released at the end of September 2015.\n\n"}

Then called \"WWE Parties Ireland\", the budding company began as a Facebook page out to be '\"a hub for wrestling fans to chat & have a laugh\", and also provided a platform to promote independent wrestling shows around the country from brands such as Main Stage Wrestling and Celtic Championship Wrestling. At this stage, future host Rick Nash would begin to provide his own insights and critique on the WWE product via his wrestling blog, through which he would also announce details of future events hosted by the company.\n\nIn April 2013, following their second successful WrestleMania party, the company began to host their own 'Hall of Fame' ceremony (mimicking the WWE Hall of Fame Ceremony carried out during the weekend of WrestleMania each year). It was at this stage that the popularity of the events began to outweigh the capacity of Captain America's, and as a result future events were announced to be staged in Woolshed Baa and Grill on Parnell Street, Dublin.\n\nFollowing continued success, Nash's critical articles garnered the attention of Irish sports outlet Balls.ie, who offered Nash a position as their professional wrestling correspondent beginning in June 2013. Through this position, Nash was able to extend the reach of the events through pay-per-view prediction leagues in his articles, the winner of which would be given complimentary access to a future event. Competitions were also able to be held throughout relevant news outlets, further promoting the brand and its events.\n\nIn April 2014, in anticipation of their first WrestleMania event at the Woolshed venue, the first episode of Low Blows was released hosted by Nash and Don Marnell (now commentator for OTT Wrestling), an inductee of the company's hall of fame from the year prior.\n\nIn February 2016, in an effort to distance themselves away from WWE and cultivate the Low Blows brand established with the podcast and their twitter handle, the company was officially rebranded to Low Blows Wrestling Parties, introducing new branding to their events as of WrestleMania 32.\n\nIn June 2016, the company hosted a campaign on behalf of a five-year-old Max Birmingham, who was then suffering from a relapse of stage four neuroblastoma cancer. Because of his fascination with wrestling, Max's mother contacted the company asking for any spare memorabilia that people could give while Max is in treatment as a means of distraction from his treatment. In response, the company's Money in the Bank party was labelled with '#MemorabiliaForMax', and there was a collection of toys made to be donated to Max. Nash had to say on the matter \"“Max and his family aren’t looking for money, just toys that people already have and can afford to give away. It’s something so small for people, but it’d make a huge difference\". The event was so impactful that it drew the attention of WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley, who tweeted his support for the event saying \"Please let me know where I can send Max some cool things\".\n\nLow Blows in its current format is presented as 2 separate weekly shows, \"SmackJade\" and \"Raw in Fast Forward.\" \"SmackJade\" is hosted by Nash and professional wrestler Jade Costello, and focuses on wrestling news that has transpired over the course of the week. \"Raw in Fast Forward\" is hosted again by Nash and sports persona David Kent, and offers a more in depth view of WWE programming with specific focus on Raw and SmackDown Live.\n\nBoth shows, while offering a critical view on the world of professional wrestling, are maintained in a lighthearted manner, often employing comedic bits which are segmented throughout the show and rely on audience participation. Current segments include 'Dave's Mystery PPV' (a segment where listeners must guess an unidentified pay-per-view through a series of clues) and '30 second warning' (a segment where listeners ring in to face off against the hosts in an attempt to win tickets to a future event).\n\nDuring live podcasts, the format will typically follow a panel-style where the audience asks questions to the hosts and any special guests they might have featured. On establishing the live podcasts, Marnell stated \"Six months ago, Rick Nash approached me about co-hosting a wrestling comedy podcast -a niche market you might say. Here we are 20 episodes later and we are preparing to host our first live episode in front of an audience. Has anyone hosted a live comedy wrestling podcast before Probably not, but we’re going to give it a bash anyway!\"\n\nThe origins of Low Blows lie within the WWE pay-per-view parties hosted during the 'big four' pay-per-view events Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series. These were initially held at Captain America's restaurant on Grafton Street before being moved to Woolshed Baa and Grill due to capacity issues. As of 2017, the parties have again been moved to Buskers on the Ball due to legal issues following the 2017 Royal Rumble.\n\nEach year, usually preceding their WrestleMania party, the company hosts their own 'Hall of Fame' ceremony in the style of WWE's Hall of Fame.\n\n2017 marks the first time a live band will appear preceding one of the company's events. The Low Blows Band, a house band curated by the hosts of the podcast, will be performing a full concert based around wrestler's theme songs prior to their WrestleMania 33 party.\n"}

Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, had their headquarters. Though also often highly syncopated, it is distinct from stride piano, which was developed in New York at about the same time.\n\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists looking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex rags with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmonies. The pioneer of this style was Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confrey's novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include\nS'more,\" \"Playmor,\" \"Nifty Nonsense,\" \"Rufenreddy,\" and \"Wild And Wooly.\"\n\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of Zez Confrey's \"Kitten on the Keys\". The popularity of this piece quickly led to other Confrey works including \"Dizzy Fingers\" and \"Greenwich Witch\", and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved off center stage and took on more of a \"support\" role.\n\nAlthough novelty piano has structural and stylistic similarities to the earlier ragtime form, there are also distinct differences. Ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, so it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by the competent amateur. By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the \"hand-played\" piano roll and the phonograph record. Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music. It was a new \"turbo-charged\" piano form, shorn of hackneyed, Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic piano roll flourishes, and influenced by the \"modernistic\" sounds of the art-deco twenties (which were themselves largely adopted from the French \"Impressionist\" pianists such as Debussy and Satie; \"novelty\" pianists tended to be highly classically trained, so were fully familiar with such \"modern\" pianists, and their fondness for complex chordal intricacies).\n\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include Zez Confrey, Charley Straight, Roy Bargy, Pauline Alpert, Fred Elizalde, Rube Bloom, Clement Doucet, Max Kortlander, and Billy Mayerl.\n\n"}

Partimenti were used mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries as pedagogical aids for the teaching of harmony, counterpoint and improvisation.\n\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in the Naples conservatories and then spread throughout Europe. Notable Partimento collections were written by Alessandro Scarlatti, Francesco Durante, Leonardo Leo, Fedele Fenaroli, Giovanni Paisiello, Nicola Sala, Giacomo Tritto, Stanislao Mattei, and Luigi Palmerini. Many important Italian composers emerged from the Partimento schools, such as Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Giuseppe Verdi, Domenico Cimarosa, Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, Gaspare Spontini and Gioachino Rossini. The rediscovery of the Partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of voice leading, harmony, and musical form, such as the so-called Rule of the Octave, cadences and sequences (the movimenti, or moti del basso). There is no strict separation between counterpoint and harmony in the Partimento tradition. The beginners’ partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting figured bass as well as unfigured bass lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento fugues. Partimenti were also used as bass lines in written counterpoint exercises, over which students wrote two-, three, and four-part “disposizione” (multistave settings).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "215539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215539", "title": "Pascal's Wager", "text": "Pascal's Wager\n\nPascal's Wager is an argument in philosophy presented by the seventeenth-century French philosopher, mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal (1623–1662). It posits that humans bet with their lives that God either exists or does not.\n\nPascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell).\n\nPascal's Wager was based on the idea of the Christian God, though similar arguments have occurred in other religious traditions. The original wager was set out in section 233 of Pascal's posthumously published \"Pensées\" (\"Thoughts\"). These previously unpublished notes were assembled to form an incomplete treatise on Christian apologetics.\n\nHistorically, Pascal's Wager was groundbreaking because it charted new territory in probability theory, marked the first formal use of decision theory, and anticipated future philosophies such as existentialism, pragmatism and voluntarism.\n\nThe Wager uses the following logic (excerpts from \"Pensées\", part III, §233):\n\n\nPascal asks the reader to analyze humankind's position, where our actions can be enormously consequential but our understanding of those consequences is flawed. While we can discern a great deal through reason, we are ultimately forced to gamble. Pascal cites a number of distinct areas of uncertainty in human life:\nPascal describes humanity as a finite being trapped within an incomprehensible infinity, briefly thrust into being from non-being, with no explanation of \"Why?\" or \"What?\" or \"How?\" On Pascal's view, human finitude constrains our ability to reliably achieve truth.\n\nGiven that reason alone cannot determine whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, even if we do not know the outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.\n\nIn Pascal's assessment, participation in this wager is not optional. Merely by existing in a state of uncertainty, we are forced to choose between the available courses of action for practical purposes.\n\nThe \"Pensées\" passage on Pascal's Wager is as follows:\n\nPascal begins by painting a situation where both the existence and non-existence of God are impossible to prove by human reason. So, supposing that reason cannot determine the truth between the two options, one must \"wager\" by weighing the possible consequences. Pascal's assumption is that, when it comes to making the decision, no one can refuse to participate; withholding assent is impossible because we are already \"embarked\", effectively living out the choice.\n\nWe only have two things to stake, our \"reason\" and our \"happiness\". Pascal considers that if there is \"\"equal\" risk of loss and gain\" (i.e. a coin toss), then human reason is powerless to address the question of whether God exists. That being the case, then human reason can only decide the question according to possible resulting happiness of the decision, weighing the gain and loss in believing that God exists and likewise in believing that God does not exist.\n\nHe points out that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of happiness and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness for the possibility of gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since \"If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing\", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, \"It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable...\"\n\nPascal addressed the difficulty that 'reason' and 'rationality' pose to genuine belief by proposing that \"acting as if [one] believed\" could \"cure [one] of unbelief\":\n\nThe possibilities defined by Pascal's Wager can be thought of as a decision under uncertainty with the values of the following decision matrix.\n\nGiven these values, the option of living as if God exists (B) dominates the option of living as if God does not exist (¬B), as long as one assumes a positive probability that God exists. In other words, the expected value gained by choosing B is greater than or equal to that of choosing ¬B.\n\nIn fact, according to decision theory, the only value that matters in the above matrix is the +∞ (infinitely positive). Any matrix of the following type (where f, f, and f are all negative or finite positive numbers) results in (B) as being the only rational decision.\n\nMany criticisms have explained that the wager has been used as a supposed theory of the necessity to believe, although that was never Pascal's intention. As Laurent Thirouin writes: \n\nTo be put at the beginning of Pascal's planned book, the wager was meant to show that logical reasoning cannot support faith or lack thereof, Pascal's intended book was precisely to find other ways to establish the value of faith, an apology for the Christian faith.\n\nCriticism of Pascal's Wager began in his own day, and came from both atheists, who questioned the 'benefits' of a deity whose 'realm' is beyond reason, and the religiously orthodox, who primarily took issue with the wager's deistic and agnostic language. It is criticized for not proving God's existence, the encouragement of false belief, and the problem of which religion and which God should be worshipped. \n\nVoltaire (another prominent French writer of the Enlightenment), a generation after Pascal, rejected the idea that the wager was \"proof of God\" as \"indecent and childish\", adding, \"the interest I have to believe a thing is no proof that such a thing exists\". Pascal, however, did not advance the wager as a proof of God's existence but rather as a necessary pragmatic decision which is \"impossible to avoid\" for any living person. He argued that abstaining from making a wager is not an option and that \"reason is incapable of divining the truth\"; thus, a decision of whether to believe in the existence of God must be made by \"considering the consequences of each possibility\".\n\nVoltaire's critique concerns not the nature of the Pascalian wager as proof of God's existence, but the contention that the very belief Pascal tried to promote is not convincing. Voltaire hints at the fact that Pascal, as a Jansenist, believed that only a small, and already predestined, portion of humanity would eventually be saved by God.\n\nVoltaire explained that no matter how far someone is tempted with rewards to believe in Christian salvation, the result will be at best a faint belief. Pascal, in his Pensees, agrees with this, not stating that people can choose to believe (and therefore make a safe wager), but rather that some cannot believe.\n\nAs Étienne Souriau explained, in order to accept Pascal's argument, the bettor needs to be certain that God seriously intends to honour the bet; he says that the Wager assumes that God also accepts the bet, which is not proved; Pascal's bettor is here like the fool who seeing a leaf floating on a river's waters and quivering at some point, for a few seconds, between the two sides of a stone, says: \"I bet a million with Rothschild that it takes finally the left path.\" And, effectively, the leaf passed on the left side of the stone, but unfortunately for the fool Rothschild never said \"I [will take that] bet\".\n\nSince there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the Wager, in an argument known as the argument from inconsistent revelations. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in \"the wrong god\", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager. Denis Diderot, a contemporary of Voltaire, concisely expressed this opinion when asked about the Wager, saying \"an Imam could reason the same way\". J. L. Mackie notes that \"the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but perhaps that of the Anabaptists or members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the Muslim Sunnis or the worshipers of Kali or of Odin.\"\n\nAnother version of this objection argues that for every religion that promulgates rules, there exists another religion that has rules of the opposite kind. If a certain action leads one closer to salvation in the former religion, it leads one further away from it in the latter. Therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion could be negative. Or, one could also argue that there are an infinite number of mutually exclusive religions (which is a subset of the set of all possible religions), and that the probability of any one of them being true is zero; therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion is zero.\n\nPascal considers this type of objection briefly in the notes compiled into the \"Pensées\", and dismisses it as obviously wrong and disingenuous:\n\nThis short but densely packed passage, which alludes to numerous themes discussed elsewhere in the \"Pensées\", has given rise to many pages of scholarly analysis.\n\nPascal says that unbelievers who rest content with the many-religions objection are people whose scepticism has seduced them into a fatal \"repose\". If they were really bent on knowing the truth, they would be persuaded to examine \"in detail\" whether Christianity is like any other religion, but they just cannot be bothered. Their objection might be sufficient were the subject concerned merely some \"question in philosophy\", but not \"here, where everything is at stake\". In \"a matter where they themselves, their eternity, their all are concerned\", they can manage no better than \"a superficial reflection\" (\"une reflexion légère\") and, thinking they have scored a point by asking a leading question, they go off to amuse themselves.\n\nAs Pascal scholars observe, Pascal regarded the many-religions objection as a rhetorical ploy, a \"trap\" that he had no intention of falling into. If, however, any who raised it were sincere, they would want to examine the matter \"in detail\". In that case, they could get some pointers by turning to his chapter on \"other religions\".\n\nAs David Wetsel notes, Pascal's treatment of the pagan religions is brisk: \"As far as Pascal is concerned, the demise of the pagan religions of antiquity speaks for itself. Those pagan religions which still exist in the New World, in India, and in Africa are not even worth a second glance. They are obviously the work of superstition and ignorance and have nothing in them which might interest 'les gens habiles' ('clever men')\". Islam warrants more attention, being distinguished from paganism (which for Pascal presumably includes all the other non-Christian religions) by its claim to be a revealed religion. Nevertheless, Pascal concludes that the religion founded by Mohammed can on several counts be shown to be devoid of divine authority, and that therefore, as a path to the knowledge of God, it is as much a dead end as paganism. Judaism, in view of its close links to Christianity, he deals with elsewhere.\n\nThe many-religions objection is taken more seriously by some later apologists of the Wager, who argue that, of the rival options, only those awarding infinite happiness affect the Wager's dominance. In the opinion of these apologists \"finite, semi-blissful promises such as Kali's or Odin's\" therefore drop out of consideration. Also, the infinite bliss that the rival conception of God offers has to be mutually exclusive. If Christ's promise of bliss can be attained concurrently with Jehovah's and Allah's (all three being identified as the God of Abraham), there is no conflict in the decision matrix in the case where the cost of believing in the wrong conception of God is neutral (limbo/purgatory/spiritual death), although this would be countered with an infinite cost in the case where not believing in the correct conception of God results in punishment (hell).\n\nFurthermore, ecumenical interpretations of the Wager argue that it could even be suggested that believing in a generic God, or a god by the wrong name, is acceptable so long as that conception of God has similar essential characteristics of the conception of God considered in Pascal's Wager (perhaps the God of Aristotle). Proponents of this line of reasoning suggest that either all of the conceptions of God or gods throughout history truly boil down to just a small set of \"genuine options\", or that if Pascal's Wager can simply bring a person to believe in \"generic theism\" it has done its job.\n\nPascal argues implicitly for the uniqueness of Christianity in the Wager itself, writing: \"If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible...Who then can blame the Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, professing as they do a religion which they cannot explain by reason?\"\n\nSome critics argue that Pascal's Wager, for those who cannot believe, suggests feigning belief to gain eternal reward. This would be dishonest and immoral. In addition, it is absurd to think that God, being just and omniscient, would not see through this deceptive strategy on the part of the \"believer\", thus nullifying the benefits of the Wager.\n\nSince these criticisms are concerned not with the validity of the Wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find himself unable to sincerely believe—they are tangential to the thrust of the Wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal's subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God's existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes him a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, \"I am so made that I cannot believe. What would you have me do?\" Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: \"God looks only at what is inward.\" For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the Wager but cannot seem to put his heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.\n\nExplicitly addressing the question of inability to believe, Pascal argues that if the Wager is valid, the inability to believe is irrational, and therefore must be caused by feelings: \"your inability to believe, because reason compels you to [believe] and yet you cannot, [comes] from your passions.\" This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: \"Learn from those who were bound like you. . . . Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.—'But this is what I am afraid of.'—And why? What have you to lose?\"\n\nSome other critics have objected to Pascal's Wager on the grounds that he wrongly assumes what type of epistemic character God would likely value in his rational creatures if he existed. More specifically, Richard Carrier has objected by positing an alternative conception of God that prefers his creatures to be honest inquirers and disapproves of thoughtless or feigned belief:\n\n\n\n"}

These films presented subjects such as actor Frederick Warde reading an original poem \"A Sunset Reverie\", labor leader Samuel Gompers speaking on labor issues, Judge Ben Lindsey on the need for a separate juvenile court system, Irvin S. Cobb reading from his works, and a lecture by James J. Davis, Secretary of Labor in the Harding administration.\n\nKellum also filmed musical numbers, including a performance of the song \"De Ducks\" by African American musicians F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles who wrote the book for the musical \"Shuffle Along\" (1921), and \"The Famous Van Eps Trio in a Bit of Jazz\" (1921), featuring Fred Van Eps, father of musician George Van Eps.\n\nA filmed performance by Sir Harry Lauder made in Phono-Kinema is preserved at the UCLA Film and Television Archive but the disc with the sound is lost.\n\nThe process was most famously used by D. W. Griffith to record singing and sound effects sequences for his movie \"Dream Street\" (1921). Employing the Phonokinema system, Griffith turned what was originally a silent film into a sound film. Earlier crude sound-on-disc and sound-on-cylinder systems had been invented 1894-1914 by Thomas Edison (Kinetophone, Kinetophonograph), Cameraphone in the US, Gaumont (Chronomegaphone) and Pathé in France, and others, but they were only used for short films. \"Dream Street\" was the first feature-length film in which a frame-synchronous human voice was heard from a sound recording of any kind.\n\nSome prints of \"Dream Street\" show Griffith speaking in a brief introduction to the film. However, the sound quality was poor, and \"Dream Street\" was only shown with sound at two theaters in New York City.\n\nThe silent version premiered on April 12, 1921 at the Central Theatre in New York City. On April 27, Griffith and Ralph Graves filmed and recorded their respective sound segments at Orlando Kellum's Photokinema office at 203 West 40th Street.\n\nThe premiere of the sound version of \"Dream Street\" took place on May 2, 1921 at Town Hall in New York City with Griffith's introduction. On May 15, the film also featured two other short sound sequences — Ralph Graves singing, and background noise in a scene showing a craps game. Unfortunately, no other theaters could show the sound version of the film, since no other theaters had the Photokinema sound system installed.\n\nOn Sunday, May 29, \"Dream Street\" moved to the Schubert-Crescent Theater in Brooklyn in a program with Phonokinema short films. However, business was poor and the program soon closed.\n\nPhonokinema was soon overshadowed by the Lee De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film system which premiered in New York City on 15 April 1923. Phonofilm was itself overtaken by the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, premiered in New York with \"Don Juan\" on 6 August 1926, and by other sound-on-film systems such as Fox Movietone in 1927 and RCA Photophone in 1928.\n\nAccording to Internet Movie Database, two low-budget Westerns released in 1930, \"Sagebrush Politics\" and \"The Apache Kid's Escape\", the latter film with Western star Jack Perrin, were the last two films released in the Phonokinema system.\n\nIn 1982, Kellum's widow donated the surviving films made with the Phonokinema process to the UCLA Film and Television Archive.\n\n\n"}

It is priced at 1500 Wii Points in Europe, and 1000 Wii Points in North America.\n\n\"Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint\" involves painting a sequence of tiles, called \"plättchen\" (which means \"platelet\" in German) the same color to make them disappear, with special tiles also painted in the sequence contributing to a point meter that must be filled in order to pass the stage. In addition to a short time limit to paint their tiles, the player must contend with items on the play field that hinder their progress, obstacles that can destroy their personified cursor, gravity that shifts tiles across the play area and unpaintable tiles.\n\nThe game includes a single player mode as well as several offline multiplayer modes where up to 8 players can take part. The single player mode includes over 100 levels, which developer Bplus claims can take from minutes to weeks to perfect.\n\nPlayers use the pointer function of the Wii Remote, twisting it left and right to change the color to be painted. The game also features support for the Wii Zapper, with the developers claiming that playing with the Zapper brings some advantages over the other available controller configurations. \"Plättchen\" was originally intended to include a multiplayer mode which made use of four sets of DK Bongos, but Nintendo has requested this functionality to be removed. It was replaced by a new \"Bomb Rain Party Mode\". In addition, the game also features \"Copycat\" and \"Mission\" modes which must be unlocked.\n\nWiiWare World gave \"Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint\" a 3/10, deriding the overcomplexity of the game and the high price it was being sold at in Europe, which they said was \"extortionate\". In summary, they called the game \"the videogame equivalent of trying to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time; there are too many elements to consider in tandem for this to be considered to be much fun\". Eurogamer, which gave the game 5/10, called \"Plättchen\" \"a game buried under an avalanche of ideas, few of which are adequately developed or incorporated into a coherent play experience\" with its more interesting elements \"obscured by a deluge of vaguely explained and often conflicting gameplay concepts\". Nintendo Power rated this game \"Grumble Grumble\", stating that \"everything is about the game is overly complex - from a lack of clear level goals to the seemingly random need to shoot down asteroids while matching up colored tiles.\"\n\nOn the other side, IGN rated the game with 7.4/10 (Decent), calling it a \"pretty entertaining game and some great (but strange) concepts buried within this very unconventional WiiWare offering.\" They say: \"if you're looking for something truly original, and don't mind taking a gamble, Plattchen is certainly a one-of-a-kind offering.\"\n"}

Within the first year of its existence, the PPA garnered over 600,000 members. In April 2008, the PPA claimed to have signed up its one millionth member. Membership growth has been due in part to promotional activities by online poker cardrooms like Party Poker.\n\nThis organization unsuccessfully lobbied against the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which prohibited financial institutions from making payments to internet gambling sites. Many online poker sites suspended U.S. operations. Other sites have continued to serve U.S. customers, citing legal opinions that UIGEA does not apply to poker.\n\nThe PPA aims to overturn laws such as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, whether through political or judicial means. For example, the PPA in conjunction with online poker sites, dedicated June 15, 2006 as \"Write Your Congressmen Day.\" Another example is the \"PPA Fly-In\", where around 100 members and many professional poker players, including Annie Duke, Howard Lederer, and Chris Ferguson, flew to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress for poker rights.\n\nThe PPA hired former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato as its chairman. In an interview with Cardplayer Magazine, he said \"What really needs to happen is to have a legitimate house, a fair game, and a fair operator, and not take away from 20-plus-million citizens who play poker the opportunity to play poker on the Internet.\" D'Amato went on to point out that under the current legislation, that the companies \"with good business practices\" could potentially be replaced by \"those who do not care\" because the U.S. is driving \"the industry offshore, where we have no regulation and no controls.\"\n\nMichael Bolcerek, the former president of the PPA, says that the PPA has been able to mount a counteroffensive to the anti-gaming bills on Capitol Hill. He states:\n\"Opponents of online gambling fail to realize that sweeping it under the rug will only serve to exacerbate any issues with problem gambling. Turning the wildly popular Internet poker from a common pastime to an illegal activity, banned by Congress, will ultimately ensure that problem gamblers do not confront their issues with gambling and drive them further underground. Regulation and taxation, however, would provide billions in revenue for federal and state governments. These funds could be used to treat problem gamblers and to educate adults and youths alike on the dangers of gambling addictions.\"\nBolcerek has appeared on over 60 local stations, CNN, CNBC, and Fox to get his message out.\n\nIn August 2007, the organization announced Michael Bolcerek had stepped down as President. John Pappas filled the role vacated by Bolcerek.\n\nShortly after the 2009 WSOP began, the Southern District of New York Action Against Online Poker Players seized $34 million from over 27,000 accounts of poker players affiliated with Full Tilt Poker, Absolute Poker, Ultimate Bet and PokerStars. Jeff Ifrah, the attorney for one of the disbursement companies affected, said that the government “has never seized an account that belongs to players who are engaged in what [Ifrah] would contend is a lawful act of playing peer-to-peer poker online.” The timing of the seizure may have been intentionally timed to affect the access to people's accounts during the World Series of Poker.\n\nIn July 2009, the PPA held National Poker Week, an effort to rally support for H.R. 2267, the Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act. More than 350,000 people signed the petition supporting the licensing and regulation of online poker and more than 150,000 letters were sent to Members of Congress during National Poker Week. Additionally the PPA and its membership held more than 100 meetings with Members of Congress.\n\nThe PPA supports several bills in Congress that amend UIGEA. The Skill Game Protection Act (HR 2610), proposed by Rep. Robert Wexler (D-FL), provides an exemption to UIGEA for games of skill, including poker, mah jong, bridge, and other games. As of December 15, 2007, HR 2610 has 20 cosponsors. The Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 2046), proposed by Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), provides for federal licensing and regulation of online gaming sites. As of December 15, this bill has 45 cosponsors. The Internet Gambling Study Act (H.R. 2140), proposed . Shelley Berkley (D-NV), provides for a study by the National Academy of Sciences to identify the proper response of the United States to the growth of Internet gambling. As of December 15, this bill has 68 cosponsors.\n\nIn April 2007, Rep Barney Frank (D-Mass) introduced a bill (the aforementioned HR 2046) that would not simply repeal the 2006 bill, but would open up a U.S. based market for online gambling. The Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2007 \"would establish a regulatory and enforcement framework to license companies to accept bets and wagers online from individuals in the U.S.\" The act would address underage and compulsive gambling, while providing safeguards for Americans. Legalizing these transactions would enable the government to tax and monitor fund transfers. This would allow transactions to be checked \"against a number of anti-fraud, money laundering and terrorism databases\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59036988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59036988", "title": "Social media use in hiring", "text": "Social media use in hiring\n\nSocial media use in hiring refers to the examination by employers of job applicants' social media profiles as part of the hiring assessment. Some employers use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees. \nThis issue raises many ethical questions that some consider an employer's right and others consider discrimination. Except in the states of California, Maryland, and Illinois, there are no laws that prohibit employers from using social media profiles as a basis of whether or not someone should be hired. Title VII also prohibits discrimination during any aspect of employment including hiring or firing, recruitment, or testing. Social media has been integrating into the workplace and this has led to conflicts within employees and employers. Particularly, Facebook has been seen as a popular platform for employers to investigate in order to learn more about potential employees. This conflict first started in Maryland when an employer requested and received an employee's Facebook username and password. State lawmakers first introduced legislation in 2012 to prohibit employers from requesting passwords to personal social accounts in order to get a job or to keep a job. This led to Canada, Germany, the U.S. Congress and 11 U.S. states to pass or propose legislation that prevents employers' access to private social accounts of employees.\n\nMany Western European countries have already implemented laws that restrict the regulation of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation that protects potential employees and current employees from employers that demand them to give forth their username or password for a social media account. Laws that forbid employers from disciplining an employee based on activity off the job on social media sites have also been put into act in states including California, Colorado, Connecticut, North Dakota, and New York. Several states have similar laws that protect students in colleges and universities from having to grant access to their social media accounts. Eight states have passed the law that prohibits post secondary institutions from demanding social media login information from any prospective or current students and privacy legislation has been introduced or is pending in at least 36 states as of July 2013. As of May 2014, legislation has been introduced and is in the process of pending in at least 28 states and has been enacted in Maine and Wisconsin. In addition, the National Labor Relations Board has been devoting a lot of their attention to attacking employer policies regarding social media that can discipline employees who seek to speak and post freely on social media sites.\n\nUse of social media by young people has caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media when they try to enter the job market. A survey of 17,000 young people in six countries in 2013 found that 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of online comments they made on social media websites. A 2014 survey of recruiters found that 93% of them check candidates' social media postings. Moreover, professor Stijn Baert of Ghent University conducted a field experiment in which fictitious job candidates applied for real job vacancies in Belgium. They were identical except in one respect: their Facebook profile photos. It was found that candidates with the most wholesome photos were a lot more likely to receive invitations for job interviews than those with the more controversial photos. In addition, Facebook profile photos had a greater impact on hiring decisions when candidates were highly educated.\n\nThese cases have created some privacy implications as to whether or not companies should have the right to look at employee's Facebook profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation of Facebook policy. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.\n"}
{"id": "5757260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5757260", "title": "Speed-ball", "text": "Speed-ball\n\nSpeed-Ball is a racquet sport invented in Egypt in 1961 by Mohamed Lotfy for the training of beginner tennis players. Today it is a sport in its own right, enjoying popularity not only in Egypt but in other countries. Several of these countries make up the International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB).\n\nA hollow ball in latex revolves around a metallic mast (1,70m high) which is linked by a nylon thread (fishing thread type) of 1,70m length. The thread is knotted to the mast by a loop or a plastic ring freely revolving around a reel. The mast is fixed in a base from 40 kg to 90 kg. The ball is elliptic and is hit with a rigid plastic racquet with a small handle and a strings around 25 cm of diameter. The speed-ball court is about 6x4 m. for the single match and 8x6 m. for the doubles.\n\nSpeed-ball is played alone (super-solo), with two players (single match), or four players (double match),or four players (relay)\n\nIn \"Super-solo\", the aim is to hit the ball a maximum times in one minute. At first with the right hand, then a minute again with the left hand, then with two racquets in fore-hand only, then with two racquets in back-hand only. The number of hits of each movement is added to make the final score of the solo.\n\nThe duration of one movement is 30 seconds for the players under 14 years old and one minute for older players. A break of 30 seconds for all classes is granted behind each movement.\n\nThe best players can do up to 160 hits in one minute.\nThe current men's world record is 614 hits, set by Egypt's Mohamed Nagy, while the women's record of 539 hits set by Egyptian Noha AbouZeid in the 26th world championship In Kuwait.\n\nThe \"single match\" is played by two players, each with one racquet. Each player has their own ground, separated by a neutral strip 60 cm wide (the diameter of the speed-ball's base). A match is divided into games of 10 points. The players attempt to hit the ball once each in turn, inverting its direction of rotation. To score points, the ball must pass twice successively across the opponent's ground, without the opponent being able to return it. If there is a fault, the point is missed and there is a new service. The service is alternated according to who wins each point. The first player to score 10 points wins the game. The first player who wins two games (three games for men's seniors) wins the match.\n\nThe \"double match\" takes place like the single, in two teams of two players. In each team, the players serve and hit the ball alternatively. The general rules are the same as the single.\n\nSpecific mistakes involve the player's rotation and reception of the ball.\n\nThe International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB) was founded in 1984 by the membership of Egypt, France, and Japan. Several other countries joined the federation (Kuwait, KSA, Austria, Slovenia, Denmark, Sudan, India, Lebanon, Nigeria, Afghanistan, UAE, ...).\n\n"}
{"id": "83491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83491", "title": "Story within a story", "text": "Story within a story\n\nA story within a story is a literary device in which one character within a narrative narrates. \"Mise en abyme\" is the French term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in heraldry of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: novels, short stories, plays, television programs, films, poems, songs, and philosophical essays. The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story. Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world. When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the reliability of the storyteller are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story. In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded ideas that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of deleted scenes with DVD releases of films. Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.\n\nThe literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a \"frame story\", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or \"frame\" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.\n\nThe earliest examples of \"frame stories\" and \"stories within stories\" were in ancient Egyptian and Indian literature, such as the Egyptian Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor and Indian epics like the \"Ramayana\", \"Seven Wise Masters\", \"Hitopadesha\" and \"Vikram and the Vampire\". In Vishnu Sarma's \"Panchatantra\", an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic \"Mahabharata\", the Kurukshetra War is narrated by a character in Vyasa's \"Jaya\", which itself is narrated by a character in Vaisampayana's \"Bharata\", which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's \"Mahabharata\".\n\nBoth \"The Golden Ass\" by Apuleius and \"Metamorphoses\" by Ovid extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by Scheherazade. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories. An example of this is \"The Three Apples\", a murder mystery narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a flashback of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an unreliable narrator tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him. As the story concludes, the \"\" is narrated within it. This perennially popular work can be traced back to Arabic, Persian, and Indian storytelling traditions. \n\nMary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes. Similarly, Roald Dahl's story \"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\" is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to \"see\" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.\n\nChaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" and Boccacio's Decameron are also classic frame stories. In Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. Homer's \"Odyssey\" too makes use of this device; Odysseus' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king Alcinous in Scheria. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the \"Odyssey\". Many modern children's story collections are essentially anthology works connected by this device, such as Arnold Lobel's \"Mouse Tales\", Paula Fox's \"The Little Swineherd\", and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's \"Ears and Tails and Common Sense\".\n\nA well-known modern example of framing is \"The Princess Bride\" (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of \"The Princess Bride\" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own \"Good Parts Version\" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called \"The Princess Bride\" by a nonexistent author named S. Morgenstern.\nIn the Welsh novel, Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert (1852) by Gwilym Hiraethog a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of Uncle Tom's Cabin to those gathered around the hearth.\n\nSometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", each episode was framed as though it were being told by Indy when he was older (usually acted by George Hall, but once by Harrison Ford). The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Christmas Story\", and the television show \"The Wonder Years\".\n\nIn The Amory Wars, a tale told through the music of Coheed and Cambria, tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.\n\nThe critically acclaimed Beatles album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, \"A Day in the Life\" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the Fugees album \"The Score\" is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable concept albums, while Wyclef Jean's \"The Carnival\" is presented as testimony at a trial. The majority of Ayreon's albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of Janelle Monae.\n\nIn his 1895 historical novel \"Pharaoh\", Bolesław Prus introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from vignettes to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from ancient Egyptian texts, that further the plot, illuminate characters, and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters. Jan Potocki's \"The Manuscript Found in Saragossa\" (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.\n\nThe provenance of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J. R. R. Tolkien, which depicts the Red Book of Westmarch (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The subtitle of \"The Hobbit\" (\"There and Back Again\") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and \"The Lord of the Rings\" is a part of the final title.\n\nAn example of an interconnected inner story is \"The Mad Trist\" in Edgar Allan Poe's \"Fall of the House of Usher\", where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in \"The Mad Trist\" begins happening in \"The Fall of the House of Usher\". Also, in \"Don Quixote\" by Cervantes, there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).\n\nA commonly independently anthologised story is \"The Grand Inquisitor\" by Dostoevsky from his long psychological novel \"The Brothers Karamazov\", which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.\n\nAn example of a \"bonus material\" style inner story is the chapter \"The Town Ho's Story\" in Herman Melville's novel \"Moby-Dick\"; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting mutiny and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing \"Moby-Dick\"—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to create and develop. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by telling the story to his impressed friends. \n\nWith the rise of literary modernism, writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is James Merrill's 1974 modernist poem \"Lost in Translation\".\n\nIn Rabih Alameddine's novel \"The Hakawati\", or \"The Storyteller\", the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.\n\nIn Sue Townsend's \"\", Adrian writes a book entitled \"Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland\", in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called \"Sparg of Kronk\", whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.\n\nDreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep. Both the book \"The Arabian Nightmare\" and the curse of \"eternal waking\" from the Neil Gaiman series \"The Sandman\" feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream. In Charles Maturin's novel \"Melmoth the Wanderer\", the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.\n\nThis structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts. The structure of \"The Symposium\" and \"Phaedo\", attributed to Plato, is of a story within a story within a story. In the Christian Bible, the gospels are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of Jesus. However, they also include within them the stories (parables) that Jesus told. In more modern philosophical work, Jostein Gaarder's books often feature this device. Examples are \"The Solitaire Mystery\", where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and \"Sophie's World\" about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.\n\nThe experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced. These include most of the various novels written by the American author Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut includes the recurring character Kilgore Trout in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious science fiction writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\" are sprinkled with these plot descriptions. Stanisław Lem's \"Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius\" from \"The Cyberiad\" has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl. \n\n\"House of Leaves\" is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. \n\nRobert A. Heinlein's later books (\"The Number of the Beast\", \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\" and \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\") propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This hypothesis enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations. Margaret Atwood's novel \"The Blind Assassin\" is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a science fiction story written by one of \"that\" novel's characters. \n\nIn Philip K. Dick's novel \"The Man in the High Castle\", each character comes into interaction with a book called \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\", which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the Axis Powers of World War II had succeeded in dominating the known world, the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history. \n\nIn \"Red Orc's Rage\" by Philip J. Farmer a doubly recursive method is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the \"World of Tiers\". Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.\n\nThe \"Quantum Leap\" novel \"Knights Of The Morningstar\" also features a character who writes a book by that name. In Matthew Stover's novel \"Shatterpoint\", the protagonist Mace Windu narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the third-person limited point of view. \n\nSeveral \"Star Trek\" tales are stories or events within stories, such as Gene Roddenberry's novelization of \"\", J. A. Lawrence's \"Mudd's Angels\", John M. Ford's \"The Final Reflection\", Margaret Wander Bonanno's \"Strangers from the Sky\" (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's \"Research\" in the anthology \" II\". Steven Barnes's novelization of \"Far Beyond the Stars\" partners with Greg Cox's \"\" (Volume Two) to tell us that the story \"Far Beyond the Stars\"—and, by extension, all of \"Star Trek\" itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.\n\nThe book \"Cloud Atlas\" (later adapted into a film by The Wachowkis and Tom Tykwer) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that \"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future.\"\n\n\"The Crying of Lot 49\" by Thomas Pynchon has several characters seeing a play called \"The Courier's Tragedy\" by the fictitious Jacobean playwright Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in \"Hamlet\", the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls. A significant portion of Walter Moers' \"Labyrinth of Dreaming Books\" is an ekphrasis on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation. Another example is found in Samuel Delany's \"Trouble on Triton\", which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences. Plays produced by the \"Caws of Art\" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, The Mouse and His Child.\n\nIn Manuel Puig's \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\", ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative. In Paul Russell's \"Boys of Life\", descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director Pier Paulo Pasolini) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative. They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.\n\nThis dramatic device was probably first used by Thomas Kyd in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action. From references in other contemporary works, Kyd is also assumed to have been the writer of an early, lost version of \"Hamlet\" (the so-called \"Ur-Hamlet\"), with a play-within-a-play interlude. William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" retains this device by having Hamlet ask some strolling players to perform the \"Murder of Gonzago\". The action and characters in \"The Murder\" mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying \"the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\" Hamlet calls this new play \"The Mouse-trap\" (a title that Agatha Christie later took for the long-running play \"The Mousetrap\"). The play \"I Hate Hamlet\" and the movie \"A Midwinter's Tale\" are about a production of \"Hamlet\", which in turn includes a production of \"The Murder of Gonzago\", as does the Hamlet-based film \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\" which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" there are specific allusions to \"Hamlet\": in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.\n\nShakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"and \"Love's Labours Lost\". Almost the whole of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince Christopher Sly, a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her \"lord\" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" is about the production of a fictitious musical, \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" based on the Shakespeare play of the same name, and features several scenes from it. \"Pericles\" draws in part on the 14th century \"Confessio Amantis\" (itself a frame story) by John Gower and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower \"assume man's infirmities\" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play. \n\nIn Francis Beaumont's \"Knight of the Burning Pestle\" (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a \"planted\" actor, condemns the play that has just started and \"persuades\" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's \"apprentice\" then acts, pretending to extemporise, in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.\n\nThe opera \"Pagliacci\" is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer Richard Rodney Bennett and playwright-librettist Beverley Cross's \"The Mines of Sulphur\" features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' \"Nixon in China\" (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's \"Red Detachment of Women\" to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.\n\nIn Bertolt Brecht's \"The Caucasian Chalk Circle,\" a play is staged as a parable to villagers in the Soviet Union to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an \"'induction'\". Brecht's one-act play \"The Elephant Calf\" (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his \"Man Equals Man\".\n\nIn Jean Giraudoux's play \"Ondine\", all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the dramatic tension and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the mortal Hans and water sprite Ondine.\n\n\"The Two-Character Play\" by Tennessee Williams has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.\n\n\"The Mysteries\", a modern reworking of the medieval mystery plays, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.\n\nAlternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in \"Noises Off\", \"A Chorus of Disapproval\" or \"Lilies\". Similarly, the musical \"Man of La Mancha\" presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by \"Quixote\"'s author, Miguel de Cervantes.\n\nIn most stagings of the musical \"Cats\", which include the song \"Growltiger's Last Stand\" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady Griddlebone sings \"The Ballad of Billy McCaw\". (However, many productions of the show omit \"Growltiger's Last Stand\", and \"The Ballad of Billy McCaw\" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In \"\", there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.\n\nA play within a play also occurs in the musical \"The King and I\", where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of \"Small House of Uncle Thomas\" (or \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\") to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.\n\nIn stagings of Dina Rubina's play \"Always the Same Dream\", the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by Pushkin.\n\nJoseph Heller's 1967 play \"We Bombed in New Haven\" is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.\n\nThe 1937 musical Babes in Arms is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money. The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. A similar plot was recycled for the films White Christmas and The Blues Brothers.\n\nTV Tropes maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device. \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as \"Mabel's Dramatic Career\" (1913).\n\nThe François Truffaut film \"Day for Night\" is about the making of a fictitious movie called \"Meet Pamela\" (\"Je vous présente Pamela\") and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of \"Pamela\" involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in \"Day for Night\". There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film. These include the darkly satirical classic \"Sunset Boulevard\" about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce \"Hail, Caesar!\"\n\nThe script to Karel Reisz's movie \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1981), written by Harold Pinter, is a film-within-a-film adaptation of John Fowles's book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.\n\nIn Buster Keaton's \"Sherlock, Jr.\", Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the Arnold Schwarzenegger children's film \"The Last Action Hero\". A similar device is used in the seminal music video \"Take on me\" by A-ha, which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, Woody Allen's \"Purple Rose of Cairo\" is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world. Allen's earlier film \"Play it Again, Sam\" featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic \"Casablanca\" as a central device.\n\nThe 2002 Pedro Almodóvar film \"Talk to Her\" (\"Hable con ella\") has the chief character Benigno tell a story called \"The Shrinking Lover\" to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents \"The Shrinking Lover\" in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, \"The Shrinking Lover\" protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of \"Talk to Her\"—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that \"The Shrinking Lover\" essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in \"Talk to Her,\" the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. \"The Shrinking Lover\" was named Best Scene of 2002 in the \"Skandies\", an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.\n\n\"Tropic Thunder\" (2008) is a comedy film revolving around a group of prima donna actors making a Vietnam War film (itself also named \"Tropic Thunder\") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out. The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy Three Amigos, where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies. The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the Star Trek parody Galaxy Quest.\n\nThe first episode of the anime series \"The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya\" consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with Kyon's typical, sarcastic commentary.\n\nChuck Jones's 1953 cartoon \"Duck Amuck\" shows Daffy Duck trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by Bugs Bunny. The \"Duck Amuck\" plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, \"Rabbit Rampage\" (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator (Elmer Fudd). A similar plot was also included in an episode of \"Baby Looney Tunes\", in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the \"Duck Amuck\" sequence was parodied on \"Drawn Together\" (\"Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care\").\n\nAll feature-length films by Jörg Buttgereit except \"Schramm\" feature a film within the film. In \"Nekromantik\", the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film \"Vera\". In \"Der Todesking\" one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film \"Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo\" and in \"Nekromantik 2\", the characters go to see a movie called \"Mon dejeuner avec Vera\" which is a parody of Louis Malle's \"My Dinner with André\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" depicts a Nazi propaganda film called \"Nation's Pride\", which glorifies a soldier in the German army. \"Nation's Pride\" is directed by Eli Roth.\n\nJoe Dante's \"Matinee\" depicts \"Mant\", an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an ant. In one scene, the protagonists see a Disney-style family movie called \"The Shook-Up Shopping Cart\".\n\nThe 2002 martial arts epic Hero presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences. Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 Terry Gilliam film The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and the 2003 Tim Burton film Big Fish, the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator. In the 2006 Tarsem film \"The Fall\", an injured silent-movie stuntman tells heroic fantasy stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's \"present-tense\" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to \"Indians,\" “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle. The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama The Usual Suspects (which garnered an Oscar for Kevin Spacey's performance).\n\nThe seminal 1950 Japanese film \"Rashomon\", based on the Japanese short story \"In a Grove\" (1921), utilizes the flashback-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered samurai, his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.\n\nThe movie \"Inception\" has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams. Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the Michael Jackson song \"Thriller\", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream. The film \"Grand Budapest Hotel\" has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.\n\nThe 2001 film \"Moulin Rouge!\" features a fictitious musical within a film, called \"Spectacular Spectacular\". The 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy \"To Be or Not to Be\" confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, \"The Naughty Nazis\", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. \"Hamlet\" also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. Laurence Olivier sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of \"Henry V\" in the tiring room of the old Globe Theatre as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these \"stage\" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the Battle of Agincourt. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe. Mel Brook's film, \"The Producers\", revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, \"Springtime For Hitler.\" Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The Outkast music video for the song \"Roses\" is a short film about a high school musical.\n\nThe main plot device in \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\" is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.\n\nIn \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\", the middle-schoolers put on a play of \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nThe 1990 biopic Korczak, about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of Rabindranath Tagore's \"The Post Office\", which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death. That same production is also featured in the stage play \"Korczak's Children,\" also inspired by the same historical events.\n\nThe 1973 film adaptation of Peter Nichols's 1969 play, \"The National Health\" features a send-up of a typical American hospital soap-opera being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably British NHS hospital.\n\nThe Jim Carey film The Truman Show is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.\n\nThe first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly Tim Stryker's 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame. Another early use of this trope was in Cliff Johnson's 1987 hit The Fool's Errand, a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.\n\n\"Power Factor\" has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a \"Virtual Reality Simulator\", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace. The \".hack\" franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and Haseo try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.\n\nMore commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the \"Yakuza\" and \"Shenmue\" franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy VII\" there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In \"Animal Crossing\", the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a Nintendo Entertainment System. In \"Fallout 4\", the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.\n\nIn the Remedy video game title \"Max Payne\" players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are \"Lords & Ladies\", \"Captain Baseball Bat Boy\", \"\" and the pinnacle television serial \"Address Unknown\" -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly \"Twin Peaks\", Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.\n\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.\n\n\"Terrance & Phillip\" from \"South Park\" comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, \"The Simpsons\", Bart's favorite cartoon, \"Itchy and Scratchy\" (a parody of \"Tom & Jerry\"), often echoes the plotlines of the main show. \"The Simpsons\" also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\".\n\nOn the show \"Dear White People\", the \"Scandal\" parody \"Defamation\" offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships. Similarly, on the HBO show \"Insecure\" the slavery-era soap opera \"Due North\" is an obsession for the show's main characters.\n\nThe Irish television series \"Father Ted\" features a television show, \"Father Ben\", which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.\n\nThe television shows \"30 Rock\", \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\", \"Sonny with a Chance\", and \"Kappa Mikey\" feature a sketch show within the TV show.\n\nAn extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom \"Seinfeld\" dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives. The gag was reprised on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", another semi-autobiographical show by and about \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated \"Seinfeld\" reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.\n\nThe \"USS Callister\" episode of the \"Black Mirror\" anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.\n\nThe concept of a film within a television series is employed in the Macross universe. \"\" (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" (1982), but was later \"retconned\" into the Macross canon as a popular movie within the television series \"Macross 7\" (1994).\n\n\"Seinfeld\" had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably \"Rochelle, Rochelle\", a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller \"Death Castle\" is a central element of the \"Master of None\" episode \"New York, I Love You.\"\n\nStories inside stories can allow for genre changes. Arthur Ransome uses the device to let his young characters in the \"Swallows and Amazons series\" of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, \"Peter Duck\" and \"Missee Lee\" (and some would include \"Great Northern?\" as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters. Similarly, the film version of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" uses a story within a story format to tell a purely fantastic fairy tale within a relatively more realistic frame-story. The film version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream. Lewis Carroll's celebrated \"Alice\" books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known \"Sylvie and Bruno\" subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the \"real\" world.\nSome stories feature what might be called a literary version of the Droste effect, where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many fractals). Among the stories that include versions of themselves are Neil Gaiman's \"\" which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including \"Cerements\" (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in Charlie Kaufman's 2008 film \"Synecdoche, New York\", the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world. The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.\n\nThe long-running musical A Chorus Line dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members. The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.\n\nMichael Ende's classic children's novel The Neverending Story prominently features a book of the same title. This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element. Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy Stranger than Fiction the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.\n\nIn Douglas Hofstadter's \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", there is a narrative between Achilles and the Tortoise (characters borrowed from Lewis Carroll, who in turn borrowed them from Zeno), and within this story they find a book entitled \"Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe\", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled \"Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe\", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.\n\nThe music video for the Björk song \"Bachelorette\" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.\n\nEpisode 14 of the anime series \"Martian Successor Nadesico\" is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on \"Gekigangar III\", an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a paradox.\n\n\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by Steven Spielberg. Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film Pee-Wee's Big Adventure ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with James Brolin as a more stereotypically manly version of the Paul Reubens title character. Mel Brooks's 1974 comedy \"Blazing Saddles\" leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the Warner Bros. studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at Grauman's Chinese Theater, which is showing the \"premiere\" of \"Blazing Saddles\"; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film. Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 \"Star Wars\" parody, \"Spaceballs\", where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release). Brooks also made the 1976 parody \"Silent Movie\" about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated \"The Artist\").\n\nIn the latter two films of the \"Scream\" horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In \"Scream 2\", characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first \"Scream\" film, while in \"Scream 3\" the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest \"Scream\" movie, \"Scream 4\", in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving time travel as a plot device.\n\nDirector Spike Jonze's \"Adaptation\" is a fictionalized version of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book \"The Orchid Thief\" into a Hollywood blockbuster. As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of \"Being John Malkovich\", previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.) Robert Altman's satirical noir \"The Player\" about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.\n\nOccasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a spin-off.\n\nIn the fictional world of the \"Toy Story\" movies, Buzz Lightyear is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\", which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within \"Toy Story\". Later, \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\" was produced in the real world.\n\n\"Kujibiki Unbalance\", a series in the \"Genshiken\" universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.\n\nSuch spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the \"Harry Potter\" series, three such supplemental books have been produced. \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" is a textbook used by the main character, and \"Quidditch Through the Ages\" is a book from the library at his school. \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.\n\nIn the works of Kurt Vonnegut, Kilgore Trout has written a novel called \"Venus on the Half-Shell\". In 1975 real-world author Philip José Farmer wrote a science-fiction novel called \"Venus on the Half-Shell\", published under the name Kilgore Trout.\n\nIn \"Homestuck\" by Andrew Hussie, there is a comic called Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.\n\n\"Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth\", a story by Dean Wesley Smith, was adapted from the holonovel \"Captain Proton\" in the Star Trek universe.\n\nIn the animated online franchise \"Homestar Runner\" many of the best-known features were spun off from each other. The best known was \"Strong Bad Emails,\" which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody \"Teen Girl Squad\" and the anime parody \"20X6.\"\n\nOne unique example is the Tyler Perry comedy/horror hit \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the Chris Rock film \"Top 5\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1020586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1020586", "title": "The ABC Sunday Night Movie", "text": "The ABC Sunday Night Movie\n\nThe ABC Sunday Night Movie is a television program that aired on Sunday nights, first for a brief time in 1962 under the title \"Hollywood Special\" (although \"Time\" magazine lists this version as \"The Sunday Night Movie\") to supposedly replace an open time slot for the TV show \"Bus Stop\", which was cancelled after March 1962. It then began airing regularly under its more commonly known title from late 1964 to 1998, on ABC. Since 2004, it has aired sporadically as a special program, now titled the \"ABC Sunday Movie of the Week\", though as of the 2011-12 television season, the only films in this timeslot were aired under the \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" banner, which transferred to ABC in that season. However, in 2014, \"The Hallmark Hall of Fame\" moved exclusively to cable on the Hallmark Channel. As a result of this, the \"Sunday Night Movie\" is now exclusively relegated to two special holiday movies, \"The Sound of Music\" every holiday season and \"The Ten Commandments\" every Easter.\n\n\"The ABC Sunday Night Movie\" was replaced in 1998 with \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" although the \"Sunday Night Movie\" initially continued to air alongside \"TWWOD\" for its final season.\n\nEncouraged by the ratings success on NBC's \"Saturday Night at the Movies\", ABC initially purchased 15 United Artists films released in the late 1950s for its April 1962 premiere. United Artists Television also provided some short featurettes promoting upcoming United Artists cinema releases to fill out some films that ended before the two hour time slot finished.\n\nThe program presented theatrical feature films airing on TV for the first time. The feature films were edited for content, to remove objectionable material, and for time - one such instance was the first network telecast in 1962 of John Huston's 1956 film \"Moby Dick\", a Warner Bros. film which runs 117 minutes uncut, and yet was shown in a two-hour time slot with commercials. In many cases, however, the broadcast was expanded from two to two-and-a-half hours to fit a film's longer running time, as in the two 1966 network telecasts of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Carousel\" (a 1956 film not to be confused with the 1967 videotaped television adaptation of the musical, also broadcast by ABC). The first major network showing of \"Superman\" in 1982 was broadcast in two parts with previously unused footage. Extra footage was also added to the ABC broadcast of \"\" in 1983, \"Superman II\" in 1984 and \"\" in 1985.\n\nBecause the concept of letterboxing films for television had not been introduced yet, the films shown were also pan-and-scanned so the image would fit the standard 4:3 television screen.\n\nIn 1972, ABC bought the broadcasting rights to the James Bond franchise (also by United Artists). The first film broadcast was \"Goldfinger\". Unlike the British broadcasts of the James Bond films, the franchise was not presented in production order. \n\nABC made edits to the Bond films for violence, sexual content, and so that the films would fit in the time allotted, but perhaps the most controversial of these was the re-edit of the 1969 film \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" broadcast on the \"ABC Monday Night Movie\".\n\nABC held the rights to the James Bond films until 1990, when \"The Living Daylights\" was the final film aired prior to Turner Broadcasting buying the TV rights to the franchise. The Bond films have also aired on several cable channels not owned by Turner. ABC broadcast the films again as a promotional tie-in when \"Die Another Day\" was in theaters in 2002, dubbed as \"The Bond Picture Show\" on Saturday nights.\n\nOccasionally, \"The ABC Sunday Night Movie\" would telecast what they termed an ABC Sunday Movie Special, i.e. a film running three hours or more (counting the commercials). When the movie in question was a family film, the telecasts would begin at an earlier hour, so that the film would end at around 11:00 p.m, enabling younger viewers to watch without having to stay up too late. The Movie Specials invariably consisted of blockbusters, such as \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"The Robe\", \"Oliver!\", and \"The Ten Commandments\". The last-named film continues its television career on ABC today, having become, like \"The Wizard of Oz\", an annual television tradition. It is usually shown during the Palm Sunday or Easter weekend (\"The Robe\", which made its TV debut in 1968, had been shown on Easter weekends by ABC prior to being sold to local television stations). The telecast of \"Patton\", which took place in 1972 at 9 P.M. E.S.T., was remarkably mature, in that very little of the film's profanity was cut for television.\n\nABC would occasionally telecast \"Movie Special\"s on other days of the week as well, among them \"Fiddler on the Roof\", and \"Godspell\" (which was shown on network television as a Thanksgiving season special in 1974).\n\nBeginning in 1965, \"The ABC Sunday Night Movie\" used a rather unusual method of presenting the films that movie series on other networks did not use. Except on rare occasions, such as the aforementioned \"Movie Specials\", or films which already had a pre-credits sequence that led directly into the main title and so could not be altered, the opening credits of the particular film in question generally would not be shown until after the movie had ended. Instead, a teaser from the film was shown, whereupon an offscreen announcer (e.g. Joel Crager) would say the name of the film and its stars, and then the credit The ABC Sunday Night Movie would appear. A commercial would then follow, and when the program started up again, one would see the screenwriter and the director's names respectively - superimposed over the film's opening scene in credits manufactured by ABC. At film's end, another commercial would follow, after which, somewhat anti-climactically, the movie's actual opening credits, together with the studio logo, would then be presented exactly as they were originally made, as if the film were starting up again. \n\n\"The ABC Sunday Night Movie\" was also famous in the mid 1970s for its theme music and brightly colored marquee. The opening has been parodied on the G4 network under the title \"Movies That Don't Suck\".\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, ABC ran a concurrent movie series on Wednesday nights, under the title \"The ABC Wednesday Night Movie\". \n\nA Tuesday night ABC Movie of the Week featuring only made-for-TV movies was added in 1969. The series was renamed Tuesday Movie of the Week and a Wednesday night Wednesday Movie of the Week, also presenting only made-for-TV films, was added in 1972. Both series continued until 1975.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1983 (and again, briefly, in 1999) ABC ran a concurrent movie series on Friday nights, under the title The ABC Friday Night Movie.\n\nOther concurrent movie series during that time also aired on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\n\nDuring the 1980s, films with more mature and politically-charged themes, such as \"The Day After\" and \"Consenting Adult\" (homosexuality) aired under the \"ABC Theater\" banner.\n\nBeginning in 1999, a Saturday night variant on the formula began, and has been somewhat of a ratings favorite. However, and more importantly nowadays, the ratings have varied from week to week. Since 1999, The \"ABC Saturday Night Movie\" has alternated with random repeats, \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" (up until 2008), and \"Saturday Night Football\", which runs from the first Saturday in September, up into the first of December. Movies also alternate on various other nights of the week, for sweeps and also as holiday-based programming, such as the annual pre-Easter telecast of \"The Ten Commandments\".\n\nFor many years, until the early 1980s, the announcer for all of ABC's movie shows was network staff announcer Joel Crager. Afterwards, the duties would be handled first by Ernie Anderson, and then others.\n\nThe advent of such cable television networks as HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and The Movie Channel (all of which broadcast theatrical films on cable before they appear on commercial television), along with the emergence of various home video formats, led to the decline of theatrical films regularly airing on commercial network TV. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, print ads for \"The ABC Sunday Night Movie\" regularly played up the quality of the film being offered to viewers at no cost (\"Another Great Film Not On Pay TV\"). Whereas one used to be able to see a relatively recent theatrical film on prime time commercial network television every night of the week, this is now done only occasionally (or, in the case of ABC's \"Saturday Movie of the Week\", weekly). Only cable networks exclusively devoted to films, such as American Movie Classics or Turner Classic Movies, show theatrical films in prime time every night; the big three networks, including the newer Fox network no longer follow this practice, except perhaps on holidays. The grand opening sequences of the past are now usually eschewed by merely mentioning the airing title in an 'up next' sequence, or a direct cut to a disclaimer noting the film has been edited and presented for a broadcast television presentation with the assumption viewers have already viewed the basic electronic program guide information for the film.\n"}

{"id": "2926433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2926433", "title": "The Graham Kennedy Show", "text": "The Graham Kennedy Show\n\nThe Graham Kennedy Show was an Australian talk show which debuted on 19 September 1972 on the Nine Network.\n\nOn 23 December 1969, host Graham Kennedy quit as host of \"In Melbourne Tonight\" due to exhaustion and rested for two years. In spite of his fame and fortune, he later described that period as \"years of misery\". After specials on 15 November 1971 and 2 March 1972, he returned with this series.\n\nKennedy sparked controversy after a \"crow-call\", which sounded like the word \"fuck\", was broadcast in March 1975 (see below). Forced to prerecord from that point on, he abruptly departed following GTV-9's censorship of the 16 April 1975 edition.\n\nOn the show of 3 March 1975, Kennedy imitated a crow, saying \"faaaaaaark\", during a live read of a Cedel hairspray advertisement by announcer Rosemary Margan. The Nine Network reportedly received hundreds of complaints, followed by a rash of newspaper headlines the next day. This led the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to request that Kennedy \"show cause\" why he should not be removed from the airwaves. Kennedy replied that he could not show cause, suggesting that the Board take action to limit his appearances, while hinting at legal action should they do so. Rather than removing him, the ABCB banned Kennedy from appearing live, forcing him to pre-record the show on videotape. Some have claimed that Kennedy deliberately engineered the crow call incident so that the show would have to be prerecorded, allowing him to get home earlier, while others suggest that he did it so that Nine would sack him.\n\nIn 2002, in \"The Age\" newspaper, writer Jonathan Green reported that the crow call segment was in fact pretaped and that the controversy was probably just a pretext for other issues. Rival Nine personality Ernie Sigley, who presented his own variety show on different nights to Kennedy, has claimed the real reason Kennedy was axed was that his ratings were so poor compared to Sigley's.\n\nAccording to \"Age\" reporter Suzanne Carbone, the first known use of the expletive on Australian TV was in the 1960s, when Nine Adelaide evening news presenter Kevin Crease said \"fucking hell\" during a mishap in a live advertisement on variety show \"Adelaide Tonight\". Crease told \"The Age\" that \"The audience fell off their chairs laughing\" and that he was amazed no complaints were received and that although he feared he would be sacked, nothing happened.\n\nHaving been forced to tape his shows \"indefinitely\" by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the network took advantage of the pretaping to completely edit out Kennedy's scathing attack on Senator Doug McClelland, the then Minister for the Media, for his failure to support local content regulations for TV on the 16 April 1975 edition.\n\nAccording to Kennedy's biographer, Graeme Blundell, Kennedy resigned from Nine after this controversy, just six weeks after the \"crow call\" incident.\n\nKennedy's words which never made it to air were:\n\nDuring a segment featuring guest Daryl Somers, Kennedy said that he'd let it be known that Somers would make a suitable replacement host \"... should I be on my way\". In the first commercial break, Kennedy addressed the opening comments off-air with the studio audience, wondering if the network would cut the remarks, and stating that if they did, he would repeat them live on \"This Day Tonight\". He made the same threat on-air during the \"wheel\" segment later in the episode, with he and Bert Newton both effectively repeating the opening remarks. Kennedy also remarked that McClelland was \"...not all that literate\", and that \"... he has to go\".\n\nThe opening segment was indeed edited out before the show went to air and Kennedy resigned in anger. He did not, however, follow through with the threat to repeat the comments on \"This Day Tonight\", with an ABC spokesman later commenting that Kennedy had decided that it \"would not be in his interests\" to appear.\n\nAustralian content on TV was a highly sensitive issue at this time. In the wake of the controversial McLean Report, the Whitlam government was taking major steps to open up the radio spectrum with the introduction of community broadcasting and the ABC's new rock station, Triple J (launched as \"Double Jay\"), but it had done nothing to address the low levels of local content on Australian TV.\n\nAware of the media's crucial role in its own election in 1972, and understandably fearful of a backlash if it forced unpopular content quotas on the industry, the government steered well clear of any serious re-examination of the current structure and did little to increase levels of Australian content on TV.\n\nThe proposal to increase local content had long been advocated local producers, writers and actors, but it was bitterly opposed by the networks, who relied on being able to buy large blocks of American programming at a fraction of what it would have cost to produce similar shows locally. The problem was compounded by the Whitlam government's far-reaching 1973 decision to reduce tariffs across the board by 25% in the first move towards today's highly successful \"free trade\" policies. The immediate result of the tariff reduction was that overseas programming became even cheaper. Also at this time, the networks were being targeted by the \"TV - Make It Australian\" campaign, which involved a number of prominent Australian actors and TV personalities including Kennedy and several leading actors from the popular police shows made by Crawford Productions, notably Gerard Kennedy and Charles \"Bud\" Tingwell. The cancellation of all three major Crawford Productions police shows within months of each other during 1975 has been portrayed by Tingwell and others as an act of revenge by the networks for Crawford's active support for the campaign and the participation of its contract players. Following this logic, Blundell suggests that Kennedy too was a victim of the Nine TV network's sensitivity about the local content issue. It has also been suggested that, with a federal election looming, Nine used the crow call incident as a pretext to remove the politically vocal Kennedy, who was known to support the ALP.\n\nFour episodes of \"The Graham Kennedy Show\" were released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in May 2013. The episodes include rare uncut footage.\n\n"}

It follows Steve Wiebe in his attempts to take the high score record for the 1981 arcade game \"Donkey Kong\" from the previous holder, Billy Mitchell. The film premiered at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival and was released in US theaters in August 2007. It received positive reviews.\n\nWalter Day is the founder of Twin Galaxies, an organization dedicated to tracking high scores in arcade games. Among the high-scoring players is restaurateur Billy Mitchell, who has held the high score for the 1981 game \"Donkey Kong\" since 2004.\n\nIn Redmond, Washington, out-of-work engineer Steve Wiebe has purchased a \"Donkey Kong\" cabinet to try to break the record. Using his mathematical knowledge to identify exploitable patterns in the game, Wiebe achieves a new record of 1,006,600 points – the first ever score over a million. He submits a tape to Twin Galaxies, which propels him to local celebrity in the Seattle area.\n\nMitchell and Twin Galaxies send two referees to investigate Wiebe's machine. They learn that the machine's circuit board was provided by Roy Shildt, a self-proclaimed fitness guru and pickup artist who claims the high score for \"Missile Command\". Unbeknownst to Wiebe, Shildt and Mitchell have been at odds for years after Mitchell questioned Shildt's high score, causing Twin Galaxies to disqualify it. Twin Galaxies suspects that Shildt may have tampered with Wiebe's board, and does not recognize Wiebe's record.\n\nWiebe travels to a tournament at Funspot in Laconia, New Hampshire, to attempt a live high score for high-ranking Twin Galaxies members. Wiebe challenges Mitchell to a \"Donkey Kong\" competition, but Mitchell does not attend. Before a crowd, Wiebe sets a new high score of 985,600 and reaches the kill screen, ending the game. However, contrary to his statements that videotaped scores carry less validity than scores achieved in public, Mitchell sends a low-quality VHS to Funspot depicting himself achieving a higher score of 1,047,200 points. Twin Galaxies proclaims Mitchell the record holder.\n\nNine months later, \"Guinness World Records\" has decided to publish Twin Galaxies' records — including Mitchell's latest score – and hosts a tournament in Mitchell's hometown of Hollywood, Florida. Wiebe again challenges Mitchell to a public competition, but Mitchell refuses. Wiebe fails to surpass the record, but afterward, Day acknowledges Wiebe's integrity and invites him to submit taped scores. At home, Wiebe achieves a new record of 1,049,100 in his garage.\n\n\n\"The King of Kong\" premiered January 22, 2007, at the Slamdance Film Festival and has been shown at the Newport Beach Film Festival, the Seattle International Film Festival, the SXSW Film Festival, the TriBeCa Film Festival, the True/False Film Festival, the Aspen Comedy Festival, and the Fantasia Festival. The film opened in limited release in the United States on August 17, 2007 in five theaters, and by September 9, 2007, it had expanded to 39 theaters. The film's DVD release was on January 29, 2008.\n\nOn Metacritic, \"The King of Kong\" has an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 23 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a score of 97% based on 99 reviews.\n\nRobert Wilonsky of the \"Village Voice\" called the film a \"miniature masterpiece\" and in August 2007 said it was his favourite film of the year so far. Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave the film five stars and said \"It’s not just one of the best documentaries I’ve ever seen, it’s one of the best movies I’ve ever seen\". Keith Phipps of \"The Onion\" AV Club gave the film an \"A-\" and said it was \"a film about what it takes to make it in America.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film three out of four stars, writing: \"Who would have guessed that a documentary about gamers obsessed with scoring a world record at \"Donkey Kong\" would not only be roaringly funny but serve as a metaphor for the decline of Western civilization?\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" similarly gave the film three out of four and called it \"a documentary that is beyond strange.\" Critic Richard Roeper stated that the film \"deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary\" in 2007 on \"At The Movies\".\n\nAnn Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" wrote: \"Is there anything more tiresome than watching people play video games?\" and \"The competition is so vicious because the stakes are so low.\" Stephen Garrett of \"Time Out New York\" called it \"moderately entertaining and ultimately kind of pathetic\" and felt the early-1980s arcade subculture is explored in greater depth in the documentary \"\".\n\nOn February 2, 2018, Twin Galaxies member Jeremy Young filed a complaint regarding several of Mitchell's records. The validity of Mitchell's August 7, 2010, high score, set at Boomers-Grand Prix Arcade, could not be determined. The referee who allegedly witnessed and certified the record was gamer Todd Rogers, who appears in \"The King of Kong\", and was himself exposed as having fabricated scores earlier in 2018.\n\nOn April 12, Twin Galaxies announced that Mitchell had used emulation software to achieve the \"Donkey Kong\" high score rather than an arcade machine; this is banned because it allows players to cheat in undetectable ways. Mitchell was stripped of his records and banned from submitting further scores, and Wiebe was recognized as the first person to score over a million points. Footage obtained from the \"Kong\" DVD's special features was cited by the investigative committee in their findings as having been instrumental in exposing Mitchell.\n\nIn 2014, \"King of Kong: The Musical\", which parodied the characters and events depicted in the documentary began its limited run.\n\nA scripted film adaptation is also in the works. Director Seth Gordon has said that the movie might be a sequel instead of a remake, telling the story of how the documentary changed both men's lives, as well as their continuing rivalry.\n\n\n"}

A late 20th century development in the area has been the ethnographic theory of theatre, pioneered by the Russian scholar Larisa Ivleva (1944–1995) who studied the influence of folk culture on the development of Russian theatre.\n\nBecause of the interdisciplinary nature of the field, those who have been described as theatrologists can vary widely in terms of the primary focus of their activities.\n\n"}

During her training Schaeppi premierred on stage, and played among others \"Gisèle\" in Giraudoux's \"Intermezzo\" on Schauspielhaus Zürich in 1955.\n\nIn 1958 Schaeppi was engaged at the \"Studio 20\" in Bern as \"Laura\" in Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\". From 1959 she worked at German city theaters, among other things, in Castorp-Rauxel, Berlin, München and in Rendsburg. At this time also began Schaeppi's career with children and trouser roles that later became one of her trademarks, including the title role in Saint-Exupéry's \"The Little Prince\". In 1968/69 she toured with the \"Deutsche Kammerspiele Buenos Aires\" through South and Central America, and received an engagement at \"Berliner Kammerspiele\" stages in 1971/72. Since 1969 she appeared in guest roles at Swiss theaters, for example, in 1969 at the \"Stadttheater Bern\" as \"Effie\" in Ludwig Thomas' \"Moral\", and in 1970 at the gallery theater \"Die Rampe\" in Bern as \"Mingo\" in the premiere of Alexander Ziegler's \"Zellengeflüster\". In 1976 she starred in the title role of Hansjörg Schneider's \"Sennentuntschi\" that was directed by Schneider.\n\nIt was followed by appearances at the \"Stadttheater Luzern\", \"Kleintheater Kramgasse 6\" in Bern and at the \"Stadttheater Chur\", and since the early 1970s, also first appearances in the Swiss German dialect theater. Her breakthrough celebrated Ursula Schäppi in 1975, at Bernhard-Theater Zürich as \"Heideli\" in the premiere of Max Rüeger's \"Hochzeit in Hägglingen\", under the direction of Inigo Gallo, followed by regular appearances in the Bernhard-Theater, at first mainly in cabaret revues by Charles Lewinsky, Fredy Lienhard and Hans Gmür, later in Swiss dialect versions of boulevard plays, for example, in 1988 in the title role of Jack Popplewell's successful play \"Katharina die Kühne\" and Swiss tour performances and television broadcasting. Moreover, Schaeppi created her own arrangements for Swiss productions of the Bernhard Theater where she also performed in leading roles. There, also the long-standing collaboration with Rudolf Haas and Franco Romano began. She had further guest appearances at other theaters, for example, in 1979 as \"Oma Zeitel\" in Jerry Bock's musical \"Anatevka\" and in 1982 as \"Toinette \" in Molière's \"The Imaginary Invalid\" on \"Atelier Theater\" in Bern.\n\nNational merits gained Ursula Schäppi since 1977 through her appearances on Swiss television as \"Goof\" or \"Göre Ursula\" (cheeky girl) in Kurt Felix' \"Teleboy\", by her television show \"10 x Schaeppi\" and as \"Eva Chifler\" in \"Traumpaar\" with Walter Andreas Müller when even a song was listed in the Swiss radio charts. Starting in 1987, Schaeppi produced independent theater productions with Haas, Romano and Müller, in which she also starred and for which she often wrote the Swiss dialect versions, including in 1987 the Swiss premiere of Pierre Chesnot's \"Vier linke Hände\" with Müller and directed by Haas, in 1991 as \"Käthi - Superstar\", and in 1994 the dialect version of \"Die Sternstunde der Hanna Bieder\", which on \"Gastspieltheater Zürich\" was resumed in 2000. A great success was \"Stan und Ollie in der Schweiz\", starring Schaeppi as \"Stan\" and \"Stephanie Glaser\" as \"Ollie\". Her productions staged for several years guest performances, among others at the Bernhard-Theater, on Theater am Hechtplatz, and on the studio stage of the Opernhaus Zürich, at the \"Atelier-Theater\" in Bern and at the \"Sommertheater Winterthur\". After a long pause Schaeppi published other theater directing credits and Swiss dialect edits: in 1998 \"Tatort: Goldküste!\" according to Popplewell, and in 2001 the Swiss premiere of Jack Jacquin's \"Der Mord zum Sonntag\" on \"Gastspieltheater Zürich\" where Schaeppi starred in the lead role.\n\nUrsula Schäppi wrote and spoke children's stories and fairy tales, which are available as audiobooks. She also became popular by numerous radio appearances. Beside the stage, she became popular, along with Jörg Schneider, Paul Bühlmann and Ines Torelli, by fairytale-radio plays records.\n\nAfter many years absence from the stage, in 2012 she toured again in her signature role as \"Requisiteuse\". Ursula Schaeppi founded the children's theater studio in the municipality of Thalwil on \"Zürichsee\" lake shore. Celebrating her 75th anniversary, Ursula Schaeppi announced to focus finally, at the request of a group of seniors, increasingly on theater productions with their peers because \"many of the existing plays are just too dull\".\n\nUrsula Schaeppi is a citizen of the municipality of Thalwil in the Canton of Zürich. Schaeppi was married with Rudolf Haas, a Swiss and actor with whom she also toured. In 1998 on Swiss television SRF Schaeppi talked about her depression to which she suffered after seven friends died within a short period; it was accompanied by a career slump, and she stepped back public appearance. She also suffers of chronic lymphoid leukaemia which did not to allow to stage again on Bernhard-Theater Zürich in \"Sie spillt wieder mit öis. Aber nume no eimal!\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34169327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34169327", "title": "Zoopoetics", "text": "Zoopoetics\n\nZoopoetics has been defined as \"the process of discovering innovative breakthroughs in form through an attentiveness to another species' bodily \"poiesis\".\" It assumes many actual, biological animals possess agency to craft gestures, vocalizations—clear material signs—in order to create social cohesion with conspecifics and other animals.\n\nZoopoetics is not a minor event in poetry, nor is it limited to human spheres. Other species discover innovative forms of their bodily \"poiesis\", through, at times, an attentiveness towards humans. Many disciplines have contributed to the radical revaluation of the animal in culture and society; zoopoetics further contributes through tracing the implications of Whitman’s insight, that animals, including humans, follow the “same old law” of a bodily \"poiesis\".\n\nJacques Derrida first used the term in \"The Animal that Therefore I Am\" (an address first delivered in 1997), speaking of “Kafka’s vast zoopoetics.” And so, in the broadest sense, zoopoetics suggests the presence of nonhuman animals within a text. In a 2008 dissertation, Christopher White establishes another facet of zoopoetics by conflating it with the term zoosemiotics (the sign-systems of nonhuman animals), and he uses both terms to explore the presence and sign-systems of animals in William Faulkner’s \"As I Lay Dying\".\n\nAnother facet of zoopoetics is explored in “Zoopoetics: A Look at Cummings, Merwin, & the Expanding Field of Ecocriticism.” Here, zoopoetics is more of an approach that “gravitates to the agency of nonhuman animals” within both the ecosphere and within texts. The notion of animal agency is defined by how nonhuman animals are imaginative, rhetorical, and cultural beings. The essay draws upon the well-known rhetorician George Kennedy, who published a controversial article in 1992: “A Hoot in the Dark: The Evolution of General Rhetoric.” In it, Kennedy argues that all animals, human and nonhuman, “share a ‘deep’ universal rhetoric.” This rhetoric is not founded on sign-systems but rather upon what he calls the “rhetorical energy” of the gestures that deliver those sign-systems. Animals (including humans) constantly navigate rhetorical situations by delivering gestures to an audience with a specific purpose. Kennedy’s article challenged one of the long-standing assumptions concerning the difference between humans and animals, for he sees language as less of a distinguishing mark of human exceptionality and more of a commonality given the evolutionary origin shared by many animals. (For a recapitulation of the history of the response to Kennedy's article, as well as a defense of the ideas within it, see Debra Hawhee's \"Toward a Bestial Rhetoric.\")\n\nAaron Moe's book \"Zoopoetics: Animals and the Making of Poetry\" explores the zoopoetic dynamic in the poetry of Whitman, Cummings, Merwin, Hillman as well as several other poets.\n\nAs with many literary terms, it is helpful to look at the term’s etymology. Zoopoetics, etymologically speaking, has to do with how animals (\"zoo\") can be capable of creation, or of \"making\" (\"poesis\"). Zoopoetics is seen as the process by which animal rhetorics may contribute to the making and shaping of both a specific poem as well as the overall poetics of a given author.\n\nOne premise underlying zoopoetics is the notion that humans are not the only beings who dwell (in Heideggerian sense) on the earth. Nonhuman animals do as well. Some human poetry hints at the dwelling of the animal, but for obvious reasons, such an endeavor is fraught with challenges. Jacques Derrida articulates this challenge most clearly through his term limitrophy:\n\nThe limit between the human and the animal becomes its own infinite terrain within the text, but Derrida seems to have overlooked one crucial aspect. It is not just the human who strives to venture into the abyss of the animal—reaching with language and with gestures—for animals also strive to venture into the abyss of the human through their gestures and the vocalizations embedded within those gestures. Stephanie Rowe demonstrates what this ebb and flow encounter may look like in a text. In her article, Rowe explores how the orangutang in Poe's story reaches into the abyss of the human, seeking to change the human space into a shared space. This occurs when the orangutang—a species whose culture is oft defined by grooming—takes on the human ritual of shaving. His gestures are misunderstood, of course, which has morbid consequences.\n\nZoopoetics, then, is an ebb and flow of energy between the human and the nonhuman. The human reaches into the abyss of the animal, but acknowledges the animals reach as well. Perhaps zoopoetics can best be experienced in a poetics that allows the gestures and vocalizations of nonhuman animals to permeate human language, through iconicity, thereby creating a shared space.\n\nWithin literary studies, there is a movement toward a multiculturalism that includes the social networks of nonhuman animals. For this to happen, though, humans must take seriously the notion that animals enter into rhetorical situations, crafting their own texts, for audiences, with specific purposes. The last thirty years of studies in animal behavior have, in part, influenced the proliferation of video documentary of animals crafting such texts. For instance, \"Planet Earth\" captures several humpback whales coordinating efforts to surround krill with bubbles from their blowholes. As the video unfolds, viewers hear and witness the text the humpback whales craft. One can then infer that such behavior is learned, socially passed on from one generation of humpback to another. One can further infer that a single humpback, or a group of humpbacks, collectively had an innovative breakthrough in using the bubbles as a tool. This innovation had to be communicated to other humpbacks, and when this happens, the humpback enters into a rhetorical situation, relying on the text of song and gesture to communicate.\n\nOrca also craft texts. Ethologists have recognized that such texts help maintain group cohesion, and they may therefore exemplify how animal texts sustain nonhuman animal cultures. For a live feeds of orca vocalizations (and archives of past recordings) from the Puget Sound, listen to this hydrophone.\n\nA wide range of animals demonstrate similar crafting of texts, but to take this seriously, one must wrestle with the implications of how nonhuman animals enter rhetorical situations.\n\n"}

Very rapid in tempo, the style lost ground in the 1980s due to the strong presence of Compas / kompa and kadans, the main music of the French Antilles. Today, zouk is the French Antilles compas (Kompa), also called zouk-love.\n\nThe Creole word \"zouke\", \"sekwe\", or \"zouke\", etc. from the French verb \"secouer\" meaning \"shake intensely and repeatedly\" was used by Haitian artists who toured the French Antilles during the late 1970s and 1980s. \n\nThe word \"zouk\" has, over time, come to mean \"party\" or \"festival\" in the local Antillean Creole of French.\n\nZouk was an attempt to develop a proper local music that would lessen or even eradicate the meringue-kadans or compas influence from the French islands. When the MIDI technology came out, Kassav' used it fully, creating new sound in both their fast carnival beat and compas. The Antilleans were all over with zouk but as other bands from the Caribbean and Africa added the MIDI technology to their music and people got used to it. Because it was a jump up beat the fast zouk béton faded away In the same 1980s and Antilleans would continue to play and dance meringue-cadence or compas. After all, French Antilleans and Dominicans are important players of the style. However, the problem is that musicians from Martinique and Guadeloupe have calculatedly labeled compas as zouk in order to remain on the map (keeping in mind Compas was created in 1950 by Haitians); creating a big confusion in Africa, Cabo Verde, Angola, Brazil, Portugal and other places. Kassav', the originator of the zouk béton, is a compas music band that has taken compas to many places, and is the only band that continues to include zouk béton in its repertoire, though to a lesser extent.\n\n"}
