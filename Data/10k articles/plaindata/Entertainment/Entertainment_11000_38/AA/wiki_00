The sequel to \"Age of Wonders\", it was developed by Dutch video game developer Triumph Studios.\n\nUnlike in \"Age of Wonders\", where the player has the option of removing their leader from the map, players in \"Age of Wonders II\" take the role of an immortal spell-casting Wizard, who cannot be upgraded, but in certain circumstances can survive being killed.\n\nIn contrast to \"Age of Wonders\", the maps for tactical battles are now much smaller. This led to faster combat and less maneuvering of units. Also in contrast to its predecessor, when gaining new levels Heroes can no longer choose new skills from a list of all available skills; instead, the player is forced to choose one of three offered skills, depending on the Hero's class.\n\nIn \"Age of Wonders\", magic is used via the spell casting abilities of leaders and heroes, and global spells can be cast some distance away from the hero; use of spells in combat is restricted to battles where a hero with spell casting is present.\n\nMagic use in \"Age of Wonders II\" uses a \"domain\" system; spells can only be cast within the domain of the casting wizard, or the domain of an allied wizard. Magic domains can overlap with each other, and in the simple case, are centered on the Wizard. When a Wizard is present in a Wizard's Tower, the radius of the domain increases significantly, and in addition is radiated by other Wizard's Towers, Magic Relays and Heroes under the control of the player. Global spells can only be cast by the Wizard, via a spell book located in the main user interface; spells can be cast in combat by either Heroes involved in the battle, or (provided the battle takes place inside their domain) the Wizard who controls any party which entered the battle.\n\nImproved audio quality and graphics, sub-quests from various gods, more races and build options as well as two large single-player campaigns made most of the large fanbase of \"Age of Wonders\" happy migrating to \"Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne\"; this was aided by the involvement of members of the HeavenGames community in suggestions, testing and development of the game.\n\nProbably planned as an expansion pack, \"\" was published later as a stand-alone game.\n\n\"Age of Wonders II\" was a nominee for \"PC Gamer US\"s \"2002 Best Turn-Based Strategy Game\" award, which ultimately went to \"\".

Once a world has been completed, the player will acquire a random power-up in the form of characters representing older Taito properties, such as \"Bubble Bobble\", \"Darius\" and \"Psychic Force\".\n\n\"Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders\" received positive reviews from critics, with reviews praising the amalgamation of \"Arkanoid\" and \"Space Invaders\", and ditching the free-to-play model of mobile applications. The game currently has an 85/100 score on Metacritic. Eli Hodapp of \"TouchArcade\" states that “the \"Arkanoid\" and \"Space Invaders\" universes have been duct taped together in a way that actually works quite well” and that it is \"A super-solid brick breaker with an interesting twist and no freemium shenanigans\". Chris Shilling of \"Waypoint\" describes the game as \"Crisp and colorful with an energetic EDM soundtrack, \"Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders\" is a fizzy, addictive treat—like a bag of cola bottles but with slightly more nutritional value, and all for roughly the price of a London pint\". Jennifer Allen of Gamezebo commented by saying that \"\"Arkanoid\" and \"Space Invaders\" is one of those perfectly shrewd moves that you had no idea could work so well until, well, it did. Partly skills based and partly a puzzle game, it's a delightful combination of two iconic classics. Even better, you won’t have to suffer the scourge of in-app purchases to enjoy it.\" However, she did criticise the boss battles by stating that they \"are somewhat lackluster, never quite fulfilling their potential\". Harry Slater of \"Pocket Gamer\" described \"Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders\" as \"a mash up of two of Taito's old arcade franchises. And it's actually pretty interesting. There's bouncing, there are blocks, there are waves of alien invaders trying to destroy the cosmos. While that might sound like a silly mish mash, there's actually a decent amount of cohesion here\". CJ Andrissen of \"Destructoid\" praised the game by stating that it is \"One of the best mobile games of the year\" and that \"there is just so much game here to enjoy and with no ads, no microtransactions, and no need to always be connected to the internet, \"Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders\" is missing most of the red flags people wave when dismissing the mobile marketplace. It isn’t the best version of \"Space Invaders\" out there but it is the best version of \"Arkanoid\" currently available\".\n"}

He shared bills with Bessie Smith on several occasions, and by summer 1913 was known for his comedy and his performances of blues songs and \"lullaby yodels\", called by one reviewer \"the Male Mockingbird\". Anderson regularly performed as a female impersonator, in costume as an archetypal \"mammy\", and performed songs including \"Baby Seals Blues\" and W. C. Handy's \"Saint Louis Blues\". Ethel Waters, long regarded as the first performer of the latter song, stated that she had first heard it sung by Anderson in Baltimore in 1917. He also toured in Ontario, Michigan, and elsewhere.\n\nIn 1923, Anderson recorded Seals' blues for Okeh Records, as \"Sing 'Em Blues\", with piano accompaniment by Eddie Heywood Sr.. Blues scholars Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff commented on the performance: \"Capturing the full range of Anderson's folk-operatic tenor voice in a remarkable rendition of the first published vocal blues song, this record survives to demonstrate an unabashedly comical resolution of \"high\" and \"low\" art, a positive realization of \"colored folks opera.\" Anderson recorded a further six songs for Okeh in 1924, and at his final recording session in 1928 recorded \"Saint Louis Blues\" as well as \"I Got Those Crying Yodelin' Blues.\"\n\nAlthough a favorite with black vaudeville audiences at the time, Anderson has tended to be dismissed as a curiosity by later critics because of his high voice and clear diction, which Abbott and Seroff say \"conflict with modern tastes and stereotypes.\"\n\nAnderson is thought to have died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after 1937.\n"}

In such films, the creation of choreography typically exists only in film or video. At its best, dance films use filming and editing techniques to create twists in the plotline, multiple layers of reality, and emotional or psychological depth.\n\nDance film is also known as the cinematic interpretation of existing dance works, originally created for live performance. When existing dance works are modified for the purposes of filming this can involve a wide variety of film techniques. Depending on the amount of choreographic and/or presentational adjustment an original work is subjected to, the filmed version may be considered as dance for camera. However, these definitions are not agreed upon by those working with dance and film or video.\n\nBritain's DV8 Physical Theatre, founded by Lloyd Newson, is well known for its film versions of staged works. The reworking of \"Enter Achilles\" (1995) for film in 1996 is a seminal example of Dance for camera. Recently acclaimed works include \"The Cost of Living\".\n\nAustralia's The Physical TV Company, directed by Richard James Allen and Karen Pearlman, is well known for creating original works that are a sophisticated meeting of the possibilities of cinema with those of dance. Dance films such as \"Rubberman Accepts The Nobel Prize\" (2001), \"No Surrender\" (2002), and \"Down Time Jaz\" (2003) are differing examples of the possibilities of this approach involving comedy, visual effects, drama, and animation.\n\nThe Machinima work by Chris Brandt: 'Dance, Voldo, Dance' which uses computer game characters within the game \"Soulcalibur\" to act out a live, choreographed dance.

{"id": "2491756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2491756", "title": "Dofus", "text": "Dofus\n\nDofus is a tactical turn-oriented massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Ankama Games, a French computer game manufacturer. Originally released solely in French, it has since been translated into many other languages. The game includes both pay-to-play accounts offering the full experience and free-to-play accounts offering a more limited amount of content. Its success has led to the marketing of spin-off products, such as books, art, comics and a movie released in 2016. It has also led to the development of two continuations: \"Dofus Arena\", released at the beginning of 2006, which is an alternative \"tournament\" version of \"Dofus\"; and \"Wakfu\", a continuation of \"Dofus\". The game has attracted over 40 million players worldwide and is especially well known in France. Today, there are more than 1.5 million subscribers every month on the game.\n\n\"Dofus\" takes place in \"The World of Twelve\", named for the 12 gods that inhabit it. Players control a 2D avatar belonging to one of 18 character classes in a third-person view. Each class has a unique set of spells that other classes can not obtain. As with most other massively multiplayer online role-playing games, players gain levels by obtaining experience. Experience can be gained by defeating monsters and completing quests. With each level, players gain points that can be used to improve their avatar's characteristics and spells. Players can access new spells and equipment by advancing in level. Players receive a special 'aura' when they reach level 100, and gain a different aura at 200, the maximum level. Players may also decide to take up professions and frequently band together to undertake dungeons. Many also become part of guilds, to more easily coordinate with others. Players complete quests to gain experience and other rewards.\n\nWhile the game takes place in real-time, combat in \"Dofus\" is conducted more like a turn based strategy game – where each player takes it in turns to make a series of moves and attacks within a time limit. As such, when a player attacks monsters – they are transported to a 'copy map' where the fighting takes place. Once a fight begins, no other players may join that fight. Players use a series of spells (which are unique to that character class) to, amongst other effects, attack, heal, buff or drain one's Action Points (AP) or Movement Points (MP). All actions done in combat (by both players and monsters) consumes an amount of AP and all movement consumes MP. In combat if a character loses all of their health points (HP) they're rendered dead.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n\nCharacters in \"Dofus\" can learn up various professions. There is a special type of profession called a specialization which can enhance item stats. Collecting professions involve players going out into the wilderness and collecting natural resources, such as certain wood and flowers. These can be later made into breads and such that restore health. They may also be sold as many of them are needed as quests items. Crafting professions involve the player piecing collected resources together to make a vast array of different items. Players gain experience in each profession by gathering the resources of that profession and/or by crafting items, depending on the type. As a player's collecting profession gains levels, they can collect new types of resources and obtain resources quickly. When a crafting profession levels, the player can create more powerful items and create them with a higher success rate, meaning that crafting will fail less often.\n\nThe currency used in \"Dofus\" is called \"Kamas\" (k). There are three cities that contain a marketplace where people can buy and sell goods and equipment for a fee. The kamas from these sales deposit directly into the player's bank account. Accounts are separated into two categories, Free-to-Play and Pay-to-Play. The game includes a zone accessible to Free-to-Play accounts. Free accounts have access to the new player zone of Incarnam and access to the city of Astrub and most of its outlying areas. This makes it possible for a new player to enjoy seemingly full game play, unbounded by time restrictions. Access to the entire world of \"Dofus\"—including access to other cities, participating in factional Player vs. Player battles and being able to raise profession levels above 30—requires a monthly fee, with discounts given for longer term subscriptions.\n\nSince its release, \"Dofus\" has seen more than 25 million accounts created from its release and distributed at least 51 servers. \"Dofus\" has roughly 1.5 millions active subscribers in 2016.\n\nThe game received \"positive\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. \"Dofus\" has also received international gaming awards including the Bytten Ernie Award for Best Graphics And Concept Art in 2007 and the Audience Award at the Independent Game Festival in 2006.\n\n\nIn 2013 an animated series entitled \"Dofus aux trésors de Kérubim\" (English: \"Dofus: The Treasures of Kerubim\") based upon the game began airing on France 3. The series is set 200 years before the beginning of the MMORPG and follows the character of Kerubim throughout various points in his life. The premise has Kerubim narrating several of his adventures to his adopted son Joris and their housekeeper Simone. \"Dofus\" consists of 52 episodes, each running 13 minutes apiece. The movie \"Dofus Book I: Julith\" was released in February 3, 2016. An English dub of the series debuted in the United States on VRV in November 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55577641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55577641", "title": "Dungeons 3", "text": "Dungeons 3\n\nDungeons 3 is a video game developed by Realmforge Studios and published by Kalypso Media. It was released on October 13, 2017, for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the sequel to the 2015 video game \"Dungeons 2\" and the third installment of the \"Dungeons\" series.\n\n\"Dungeons 3\" combines dungeon building with real-time strategy elements. Players are tasked with creating an underground dungeon for creatures to live in as well as defending their dungeon against invading heroes from the world above. They can also send creatures to the world above where they can take direct control of their units. The game's single-player campaign follows the story of Thalya, a dark elf sorcerer, on her quest to conquer the continent she lives on at the behest of the Dungeon Lord from the previous games. In multiplayer, players can either cooperate to play the campaign or compete against each other.\n\n\"Dungeons 3\" is a dungeon building video game with real-time strategy elements. The primary task is to build a dungeon, an underground lair which serves as a home to the player's units and their base of operations. In dungeon building mode, the player controls the world with a hand, performing actions such as moving creatures around the map, casting spells, and interacting with specific items. The hand is also used to designate parts of the underground for excavation and to create rooms. Commands are carried out by little imp-like creatures called snots, which are constantly regenerated by the dungeon heart which is the center of the dungeon and represents the player's health. It is the primary target for attacking heroes and its destruction leads to a game over. Additionally, the dungeon heart room stores gold and features a trap door that can be used to get rid of unwanted units.\n\nTo build and maintain their dungeon, five different resources are available: Gold is gained by excavating gold veins in the underground and is used to pay for rooms, units and new technologies. Gobblers are little chicken-like creatures continuously created by a farm and serve as food for creatures. Toolboxes are used to make traps as well as to create certain contraptions in some rooms. Mana is generated by Demon units and is used to unleash powerful magic spells as well as revive Demon units and turn toolboxes into magic toolboxes for more powerful traps. Beer is brewed by Horde units in special rooms and serves to keep those units happy. \"Evilness\" is a resource generated by capturing certain places in the over-world and is needed to research stronger technologies and upgrades.\n\nWith the exception of Thalya, the player's hero unit, all other units have to be unlocked by research and hired through an in-game menu. Almost all units demand a number of comforts, including a regular wage, rooms to sleep in, food and relaxation, and will go on strike if their needs are not met. The game features both neutral units and rooms, such as a treasury and farms, as well as three factions that provide their own specific advantages and disadvantages: The Horde allows the player to hire goblins, orcs and naga and provides access to training rooms and traps; Demons consist of imps, arachnids and succubi and allows the player to research upgrades as well as generate mana for spells and advanced traps; and The Undead faction offers banshees, vampires and lich creatures and rooms like a prison to incarcerate attacking heroes. Additionally, each faction has a singular powerful titan unit that can only be hired once. Even with upgrades, players can only recruit 20 units from all three factions combined as well as up to five converted heroes; additionally, undead skeletons and zombies can be created from fallen heroes that do not count towards this limit. While each faction offers their own technology tree, many aspects can be combined for better results: For example, heroes captured in the Undead prison can be tortured in the Demon torture chamber to switch sides and fight for the player and Undead crypts can serve to resurrect dead Horde creatures. Dead Demon units will be resurrected in a lair using mana and defeated Undead units will slowly regenerate in their graveyard.\nWhile in dungeon building mode, units cannot be controlled directly but picked up using the hand and dropped where they should be, for example to attack heroes that have entered the dungeon through one of the entrances. Each dungeon features one or more such entrances that also allow units to be sent to the world above by grabbing the units with the hand and placing them on the exit. Units that leave the dungeon reappear in the over-world map. Unlike in the dungeon, players can select units like in other real-time strategy games and issue commands directly as well as use their skills. Most maps require certain goals to be achieved on this map. Additionally, some missions feature no dungeon and have to be played with a fixed number of units provided. Events on both maps happen at the same time, forcing players to divide their attention.\n\nThe game features twenty single-player missions as well as a co-op mode that allows two players to complete the campaign together. Additionally, the game contains a skirmish mode which allows battles against the computer on randomly generated maps as well as a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other but not attack each other's dungeons (unlike in \"Dungeons 2\"). The game uses an isometric perspective that can be rotated by 90° to display the environment and uses two different mini-maps for dungeon and over-world view. Cut-scenes that tell the story use comic book style drawings instead of being rendered in the game's engine.\n\nThe game's story takes place a short time after the events of \"Dungeons 2\" on a new continent ruled by the good paladin Tanos with the help of his friends, racist dwarf king Grimli, the vain paladin Elric the Pretty, and the greedy Yaina Overproud. Tanos has also adopted a young dark elf sorcerer named Thalya in an attempt to cure her inner darkness and prevent her from doing evil. The player's goal is to conquer the empire for the Dungeon Lord using Thalya as their lieutenant.\n\nAfter conquering the lands above, the Dungeon Lord becomes bored and attempts to invade a new continent which fails due to the minions' incompetence in boat-building. The Dungeon Lord casts a spell that allows him to control Thalya, awakening her evil side. After she slaughters the people in her home village, she decides to let her dark side take over and begins serving the Dungeon Lord as its chief lieutenant. on her quest to punish Tanos for attempting to convert her.\n\nOn this quest, Thalya gradually conquers more and more parts of the continent and dispatches of Tanos' friends one by one. Facing Tanos himself, she fails to defeat him and uses a spell to temporarily transport the Dungeon Lord to the continent where he battles with Tanos who then flees and becomes more fanatic in his attempts to destroy Thalya and her forces, sacrificing his own cities and people and calling upon dead heroes from Valhalla to fight for him instead. In the end, Thalya manages to defeat Tanos and subjugate the empire under the Dungeon Lord's will.\n\nMore so than its predecessors, \"Dungeons 3\" contains a lot of allusions to other works of science-fiction and fantasy as well as meta-humor, which includes frequently breaking the fourth wall by both the narrator and Thalya in dialogue. The narrator (Kevan Brighting) also frequently argues with Thalya during missions and alters the missions based on these dialogues, such as having Thalya be attacked by bears he conjured out of thin air because she made a snippy comment at his expense. Allusions to other games of the same genre, especially \"Warcraft III\", as well as other games, films, such as \"The Lord of the Rings\", and fantasy franchises are numerous.\n\nKalypso Media announced the development of \"Dungeons 3\" on February 21, 2017 with a press release and an announcement teaser. The game was shown to reporters at Game Developers Conference 2017. According to the developer, the introduction of the over-world as an area to be captured in \"Dungeons 2\" has proven a successful addition to the formula which is why Realmforge Studios concentrated on expanding upon this concept while keeping the changes that players liked from the last game.\n\n\"Dungeons 3\" was released worldwide and for all supported platforms on October 13, 2017. It is the first entry in the series that was released on multiple platforms, i.e. Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, at the same time.\n\nRealmforge Studios released three downloadable content (DLC) to \"Dungeons 3\" that expand upon the story:\n\n\nThe PC version of \"Dungeons 3\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. The Xbox One version received slightly worse reviews and is considered by Metacritic as having \"mixed or average reviews\". Multiple reviewers opined that \"Dungeons 3\" was the closest the developer has come to creating a successor to Bullfrog Productions' iconic \"Dungeon Keeper\" series.\n\nMost reviewers noted the graphics and audio positively. \"Eurogamer.it\" emphasized that the game's cartoonish look and feel are consistent with the humor of the game and highlighted how the world is peaceful and idyllic when the good heroes rule it but instantly turns dark, gloomy and oppressive when the player's units capture parts of it. Other reviewers also lauded the colorful world and especially noted the level of details when units are in combat and magic effects are used. However, some critics also argued that improvements compared to \"Dungeons 2\" were almost non-existent, making \"Dungeons 3\" merely a polished version of its predecessor. Console versions were rated worse than the PC version, with \"4Players\" especially criticizing the Xbox One version's graphical errors.\n\nReviewers also lauded the improved user interface (UI) and ease of input, which includes easy input on consoles, something seldom achieved by strategy and simulation games that tend to be tailored to PC keyboard and mouse input. The UI drew minor criticisms as well though for having menus that block the whole screen when opened, thus making it harder to use them during battle.\n\nGerman magazine \"GameStar\" noted positively that the fact that different resources only exist in the over-world or in the underground forces players to care about both areas. Reviewers also positively noted the variety of missions, such as missions where enemies are far stronger during the day than they are at night or where the player has to prevent food from being delivered to starve an otherwise invincible enemy. The pacing of the campaign, giving players access to more rooms and technologies gradually, was also remarked upon positively. On the other hand, \"PC Games\" criticized the dungeon building aspect for always relying on the same pattern since there are no missions in which a scarcity of resources would force players to change their approach. That research was not saved and had to be repeated each mission was also seen as negatively forcing players into monotonous routine.\n\nAlthough the game's humor was praised by some reviewers, many critics noted that not all players will enjoy the type of humor and that the game relies too much on humor to the point of becoming annoying.\n\n\"PC Games\" lauded the new co-op mode but criticized that \"Dungeons 3\", unlike its predecessor, no longer offered a multiplayer mode that allowed to attack another player's dungeon.\n"}

{"id": "23459660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23459660", "title": "GeneRally", "text": "GeneRally\n\nGeneRally is a freeware racing game originally developed by brothers Hannu and Jukka Räbinä from Finland. Although it features a 3D graphics engine, GeneRally has a top-down perspective, where you can see all the cars (which is perfect for multiplayer races). Its art design calls to mind older arcade racing games such as Super Sprint and Slicks 'N' Slide. PCGamer, in an issue about free PC games, described it as \"A minimalist Micro Machines\".\n\nUp to six cars (either human or computer-controlled by AI) can race at the same time on a track. The game is quite easy to learn because the game physics are quite forgiving if you happen to lose control of the car. The game offers three game modes - time trial mode (player attacks best lap of a track; option of ghost car is available), race mode (against next 1-5 human or artificial opponents) and championship mode (season of several races). No matter on simple appearance, the game offers a basic damage model and even tire wear and fuel consumption causing necessity of pit-stops during the race - rare options in genre of arcade racing games including commercial titles. All settings of game are fully customizable (including details like separate adjustable AI level of every single AI opponent or pointing system of held championship).\n\nGeneRally does not support online or LAN play. However, up to 6 human players can play around one computer using same keyboard or keyboard combined with other devices like joystick or gamepad.\n\nGenerally 2, the sequel to GeneRally has been announced and is currently in the pre-alpha stage of development. A day and night cycle has already been showcased for Generally 2 in a video on the Curious Chicken Games YouTube channel and is expected to be in the coming sequel. A demo is also ready to play on the Generally 2 website which players can only play on the Unity (game engine) web player. According to the 'GR2 Developer Blog' the demo represents maybe only 15% of the progress to the final game. The Demo has all the basic features of the original Generally, though now with added features. It has a dynamic shadowing feature and a Day and Night sequence as well, however according to the Developer Blog many additional features haven't been added yet and are under development. Respected Community player and car modeler Kimmo Kaisla has joined in with the development team to help with development and a Kickstarter campaign was started on 9 June 2014.\n\nUnfortunately, soon after the campaign launch, the team could not get in contact with Kimmo for reasons that were unknown at that moment. Since Kimmo held a major role in the development of GeneRally 2, the rest of the team was unable to deliver new updates to the bakers and this caused a knock-off effect on the whole campaign, which in the end didn't reach the funding goal. Some time later, Kimmo let the team know that he had some important issues (not disclosed to the public) which made it impossible for him to continue the development of the game. Still, the team decided to continue working with what they had; two more posts were written in the developer blog, but then no more news about GeneRally 2 seem to have surfaced ever since, despite the roadmap and the established release dates.\n\nMost of GeneRally is customizable, It is not possible to change only the models of in-game objects and the layout of the user interface, which causes, that the GeneRally is deeply customizable by 3rd-party content. This possibility allows to the player to set the game precisely to their needs and interests.\n\nGeneRally cars are made up of a maximum of 40 polygons. Therefore, it is quite a skill to build them, which is done using community built tools. Most of the cars, that you can choose to drive, are fully color-customizable, which adds a personal touch to the game.\n\nThe tracks that come with GeneRally are small and simple, unlike most current third-party tracks. An official track editor lets the user put different objects (e.g. trees, walls, bridges and buildings) around the track, and make elevation changes, draw the areas with surfaces (asphalt, grass, mud, gravel, snow or water) and export and edit land's map into various advanced external graphic editors like Photoshop or GIMP. Every month since July 2003 the community sets up Track of Month, where the members of the community vote for the best tracks published over each month. The default game itself comes with two basic folders of tracks, an [Old Tracks] set, with a variety of creative courses, and a [World Tour Tracks] set, with courses based on several countries. They are all fictional, but some hint at or resemble real-life locations. In the recent version of 1.10, an additional track set was released by TuomoH and included in GeneRally.\n\nDrivers can be created easily within GeneRally, and each can be assigned to be either a computer-controlled driver or a human-controlled driver. If human-controlled, the commands for Accelerate, Brake, Left, and Right can be assigned. If computer-controlled, a skill level from 0-200 can be chosen, with 200 being the \"most-skilled\". Also, each driver can choose primary and secondary colors for themselves, both of which are selected using a \"color mixer\" of primary and secondary colors (both in RGB scales).\n\nVarious third party fonts for GeneRally are downloadable. rather than a TTF file.\n\nA palette is a file (with the extension \".pal\") that allows you to change the in-game colors in order to create a specific atmosphere (fog, rain, autumn, night,etc.) or just small changes to the environment (blue kerbs, grey wooden planks, darker grass,etc.).\n\nThe community of GeneRally has created several types of competitions to solve lack of competing to each other online. For all of them is common, that racer, who is taking a part, runs his event alone and not affected by other humans. Then he submits before set deadline predefined types of files of event to organizer (obviously savegame with full replay of his ride, then file of track, which he used and finally screenshot of game menu with after-race summary). The organizer then analyzes the files to verify their values (to prevent frauds), creates summary classification of all human drivers, merges the submitted replays and release results to public.\n\nThree types of events exist: \"race\", where a human racer runs together with AI racers - human racer with fastest race time wins, In a \"hotlap\" event the human racer has to race alone, without AI racers, and attempts to set the fastest single lap - the racer with fastest lap time wins. It's very similar system to game's mod \"time trial\". However the term \"time trial\" has another sense in competition's terminology, it represents a combined version of \"race\" and \"hotlap\" - a racer runs a ride without AI racers like in \"hotlap\", but on distance of several laps, trying to set as short summary time as possible like in \"race\".\n\nThe classical GeneRally event allows unlimited tries - racer can choose, which of his several tries will be submitted by him then and counted by organizer into the results. It eliminates natural accidents, failures, mistakes and influence of vis maior on racing.\n\nGeneRally World Ranking is classification and statistic of each one driver, team or nation, who joined one of supported competitions. It aims to compare the performances of GeneRally racers according to their performances in various competitions and to the difficulty of these. Sometimes it's compared with various real ranks like tennis' ATP. Since March 2003 every event, which fulfills GWR's rules, is classified and racers, teams and nations taking a part are awarded by number of points according defined scales.\n\n"}
{"id": "9794095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9794095", "title": "Ghost Town Village", "text": "Ghost Town Village\n\nGhost Town Village (formerly \"Ghost Town in the Sky at Ghost Mountain Park) is a Wild West-themed amusement park in Maggie Valley, North Carolina, United States that is currently on hiatus. An unusual aspect of this park is that it is located atop a mountain which can only be accessed by visitors via a chair lift or an inclined funicular railway. These start at the parking area beside Jonathan Creek at an elevation of , climbing to the lower level of the park at , a climb of . The recreated \"Ghost Town\" sits at , with the highest elevation in the park being about . The park is located on a ridge extending from Buck Mountain border, an extension of the Cataloochee Divide, to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park's entrance is located on U.S. Highway 19, the main road through the town. Ghost Town is promoted as \"North Carolina's mile-high theme park.\"\n\nGhost Town was the brainchild of R.B. Coburn, a Covington, VA native who moved to Maggie Valley, North Carolina. The park was designed by Russell Pearson and constructed for approximately $1 million in 1960. The park opened on May 1, 1961 and quickly became one of Western North Carolina's most popular tourist attractions. Pearson and Coburn also opened Frontierland in Cherokee North Carolina in 1964, then another Wild West theme park: Six Gun Territory in Florida.\n\nAt one point, 620,000 people visited Ghost Town each year. This number declined to 340,000 by 2008.\n\nThe park was sold in 1973 to National Services for a stock swap, but Coburn bought it back in 1986 and constructed the park's famous Red Devil roller coaster. In its later years under Coburn's ownership, the park suffered from mismanagement and a lack of maintenance. The Red Devil, Goldrusher, Sea Dragon, Monster, Mountain Town Swings, Undertaker, Dream Catcher, Casino, Round Up, Lil Devil and Silver Bullet rides were regularly breaking down and rarely opened, causing many visitors to tell others not to go. The chairlift and incline railway also required constant maintenance and repair. Coburn spent thousands of dollars maintaining them. On July 16, 2002, the chairlift stopped, stranding passengers for over two hours. With fewer people visiting Ghost Town because of the bad condition of the park, Coburn closed Ghost Town a few days after the chairlift failure and put the park up for sale. The park remained closed and unmaintained for the next four years, leading many to believe that nobody would buy the park because of the bad condition of the rides.\n\nGhost Town was sold in August 2006 and reopened on May 25, 2007 after $38 million was spent on renovations and improvements. All of the rides were reopened except the incline railway, the train and the Monster. The opening of the park in May was scheduled closely by Dean Teaster and Hank Woodburn so the motion picture \"Dean Teaster's Ghost Town,\" which was filmed in the western town could premiere that same weekend.\n\nIn 2009, after more than $11 million had been spent, $6 million of that on the Cliffhanger roller coaster, Ghost Town filed for bankruptcy. The economy and high gas prices the previous year were blamed for the park's problems, but managing partner Lynn Sylvester said reopening was planned for May 15 and the park would continue to operate.\n\nBy mid-May 2009, the park's rides had not been inspected and Ghost Town claimed to need a $330,000 loan in order to reopen for the summer on May 22. The park asked the town for that money. Failure to secure the loan was expected to mean the loss of 200 jobs and a $2 million payroll, as well as impact local businesses who benefited from park visitors. An anonymous investor provided the money, according to park president Steve Shiver, so a vote by the town on the loan request became unnecessary and the park opened as planned, except for rides that had not been inspected. The park also added a new ride, Geronimo Drop, which had been at Libertyland in Memphis, Tennessee and was bought by Ghost Town in 2007. Shiver said the park had a $27 million plan to improve the park over four to five years, including moving and adding rides and introducing new events.\n\nGhost Town continued to struggle financially until the end of the 2009 season, when the park closed while the owners dealt with bankruptcy issues amid complaints that employees were not being paid.\n\nOn February 5, 2010, a massive mudslide occurred when retaining walls on the Ghost Town property gave way. Although there were no injuries, more than 40 homes had to be evacuated and three homes were damaged around the mountain. The park itself sustained damage, but to what extent is not publicly known. This led to speculation that the park would not open at all for the 2010 season. Shiver announced on a local news program that the park was still slated to open on Memorial Day weekend, but this did not happen. Federal funding was granted to the park in the amount of $1.3 million for the clean-up of its main access road, Rich Cove, which was buried in the slide.\n\nIn early March, 2010, a judge ruled in favor of the park's largest creditors, SunTrust and BB&T, to proceed with foreclosure on Ghost Town and sell the property to begin paying off the park's $9 million debt to SunTrust and $5 million debt to BB&T. Ghost Town partners negotiated a separate deal with SunTrust and BB&T which gave them until May 31 to come up with an alternate plan to allow the park to continue operating if funding was obtained. On May 4, a judge approved a takeover bid by American Heritage Family Parks, who pledged to pay SunTrust $7 million of its debt, BB&T its entire $5 million of debt and pay $100,000 in back taxes to Haywood County. The park was said to be allowed to open for the season while details of the sale were worked out. Instead, the park remained closed.\n\nIn April 2011, the bankruptcy administrator recommended dismissing the case, citing the failure of Ghost Town partners to submit a sufficient reorganization plan to pay its debts. This allowed foreclosure proceedings to continue as the park was no longer protected under Chapter 11.\n\nIn February 2012, the park was purchased at public auction by Alaska Presley for $2.5 million. Presley, a Maggie Valley businesswoman involved with the park since its beginning, hoped to have at least a portion of the park open for the end of the 2012 season.\n\nOn June 29, 2012, the park's A-frame entrance opened to the public for the first time in four years for gifts to be sold. The chairlift was also open and tours of the town could be taken.\n\nA limited opening of the park was planned for 2013. During the four years the park was idle and without security, the property was subject to vandalism and theft. New laws required millions of dollars to be spent on labor and time lost due to state inspections. Wells for private water were condemned because they were too close to potentially unacceptable objects. Four new wells were drilled and all were failures except one of limited output. The option of city water was decided and virtually every piece and part of an old system had to be replaced.\n\nIn November 2014, Ghost Town was listed for sale with an asking price of $3 million by Action Creak Realty. The sale of the lower half of the property, which housed the Western theme park, was placed up for sale to attract investors for Presley's redevelopment of the upper portion of the property as a \"Holy Land replica theme park.\" On January 24, 2015 the property was taken off the market, prompted by major progress in the redevelopment of other parts of the property.\n\nOn October 22, 2015, the park announced the rebranding of the park to Ghost Town Village with a planned opening on June 1, 2016. The rebranded park was to feature gunfights, the chairlift, gift shops, ziplines, a museum, a paintball course, arcade and horseback riding. According to park management, the rebranding was due to the park's inability to reopen any of its former roller coasters and rides as the repair costs were too high.\n\nOn June 2, 2016, park management announced that the park would not open in 2016 and was again being offered for sale.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, an article in the Waynesville Mountaineer stated that a newly formed investment group, called \"Ghost Town Adventures\" had completed a purchase agreement for the park property from Alaska Presley, and is currently in the starting phases of restoring the park to its former glory, anticipating a 2019 re-opening, with a July 2018 preview for the public.\n\nThe park is divided into several \"towns\" located at different elevations of the mountain, each with a different theme. Among these are the \"Indian Village\", \"Mountain Town\" and \"Mining Town.\" The heart of the park is the recreated Old West town, complete with two saloons, a schoolhouse, bank, jail and church and various other businesses. Each hour, a gunfight was staged in the street, with visitors lining up to watch on the board sidewalks. The \"Silver Dollar Saloon\" featured hourly shows of Old West can-can dancers, while the \"Red Dog Saloon\" featured live country and bluegrass music performances throughout the day. \"Indian Village\" featured shows about Indian life in Old West days, including a deer hunt and a raid on a frontier settlement. \"Mining Town\" had areas where people could pan for gold and silver. It also had shows about life in mining settlements. \"Mountain Town\" featured shows about life in the Smoky Mountains.\n\nAt the terminus of the chairlift and incline railway is the \"Heritage Town Square,\" a 2007 addition to the park. This area featured a museum chronicling the history of \"Ghost Town\", a restaurant, the Freefall, the casino and the Cliffhanger.\n\nOriginally opened in 1988, Red Devil was renamed Cliffhanger in 2007 and given a new paint job. The coaster is unique in that rather than boarding the train and being towed up the lift hill, its boarding station is at the top of the hill. Once riders boarded, the train rolled out of the station, around a 90-degree curve and then over the main drop and into its one inverted loop. The rest of the track extends over the edge of the mountain with great views of the surrounding mountains. Cliffhanger's reopening was pushed back through the 2007 and 2008 seasons because of necessary major repairs.\n\nIt opened on June 30, 2009, but was closed less than two days later after a ride operator detected something wrong with one of the train’s seats. State inspectors on site discovered a hairline crack in the seat’s frame next to a bolt that attached the seat to the rest of the car. Rotational Motion, who built the custom cars for Ghost Town, was tasked with finding a solution. The coaster began operating again during the last few weeks of the 2009 season with no reported problems.\n\nDuring a test run the day before Ghost Town's 2010 season began, there was a problem with one of the train's wheel chassis. Contrary to reports, the train did not derail, but came to an abrupt halt. Shiver said that Cliffhanger would be closed until a new train was purchased.\n\nThe other roller coaster operating at Ghost Town is a children's small coaster, Tumbleweed. It was originally named Lil Devil, but received a name change along with Red Devil/Cliffhanger.\n\nAbove Ghost Town, a section of the park hosts a variety of standard amusement rides and the \"Mountain Top Music Hall\" and \"Indian Dance Hall.\" All of the rides are situated at the edge of the mountain, with one (\"The Gun Slinger\") that swings out over the mountainside.\n\nA new feature in 2009 was \"The House of Terror,\" a haunted house open during the Halloween season.\nRides no longer in use.\n\nIn October and November 2006, a movie was filmed at the park. The film, titled \"Ghost Town: The Movie\", was directed by Haywood County native Dean Teaster and technical director Jeff Kennedy. The film starred Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward, DJ Perry, Renee O'Connor, Terrance Knox, and Princess Lucaj with appearances by Rance Howard and Stella Parton (Dolly's sister). The movie was based on the legend of Harmon Teaster, a Haywood County native from Cold Springs now named Harmon Den Game Refuge Area, and premiered at the Eaglenest Entertainment Center in Maggie Valley on June 2, 2007. The inspiration of the movie came from Haywood County native Dean Teaster who had a story to tell about his ancestor Harmon Teaster and Ghost Town in the Sky, where he spent many summers as a child. Teaster's desire was to capture Ghost Town in the Sky as how it might have looked in the late 1870's.\n\n\"Ghost Town: The Movie\", later titled \"Dean Teaster's Ghost Town,\" at the time of release on Lionsgate label was listed the most rented Western film by \"Rentrax\" reporting service. This position held for sixteen weeks after its release. The rename was due to Paramount releasing their movie titled \"Ghost Town\" a month prior to the Lionsgate release of \"Ghost Town: The Movie.\" The movie brought elements of the original gunfight staged plays written by RB Coburn and Hubert Presley from the early 1960 era. Some of the gunfighters in the movie were the original gunfighter crew of 1961. Dean Teaster wanted to capture some of the original park design by Coburn, to keep it forever forged on film. Dean Teaster also brought his fathers character \"Digger the Undertaker\", back to life in the film to give tribute to his fathers original first creation of Coburn's \"Digger the Undertaker\". While Robert Teaster is noted as being one of the original \"Internationally Famous Ghost Town Gunfighters\" as well as the first undertaker, many others shared in this movie tribute to the first gunfighter crew. A marble stone was erected at the base of the mountain after filming as a tribute to the first gunfighter crews and the Hollywood stars that performed there.\n\nTwo independent films were filmed at the park, \"Mandie and the Secret Tunnel\" (2008) and \"Ringside Rosary\" (2010).\n\n\n"}

The sequel, \"SuperPower 2\", was published by DreamCatcher Interactive in North America on October 11, 2004 and in the EU on November 19, 2004.\n\nTwo different remastered versions of \"SuperPower 2\" were finally released with Nordic Games as publisher: \"SuperPower 2 Steam Edition\", released on Steam on April 18, 2014, and an unnamed version on Good Old Games/GOG.com on August 13, 2015.\n\nWith GolemLabs as development company, THQ Nordic has scheduled The Guild 3 for release in the second half of 2017.\n\nYears of turmoil followed the release of SuperPower 2, with the Financial Crisis and the Great Recession soon \"looming\" over the market at large. Ironically for GolemLabs, this famous Depression-times styled wording, used in SuperPower 2, soon hit the company itself. Forbes explained the everyday situation in 2012 like this: \nAkin to this deep macroeconomic SuperPower 2 study, we find that: Hard Times Are Still Hoover-ing Over Us at \"Great Depression\", Hooverville.\n\nDuring the Financial Crisis and the following Great Recession, both customers and investors for the gaming industry faced difficult times, spending was low, frugality was encouraged, resulting in investments and sales both drying up also for the gaming industry. An example of this is Obsidian Entertainment's history with the old THQ, the publisher caused by the publisher's own commercial failures: The old THQ's Reorganization, financial struggles (2010–2012) & the old THQ's Bankruptcy and liquidation, THQ Nordic (2012–present).\n\nAt the same time, JoWooD Entertainment, publisher of The Guild Series, went into administration. They had received Metascore ranging from mediocre to below average (The Guild 2 Venice flagged red, 49%) for their niche games and were bogged down by a lawsuit filed by JoWooD against Koch Media GmbH for €2.36 million ($3.06 million) plus interest. This caused their newly acquired subsidiary Dreamcatcher Interactive, GolemLabs' publisher for SuperPower 1 & 2, to file for bankruptcy. Then Nordic Games (2011–2016) acquired the rights & labels from JoWood and Dreamcatcher.\n\nSo a decade after GolemLabs' last published title, two different remastered versions of \"SuperPower 2\" were finally released with Nordic Games as publisher: \"SuperPower 2 Steam Edition\", released on Steam on April 18, 2014, and an unnamed version on Good Old Games/GOG.com on August 13, 2015.\n\nSince then, Lars Wingefors' company (Swedish entrepreneur, Nordic Games) as the new owners of the rights for The Guild series, \"was able to hire the Canadian developer GolemLabs in 2014\", (2013 according to insider sources) \"for the sequel of the popular The Guild series.

THQ Nordic, \"has been passionately committed on supporting and expanding the \"Guild\" games.\" This partnership with GolemLabs, who has a long experience in strategy games, combines the creative talents of both companies to expand on the potential of this beloved franchise.\"\n\nVienna, Austria, August 12, 2016: Nordic Games had acquired the rights to the THQ brand name, and reincorporated & renamed itself with a fusioned name: THQ Nordic, and went public with its own listing on the stock exchange. This meant even better times for GolemLabs, The new funding (finances) and therefore prospects were better after THQ Nordic took over. Swedish press instantly labeled Lars Wingefors as a \"Super Entrepreneur\" and \"billionaire\", hailing the move as a great commercial success.

THQ Nordic has scheduled The Guild 3 for release in the second half of 2017. In 2015, an alpha version of the game was shown to the public at Gamescom, according to German PC Games, relaying footage from THQ Nordic & GolemLabs' room there.

{"id": "255589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255589", "title": "Harlem Globetrotters", "text": "Harlem Globetrotters\n\nThe Harlem Globetrotters are an exhibition basketball team. They combine athleticism, theater, and comedy in their style of play. Over the years they have played more than 26,000 exhibition games in 123 countries and territories. The team's signature song is Brother Bones' whistled version of \"Sweet Georgia Brown\". Their mascot is an anthropomorphized globe named Globie. The team plays over 450 live events worldwide each year. The team is currently owned by Herschend Family Entertainment. The executive offices for the team are located in suburban Atlanta.\n\nThe Globetrotters originated on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, in the 1920s, where all the original players were raised. The Globetrotters began as the Savoy Big Five, one of the premier attractions of the Savoy Ballroom opened in January 1928, a basketball team of African-American players that played exhibitions before dances. In 1928, several players left the team in a dispute. That autumn, several of the players, led by Tommy Brookins, formed a team called the \"Globe Trotters\" and toured Southern Illinois that spring. Abe Saperstein became involved with the team as its manager and promoter. By 1929, Saperstein was touring Illinois and Iowa with his basketball team called the \"New York Harlem Globe Trotters\". Saperstein selected Harlem, New York, New York, as their home city since Harlem was considered the center of African-American culture at the time and an out-of-town team name would give the team more of a mystique. In fact, the Globetrotters did not play in Harlem until 1968, four decades after the team's formation.\nThe Globetrotters were perennial participants in the World Professional Basketball Tournament, winning it in 1940. In a heavily attended matchup a few years later, the 1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game, the Globetrotters made headlines when they beat one of the best white basketball teams in the country, the Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers). Once one of the most famous teams in the country, the Globetrotters were eventually eclipsed by the rise of the National Basketball Association, particularly when NBA teams began fielding African-American players in the 1950s. In 1950, Harlem Globetrotter Chuck Cooper became the first black player to be drafted in the NBA by Boston and teammate Nat \"Sweetwater\" Clifton became the first African-American player to sign an NBA contract when the New York Knicks purchased his contract from the Globetrotters.\n\nThe Globetrotters gradually worked comic routines into their act—a direction the team has credited to Reece \"Goose\" Tatum, who joined in 1941—and eventually became known more for entertainment than sports. The Globetrotters' acts often feature incredible coordination and skillful handling of one or more basketballs, such as passing or juggling balls between players, balancing or spinning balls on their fingertips, and making unusually difficult shots.\n\nIn 1952, the Globetrotters invited Louis \"Red\" Klotz to create a team to accompany them on their tours. This team, the Washington Generals (who also played under various other names), became the Globetrotters' primary opponents. The Generals are effectively stooges for the Globetrotters, with the Globetrotters handily defeating them in thousands of games.\nIn 1959, the Globetrotters played nine games in Moscow after Saperstein received an invitation from Vasily Gricorevich, the director of Lenin Central Stadium. The team, which included Wilt Chamberlain, was welcomed enthusiastically by spectators and authorities; they met Premier Nikita Khrushchev and collectively received the Athletic Order of Lenin medal.\n\nHowever, according to one report, spectators were initially confused: \"A Soviet audience of 14,000 sat almost silently, as if in awe, through the first half of the game. It warmed up slightly in the second half when it realized the Trotters are more show than competition.\" The Globetrotters brought their own opponent—not the Washington Generals, but the San Francisco Chinese Basketeers. A review in Pravda stated, \"This is not basketball; it is too full of tricks\" but praised the Globetrotters' skills and suggested that \"they have some techniques to show us.\"\nThe American press—particularly Drew Pearson—made note of the fact that the Globetrotters were paid (per game) the equivalent of $4,000, which could be spent only in Moscow. The games were used as evidence that U.S.–Soviet relations were improving, that Moscow was backing off its criticism of race relations inside America, and that the USSR was becoming more capitalist (Pearson suggested that the games were held because Lenin Stadium needed money).\n\nMany famous basketball players have played for the Globetrotters. Greats such as \"Wee\" Willie Gardner, Connie \"The Hawk\" Hawkins, Wilt \"The Stilt\" Chamberlain, and Nat \"Sweetwater\" Clifton later went on to join the NBA. The Globetrotters signed their first female player, Olympic gold medalist Lynette Woodard, in 1985. The Globetrotters have featured thirteen female players in their history. Baseball Hall of Famers Ernie Banks, Bob Gibson, and Ferguson Jenkins also played for the team at one time or another. \nBecause the majority of the team players have historically been African American, and as a result of the buffoonery involved in many of the Globetrotters' skits, they drew some criticism during the Civil Rights era. The players were accused by some civil-rights advocates of \"Tomming for Abe\", a reference to Uncle Tom and Jewish owner Abe Saperstein. However, prominent civil rights activist Jesse Jackson (who would later be named an Honorary Globetrotter) came to their defense by stating,\n\"I think they've been a positive influence... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior.\"\nIn 1995, Orlando Antigua became the first Hispanic player on the team. He was the first non-black player on the Globetrotters' roster since Bob Karstens played with the squad in 1942–43.\n\nWhile parts of a modern exhibition game are pre-planned, the games themselves are not fixed. While their opponents do not interfere with the Globetrotters’ hijinks while on defense, they play a serious game when in possession of the ball and about 20 to 30 percent of a game is \"real\". This once led to an infamous defeat at the hands of the Washington Generals, to the distress of a watching crowd.\n\nThe Globetrotters won the World Professional Basketball Tournament once, in 1940, beating the Chicago Bruins with a score of 31–29.\n\n \n\nStarting in 2007, the Globetrotters have conducted an annual \"draft\" a few days before the NBA draft, in which they select players they feel fit the mold of a Globetrotter. Being drafted by the Globetrotters does not guarantee a spot on the team, although several drafted players have gone on to become Globetrotters: Anthony \"Ant\" Atkinson (2007), Brent Petway (2007), William \"Bull\" Bullard (2008), Tay \"Firefly\" Fisher (2008), Charlie Coley III (2009), Paul \"Tiny\" Sturgess (2011), Jacob \"Hops\" Tucker (2011), Darnell \"Spider\" Wilks (2011), Bryan \"B-Nice\" Narcisse (2012), Tyrone Davis (2013), Corey \"Thunder\" Law (2013), Tyler \"Iceman\" Inman (2014) Devan \"Beast\" Douglas (2016) and AJ \"Money\" Merriweather.\n\nOther notable draft picks by the Globetrotters include: Sun Mingming (2007), Patrick Ewing, Jr. (2008), Sonny Weems (2008), Taylor Griffin (2009), Tim Howard (2009), Mark Titus (2010), Lionel Messi (2011), Andrew Goudelock (2011), Usain Bolt (2012), Mariano Rivera (2013), Brittney Griner (2013), Johnny Manziel (2014), Landon Donovan (2014), Mo'ne Davis (2015), Dude Perfect (2015), Neymar (2016), Missy Franklin (2016), Jordan Spieth (2016), Craig Sager (2016), Gal Gadot (2017), Aaron Judge (2017), Tim Tebow (2017) Paul Pogba (2018), and Joseph Kilgore (2018).\n\nThe Globetrotters have honored seven players by retiring their numbers:\n\nNote:<br>\na. The first non-Globetrotter to have a number retired by the team was Red Klotz, the founder, owner and two-handed-set-shot artist for the Washington Generals, the long-time Harlem Globetrotters' foils. He wore #3 as a player with the Generals, as well as during his standout collegiate and high school career in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Harlem Globetrotters have been featured in several of their own films and television series:\n\nTen people have been officially named as honorary members of the team:\n\n\nIn addition Bill Cosby (1972) and Magic Johnson (2003) were each signed to honorary $1-a-year lifetime contracts with the Globetrotters. When Cosby's nominal association with the team was the subject of criticism following sexual assault allegations, the Globetrotters stated that they had had no association with him for decades.\n\n"}
{"id": "3491523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3491523", "title": "Jerome Zerbe", "text": "Jerome Zerbe\n\nJerome Zerbe (July 24, 1904, Euclid, Ohio – August 19, 1988) was an American photographer. He was one of the originators of a genre of photography that is now common: celebrity paparazzi. Zerbe was a pioneer in the 1930s of shooting photographs of the famous at play and on-the-town. According to the cocktail recipe book \"Bottoms Up\" (1951), he is also credited with inventing the vodka martini.\n\nZerbe differed from the common paparazzo in a major way: he never hid in bushes or jumped out and surprised the rich and famous he was photographing. Rather, Zerbe often traveled and vacationed with the film stars themselves. As one biographer stated, Zerbe never rode in a rented limousine, and his coat pocket always had in it an engraved invitation to the high-society events.\n\n\"Once I asked Katharine Hepburn to come up from her place at Fenwick, a few miles away, and pose for some fashion photos for me,\" Zerbe recalled in his book \"Happy Times\". \"She arrived with a picnic hamper full of food and wine for the two of us. I snapped her just as she came to the door.\"\n\nIn a career that spanned more than 50 years, Zerbe's library held well over 50,000 photos. Some of his well-known images were of Greta Garbo at lunch, Cary Grant helping columnist Hedda Hopper move into her new home, Steve Reeves shaving, Moss Hart climbing a tree, Howard Hughes having lunch at \"21\" with Janet Gaynor, Ginger Rogers flying first-class, plus legendary stars Charlie Chaplin, Gary Cooper, Salvador Dalí, Jean Harlow, Dorothy Parker, Gene Tunney, Thomas Wolfe, and the Vanderbilts.\n\nZerbe claimed to be the first – and only – society photographer. He was for years the official photographer of Manhattan's famed nightspot El Morocco, the place to be and be seen, whether you were Humphrey Bogart, John O'Hara, or Ed Sullivan. Zerbe pioneered the business arrangement of getting paid by the nightclub to photograph its visitors, then turning around and giving the photos away to the gossip pages. Today, the practice is a common public relations stunt.\n\nZerbe was born in Euclid, Ohio, on July 24, 1904. His father, Jerome B. Zerbe, was the president of a coal company and a prominent citizen in nearby Cleveland, where the family later resided. Young Jerry Zerbe was driven to public school in the family limousine, which got him beaten up by bullies. He managed to survive well enough to be sent East, to the Salisbury School in Salisbury, Connecticut. There he took an interest in art, drawing, and photography.\n\nZerbe graduated from Yale in 1928, where he was an editor of the campus humor magazine \"The Yale Record\" with writer Geoffrey T. Hellman, writer and film critic Dwight MacDonald, and Hollywood art director Jack Otterson. While an undergrad, Zerbe had a knack for getting around the Prohibition laws, and was known as the guy who knew where the booze and parties were. (It helped that there was a speakeasy in the basement of \"The Yale Record\" building.) This paid off, and he became a supreme social networker. He gained important social prominence in New Haven, which would serve him well in New York City, Paris, and London.\n\nAfter graduation he went out to Hollywood to try his hand at drawing portraits of the famous residents. He was befriended by a young Gary Cooper, which led to Zerbe's quickly becoming friends with Hedda Hopper, Cary Grant, Errol Flynn, Randolph Scott, Marion Davies, and Paulette Goddard.\n\nIt did not take long for Zerbe to put down his paintbrush and pick up a camera. He photographed numerous stars in Hollywood's Golden Age and some of the hopefuls, before they became known, posed for him wearing few if any clothes.\n\nDuring the Depression, Zerbe landed his first major job, as art director of \"Parade\", which was headquartered in his hometown, Cleveland. This was where he began his career of setting up portraits of the upper crust. He persuaded the wealthy local residents that it would help them to be photographed at their parties, which was simply not done at the time. He convinced them that it would assist the charity balls and fundraisers the leading society matrons were hosting. This paid off. He shot hundreds of debutantes, brides, newlyweds, and formal dinners in North America and Europe.\n\nSoon afterward, Harry Bull, the editor of \"Town & Country\" in New York, saw some of Zerbe's society photos from Cleveland and made him an offer to photograph ritzy parties in the Midwest. This gave Zerbe's photos' a wide audience and garnered offers of work from the capital of glitz -- Manhattan.\n\nWhen Zerbe arrived in New York, he was in the right place at the right time. Prohibition had just ended, and nightlife was booming. The city had seven daily newspapers and three press associations. They all needed society photographs.\n\nZerbe got himself hired by the Rainbow Room – on the 65th Floor of 30 Rockefeller Center – to set up fashionable dinner parties and photograph the guests. Zerbe was shocked that at the height of the Depression, unemployed readers craved looking at photos of high-society types dressed in evening clothes and drinking champagne.\n\nAround 1934, Zerbe was in business in Manhattan. He was the staff photographer for both the Rainbow Room and a bustling nightclub, El Morocco. Zerbe said that from 1933 to 1938, he spent most nights from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. at El Morocco eating, drinking, and taking pictures.\n\nMany considered El Morocco the classiest nightclub in town and looked down upon the Stork Club regulars as \"tacky\". El Morocco was the place to be seen – particularly if one just came from a Broadway show. Zerbe photos taken at El Morocco are readily identifiable due to the blue-and-white zebra-stripe fabric on all the banquettes and couches.\n\nWorld War II prompted Zerbe to enlist in the Navy. He was able to bring his camera, became the official photographer for Admiral Nimitz, and found a way to travel with the stars who flew overseas to entertain the troops.\n\nAfter the war, Zerbe took up photographing café society with gusto. He was a charming man who was able to rub shoulders with dukes, duchesses, visiting dignitaries, as well as John Hay Whitney, Cornelius Vanderbilt IV, and scores of others. He traveled to France to photograph estates and country homes – and the residents as well.\n\nIn the 1940s, Zerbe worked for the Hearst newspaper chain, and wrote a Sunday column for the \"Sunday Mirror\" for more than 10 years. From 1949 to 1974, he was the society editor for \"Town & Country\". He traveled around the globe photographing big celebrity events.\n\nZerbe had several \"coffee table\" photo books published. Among them were \"People on Parade\" (1934), \"John Perona's El Morocco Family Album\" (1937), \"The Art of Social Climbing\" (1965), and with Brendan Gill of \"The New Yorker\", Zerbe's greatest collection, \"Happy Times\" (1973).\n\nZerbe died on August 19, 1988, at his Sutton Place apartment in Manhattan. He was 85.\n\nThe Zerbe photographic archive was purchased by Frederick R. Koch, eldest son of industrialist Fred C. Koch, and gifted in 2013 to the Beinecke Rare Book Library.\n\nIn the 1930s, Zerbe was the partner of the society columnist and writer Lucius Beebe. Beebe made so many flattering references to Zerbe in his newspaper column, \"This New York,\" that rival columnist Walter Winchell suggested that Zerbe should change the name to \"Jerome Never Looked Lovelier.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "646598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=646598", "title": "Literary language", "text": "Literary language\n\nA literary language is the form of a language used in the writing of the language. It is typically a dialect or standardised form of the language. It can sometimes differ noticeably from the various spoken forms of the language, but difference between literary and non-literary forms is greater in some languages than in others. Where there is a strong divergence between a written form and the spoken vernacular, the language is said to exhibit diglossia.\n\nA related concept is liturgical writing, which is the language or form of language used in the liturgy of some religions.\n\nFor much of its history, there has been a distinction in the English language between an elevated literary language and a colloquial language. After the Norman conquest of England, for instance, Latin and French displaced English as the official and literary languages, and standard literary English did not emerge until the end of the Middle Ages. At this time and into the Renaissance, the practice of aureation (the introduction of terms from classical languages, often through poetry) was an important part of the reclamation of status for the English language, and many historically aureate terms are now part of general common usage. Modern English no longer has quite the same distinction between literary and colloquial registers.\n\nEnglish has been used as a literary language in countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, for instance in India up to the present day, Malaysia in the early 20th century and Nigeria, where English remains the official language.\n\nModern Standard Arabic is the contemporary literary and standard register of Classical Arabic used in writing across all Arabic-speaking countries and any governing body with Arabic as an official language. Many western scholars distinguish two varieties: the Classical Arabic of the Qur'an and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) literature; and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the standard language in use today. The modern standard language is closely based on the Classical language, and most Arabs consider the two varieties to be two registers of the same language. Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages .\n\nThe sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia—the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts. Educated Arabic speakers are usually able to communicate in MSA in formal situations. This diglossic situation facilitates code-switching in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. In instances in which highly educated Arabic-speakers of different nationalities engage in conversation but find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Kuwaiti), they are able to code switch into MSA for the sake of communication.\n\nThe Aramaic language has been diglossic for much of its history, with many different literary standards serving as the \"high\" liturgical languages, including Syriac language, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic language and Mandaic language, while the vernacular Neo-Aramaic languages serve as the vernacular language spoken by the common people like Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Hértevin language, Koy Sanjaq Syriac language, Senaya language), Western Neo-Aramaic, Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, Central Neo-Aramaic (Mlahsô language, Turoyo language), Neo-Mandaic, Hulaulá language, Lishana Deni, Lishanid Noshan, Lishán Didán, Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic, and Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.\n\nThe Armenian language was a diglossic language for much of its history, with Classical Armenian serving as the \"high\" literary standard and liturgical language, and the Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian dialects serving as the vernacular language of the Armenian people. Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian were eventually standardized into their own literary forms.\n\nStandard Bengali has two forms:\n\n\nGrammatically, the two forms are identical, and differing forms, such as verb conjugations, are easily converted from one form to another. However, the vocabulary is quite different from one form to the other and must be learned separately. Among the works of Rabindranath Tagore are examples of both shadhubhasha (especially among his earlier works) and chôlitôbhasha (especially among his later works). The national anthem of India was originally written in the shadhubhasha form of Bengali.\n\nLiterary Chinese, \"Wényánwén\" (文言文), \"Literary Writing\", is the form of written Chinese used from the end of the Han dynasty to the early 20th century when it was replaced by written vernacular Chinese, or \"Baihua\" (白話) spoken according to Standard Mandarin pronunciation. Literary Chinese continually diverged from Classical Chinese as the dialects of China became more disparate and as the Classical written language became less representative of the spoken language. At the same time, Literary Chinese was based largely upon the Classical language, and writers frequently borrowed Classical language into their literary writings. Literary Chinese therefore shows a great deal of similarity to Classical Chinese, even though the similarity decreased over the centuries.\n\nStarting from early 20th century, written vernacular Chinese have become a standard for Chinese writing which is mostly aligned with a standardized form of Mandarin Chinese, which however mean there are divergence between written vernacular Chinese against other Chinese variants like Cantonese, Shanghainese, Hokkien and Sichuanese. Some of these variants have their own literary form but none of them are being used in formal register.\n\nThe Finnish language has a literary variant, literary Finnish, and a spoken variant, spoken Finnish. Both are considered a form of non-dialectal standard language, and are used throughout the country. Literary Finnish is a consciously created fusion of dialects for use as a literary language, which is rarely spoken at all, being confined to writing and official speeches.\n\nThe Georgian language has a literary liturgical form, the Old Georgian language, while the vernacular spoken varieties are the Georgian dialects and other related Kartvelian languages like Svan language, Mingrelian language, and Laz language.\n\nGerman differentiates between \"Hochdeutsch\"/\"Standarddeutsch\" (Standard German) and \"Umgangssprache\" (colloquial language). Amongst the differences is the regular use of the genitive case or the simple past tense \"Präteritum\" in written language. In colloquial German genitive phrases (\"des Tages\") are frequently replaced with a construction of \"von\" + dative object (\"von dem Tag\") - comparable to English \"the dog's tail\" vs. \"the tail of the dog\" - likewise the \"Präteritum\" (\"ich ging\") can be substituted with the perfect (\"ich bin gegangen\") to a certain degree. Nevertheless, the use of neither the \"Präteritum\" nor especially the genitive case is totally unusual in colloquial language, just quite rare, yet also depending on a region's dialect and/or the grade of education of the speaker. People of higher education use the genitive more regularly in colloquial language and the use of perfect instead of \"Präteritum\" is especially common in southern Germany, where the \"Präteritum\" is considered somewhat declamatory. The German \"Konjunktiv I / II\" (\"er habe\" / \"er hätte\") is also used more regularly in written form being replaced by the conditional (\"er würde geben\") in colloquial language, although in some southern German dialects the \"Konjunktiv II\" is used more often. Generally there is a continuum between more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties in German, while colloquial German nonetheless tends to increase analytic elements at the expense of synthetic elements.\n\nFrom the early nineteenth century until the mid-20th century, \"Katharevousa\", a form of Greek, was used for literary purposes. In later years, \"Katharevousa\" was used only for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting) while \"Dhimotiki\", ‘demotic’ or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a diglossic situation until in 1976 \"Dhimotiki\" was made the official language.\n\nDuring the revival of the Hebrew language, spoken and literary Hebrew were revived separately, causing a dispersion between the two. The dispersion started to narrow sometime after the two movements merged, but substantial differences between the two still exist until nowadays.\n\nWhen Italy was unified, in 1861, Italian existed mainly as a literary language. Different languages were spoken throughout the Italian Peninsula, many of which were Romance languages which had developed in every region, due to the political fragmentation of Italy. Now, it is the standard language of Italy.\n\nUntil the late 1940s, the prominent literary language in Japan was the Classical Japanese language (文語 \"Bungo\"), which is based on the language spoken in Heian period (Late Old Japanese) and is different from the contemporary Japanese language in grammar and some vocabulary. It still has relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in \"bungo\", although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). Bungo grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect, and fixed form poetries like Haiku and Tanka are still mainly written in this form.\n\nIn the Meiji period, some authors started to use the colloquial form of the language in their literature. Following the government policy after the World War II, the standard form of contemporary Japanese language is used for most literature published since the 1950s. The standard language is based on the colloquial language in Tokyo area, and its literary stylistics in polite form differs little from its formal speech. Notable characteristics of literary language in contemporary Japanese would include more frequent use of Chinese origin words, less use of expressions against prescriptive grammar such as \"ら抜き言葉\", and use of non-polite normal form (\"-だ/-である\") stylistics that are rarely used in colloquial language.\n\nIn the Javanese language, alphabet characters derived from the alphabets used to write Sanskrit, no longer in ordinary use, are used in literary words as a mark of respect.\n\nKannada exhibits a strong diglossia, like Tamil, also characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style, and a modern colloquial form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.\n\nThe formal style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of Kannada literature and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio.\n\nThere are also many dialects of Kannada, one major dialect being \"Dharwad Kannada\" of North Karnataka.\n\nClassical Latin was the literary register used in writing from 75 BC to the 3rd century AD, while Vulgar Latin was the common, spoken variety used across the Roman Empire. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to Gaul, Iberia, or Dacia was not identical to the Latin of Cicero, and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. Some literary works with low-register language from the Classical Latin period give a glimpse into the world of early Vulgar Latin. The works of Plautus and Terence, being comedies with many characters who were slaves, preserve some early basilectal Latin features, as does the recorded speech of the freedmen in the \"Cena Trimalchionis\" by Petronius Arbiter. At the third Council of Tours in 813, priests were ordered to preach in the vernacular language—either in the \"rustica lingua romanica\" (Vulgar Latin), or in the Germanic vernaculars—since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin.\n\nMacedonian (/ˌmæsɪˈdoʊniən/; македонски, tr. makedonski, pronounced [maˈkɛdɔnski ˈjazik] (About this sound listen)) is a South Slavic language spoken as a first language by around two million people, principally in the Republic of Macedonia and the Macedonian diaspora, with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational region of Macedonia. It is the official language of the Republic of Macedonia and a recognized minority language in parts of Albania, Romania and Serbia.\n\nThe Malay language exists in a Classical variety, a modern standard variety and several vernacular dialects.\n\nMaltese has a variety of dialects (including the Żejtun dialect, Qormi dialect and Gozitan amongst others) that co-exist alongside Standard Maltese. Literary Maltese, unlike Standard Maltese, features a preponderance of Semitic vocabulary and grammatical patterns; however, this traditional separation between Semitic and Romance influences in Maltese literature (especially Maltese poetry and Catholic liturgy on the island) is changing.\n\nStandard Manchu was based on the language spoken by the Jianzhou Jurchens during Nurhaci's time, while other unwritten Manchu dialects such as that of Aigun and Sanjiazi were also spoken in addition to the related Xibe language.\n\nThe Classical Mongolian language was the high register used for religious and official purposes, while the various Mongolian dialects served as the low register, like Khalkha Mongolian, Chakhar Mongolian, Khorchin Mongolian, Kharchin Mongolian, Baarin Mongolian, Ordos Mongolian and the Buryat language. The Tibetan Buddhist canon was translated into Classical Mongolian. The Oirat Mongols who spoke the Oirat Mongol language and dialects like Kalmyk language or Torgut Oirat used a separate standard written with the Clear script.\n\nThe Mongolian language, based on Khalkha Mongolian, now serves as the high register in Mongolia itself while in Inner Mongolia a standard Mongolian based on Chakhar Mongolian serves as the high register for all Mongols in China. The Buryat language, which is seen by some as part of the Mongolian language, has been turned into a standard literary form itself in Russia.\n\nN'Ko is a literary language devised by Solomana Kante in 1949 as a writing system for the Mande languages of West Africa. It blends the principal elements of the mutually unintelligible Manding languages. The movement promoting N'Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the Maninka cultural identity in Guinea, and has also strengthened the Mande identity in other parts of West Africa. N'Ko publications include a translation of the Qur'an, a variety of textbooks on subjects such as physics and geography, poetic and philosophical works, descriptions of traditional medicine, a dictionary, and several local newspapers.\n\nPersian or New Persian has been used continually as the literary language of Iran and Afghanistan, as well as India and Central Asia, for over a millennium. The language written today remains essentially the same as that used by Ferdowsi despite variant colloquial dialects and forms. Until the 20th century, every educated person from the Bosphorus to the Bay of Bengal would be expected to know some Persian. It was the second major vehicle after Arabic in transmitting Islamic culture and has a particularly prominent place in Sufism. It remains a in active use in the Indian subcontinent among traditionally educated Muslim, although its former position has been occupied to a great degree by Urdu. There are prominent Persian writers from Modern Turkey, such as Rumi and Uzbekistan, such as Jami. The corpus of literary writing in Persian from the Indian subcontinent is greater than that of Iran and Central Asia.\n\nSlavonic-Serbian (\"slavenosrpski\") was the literary language of Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy used from the mid-18th century to 1825. It was a linguistic blend of Church Slavonic of the Russian recension, vernacular Serbian (Štokavian dialect), and Russian. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was severely attacked by Vuk Karadžić and his followers, whose reformatory efforts formed modern literary Serbian based on the popular language, known as Serbo-Croatian.\n\nTagalog was the basis of the Filipino language; both share the same vocabulary and grammatical system and are mutually intelligible. However, there is a significant political and social history that underlies the reasons for differentiating between Tagalog and Filipino.\n\nModern Tagalog is derived from Archaic Tagalog, which was likely spoken during the Classical period, it was the language of the Mai State, Tondo Dynasty (according to the Laguna Copperplate Inscription) and southern Luzon. It was written using Baybayin, a syllabary which is a member of the Brahmic family, before the Spanish Romanised the alphabet beginning in the late 15th century. Tagalog was also the spoken language of the 1896 Philippine Revolution.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution maintains that Filipino is the country’s national language and one of two official languages, alongside English. Today, Filipino is considered the proper term for the language of the Philippines, especially by Filipino-speakers who are not of Tagalog origin, with many referring to the Filipino language as “Tagalog-based\". The language is taught in schools throughout the country and is the official language of education and business. Native Tagalog-speakers meanwhile comprise one of the largest linguistic and cultural groups of the Philippines, numbering an estimated 14 million.\n\nTamil exhibits a strong diglossia, characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style and a modern colloquial form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.\n\nThe modern literary style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of Tamil literature and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio.\n\nClassical Tibetan was the high register used universally by all Tibetans while the various mutually unintelligible Tibetic languages serve as the low register vernacular, like Central Tibetan language in Ü-Tsang (Tibet proper), Khams Tibetan in Kham, Amdo Tibetan in Amdo, Ladakhi language in Ladakh and Dzongkha in Bhutan. Classical Tibetan was used for official and religious purposes, such as in Tibetan Buddhist religious texts like the Tibetan Buddhist canon and taught and learned in monasteries and schools in Tibetan Buddhist regions.\n\nNow, Standard Tibetan, based on the Lhasa dialect, serves as the high register in China. In Bhutan, the Tibetan Dzongkha language has been standardised and replaced Classical Tibetan for official purposes and education, in Ladakh, the standard official language learned are now the unrelated languages Hindi-Urdu and English, and in Baltistan, the Tibetan Balti language serves as the low register while the unrelated Urdu language is the official language.\n\nThe Turkic Chagatai language served as the high register literary standard for Central Asian Turkic peoples, while the vernacular low register languages were the Uzbek language and Eastern Turki (Modern Uyghur). The Soviet Union abolished Chagatai as the literary standard and had the Uzbek language standardized as a literary language for, and the Taranchi dialect of Ili was chosen as the literary standard for Modern Uyghur, while other dialects like the Kashgar and Turpan dialects continue to be spoken.\n\nStandard Yoruba is the literary form of the Yoruba language of West Africa, the standard variety learnt at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when Samuel A. Crowther, native Yoruba and the first African Anglican Bishop in Nigeria, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the Ọyọ and Ibadan dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects. Additionally, it has some features peculiar to itself only, for example the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as calques from English which originated in early translations of religious works. The first novel in the Yorùbá language was \"Ogboju Ode ninu Igbo Irunmale\" (\"The Forest of A Thousand Demons\"), written in 1938 by Chief Daniel O. Fagunwa (1903–1963). Other writers in the Yorùbá language include: Senator Afolabi Olabimtan (1932–1992) and Akinwunmi Isola.\n\n\n"}

It is the third installment of the \"Madagascar\" series and the sequel to \"\" (2008). It is also the first in the series to be released in 3D. The film is directed by Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath, and Conrad Vernon, with a screenplay written by Darnell and Noah Baumbach.\n\nIn this film, Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer), and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) are still struggling to get home to New York. This time, their journey takes them to Europe, where they are relentlessly pursued by the murderous Monaco-based French Animal Control officer Captain Chantel Dubois (Frances McDormand). As a means of getting passage to North America, the animals join a circus, where they become close friends with the animal performers, including the new characters of Gia (Jessica Chastain), Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), and Stefano (Martin Short). Together, they spectacularly revitalize the business and along the way find themselves reconsidering where their true home really is.\n\n\"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\" made its world premiere at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2012. In the United States, it was released on June 8, 2012. It has a 79% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is the eighth highest-grossing film of 2012 and the highest-grossing \"Madagascar\" film with a worldwide gross of over $746 million. A spin-off titled \"Penguins of Madagascar\" was released on November 26, 2014. A sequel, \"Madagascar 4\", was initially announced for 2018 but it was removed from its schedule due to the studio's restructuring.\n\nMany days after bidding the penguins goodbye, Alex the lion suggests to his friends, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe and Gloria the hippopotamus and the lemurs, King Julien XIII the ring-tailed lemur, Maurice the aye-aye and Mort the mouse lemur that they should go to Monte Carlo to get the penguins and chimpanzees, Mason and Phil and fly back to New York City, which they agree to do.\n\nIn Monte Carlo, the penguins and chimpanzees have been saving up their daily winnings from the casino to fly back to Africa and bring their friends home. Alex's interference to kidnap them leads to animal control, led by a vicious big-game hunter named Chantel DuBois, pursuing them around the city, with Alex and the gang barely escaping. With determination, DuBois vows to capture Alex and add his head to her collection of animals' heads she's captured.\n\nIn the skies of France, the plane crashes as the authorities close in. They come across a circus train consisting of Stefano the sea lion, Gia the jaguar, and Vitaly the tiger, and manage to gain entry, claiming that they are circus animals themselves. The team soon learn from Stefano that they are performing in Rome and London, where they plan to impress a promoter to get them on their first American tour. Before the zoo animals' claim is discredited, the penguins suddenly appear with a deal to purchase the circus themselves; however, the circus animals' show in Rome proves to be a failure.\n\nIn route to London, Stefano soon reveals to Alex that Vitaly was the biggest star of them all, but quit due to an accident in one of his stunts; therefore, the friends lost faith in the circus. At a stop in the Alps, Alex convinces the circus to continue pursuing the circus. Marty finds a new passion in being shot out of a cannon along with Stefano, while Melman and Gloria decide to dance on a tightrope. Gia persuades Alex to teach her Trapeze Americano. In the process, they grow closer.\n\nMeanwhile, DuBois is arrested in Rome while chasing the animals, but escapes and discovers that Alex was the missing lion from the zoo in New York. Once free, DuBois personally reassembles her injured men and they head toward the Alps, forcing the animals to proceed to London despite incomplete rehearsals. Alex finds Vitaly preparing to leave and convinces him to stay by reminding him of how he enjoys performing the impossible. He suggests that he uses hair conditioner as a safer lubricant to perform his flaming ring jump as well as fix his damaged fur. As a result, Vitaly's stunt is performed perfectly and the show is a spectacular success. After the impressed promoter arranges for an American tour, DuBois shows up with a paper showing that Alex was missing. Though the penguins are able to foil Dubois' plan, Alex is forced to confess that the four of them are just zoo animals trying to get home, disappointing the others who feel used and lied to.\n\nThe zoo animals and circus go their separate ways but arrive in New York City at the same time. Realizing how much their adventures have changed them, the zoo animals find that their true home was with the circus. Before they can go back, however, DuBois tranquilizes and captures them, before being discovered by the zoo staff, who believe she is responsible for returning the missing animals. King Julien and the penguins manage to get to the circus and convince the circus animals to rescue their friends.\n\nBack at the zoo, Alex awakens to find that he along with his friends are trapped in larger fence enclosures. DuBois, who was honored by the zoo guards, secretly loads a poison-filled dart into a gun that she hides inside a foam finger in preparation for publicly executing Alex. The circus animals arrive led by Skipper and are able to defeat DuBois and her henchmen. Alex and his friends eventually decide to permanently join the circus to pursue their adventures, while DuBois and her henchmen are sent off in crates bound for Madagascar (just like the zoo animals themselves were in the first film) thanks to the penguins.\n\n\nDreamWorks Animation's CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg confirmed in 2008 that there would be an additional sequel to \"Madagascar\" and \"\". Katzenberg stated, \"There is at least one more chapter. We ultimately want to see the characters make it back to New York.\" At the Television Critics Association press tour in January 2009, Katzenberg was asked if there would be a third film in the series.

On Metacritic, it holds a score of 60 out of 100 based on 26 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nLisa Kennedy of \"The Denver Post\" gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"From time to time the improbable occurs: A sequel outdoes its original.\" Colin Covert of \"Star Tribune\" said that \"Madagascar 3\" set a high standard for cartoon comedy and was almost too good for kids. He gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars. Giving the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"A neon-saturated, high-flying trapeze act with enough frenetic funny business that it's a wonder the folks behind this zillion-dollar franchise about zoo critters on the lam didn't send the animals to the circus sooner.\" Stephen Witty of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" calls the movie \"fun and fast family entertainment. […] the animals' jazzy circus performance, done in black-light colors and set to a Katy Perry song—may be one of the trippiest scenes in a mainstream kiddie movie since \"Dumbo\" saw those pink elephants.\" Film scholar Timothy Laurie writes that the plot development of \"Madagascar 3\" is \"met with large servings of personal growth and side dishes of overcooked romance\".\n\n\"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\" earned $216,391,482 in North America and $530,529,792 in other countries for a worldwide total of $746,921,274.

{"id": "250945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250945", "title": "Media circus", "text": "Media circus\n\nMedia circus is a colloquial metaphor, or idiom, describing a news event for which the level of media coverage — measured by such factors as the number of reporters at the scene and the amount of material broadcast or published — is perceived to be excessive or out of proportion to the event being covered. Coverage that is sensationalistic can add to the perception the event is the subject of a media circus. The term is meant to critique the coverage of the event by comparing it to the spectacle and pageantry of a circus. Usage of the term in this sense became common in the 1970s. It can also be called a media feeding frenzy or just media frenzy, especially when they cover the media coverage.\n\nAlthough the idea is older, the term \"media circus\" began to appear around the mid-1970s. An early example is from the 1976 book by author Lynn Haney, in which she writes about a romance in which the athlete Chris Evert was involved: \"Their courtship, after all, had been a \"'media circus.'\"\" A few years later \"The Washington Post\" had a similar courtship example in which it reported, \"Princess Grace herself is still traumatized by the memory of her own \"media-circus\" wedding to Prince Rainier in 1956.\" The term has become increasingly popular with time since the 1970s. Reasons for being critical of the media are varied; at the core of most criticism is that there may be a significant opportunity cost when other more important news issues get less public attention as a result of coverage of the hyped issue.\n\nMedia circuses make up the central plot device in the 1951 movie \"Ace in the Hole\" about a self-interested reporter who, covering a mine disaster, allows a man to die trapped underground. It cynically examines the relationship between the media and the news they report. The movie was subsequently re-issued as \"The Big Carnival\", with \"carnival\" referring to what we now call a \"circus\". The movie was based on real-life Floyd Collins who in 1925 was trapped in a Kentucky cave drawing so much media attention that it became the third largest media event between the two World Wars (the other two being Lindbergh's solo flight and the Lindbergh kidnapping).\n\nEvents described as a media circus include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was first broadcast on Soviet Central Television in 1965, 20 years after the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. Aside from the minute of silence itself the main part of the program was a solemn address, commonly known as \"The Minute of Silence\", dedicated to all those who fell fighting the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe idea of the program was suggested by Irana Kazakova. Other people of the team who produced the first version were Ekaterina Tarkhanova, Svetlana Volodina, Arkadi Revenko, Mesyatsev, Khazanov, Levitskaya, and other people assistants, artists, musical editors, etc.\n\nThe program was started with the announcement \"Attention, Attention! Moscow is speaking and broadcasting!\" by the Soviet radio voice Yuri Levitan, famous for his announcements during World War II. The very \"minute of silence\" was sounded with the toll of the Moscow Kremlin bells and the clock at the Spasskaya Tower striking seven in the evening. The address was initially narrated by well-known Soviet radio commenter and actress Vera Enyutina. The TV version was showing the flame on the background of a wall with the text \"To the Memory of the Fallen.\" Due to its solemnity the address was informally known as \"the prayer\".\n\nAfter Enyutina emigrated to the United States the address was narrated by Levitan, and later by Igor Kirillov. The text of the address was modified during the Brezhnev stagnation by Galina Shergova and Yevgeny Sinitsyn, under the orders of the management. In particular, a piece about \"Malaya Zemlya\" was inserted (removed after Leonid Brezhnev's death in the May 9, 1983 broadcast).The text was replaced with a new one in 2015, with inserted footage from the first ever minute of silence from that year's Victory Day Parade, plus pictures of some of the many fatalities of the conflict.\n\nRussia's Channel One and other networks (like Russia 1) still broadcast this special program today while RT broadcasts it in English, Spanish and Arabic for the benefit of its international viewers.

UNAIDS estimate there are 3588 prostitutes in the country. The Macedonian government is trying to clamp down on prostitution.\n\nSTAR-STAR (Association for support of marginalised workers) is a sex worker led support group. It's Executive Board is exclusively made up of sex workers. STAR-STAR was the first sex workers collective in the Balkans.\n\nThe country is a major transit point for prostitution to the west. The trafficking of women for sex is worth billions in Macedonia and is considered to be run primarily by Albanian gangsters. The reputed 'kimgpin' of sex trafficking, Dilaver Bojku, was murdered by a close range gunshot to the head in August 2017.\n\nActivities related to prostitution are prohibited in the Republic of Macedonia by both the \"Law on Misdemeanours Against the Public Order and Peace\" and the \"Criminal Law 1996\".\n\nSoliciting in a public place is prohibited by article 19 of the Law on Misdemeanours. The article also prohibits providing space for an act of prostitution. As restaurants, bars and hotels are defined as public places, owners of such places can be fined if prostitution occurs on the premises. Sex in public is also prohibited.\n\nArticle 191 of the Criminal Law prohibits third party involvement, such as procuring, pimping and profiting from the prostitution of others.\n\nLaw enforcement is corrupt, and often violent towards sex workers. In a 2007 study reported 82.4% of sex workers had been assaulted by the police.\n\nMacedonia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls in Macedonia are subjected to sex trafficking within the country in restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Foreign victims subjected to sex trafficking in Macedonia typically originate from Eastern Europe, particularly Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine. Citizens of Macedonia and foreign victims transiting Macedonia are subjected to sex trafficking in Southern, Central, and Western Europe. Migrants and refugees, particularly women and unaccompanied minors, travelling or being smuggled through Macedonia are vulnerable to trafficking. Students are vulnerable to false employment promises in other European countries. Traffickers frequently bribe police and labour inspectors. Police have been investigated and convicted for complicity in human trafficking.\n\nArticles 418(a) and (d) of the criminal code prohibit all forms of trafficking and prescribe a minimum penalty of four years imprisonment for trafficking adults and 12 years imprisonment for trafficking children. In December 2015, the government deleted article 191(a) on child prostitution, which had allowed the prosecution of child sex traffickers for a lesser offence, and amended article 418(d). The government investigated one sex trafficking case involving six suspects for sex and labour trafficking of children, compared to zero investigations in 2015.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks the Republic of Macedonia as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\n"}

It is played between two players, Alice and Bob, and arbitrated by a referee. The referee outputs the pay-off for the players after interacting with them for a fixed number of rounds, while exchanging quantum information.\n\nAn formula_1-turn quantum referee performs formula_1 rounds of interaction with the player Alice and Bob. Each interaction involves receiving some quantum states from Alice and Bob, processing the quantum states together with the \"left-over\" state from the previous interaction, producing some output state, and sending part of the output state to the players. At the end of the formula_1 rounds, the referee processes the final state received from the players and decides the pay-off for Alice and Bob.\nMathematically, an n-turn referee is a measuring co-strategy formula_4 whose input spaces formula_5 and output spaces formula_6 are of the form\n\nfor complex Euclidean spaces formula_9 and formula_10.\n\nformula_11 represent the message sent by the referee to Alice and Bob during turn formula_12, and formula_13 correspond to their responses. At the end of formula_1 turns, the referee produces an output formula_15\n\nAn formula_1-turn quantum refereed game consists of an n-turn referee along with functions formula_17 that maps each measurement output formula_18 to Alice's and Bob's pay-off.\n\nIndividual quantum refereed games may place specific restrictions on strategies Alice and Bob can choose from. For example, in nonlocal games and pseudo-telepathy games, Alice and Bob are allowed to share entanglement but are forbidden from communicating. In general, such restrictions may not apply in quantum refereed games.\n\nSimilar to a classical zero-sum game, a zero-sum quantum refereed game is a quantum refereed game with the additional constraint formula_19.\n\nIt is natural to assume Alice and Bob play independent strategies in a zero-sum quantum refereed game, since it cannot simultaneously be to both players' advantage to communicate directly with one another or to initially share an entanglement state {reference}. In this case, Alice's and Bob's strategy can be represented by\n\nwhere formula_22 is the set of all n-turn strategies having input space formula_23 and output space formula_6.\n\nThe combined strategy is then formula_25.\n\nDefine formula_26, and formula_27, then Alice's expected pay-off is formula_28\n\nThe optimal strategy for Alice then lies in the min-max problem\n\nThe above equality holds because formula_30 are drawn from compact and convex sets formula_31 and formula_32. It is called the min-max theorem for zero-sum quantum games.\n\nA quantum interactive proof with two competing provers is a generalization of the single prover quantum interactive proof system. It can be modelled by zero-sum refereed games where Alice and Bob are the competing provers, and the referee is the verifier. The referee is assumed to be computationally bounded (polynomial size quantum circuit), whereas Alice and Bob can be computationally unrestricted. Alice, Bob and the referee receive a common string, and after fixed rounds of interactions (exchanging quantum information between the provers and the referee), the referee decides whether Alice wins or Bob wins.\n\nIn the classical setting, RG can be viewed as the following problem. Alice, Bob, and the referee is given some statement. Alice is trying to convince the referee that the statement is true while Bob is trying to convince the referee that the statement is false. The referee, who has limited computing power, will look at the proofs provided by Alice and Bob, ask them questions, and at the end of the day decide which player is correct (wins). The goal is for the referee to find an algorithm such that if the statement is true, there is a way for Alice to win with probability greater than 3/4, and if the statement is false, there is a way for Bob to win with probability greater than 3/4.\n\nIn the language of complexity theory, a promise problem formula_33 has a classical refereed game (classical RG) if there exists a referee described by polynomial time randomized computation, such that\n\nIt is known that RG = EXP.\n\nQuantum interactive proof systems with competing provers is a generalization of the classical RG where the referee is now restricted to polynomial-time generated quantum circuits and may exchange quantum information with the players. Therefore, QRG can be seen as the following problem. Alice, Bob and the referee is given some statement (it may involve a quantum state). Alice is trying to convince the referee the statement is true while Bob is trying to convince the referee the statement is false. The referee can ask the provers questions via quantum states, receive answers in quantum states, and analyse the received quantum states using a quantum computer. After communicating with Alice and Bob for formula_1 rounds, the referee decides whether the statement is true or false. If there is a way for the referee to make a correct decision with probability ≥ 3/4, the game is in QRG.\n\nMore formally, QRG denotes the complexity class for all promise problems having quantum refereed games defined as follows. Given a string formula_37, a promise problem formula_33 is in QRG if there is a referee represented by a polynomial time generated quantum circuit such that\n\nIt turns out that QRG = EXP — allowing the referee to use quantum circuit and send or receive quantum information does not give the referee any extra power. EXP ⊆ QRG follows from the fact that EXP = RG ⊆ QRG. proved QRG ⊆ EXP by a formulation of QRG using semidefinite programs (SDP).\n\nFor a quantum refereed game, at the end of all the interactions, the referee outputs one of the two possible outcomes formula_41 to indicate whether Alice wins formula_42 or Bob wins formula_43.\n\nSetting formula_44 results in a quantum refereed game whose value is the maximum winning probability for Alice.\n\nUsing the same notation as the zero sum quantum refereed game as above, the referee is represented by operators formula_45, Alice may pick a strategy from formula_46, and Bob from formula_47. Define\n\nwhere formula_50 is the partial trace operator.\n\nThe referee outputs formula_51 with probability formula_52, and formula_53 with probability formula_54. formula_55 can be considered as a co-strategy that merges Alice's strategy with the referee's.\n\nFor any given strategy formula_56 Alice chooses, the maximum winning probability for Bob is\n\nwhich, by the property of the strategy representation, is equal to\n\nTherefore, to maximize Alice's winning probability, formula_59, the maximum winning probability for Bob, needs to be minimized over all possible strategies. The goal is then to compute\n\nThis minimization problem can be expressed by the following SDP problem:\n\nThe dimension of the input and output space of this SPD is exponential (from the tensor product states) in formula_1, and the SDP has a size polynomial in the dimension of its input and output space. Since there are efficient algorithms that can solve SDP in polynomial-time, it follows that QRG ⊆ EXP.\n\n"}

Inspired by \"Flappy Bird\", \"Retry\" has similar controls. The game was soft launched in Finland, Canada, and Poland in May 2014. As of 2017 Retry has been taken off the AppStore The worldwide iOS and Android release was on October 22, 2014.\n\nThe goal of the game is to send an airplane from one hangar to another hangar in different places. There are many obstacles between the two points, including air and moving landscapes.\n\nThe game has in-app purchases, and users can pay to make the game ad-free.\n\nThe goal of the game is to bring the airplane from one hangar into another hangar without crashing into obstacles (even the ground). In order to move the plane, the players must simply tap the screen. The plane will then move forwards and upwards. Releasing the finger from the screen makes the plane move down. (Similar gameplay has appeared before in old Finnish games, such as \"Triplane Turmoil\" (1996) by Dodekaedron Software and even more similarly in \"Super Sukkula\" (1994) by Lasse Makkonen.)\n\nIn every level, there is at least one \"retry point\", that when landed upon changes the plane's spawn point into that of the retry point for one coin. The game, unlike \"Flappy Bird\", can also let players loop the plane, and even fly backwards. There are also new gameplay elements such as liquid physics, moving obstacles, stars, and currency (for unlocking levels early and acquiring retry points), which can be earned via achievements or playing levels and purchased for real money.\n\nIn certain levels, there are elements that can increase the difficulty. The wind can slow down the plane, water can drown the plane (but not crash), and moving terrain. There are also locked blocks in some levels that locks a certain level path, that can only be opened by unlocking the next level pack.\n\nLike all Rovio games, Retry has a 3-star format. The first star is earned by finishing the level, the second star is earned by not crashing a certain number of times, and the third star by not flying more than a certain distance. Stars, not only shows the mastery of each level but are also used to unlock additional level packs.\n\nPatrick O'Rourke of canada.com described the game as taking \"one of the few things that was great about Flappy Bird\", namely the satisfaction of repeatedly retrying the same simple task, and building a full game around the idea. He saw its visuals as paying homage to the Nintendo Entertainment System without \"completely ripping them off\" as Flappy Bird had done, and summarised the game as a \"decent pick-up-and-play iOS title\".\n"}
{"id": "52242668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52242668", "title": "Sepak Tekong", "text": "Sepak Tekong\n\nSepak Tekong is a traditional children's game from Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia similar in play to hide-and-seek. It is played in many regions around Indonesia. The name comes from the Minangkabau language. The word \"sepak\" means or in Indonesian, which roughly translates to \"kick\" in English; and \"tekong\" means in Indonesian, which translates to the word \"can\" in English. Sepak Tekong therefore roughly translates to \"kicking the can\" in English. \n\nSepak Tekong is a game usually played by children around eight years of age and above. The ideal number of players is between three and ten people and it is normally played in a house or yard that has various places to hide. Players use either a coconut shell or a small milk can filled with sand as the can. It is essential that the can makes a loud sound when kicked. \n\nBefore the game starts, the first player selects the best place to set the can and chooses the boundaries of where other players can hide. A lottery, called \"hompimpa\", decides who will be the player that guards the can and seeks the players. \n\nTo start the game, all of the children, including the guard and seeker, stand near the can. One player kicks the can as far as possible and then all the players, except the guard and seeker, go into hiding. The guard and seeker sits on the can with eyes closed until everyone else has hidden and called out \"ready\". The guard and seeker then begins searching for the hidden players. When the guard and seeker finds a hidden player, the guard and seeker says the hider's name. The hider and the guard and seeker race to the can. If the guard and seeker gets to the can first, the hider is declared caught and the guard and seeker continues to look for players that are hiding. If the guard and seeker leaves the can to search and a hider emerges and kicks the can, the players who were caught earlier can hide again.\n\nSome argue that Sepak Tekong has many benefits for its players:\n\n\nYounger generations no longer play traditional games like Sepak Tekong. There are many modern games which are considered simpler and easier to play. Only a few children still know and play this Sepak Tekong today. In addition, Sepak Tekong requires a large space to play and it is difficult to find large spaces because most of the possible playing areas are under construction or have been built upon. In this era, most children do not feel that the game is relevant.\n\n"}
{"id": "76336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76336", "title": "Serene Velocity", "text": "Serene Velocity\n\nSerene Velocity is a 1970 American experimental short film directed by Ernie Gehr. Gehr filmed it in the basement hallway of a Binghamton University academic building, using a static camera position and changing only the focal length of the camera. It is recognized as a key work of structural filmmaking and has been inducted into the U.S. National Film Registry.\n\n\"Serene Velocity\" lasts twenty-three minutes and is silent. To make the film, Gehr locked his camera down in the center of a hallway, shooting several individual frames at a time. After each set of exposures, he changed the focal length on the lens, zooming in and then out in increasing increments. What begins as a small difference in apparent distance several frames at a time expands to extreme closeups and wide shots jumping back and forth. By the end of the film, the zoom into the end of the hallway reveals a set of double doors with daylight filtering through.\n\nIn early 1970 Gehr was at SUNY Binghamton while Larry Gottheim was beginning to form a film department. Gottheim was impressed with Gehr's earlier short films \"Morning\" and \"Wait\", and the two became acquainted when Gottheim replaced a damaged print of one of Gehr's works. With the encouragement of Gottheim and Ken Jacobs, Gehr taught two courses there during the summer session. He had been interested in making a film that explored \"the intervals between frames–activating the screen plane from frame to frame more dynamically\". One day during the session, Gehr was on his way to the film department's editing rooms in a basement and thought of the hallway as an ideal place to film. A long, plain area appealed to him as a good space to \"maximize the tension between representation and abstraction\".\n\nGehr began shooting test footage in the basement hallway. He tested mid-range and extreme focal lengths in \"bars\" of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 frames. He decided to use bars of 4 frames, projected at 16 frames per second. This would have been roughly equivalent to 6 frames at 24 frames per second, but Gehr chose a lower frame rate so that each frame would remain on screen longer, accentuating the optical effects. He was surprised by the physical effect from watching the footage and felt nauseated afterward.\n\nThe footage for \"Serene Velocity\" was shot over the course of one night. Gehr began filming once it was dark outside, planning to take a break for several hours and finish filming during sunrise. He started by alternating between focal lengths of 50 mm and 55 mm. After roughly of film, he moved each of the lengths apart by 5 mm, to 45 mm and 60 mm, then 40 mm and 65 mm, and so on. He marked off lengths in intervals of 5 mm on a piece of tape and gradually moved the lengths farther apart over the course of filming. He manually recorded each frame, and without the use of a cable release his fingers became swollen from holding the shutter button. The process took longer than he had expected, and he took only one break to use a restroom and hold his head under water to keep awake.\n\nWatching \"Serene Velocity\" produces the appearance of motion and other optical effects, positioning it as a cinematic version of op art. Gehr has noted that the effects of watching the film vary significantly based on which part of the screen the viewer focuses on. The composition of the screen is divided into five sections: the ceiling's fluorescent lights and exit signs; the doors, water fountains, and ashtrays on the left and right walls; the reflections on the floor; and the doors in the center of the frame. The perspective lines point to the center of the frame, which would normally be the center of interest, but the motion along the margins of the frame draws attention away. Viewing the images as flat, two-dimensional spaces transforms the work into an abstract, flashing sign. Focusing on individual features of the successive images produces the illusion of motion. The illusion of depth perception can transform the image into an upright pyramid pointing into or out of the screen. Ken Jacobs emphasized this sense of thrusting and described \"Serene Velocity\" as a \"sexual metaphor, or sex-become cinema\", and J. Hoberman described it as a \"piston-powered mandala\".\n\nCritics have often evaluated \"Serene Velocity\" as a metacinematic work. Noël Carroll pointed to the simplified procedure with which it was photographed as an example of minimalist cinema. Carroll wrote that the film, with its lack of movement, is an argument for \"the impression of movement\" as the essential characteristic of cinema. Critics have drawn parallels with Andy Warhol's 1964 film \"Empire\", an extended, continuous shot of the Empire State Building. Both films advance a philosophical argument with a lack of movement and an emphasis on the recording process.\n\nGilberto Perez characterized the building's design as a descendant of Bauhaus architecture, calling it \"barren and dehumanizing\". He interpreted \"Serene Velocity\" as \"neither a celebration–nor exactly a condemnation\" of Bauhaus minimalism.\n\n\"Serene Velocity\" received a positive reaction from many of Gehr's contemporaries, including Ken Jacobs, Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Richard Foreman, Steve Reich, and Andrew Noren. However, the film received little coverage from the press upon its 1970 release, save for a mention by Jonas Mekas. In 1972, Bob Cowan wrote in his column for \"Take One\" that \"Serene Velocity\" was \"one of the few really unique films I have seen during the last few years…It is rare that a film, which on the surface seems to be only a technical tour-de-force, can lift one to such emotional heights as it develops from surprise to surprise.\" \"Serene Velocity\" cemented Gehr's reputation as a structural filmmaker. He demurred to the term, stating \"I don't know what that word really means–[Labels] stop people from actually seeing, actually experiencing the work.\"\n\nIn 2001, the United States Library of Congress named the film \"culturally significant\" and entered it into the National Film Registry. The film was preserved in 2006 by The Museum of Modern Art, which enlarged the original 16 mm print to 35 mm.\n\nDirector Laura Poitras began making films while taking a course that Gehr taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. The first film Gehr screened was \"Serene Velocity\", and Poitras has identified it as an influence on her work. For their 2008 short film \"Lossless #4\", Rebecca Baron and Douglas Goodwin used a digital reproduction of \"Serene Velocity\" as source material. They fed it through a motion estimation algorithm to create a vector representation of the apparent motion in the film. In the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time, Noël Carroll listed \"Serene Velocity\" in his submission.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41104343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41104343", "title": "Television in Iran", "text": "Television in Iran\n\nTelevision was first introduced to Iran in 1958, as a privately owned and commercially operated enterprise, before being nationalised, remaining a state-controlled monopoly, first of National Iranian Radio and Television, and following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.\n\nOn October 3, 1958, Television Iran (TVI) was established, broadcasting from Tehran. A second station, based in Abadan in the south of the country, was established in 1960. Its programming included quiz shows and American programmes dubbed into Persian, and appealed to an unsophisticated audience.\n\nHabib Sabet, a Baha'i who was one of Iran's major industrialists, was the founder of the first television station. The station manager was an American, A. Vance Hallack, who had previously operated the Baghdad Television Station in Iraq. Before coming to the Middle East, Hallack had managed NBC's colour division. \n\nAt its launch, TVI had the sponsorship of numerous blue chip Western companies, RCA, General Tire, Pepsi-Cola, Autolite, Squibb and Volkswagen, Sabet having opened the first Pepsi-Cola plant in Iran in 1955. However, by 1963, it claimed to have lost 70 million rials, and its owners attempted to sell the station to the government, but by then it had already approved plans for its own television network. \n\nA separate network, National Iranian Television (NITV), was established in 1966. This catered for a more educated public. On October 26, NITV transmitted its first broadcast message, a statement by the Shah; test programs were run, and complete programming commenced in Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, in March 1967, with the first week’s programs included the broadcasting of the Shah’s birthday celebrations from Amjadieh Stadium.\n\nUntil 1976, the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) broadcast a television service on Channel 7 in Tehran and the surrounding area from its studios in the city. \n\nCatering for US Armed Forces personnel, this was known as AFTV, and was the only television service in the country then carrying programming in English, as all foreign programming on NITV and TVI, including American and British imports, was dubbed in Persian. In deference to Iranian sensitivities, AFRTS avoided carrying programming that might be construed as offensive on political or religious grounds, instead carrying cowboy or detective movies. \n\nHowever, in that year it was decided by the Iranian government that AFRTS should close down its radio and TV services, which it did on October 25. These would be replaced by similar services, operated by the state broadcaster. \n\nIn 1971, NITV was merged with Radio Iran to form a new broadcasting organisation, National Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT). TVI, meanwhile, had been nationalised at the end of April 1969. By that time, the government had come to consider the privately-owned station a competitive threat, and bought out Sabet for the sum of 20 million toman, against his initial investment of 70 million toman, with the station's building being taken over by the new Educational Television service. \n\nPrior to 1967, television had covered about 2.1 million people; when NIRT began regular transmissions that year, coverage rose to 4.8 million, and by 1974 had risen to over 15 million, roughly half the total population. The large budget allocations that were provided to NIRT, a reflection of the organisation's role in development, enabled it to use the latest technologies, including microwave delivery systems, to overcome problems of mountainous terrain. \n\nBy 1975–76, 70 percent of the population had television reception. Before then, in 1973, NIRT had already established a total of 14 television production centres with 153 transmitters, covering approximately 88 cities and towns in Iran, accounting for 60 per cent of the population. The following year, this had increased to fifteen, including two in Tehran, as well as one each in the provincial cities of Abadan, Ardebil, Bandar Abbas, Esfahan, Kerman, Kermanshah, Shiraz, Mahabad, Mashad, Rasht, Rezaiyeh, Sanandaj, Tabriz and Zahedan. \n\nEarlier, it had aimed for its first television network to reach 65 per cent of the population of Iran, with its second network reaching 50 per cent by the end of 1977, marking the end of the country's Fifth Development Plan.\n\nBy 1974, Iran was second only to Japan in Asia in terms of the development of its broadcasting capabilities. This prompted one Western commentator to argue in 1977 that \"[if] Iran continues on its present path it will be the first nation in the world to have nationally spread television before a nationally spread press\". \n\nColour television broadcasts first began in 1975, although reception was largely confined to affluent people able to afford colour sets. Regular colour broadcasts were introduced in 1976. The standard was changed to the French SECAM in February 1977, resulting in imported television sets becoming unusable. Although NIRT had the facilities to broadcast in colour, and used this when broadcasting the Asian Games held in Tehran in 1974, full broadcasts in colour were delayed until 1978, on account of the ability of local manufacturers to meet demand for colour sets. \n\nThe first NIRT television network, known as the First Program, carried general content, of which only 33 per cent was imported, with the second network or Second Program aiming to show more educational and cultural content, of which 60 per cent of its content was imported. \n\nAlthough the International Program carried some programming devoted to Iranian culture and education, its output remained broadly similar to that of the AFRTS service it had replaced, with nearly all imported programs from the United States. Broadcast for eight and a half hours daily, most programming was in English, with some films and programs in French and German. This appealed to the 60 000 US Army and civilian personnel then stationed in Iran, as well as the wider population of foreign nationals resident in the country.\n\nAfter the 1979 Islamic Revolution, NIRT was renamed as صدا و سيمای جمهوری اسلامی ايران \"Seda va Sima-ye Jomhouri-e Eslami-ye Iran\" (\"Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran\"), known in English as Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), and under the new Constitution of the Islamic Republic, radio and television were to be \"aligned with the course of perfection of the Islamic Revolution and served the promotion of Islamic culture, and to this end benefit from the health collision of different ideas and seriously avoid spreading and propagating destructive and anti-Islamic tenets\". \n\nIn 1998, Iran changed from using SECAM to the PAL system developed in Germany, and also used in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs a result of IRIB's monopoly and censorship, satellite television channels, most notably Persian language ones based in Europe and North America, have gained popularity in Iran. This was despite the passing of a law in 1994 under which the use and ownership of satellite dishes was banned. However, the research centre of IRIB estimates that they were used by up to 70 per cent of Iranian households.\n\nDespite being repeatedly jammed, the BBC Persian channel had a weekly audience of 7.2 million in 2011. GEM TV is one of the most popular satellite channels in Iran. Based in Dubai, it is broadcast illegally into the country. Farsi1, a satellite channel part owned by News Corporation broadcasting mostly comedies and dramas from other Asian countries and Latin America, is one of the most popular stations in the country. \n\n"}

Schiller, a then thirteen-year-old boy.\nThe sixteen charter members, some of whom continue to make valuable contributions to the club, were garnered from the mailing list found among the papers of the recently deceased Jack Snow, with whom Schiller and the others had discussed the work of L. Frank Baum.\n\nThe organization today has hundreds of members from all over the world, including children, adults who were alive when the books were still being published annually, ardent Baumists, Oz collectors, and those interested primarily in the classic MGM movie.\n\nThe society's major publication, \"The Baum Bugle\", began with Schiller duplicating issues on his parents' mimeograph machine. It is now published three times a year and has been recognized as a scholarly journal by the Modern Language Association since 1983. It has reached 159 issues as of Winter 2010, and its issues have more than doubled in size over the years, typically running to forty pages plus full-color covers.\n\nOz Club members originally organized three major conventions a year in the United States (Munchkin (east), Winkie (west), and Ozmopolitan (central). The self-supporting events attracted members in that region of the country. Arriving with car loads of decorations, props, costumes, auction contributions and show-and-tell materials, attendees immersed themselves in a weekend of Ozzy camaraderie. The Convention names usually reflected geographical locations or citizens identified in the Oz books. There are also smaller gatherings, most frequently South Winkie, Quadling, and Gillikin or Ozcanabans. The last group met in the banquet hall of a restaurant in Escanaba, Michigan, home of Fred M. Meyer, a founding member who served for decades as the club's secretary. Meyer also mailed out an annual Christmas card to all members each year, often with ideas for new Oz books, until his health put him at emeritus status that lasted to the end of his life. As large public Oz festivals grew in popularity, IWOC conventions in the Midwest and East Coast lost much of their support base; fans found the guest speakers attractive and the flexible accommodations more affordable. The Ozmopolitan and Munchkin conventions could not be sustained, although the Winkie Convention, re-branded as OzCon International, remains a robust, vibrant fan event attracting attendees from around the world. The 54th OzCon International is scheduled for August 10-12, 2018, in Pomona, California.\n\nBeginning in 2008, the Oz Club began to hold conventions with programs designed to appeal more broadly to the general public. They are frequently tied to geographic sites of special interest to Oz fans giving members a chance to visit these locations as a group. These national conventions will next be hosted in the Naperville, Illinois area from August 3–6, 2017. Information about all the conventions can be found at ozclub.org.\n\nNotable members of the Club past and present have included Ray Bradbury, Willard Carroll, Martha Coolidge, Rachel Cosgrove Payes, Martin Gardner, Margaret Hamilton, Michael Patrick Hearn, Eloise Jarvis McGraw, Bronson Pinchot (who organized conventions in the 1970s), Edward Wagenknecht, Eric Shanower, John Fricke, and Meinhardt Raabe. Frank Joslyn Baum was appointed the club's first president. Robert Allison Baum, Jr., a great-grandson of the author, currently serves on the board of directors.\n\nThe club has published many of Baum's rarer books, including \"Animal Fairy Tales\", \"Aunt Jane's Nieces\", and \"Twinkle and Chubbins\". It published two Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson and one each by Rachel Cosgrove and the team of Eloise Jarvis McGraw and Lauren Lynn McGraw. In 2000, it put out its first new Oz book not linked to the original series: Gina Wickwar's \"The Hidden Prince of Oz\", with illustrations by Anna-Maria Cool. A Wickwar/Cool sequel followed in 2007, \"Toto of Oz.\" That same year it published \"The Collected Short Stories of L. Frank Baum.\" In addition, the Club has published a set of color-printed maps of The Marvelous Land of Oz and Countries Surrounding the Land of Oz, as well as new editions of short stories by L. Frank Baum and Ruth Plumly Thompson. Its best-selling publication is \"Bibliographia Oziana\" by Douglas G. Greene and Peter E. Hanff, which provides bibliographical descriptions of the original Oz series.\n\nThe Club owns a small but fine collection of original artwork and archival materials.\n\n"}
{"id": "2448847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2448847", "title": "The New Batman Adventures", "text": "The New Batman Adventures\n\nThe New Batman Adventures (often shortened as TNBA) is an American animated television series based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, and is a continuation of the 1990s \"\" and is the final season of the series. It was produced by Warner Bros. Animation and aired on Kids' WB from September 13, 1997 to January 16, 1999. The show lasted for 24 episodes, and was succeeded by \"Batman Beyond\". According to the reference book \"Batman Animated\", series writer Paul Dini originally wanted the new show to be titled \"Batman: Gotham Knights\", but this idea was rejected by the other producers. To better adhere with the prior DVD sets of the original series, the DVD release of this series was titled \"Batman: The Animated Series Volume 4 (From The New Batman Adventures)\" and was given the opening theme from the prior series.\n\nStories in this series tend to give more focus to Batman's supporting cast, which include fellow crimefighters Robin, Nightwing and Batgirl, among others. The show also features guest stars such as Supergirl, Etrigan the Demon and The Creeper; characters who would later appear with Batman in \"Justice League\" and \"Justice League Unlimited\". In addition, the series takes place around the same time as \"\". The 2001 video game \"\" and its follow-up \"\" are based on this series.\n\n\"The New Batman Adventures\" premiered on Kids' WB just two years after \"Batman: The Animated Series\" ended its original run on Fox Kids. The animation style was changed significantly from \"BTAS\" due to budgetary issues. The animators decided to make the show look more compatible with the smoother \"Superman: The Animated Series\" with which \"TNBA\" would air in tandem as part of \"The New Batman/Superman Adventures\" on Kids' WB. \"TNBA\" was later given the same opening theme of \"BTAS\" when aired in syndication.\n\nThe show had a significant change in focus from the original series, with episodes focusing less on Batman and more on the many characters that inhabited Gotham City. The art became more streamlined and darker with simpler color schemes, while the Art Deco and film noir imagery from the original series were replaced with a more modern look.\n\nBatman was given a sleeker, brawnier appearance with an overall darker costume; the golden ellipse surrounding the bat emblem on his chest and the blue highlights of his cape and cowl were both removed, which resembles his appearance in \"\". His gadgets and vehicles were given a sleeker, redesigned look with a more black color scheme. Bruce Wayne's appearance was also changed from the previous series; his hair was brushed back to highlight his face, with blue eyes instead of black, and his regular business suit was changed from brown to black. Kevin Conroy's voice for Batman became more stern, as well as less distinguishable from his voice for Bruce than in the original series. The writers made an effort to keep Batman's dialogue as terse and grim as possible, in order to heighten the contrast between him and the lighthearted supporting cast.\n\nBatgirl's costume was changed to a look similar to her original outfit from her comic debut in \"Detective Comics\" #359, which is now a black bodysuit with yellow gloves and boots. Producer Paul Dini said that Batgirl would appear in every episode of the new series because \"Kenner wants to do a line of toys, we're taking advantage of the publicity from her being in \"Batman & Robin\", and we just love Batgirl\". Melissa Gilbert was replaced by Tara Strong as the voice of Batgirl. Strong would reprise her role over a decade later in another Batman animated television series, \"Beware the Batman\", and also on the DC Nation short \"Super Best Friends Forever\", \"Teen Titans Go!\" and in the animated feature \"\", which reunited her with Conroy and Mark Hamill.\n\nTim Drake was introduced as the new Robin in the episode \"Sins of the Father\". However, Dini remarked that \"the Tim Drake origin in the comics as written now didn't work for us with him having a father and living so close to Wayne Manor. It seemed to work fine in the comics, but we needed our own little family unit of Batman, Robin, Batgirl and occasionally Nightwing – and Alfred of course\". For these reasons, the production team came up with their own origin for Tim Drake, though they later realized this new origin was extremely similar to Jason Todd's. Batman made a new suit which is similar to the first one worn by Dick Grayson and identical to Tim Drake's original Robin costume from the comics, but the color scheme was simplified to red, black and yellow, eliminating green entirely. The costume retained the familiar red short-sleeved shirt, as well as the black cape with yellow inner lining. New elements included black sleeves, gloves, trunks and boots with red leggings. The familiar domino mask had also changed, giving the new Robin a more wide-eyed, innocent look. The original costume worn by Dick Grayson was seen in \"Old Wounds\" and \"Over the Edge\".\n\nDick Grayson, having abandoned his Robin persona as a result of a falling out with Batman, adopted the identity of Nightwing. Grayson's build became sleeker, with broader shoulders, showcasing his emergence as a mature hero in his own right. The short spiky hair that Grayson wore as Robin had grown longer, styled to flow down the back of the neck. In his civilian guise, he wore it in a ponytail. As Nightwing, he wore a V-shaped mask and an all-black unitard with light blue hawk emblem that borrowed some elements of the comics version from the 1990s. The costume also featured collapsible wings under the arms that allowed Nightwing to glide for short distances.\n\nThe designs of most of the villains from Batman's rogues gallery were also changed considerably, generally developing darker color schemes. Most controversial of the redesigns was that of the Joker, whose white skin now had a bluish-gray tinge, while the eyes had their scleras removed and were replaced by cavernous black spaces with white pupils. The ruby-red lips were gone, focusing more attention on the teeth, and the green-tinged hair was almost completely black. His primary suit colors were changed from purple and yellow to purple and green (similar to his appearance from the Golden Age and Silver Age comics).\n\nHarley Quinn, Two-Face, Clayface and Harvey Bullock were among the few characters who did not receive any drastic change in appearance or color alterations. Harley Quinn is also the only villain aside from the Joker who appeared in six or more episodes. Ra's al Ghul and his daughter Talia also did not receive any drastic re-designs, although their only appearance during this time was in the episode \"The Demon Reborn\" from \"Superman: The Animated Series\".\n\nThe Kids' WB censors were much more flexible with episode content than the Fox Kids censors were with \"Batman: The Animated Series\". Producer Bruce Timm recounted that \"when we were at Fox, after every single storyboard, we would get five single-spaced pages of notes on things we couldn't do. On the WB, we usually get maybe two paragraphs of stuff we can't do. At Fox, they were really picky, not just about things you couldn't do, but just in terms of content and story. They had a million opinions about what we should be doing. Nobody bothers us like that at the WB\".\n\nShortly after \"The New Batman Adventures\" aired on Kids' WB, a miniseries set in the continuity of the series was published. In a total of five books, Hilary Bader, Bo Hampton, Terry Beatty, Lee Loughridge, and Tim Harkins, explained the two-year gap between \"Batman: The Animated Series\" and \"The New Batman Adventures\". It explored Dick Grayson's journey after leaving Batman's side, and his path to becoming Nightwing.\n\nOn December 6, 2005, \"The New Batman Adventures\" was released onto DVD under the title of \"Batman: The Animated Series - Volume Four (from The New Batman Adventures)\" to coincide with the previous three volume DVD sets of \"Batman: The Animated Series\". The series was released a second time on November 4, 2008, as part of a DVD release entitled \"Batman: The Complete Animated Series\", which contained the episodes of all four volumes that were released in 2004/2005. The series has also been released for online media distribution services such as iTunes and Google Play specifically as \"Season 4\" of the animated series.\n\n\n\nDaytime Emmy Awards\n\nYoung Artist Awards\n\n\n"}

It was said to have been made in the honour of Queen Elizabeth I. Every madrigal in the collection contains the following couplet at the end: “Thus sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana: long live fair Oriana” (the word \"Oriana\" often being used to refer to Queen Elizabeth).\n\nRecently, the attribution of \"Oriana\" to Elizabeth has come into question. Evidence has been presented that \"Oriana\" actually refers to Anne of Denmark, who would become Queen of England alongside James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) in an apparently failed early attempt to remove Elizabeth in order to restore England to Catholicism. In his book 'The English Madrigalists', Edmund Fellowes, one of the leading madrigal scholars of the 1940s declared this theory to be false.\n\nIn 1899, at the instigation of Master of the Queen's Music Sir Walter Parratt, 13 British composers submitted a limited edition (100 copies) collection of choral songs entitled \"Choral Songs in Honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria\" on the occasion of her 80th birthday.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928512", "title": "Tropical Islands Resort", "text": "Tropical Islands Resort\n\nTropical Islands Resort is a tropical theme park located in the former Brand-Briesen Airfield in Halbe, municipality in the district of Dahme-Spreewald in Brandenburg, Germany, 50 kilometres from the southern boundary of Berlin. It is housed in a former airship hangar (known as the Aerium), the biggest free-standing hall in the world. The hall belonged to the company Cargolifter until its insolvency in 2002.\n\nTropical Islands has a maximum capacity of 8,200 visitors a day. In its first year of operation it attracted 975,000 visitors, according to the operators. The Tanjong company reported 155,000 visitors in the business year February 2004 to February 2005. Approximately 500 people work at Tropical Islands.\n\nTropical Islands has a world record for the largest indoor waterpark. It is bigger than Canada's World Waterpark at West Edmonton Mall.\n\nTropical Islands is located approximately 60 kilometres south of the centre of Berlin and 50 kilometres from the southern boundary of the city. It is close to Briesen/Brand in the south of the municipality of Halbe. The theme park is on the site of the former Soviet airfield Brand, in the Aerium hangar.\n\nIt can be reached by taking the A13 autobahn. It can also be reached by train and the closest railway station is Brand Tropical Islands.\n\nIn 1938, Germany began development of Brand-Briesen Airfield for the Luftwaffe. The Red Army overran the site in May 1945, and occupied the site after World War II, adding a second runway and nuclear-resistant command and control facilities for the fighter aircraft regiment.\n\nWith the reunification of Germany in 1989/1990, the Soviet Army agreed to return all military bases by 1994. Returned to the Federal Government of Germany in 1992, Cargolifter AG bought the former military airfield to construct airships. They began development of a new construction hall, 360 metres long, 210 metres wide and 107 metres high, which cost €78 million. At 5.5 million m³ (194 million ft³), it is one of the largest buildings on Earth by volume, and is the world's largest single hall without supporting pillars inside. The hangar was commissioned as an airship hangar named \"Aerium\" in November 2000, but the airship it was intended to house – the CL160 – was never built. CargoLifter went bankrupt in mid-2002.\n\nTropical Islands was built by the Malaysian corporation Tanjong in the former airship hangar known as the Aerium.\nThe hangar – the third largest free-standing hall in the world – was originally designed to protect large airships from the elements. It was purchased by Tanjong on 11 June 2003 for €17.5 million, of which €10 million was a subsidy from the federal state of Brandenburg. The building permit for constructing the theme park inside the hall was granted on 2 February 2004 and Tropical Islands officially opened on 19 December 2004.\n\nInside the hall, the air temperature is 26 °C (78°F) and air humidity is around 64%. Tropical Islands is home to the biggest indoor rainforest in the world, a beach, many tropical plants and a number of swimming pools, bars and restaurants. It is open around the clock, every day of the year – except on Christmas Eve .\n\nOn entering the hall, visitors choose between different basic admission options with different prices. Tropical Islands is divided into two main areas, each with its own admission price. Visitors can move from one area to the other by paying an additional daily charge. Additional charges also apply for areas such as the water slide tower, crazy golf course, African Jungle Lift, evening show and internal accommodation area. The entertainment programme comprises a gala evening show, smaller shows during the day and various events.\n\nTropical Islands has a number of different themed areas:\n\nA 4,000 m² children's play area opened in 2007. In mid-2007, a sauna and spa facility with six separate areas was added, the largest tropical sauna complex in Europe. The design of the saunas is inspired by UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South-East Asia, including a cave temple on Elephanta Island in India and the Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia. The bathing area includes a 27-metre high water slide tower with four slides, a children's play area and a crazy golf course.\n\nAccording to figures published by the company, Tropical Islands has spent EUR 23 million on further development and expansion work. The original total investment sum announced was EUR 75 million, including a EUR 17 million subsidy from the federal state of Brandenburg. The purpose of the subsidy for the development work was to preserve the 501 jobs.\n\nIn 2008, a campsite was added close to the Tropical Islands hall.\n\nAt first, visitor numbers remained behind original estimates. For a cost-effective operation, 1.25 million visitors per year are required. In 2005, the resort lost between 10 and 20 million euros. By October 2006 there were about 600,000 visitors. The initial lack of visitors has been attributed to various reasons, including the relatively remote location of Tropical Islands. In addition, in Berlin, South Brandenburg, the direct surrounding area of the resort, the disposable income is below the national average. The target demographic of the resort was extended to attract visitors from further away, including Poland.\n\nBy altering the ticket price structure and adding new overnight accommodation, visitors attendance has been improved. According to the then managing director Ole Bested Hensing, 2008 was the first time Tropical Islands Resort made a profit. It recorded 300,000 overnight stays.\n\nAt the start there were problems with the plants that were under the light-tight dome. In October 2005, the southern front along the \"South Sea\" bathing area had a special UV-transparent film made of ETFE installed. This 20,000 square metre \"window\" allows daylight. The palms, trees and bushes have grown well since.\n\n\n"}

In consultation with the production manager, stage manager and sometimes the director, the wardrobe supervisor helps to coordinate and assign dressers to specific performers and tasks. They help determine where and how costume changes are made. Generally, the wardrobe supervisor decides whether a point in a production requires a quick change backstage, or if there is time for a normal change in the dressing room.
