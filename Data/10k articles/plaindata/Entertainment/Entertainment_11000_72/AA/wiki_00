{"id": "3679118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3679118", "title": "Action Park", "text": "Action Park\n\nAction Park was an amusement and water park located in Vernon, New Jersey, on the grounds of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski resort. The park consisted primarily of water-based attractions and originally opened to the public in 1978 under the ownership of Great American Recreation (GAR).\n\nAction Park featured three separate attraction areas: the Alpine Center, Motorworld, and Waterworld. The latter was one of the first modern American water parks. Many of its attractions were unique, attracting thrill-seekers from across the New York metropolitan area. Action Park's popularity went hand-in-hand with a reputation for poorly designed rides, under-trained, under-aged staff, intoxicated guests and staff, and a consequently poor safety record. At least six people are known to have died as a result of mishaps on rides at the park, and it was given nicknames such as \"Traction Park\", \"Accident Park\", and \"Class Action Park\". Little effort was made by state regulators despite a history of repeat violations. In its later years, personal injury lawsuits led to the closure of more and more rides, and eventually the entire park in 1996. \n\nOn February 9, 1998, resort developer Intrawest announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including Action Park and other developable real estate lands that GAR owned. After a massive overhaul, which included revamping rides and removing attractions deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, the waterpark was reopened as Mountain Creek Waterpark.\n\nThe idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company Great American Recreation (GAR), the owners of the recently combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a alpine slide down one of the steep ski trails. For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two water slides and a go-kart track, and named the collection of rides the \"Vernon Valley Summer Park\". The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of \"Action Park\". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across Route 94. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks.\n\nUltimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).\n\nAction Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride. Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count grand jury indictment against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized insurance company. Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five insurance fraud-related charges. Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper. \n\nThe park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends. Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of the emergency room at a nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the township of Vernon extra ambulances to keep up with the volume. In September 1989, GAR negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley/Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million. IBC, however, backed out of the deal, feeling the site was not suitable for their needs upon further inspections of the properties.\n\nBy the 1990s, the Action Park was being advertised as the world's largest water park. Additionally, the park launched a website on which visitors could find information about rides, directions to the park, and lodging, and even enter a lottery for a chance to win park tickets. In September 1991, Great American Recreation attempted to petition the Vernon Township Committee to put a referendum on the November ballot that, if passed, would have legalized the operation of games of skill and chance at Action Park. On September 23, the petition was rejected by the committee because only 643 of the 937 signatures on the petition came from registered voters.\nA few rides were closed and dismantled due to costly settlements and rising insurance premiums in the 1990s, and the park's attendance began to suffer as a recession early in that decade reduced the number of visitors. In early 1995, GAR operated Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and Action Park with no liability insurance. New Jersey did not require it, and GAR found it more economical to go to court than purchase liability insurance, since they relied on their own self-insurance. However, they ultimately purchased liability insurance from Evanston Insurance Company in May of that year to cover Action Park and the skiing facilities. As 1995 progressed, GAR's financial woes continued to accumulate. First Fidelity Bank, who lent $19 million to GAR and some 15 other connected corporations, filed suit against them in an effort to begin the process of foreclosing on the debt owed to them. Law firms owed money for services rendered between 1991 and 1993 also began filing suit. As November approached, GAR negotiated a deal with Noramco Capital Corp. and the Praedium Fund of CS First Boston, in which they would purchase the debt owed to First Fidelity, temporarily fending off an impending foreclosure.\n\nIn February 1996, the creditors who had taken on GAR's debt petitioned to force GAR into bankruptcy over the $14 million owed by the struggling company. GAR filed for Chapter 11 protection that following March, but remained optimistic that they could regain their financial footing \"within a year.\"\n\nAction Park closed at the end of the season as usual on Labor Day, September 2, 1996. As the 1997 summer season approached, GAR remained optimistic that Action Park would open as expected on June 14, in spite of massive layoffs that occurred at the end of the prior ski season. The opening date was pushed back to June 28, then mid July. On June 25, 1997, GAR announced the cessation of all its operations, including Action Park.\n\nFollowing the demise of GAR in 1997, Praedium Recovery Fund purchased the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge resort, including Action Park, for $10 million. The investment group put Angel Projects in charge of managing the resort, and aimed to spend $20 million to upgrade the ski resort's equipment and trails and to remodel the water park. Canadian resort developer Intrawest, however, purchased the park and surrounding ski area in February 1998. The company revamped the Waterworld section of Action Park and reopened it for the 1998 season as Mountain Creek Waterpark, while the Motorworld and Alpine Center sections were demolished.\n\nThe Gladiator Challenge attraction, loosely based on the television series \"American Gladiators\", opened in 1992. It allowed guests to compete against other guests in an obstacle course, and against park-employed \"Gladiators\" in jousting matches. Former bodybuilders Michael and Vince Mancuso designed the attraction, and the employees that guests would compete against in the jousting matches were found by scouting local gyms. Over the course of a day, there were 3 shows, with the guests that ran the fastest obstacle course times in the earlier shows brought back to compete against each other later in the day. By 1995 the attraction was removed and replaced with a beach volleyball court.\n\nAction Park's alpine slide descended the mountain beneath one of the ski area's chairlifts, which provided guests access to the top of the slide. Riders sat on small sleds that had only a brake control stick, and rode down the slide in long chutes built into the slope. The ride, and more specifically the sleds, became notorious for causing injuries. The stick that was supposed to control the sled's speed in practice offered just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as \"death awaits\". The chutes the sleds travelled in were made of concrete, fiberglass, and asbestos, which led to serious abrasions on riders who took even mild falls. The tendency of guests to ride in bathing suits made the problem worse. The path underneath the chairlift resulted in verbal harassment and spitting from passengers going up for their turn.\n\nThe slide led to the first fatality at the park, a head injury suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a large embankment and hit his head on a rock, killing him. Hay bales at the curves were put in place in an attempt to cushion the impact of guests whose sleds jumped the track, a frequent occurrence. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations. According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 fractures and 26 head injuries. \n\nWhen Intrawest reopened the water park as Mountain Creek in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. However, riders were required to wear helmets and kneepads. The last day of the slide's operation was September 6 of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's Labor Day was rainy and the slide had to be closed.\n\nThe chutes were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the gondola that replaced the chairlift. The resort's mountain bike route travels down the site, and crosses over a few wooden footbridges that provided access over the alpine slide. Mountain Creek recently introduced an alpine coaster, which combines elements of an alpine slide and a roller coaster.\n\nIn 1991, Action Park opened up a , two-station bungee jumping tower near the alpine slide. The next summer, the tower was upgraded to four jumping stations. Guests could not drop very far, however, and were tethered to a weight that prevented them from bouncing back up to the top of the tower. The attraction closed with the park in 1996.\n\nA skatepark briefly existed near the ski area's ski school building, but closed after one season due to poor design. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine \"Weird NJ\" as saying that the \"skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed\".\n\nThe Transmobile was a monorail that took riders from the Alpine Center across Route 94 to the Cobblestone Village shopping complex and the park's Motorworld section. Riders would sit sideways in cars built for two people. Each stop had two stations, one for guests heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for guests heading to Motorworld. Rides were one way, and riders were not allowed to stay on the ride and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff, and riders who either did not understand—-or did not want to follow the rules.\n\nMuch of the Transmobile was dismantled when Intrawest took over the park in 1998. However, the Cobblestone Village station remains in place, as does the right of way through the Village's mini golf course.\n\nAction Park's Motorworld section consisted of rides based around powered vehicles and boats on the west side of Route 94, opposite the main part of the park. This area closed with Action Park in 1996 and never reopened; they have since been replaced with a condominium development, a restaurant, and additional parking for the Mountain Creek ski resort.\n\n\n\nWater-based attractions made up half of the park's rides and accounted for the greatest share of its casualty count. Mountain Creek Waterpark and its currently revived Action Park still operates some of these attractions. In addition, there was also a miniature golf course as well as standard pools and rides for children. These were sometimes smaller, safer versions of the park's main attractions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a complete vertical loop at the end, similar to that of a roller coaster. The resulting slide, called the \"Cannonball Loop\", was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered a hundred dollars to test it. Fergus, who described himself as \"one of the idiots\" who took the offer, said, \"$100 did not buy enough booze to drown out that memory.\"\n\nThe slide was opened for only one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time. One worker told a local newspaper that \"there were too many bloody noses and back injuries\" from riders, and it was widely rumored, and reported in \"Weird NJ\", that some of the test dummies sent down before it opened had been dismembered and decapitated. A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a hatch had to be installed at the bottom of the slope to allow for future extractions.\n\nThe ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, it was opened for several days before further injuries forced its permanent shutdown.\n\nThose who rode the \"Cannonball Loop\" have said that more safety measures were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, instructed to remove jewelry, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.\nFor the remainder of the park's existence, \"Cannonball Loop\" remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld. It was dismantled shortly after the park closed.\n\nIn 2014, video footage that appeared to show riders going down the \"Cannonball Loop\" was unearthed and published online.\n\n\nThe Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984. In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997. Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the bodyflight instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of 6 or 7 feet (2 m) above the ground, approximately a foot or two over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.\n\nA range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight.\n\nAction Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long. Ride designers may have had insufficient training in physics or engineering. \"They seemed to build rides,\" one attendee recalled, \"not knowing how they would work, and [then let] people on them.\"\n\nGAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, was accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by other facilities. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety. (In the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain liability insurance).\n\nThe vast majority of workers at Action Park, at least the ones regularly seen by visitors, were teenagers. Jim DeSaye, a security director for the park, says he got that job at the age of 21, after having worked at the park for two years. His experience was not uncommon.\n\nMost were underaged, undertrained, often under the influence of alcohol and cared little for enforcing park rules and safety requirements. Height- and weight-based restrictions were often ignored.\n\nSince it was closer and slightly cheaper than Six Flags Great Adventure, Action Park attracted many visitors from urban enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in Spanish-language media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language.\n\nThe staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.\n\nSince many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risque and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of foul language (not always planned) and exhibitionism as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them.\n\nThe park also sold beer in many kiosks on the grounds, with similarly relaxed enforcement of the drinking age as with other restrictions in the park. Doctors treating the injured often reported that many of them were intoxicated.\n\nDespite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), an investigation by the \"New Jersey Herald\", Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was fined only once. It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses—except Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.\n\nSome of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.\n\nSix people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park:\n\n\nAction Park was a cultural touchstone for many Generation X-ers who grew up in North and Central Jersey, as well as nearby locales in New York and Connecticut. A popular list of \"You Know You're from New Jersey When ...\" that circulates in email begins with, \"You've been seriously injured at Action Park.\"\n\nSome even credit the park for making them learn some difficult lessons. In 2000, one Matthew Callan recalled Action Park thus:\n\nChris Gethard, a writer for \"Weird NJ\" and the associated book series, concurs:\n\nOn August 1, 1993, MTV's \"Headbanger's Ball\" taped an episode at the park. The host, Riki Rachtman, interviewed and went on the rides with the band Alice In Chains.\n\nAction Park was the topic of the first episode of the Relay FM podcast \"Ungeniused\" in June 2016, which explores the legacy of the park, how unsafe it was, and why people continued to visit it.\n\nThe original version of the park's notoriety for its unsafe reputation inspired a film by Jackass star Johnny Knoxville; filming started in March 2017 and wrapped in June 2017. The film was released under the title \"Action Point\" by Paramount Pictures on June 1, 2018.\n\nIn 2010, the whole Mountain Creek ski area and water park was sold to a group led by Eugene Mulvihill, the former owner of Great American Recreation and the owner of the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort; however, he died two years later. Under the new ownership the name of the water park was changed back to Action Park, starting with the 2014 season. In 2016, the Mountain Creek Waterpark name was restored to the park, thus retiring the Action Park name again.\n\nOn April 14, 1980, Pocono Action Park Inc. was formed by Great American Recreation, which later opened Pocono Action Park and Motorworld. Located in the town of Tannersville, Pennsylvania, it had a Waterworld section with slides and tube rides, as well as a Motorworld section featuring many of the same racing themed attractions—including LOLA race cars and go-karts—as the Vernon park. By late 1991, the park was closed. The rides were torn down in stages, and The Crossings Premium Outlets was built over the location. Even after the park closed, however, Pocono Action Park Inc. continues to exist, and is listed as an active business.\n\nIn June 1984, Stony Point Recreation, a subsidiary of GAR, opened Action Mountain in Pine Hill, New Jersey. The park offered an alpine slide, go-karts, LOLA race cars, bumper boats, speed slides, tube slides, swimming pools, as well as a diving platform. By 1986, Stony Point Recreation had accumulated some $398,697 in back taxes owed to the town of Pine Hill, and in an effort to relieve the debt sold off the park. In 1999, the site was redeveloped into the Pine Hill Golf Course.\n\n"}

The genre is a mix of West African and Spanish music.\n\nMúsica Criolla includes flamenco-influenced guitar sounds, as well as percussion instruments, including cajon, cajita, cowbell and quijada.\n\nMuch of the original music has been lost, but in the 1950s a revival was staged by José Durand, a white Peruvian criollo who was a folklore professor, and Porfirio Vásquez. Durand founded the Pancho Fierro Dance Company. Drawing upon elderly members of the community for memories of musical traditions, Durand collaborated with Vásquez to revive various songs and dances to create the repertoire for the group. One of the best known is his revival of the carnival dance “El Son de los Diablos.” In colonial times, this dance was featured in parades with a fleet of austere, pure angels leading the way, followed by the mischievous devils. In the revival of the dance, the angels were eliminated, and the crowds were entertained by rambunctious devils and their leader “el diablo mayor.” The dance featured energetic zapateo tap-dancing. The group performed for about two years, including a concert for Peruvian composer Chabuca Granda and a tour through Chile.\n\nActually, poet Nicomendes Santa Cruz and Victoria Santa Cruz (siblings) both created Cumanana (1957) an Afroperuvian ensemble that highlighted the rich West and Central African call and response poetry, music / dance traditions that were a staple of Peruvian culture and are essentially valued to this day.\n\nOne long lasting Afro-Peruvian dance company was Perú Negro, which, incorporated more modern use of percussion combined with criollo music. Perú Negro is also known for their use of blackface, celebrating the mixture of African and Spanish heritage. Two of their best known pieces are “Dance of the Laundresses,” which depicts historical hard working yet beautiful black women in Peru, and the “Canto a Elegua,” which shows tribal religion before the Spanish influence.\n\nLima and Chincha are two areas where there are many performers of this music, which is played in night clubs, dinner dances and festivals. Notable artists and groups through the years have included Victoria and Nicomedes Santa Cruz, Lucila Campos, Pepe Vásquez, and Susana Baca. One of the best known songs in the genre is Peru's \"Toro Mata\".\n\n\n\n"}

The best possible fixed camera position is chosen and then a computer chooses framing by randomly tilting, panning or zooming the camera. In doing so it is not uncommon that the actors appear in the shots with a part of their face and head cut from the frame. With this technique then the blame for any \"errors\" are entirely attributable to a computer.\n\nVon Trier described Automavision as \"a principle for shooting film developed with the intention of limiting human influence by inviting chance in from the cold (...) and thus giving the work an idea-less surface free of the force of habit and aesthetics.\" The principle was used during filming of the movie \"The Boss of It All\" (2006). Interviewed by \"The Guardian\" in 2006, von Trier said, \"For a long time, my films have been handheld. That has to do with the fact that I am a control freak. With Automavision, the technique was that I would frame the picture first and then push a button on the computer. I was not in control — the computer was in control.\" And in a 2008 interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\", von Trier said \"If you want bad framing, Automavision is the perfect way to do it. It was rather pleasant to lose control. In this case, I wanted to lose control 100 per cent.\"\n\n"}

The play opened on Broadway at the end of 2015 with a short run scheduled to close at the end of January 2016. The two-act play contains only two characters who appear on stage throughout the play, Mickey and Carson.\n\nMickey is an elderly retiring political operative and political fixer in the USA who is planning an elaborate May–December wedding to a young fiancé who is a British national citizen. Mickey is planning to retire in style with his great wealth by arranging for the purchase of a luxurious private jet made in Switzerland for himself and his soon-to-be wife. An entanglement arises when Mickey receives a telephone call in his office indicating that the $5 million tax-saving scheme he has planned for his private jet purchase has gone sour. The foreign Swiss jet was supposed to fully stay out of the USA for six months for the $5 million tax-saving scheme to succeed. An apparently trivial malfunction caused the jet to land temporarily on USA soil, thus seemingly invalidating Mickey's tax-saving scheme. Not only that, but after the jet finally arrives at its original destination in Toronto, its single passenger, his fiancé, is subjected to a full strip search while being refused entry into Canada. Mickey goes ballistic when he receives this telephone report in his office. He threatens to renege on delivery of the jet on which he still has not fully signed-off, and he suspects mischief from a new political candidate and contender in the USA with whom he has a history. Mickey begins to suspect that the new candidate, known to him as \"the Kid\", is the source of upsetting Mickey's $5 million tax saving scheme, and for causing the false report in Toronto which caused his fiancé to be denied entry in Canada and to be strip searched.\n\nBy the next morning, Mickey realizes that he may have overplayed his hand in lashing out against the jet manufacturer, against his assistant Carson, and against the political operatives of \"the Kid\". \"The Kid\" is likely to be the next governor of his State, with many inside ties and favors coming his way from the Federal government by way of \"the Kid's\" inside government connections. Mickey's worst nightmare comes true when he receives a phone call in his office telling him that \"the Kid\" has pulled in his Federal government \"favors\" in order to get Mickey formally charged with a Federal indictment for violation and conspiracy against the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, since the jet purchase he was arranging originated under Swiss manufacture from a Swiss contract. Mickey's only life-line is a dirty-secrets political file he has kept on \"the Kid's\" family of political office holders, and Mickey uses it to make a plea deal on the phone to \"buy\" himself out of the Federal Indictment on him against the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The deal requires his assistant, Carson, to play along, since Federal marshals have already been dispatched to arrest Mickey. Carson decides that Mickey is not to be trusted, and that Mickey will sell Carson out as part of Mickey's own plea deal. Carson resolves to abscond with Mickey's dirty-secrets political file right under Mickey's eyes, in order to let himself make his own exonerating plea deal for himself. Mickey gets the jump on Carson before Carson can get out the door and mortally bludgeons him with a heavy-gauge metallic scale model of the jet which he was about to purchase. As the dispatched federal marshalls are heard knocking at his office door, Mickey reverses his tactics once again and starts self-inflicting bloody wounds on his own body while shouting to the federal marshals standing outside his door, \"Help me. Will... Will... Oh my God. Will no one help an old man...?\", at the final curtain as the play ends.\n\n\nSeveral off-stage characters are portrayed as participating in telephone conversation with Mickey while Mickey is in his private office whose voices are not heard during the play, but only inferred by Mickey's interaction with them while speaking into his telephone on stage.\n\nThe play began previews on Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on October 21, 2015 with the official opening originally scheduled for November 19. On November 9, 2015, the producers announced that the official opening was moved to December 4, 2015, stating \"The move allows the creative team additional time to work on the play before its world premiere.\" The play opened on December 4, 2015 in a limited engagement for 97 performances.\n\nAl Pacino plays billionaire \"Mickey Ross\" and Christopher Denham plays his assistant \"Carson\" in the two-character play. The play is directed by Pam MacKinnon, with scenery by Derek McLane, lighting by Russell H. Champa and costumes by Jess Goldstein.\n\nPacino said of his character and the play: \"...'one of the most daunting and challenging roles I've been given to explore onstage. It's a special gift to originate a role in the theatre, especially written by such a formidable writer, and I haven't done that in a long, long time...' \"\n\nOn January 21, 2016, \"Playbill\" reported that the producer of the play Jeffrey Richards summarized the short-run on Broadway stating: \"It’s been ultimately very rewarding because of the work that’s been done during the actual run of the play. The ending has been changed by the playwright, and the audiences have embraced it recently, which has been very encouraging.\"\n\nCritical reception for \"China Doll\" has been largely negative. Michael Riedel, theatre columnist for the \"New York Post\" called it a \"terrible new play\"... \"Preview audiences are having none of it. The exodus at intermission is practically a stampede, and sources say some have angrily demanded refunds.\"\n\nAfter a retooling of the play, the December 2015 review in \"The New York Times\" said \"One of the biggest problems (though not the only one) in comprehending \"China Doll\" is that Mr. Pacino's lurching, stammering performance is not easy to follow in terms of content, character or subtext. There has been more than enough evidence in the past to certify that Mr. Pacino is a bona fide genius, so let's assume that there are reasons for what he's doing here.\"\n\nIn January 2016 review of the play, \"PopMatters\" magazine wrote \"For all of its follies, \"China Doll\", which has a limited run at Manhattan's Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, is unlike anything Mamet has written before\", and \"In the abstract \"China Doll\" sounds like a rigorous but doable challenge; in performance, the play outstays its welcome. This two scene and nearly two hour play has, at most, enough dramatic momentum for one act.\"\n\n\"Variety\" magazine in May 2016 summarized \"China Doll\" as having suffered from \"bad-buzz\" media coverage once plans for Mamet's new 2017 play were announced stating: \"David Mamet's first play following the bad-buzz magnet \"China Doll\" has been added to the 2016–17 season at the Atlantic Theater Company, the Off Broadway troupe that Mamet co-founded... Details are scarce on the latest from Mamet, whose Broadway outing \"China Doll\" stirred up controversy and crummy word of mouth earlier this season but still turned a profit. The untitled new play, to be directed by Atlantic artistic director Neil Pepe, is described as written 'specifically for Atlantic’s ensemble,' and will run February through April on the theater's mainstage, with exact dates to be set.\"\n\n"}

It is the reboot of the \"Dead to Rights\" franchise featuring Grant City police officer Jack Slate and his canine companion Shadow. Developed by Volatile Games and published by Namco Bandai Games under the Namco label for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the game was released in April 2010 (or July in Japan).\n\nThe game begins with Jack collapsing on a dock after disembarking from a tugboat, and is confronted by members of the Grant City Triad, who intend to kill him as revenge for earlier events. Shadow, Jack's dog, brutally kills all of the Triad members who try to attack Jack on his way to a bar where he meets his friend, an EMT named Faith Sands, and goes into the story of what happened in the game. He flashes back to a terrorist takeover of Temple Tower, where he disobeys orders from Captain Inness and charges in, killing members of the Union gang, saving hostages and pursuing Riggs, the leader of the gang, to the roof where he escapes via a futuristic helicopter. Jack believes Riggs has military training after seeing how the Union were armed and organized. Jack is saved from Inness firing him by SWAT Captain Redwater, who is a friend of Jack and his father, Frank Slate, who takes Jack and Shadow to investigate a lead on Riggs. They discover plans and simulated versions of the Temple Tower studio, and are drawn into a gunfight when Redwater arrives with the SWAT.\n\nAfter holding out until more SWAT teams arrive, Frank and Jack pursue Riggs and a Triad member, splitting up to do so. Jack succeeds in arresting the Triad, but finds Frank mortally wounded nearby. Faith arrives and tries to save Frank, but fails, and Jack storms off after beating up the Triad brutally and goes to find out why his father was killed. He stops an attempted Triad bombing at Grant City Central, defeats their leader, Tseng, in hand-to-hand combat, and then returns to the area where his father was killed. He discovers that Riggs is a member of the newly formed GAC (Grant City Anti Crime Unit), which was formed by Julian Temple and now approved by the city to deal with crime in ways that go against standard ethics and protocol. Jack fights his way past GAC soldiers and destroys GAC dropships, but is knocked out by Redwater, who kills Riggs after hearing a recorded conversation between Temple and Riggs, who plot to kill Redwater. Jack manages to escape the slowly rising dropship he and Redwater are on, and Redwater's fate is left unknown when the C4 Jack attached to the ship detonates while being tossed away by Redwater.\n\nThe game picks up at the bar, where Jack reveals that he detects Faith has deceived him, and she admits she was persuaded by the GAC to help locate him. Faith is wounded by a sniper, and Jack manages to evacuate her on a helicopter she called before being shot, and is dropped off at Temple Tower, where he arrests Temple, who tries to bribe him into letting him go by revealing that Redwater killed Frank, choosing to follow his father's way instead of killing Temple in cold blood. He takes Temple to the precinct he and his father work at, and discovers all regular and SWAT officers have been imprisoned for resisting GAC control. Jack imprisons Temple and frees the officers, who help to free the precinct and call patrol officers back to fight off attacking GAC troops-with help from Captain Inness, who is now glad to work Jack's way and even sends out the transmission to call for backup. Jack takes a dead GAC soldier's armor and sneaks into the GAC Alpha Base in a rundown hospital on an island. He manages to make a distraction that lets the GCPD storm the base while Jack provides sniper cover for Inness, Shadow, and a SWAT team that manages to break into the main area. Jack helps to fight off multiple GAC troops and then pursues Redwater.\n\nJack takes control of a GAC Tank Armor and fights his way through dozens of GAC while furiously arguing with Redwater, offering him the chance to surrender like Frank would have done. Redwater refuses, stating that he did what he did for the good of the city and that Frank never would have understood, and Jack responds by fighting his way through a group of snipers as he chases Redwater on foot to a lighthouse. Redwater tries to kill Jack with a mounted machine gun, but Shadow bites Redwater's arm only to be wounded, forcing Jack to proceed alone and unarmed against Redwater, who cuts Jack across the eye with a knife and leaves a scar. Jack and Redwater fight, stealing the knife from each other repeatedly, until Jack stabs Redwater fatally, which results in him falling to his death. The game ends with Jack and Faith attending Frank's funeral, and Jack is left to look out at Grant City with Shadow next to him, promising his father he will be with him soon.\n\n\"Retribution\" received \"mixed\" reviews on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one seven, one eight, and two sevens, for a total of 29 out of 40.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the Xbox 360 version a score of seven out of ten and said, \"We all need a \"Die Hard\" every now and then, and that’s exactly the kind of spirit \"Retribution\" evokes.\" 411Mania gave the same console version 6.9 out of 10, saying that calling it \"a game that is just kind of there, and in this day and age, just being there is no longer enough.\" \"The Escapist\" gave the same console version three stars out of five, saying, \"Other than the presence of your canine sidekick, there is absolutely nothing in \"Dead to Rights: Retribution\" that hasn't been done before (and probably better) in other games.\" However, \"The A.V. Club\" gave the PS3 version a C−, saying, \"The executions are designed to provide a was-it-good-for-you catharsis. They don’t. They come off as juvenile and obscene. Whatever shock value they might have wears off almost instantly, transforming the game’s supposed \"money-shot\" into something pedestrian and tedious.\"\n"}

It was found that across societies and time, facial prominence of men has been much higher than that of women.\n\nSubsequent studies have generated consistent findings and thus helped confirm the pervasive presence of face-ism. For instance, a prevalent face-ism phenomenon was observed in news magazines and women's magazines of the 1970s and 1980s. Face-ism has been documented in prime-time television programs. Evidence has been shown that face-ism is still present in mainstream printed media from as recently as 2004, and showed that men in intellectually focused occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than women in similar professions, while women in physical occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than men in similar professions. A cross-cultural study on face-ism found that face-ism in photographs of politicians is more pronounced in gender-egalitarian societies compared to gender-unequal societies.\n\nThere is no relation between face-ism and the perception of intellect.\n\nIt was found that regardless of gender difference, news photographs featuring high face prominence tend to generate more positive ratings with regard to intelligence, ambition and physical appearance than those with low face prominence.\n\nSimilarly, another study argued that as a series of mental life dimensions including intelligence, personality, and character, are closely associated with the face and head; higher face-ism of men may convey impressions of greater intelligence, dominance, and control. In contrast, the greater body-ism of women (analyzed in television beer commercials) serves to reinforce the stereotypical images of women as trophies or sex objects without personalities.\n\nFace-ism may not be merely restricted to gender difference but can apply to racial difference as well. For instance, the study revealed that Caucasians have higher face-ism than blacks across different media types.\n\n"}

Built in 1936, it lasted as a venue until 1958.\n\nHarringay Arena was built and owned by Brigadier-General Alfred Critchley under the auspices of his private company, the \"Greyhound Racing Association Trust Ltd\" (GRA). A new company, \"Harringay Arena Limited\", whose directors were also directors of the GRA, was incorporated in 1929 to build and manage the venue. The company raised funds for the venture via a stock and share issue in January 1936.\n\nDesigned by Dr. Oscar Faber, the arena was a stark modernist octagonal-shaped building which borrowed heavily from the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. It was erected adjacent to the Harringay Stadium in just eight months between February and October 1936. Its vast steel roof was constructed by Dorman Long & Co, who had recently been responsible for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and completed the new Wembley Stadium in 2007.\n\nIt had a seating capacity of almost 10,000 for ice hockey and slightly more for boxing. The actual arena was long by wide. A removable maple floor could be laid over the ice for non-sporting events. This arrangement clearly proved troublesome. At an event shortly after its opening the \"Daily Herald\" reported that \"claims that Harringay had solved its cold-feet problem were not quite substantiated. Cold air from the ice below the boards filtered through\".\n\nSpecifically designed as an ice hockey venue, it quickly became famous as a venue for both ice hockey and boxing.\n\nUp to the Second World War, ice hockey enjoyed its most popular era in the UK until a revival in the 1990s. Two local teams were formed for the Arena's opening, Harringay Racers and Harringay Greyhounds. On 26 October 1938, the first ice hockey game to be televised anywhere in the world was played at Harringay between the Racers and Streatham. A year later, WWII started and ice hockey matches were suspended. This interruption proved very damaging to the sport's popularity and post-war audiences remained thin for the remainder of the Arena's life.\n\nBoxing became firmly established at the Arena prior to the war. On 7 April 1938 Harringay was the venue for the first boxing match to be televised live when the full 15 rounds between Len Harvey v Jock McAvoy were broadcast. Following the war Harringay was a very successful boxing venue. During its 22-year life, it was home to five world title fights, a record for any British venue by the time the Arena ceased operating as a venue in 1958.\n\nHowever famous the Arena became for boxing, commercial necessity led to a diversification into a wider range of events including:\n\n\nThe Arena's diversification went beyond sports and included a variety of entertainment events including:\n\nIn the 1940s the arena hosted ground breaking classical music events popularising classical music for the first time including the \"London Music Festival\" in 1947 and 1948. The '48 festival included the hugely popular London debut of Pierino Gamba. 10,000 people watched this ten-year-old boy conduct the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra playing Beethoven and Dvořák. The festival also featured the world-famous Manuel Rosenthal, who brought his Orchestre National de France to join Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic in a concert that filled the Harringay Arena with 13,500 listeners\n\nA report in \"The Guardian\" on a classical music event in June of the following year said:\n\nClassical music events also figured large in the 1949 calendar.\n\nIn April, famed black singer Paul Robeson appeared at Harringay as part of his European concert tour. Sell-out audiences, including one of 10,000 at the arena, led him to describe the tour as \"the most successful concert tour of my career\"\n\nIn June, there was a short season of classical music events including a two-week stay by the Philadelphia Orchestra. The event was part of their hyped European tour. They were the first American orchestra to visit the UK since 1929. Financed by British theatrical impresario Harold Fielding, the tour was a critical success, but high ticket prices kept the post-war audiences away.\n\nFrom 27 August to 1 September, along with Empress Hall, Earl's Court, Harringay Arena was the venue for a series of five gala performances by Alicia Markova, Anton Dolin and the Ballet Rambert. The success of these performances led to the formation of the English National Ballet.\n\nThe arena was well known as a venue for circuses. It was home to Tom Arnold's annual Harringay Circus for eleven seasons from Christmas 1947 to Christmas 1957. For the first circus show in 1947 Arnold hired twenty baby elephants specially imported from Ceylon by the Chipperfield family. They arrived at the George V Dock in London's Docklands in October 1947 on SS Arbratus.\n\nBilly Smart occasionally appeared in these shows. At one of the \"Mammoth Christmas Circuses\", he spray-painted five of his elephants white, yellow, blue, cream and pink.\n\nThe 1952 circus included an elephant act with Sabu, the young Indian actor made famous by his appearance in films such as \"The Thief of Baghdad\".\n\nThe resident band for the circuses was led by Charles Shadwell; the signature tune \"Down with the Curtain\" always introduced the proceedings.\n\nThe arena also hosted a number of other circus shows. In 1956 the Moscow State Circus came to Harringay, the first occasion on which a state circus from the Soviet Union had visited Western Europe. Other events included a handful of western cowboy shows in the 1950s, including the 1952 \"Texas Western Spectacle\", starring the famous cowboy singer/actor Tex Ritter.\n\n\nDespite running an impressive and broad ranging calendar of events from 1947 to 1958, the change in the fortunes of ice hockey in the UK and the straitened post-war circumstances meant limited commercial success for the Arena after the Second World War. The arena hosted its final event on Tuesday, 28 October 1958. It was a sentimental occasion and promoter Jack Solomons headlined with a world-class lightweight fight between Dave Charnley and Carlos Ortiz (who was to go on to become world champion). \"The Times\" quoted part of the speech at that event in its paper the following day:\nBehind the scenes moves for the Arena's disposal had been going on for some time. International food retailer and manufacturer, Home & Colonial Stores Ltd were offered the site in 1957. They took possession of the building and the adjacent market hall in 1958. Works to convert the Arena to its new use were complete by February 1960. It was henceforth put to use as a food storage facility for the next 20 years until its demolition in 1978.\n\nThrough the early 1980s an open air Sunday market was held on the site up until the site was developed for shopping. The initial development included principally warehouse style shopping including DIY, bathroom and food wholesale outlets. A Royal Mail sorting facility was also built which survived the later redevelopment.\n\nEarly in the 21st century the whole site was redeveloped for retail shopping as the Arena Shopping Park, hosting mid-market brands such as \"Next\", \"Carphone Warehouse\", \"Homebase\" and a \"Fitness First\" gym.\n\n"}

{"id": "4601855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4601855", "title": "Jatra (theatre)", "text": "Jatra (theatre)\n\nJatra (, origin: \"Yatra\" meaning procession or journey in Sanskrit) is a popular folk-theatre form of Bengali theatre, spread throughout most of Bengali speaking areas of the Indian subcontinent, including Bangladesh and Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Orissa and Tripura As of 2005, there were some 55 troupes based in Calcutta's old jatra district, Chitpur Road, and all together, jatra is a $21m-a-year industry, performed on nearly 4,000 stages in West Bengal alone, where in 2001, over 300 companies employed over 20,000 people, more than the local film industry and urban theatre.\n\nThe word \"jatra\" means journey or going. The origin of jatra intrinsically a musical theatre form, is traditionally credited to the rise of Sri Chaitanya's Bhakti movement, wherein Chaitanya himself played Rukmini in the performance of \"Rukmini Haran\" (\"The abduction of the Charming Rukmini\") from Krishna's life story, a first definite presentation of this theatrical spectacle. The performance, which lasted through the night in 1507 AD., has been described in \"Chaitanya Bhagavata\", Chaitanya's hagiography by a disciple Vrindavana Dasa Thakura. Though there are evidences of existence of a form of singing called the 'Carya', which was popular between the 9th and the 12th centuries in Bengal, which existed in Orissa simultaneously as the popular 'Carya Padas' form. Jatra performances resemble the Nautanki of Uttar Pradesh, the Tamasha of Maharashtra and Bhavai of Gujarat.\n\nThough its birthplace lies in the religious landscape, replete with various Bhakti movements of Hinduism, by the end of the 19th century it was replaced by morally didactic content, and eventually became secular, when it gained entry into urban proscenium theatres during Bengal Renaissance. The survival of the form over such a vast period of rapidly changing social milieu, while catering to a heterogeneous audience, has been credited to its innate malleability and ways of adapting to changing social dynamics, and thus staying not just relevant and alive, but also thriving.\n\nJatras are usually epic four-hour-long plays, preceded by a musical concert often lasting an hour, used to attract audiences. The dramatic performance itself is liberally interspersed dramatic monologues, songs and duet dance routines on the folk tunes, which often serve as scene transitions and sometimes mark the end of an act. Jatra plays are usually performed on stages that are open on all sides in open-air arenas. The stage often had minimal or no furniture or props, it was rather seen as a neutral space, free to be given a meaning befitting the scene, this technique continued even when jatra started getting performed in proscenium theatres. Sets, props and lighting came in much later, when its started interacting with Western theatre in the late 19th century, as urban educated youth started joining the jatra tradition.\n\nThe cast is predominantly male, whose members also play the female parts, though since the 19th century, female actors started joining the cast. Actors often joined the troupes at a young age, and worked their way up the hierarchy of roles, and strive for virtuoso acting and are judged on their vocal prowess, as this determines their ability to capture a large audience with thundering dialogue deliveries and improvised dialogues. The modern version of jatra, features loud music, harsh lighting and dramatic props played on giant outdoor stages, and actors are hired for a season under written contracts. Sometimes ramps are built around the stage and used for dramatic effects as in Kabuki plays.\nJatras are often very melodramatic with highly stylised delivery and exaggerated gestures and orations. Music being the key element of the jatra, much attention is placed on its selection, popular tunes are created and incorporated. Musicians sit on two sides of the stage, carrying Dholak, pakhawaj, harmonium, tabla, flute, cymbals, trumpets, behala (violin) and clarinet, all used to heighten the overall dramatic effect of performances that are already frenzied, plus most of the singing is done by the actors themselves. Many of the songs were based on classical Ragas. A generic character, unique to jatra and part of most jatra performances even today, is the allegorical figure called \"Bibek\" or Vivek (Conscience); it performs the function of a moral guardian, commenting on actions of actors and their consequences, sometimes it elaborates on the feelings of different characters, and often steps into a scene unannounced and presents an alternate or philosophical point of view, and all done through singing, something which is done by the chorus in a Greek tragedy. Like Conscience, a character called niyati (Fate) often played by a woman, while commenting on the scene, foretells or warns the actors of impending dangers. Another distinct feature of jatra is that the plays begin with the climax, a device used to captivate the attention of the audience.\nThe Jatra season begins in the autumn, around September, around Durga Puja the beginning of harvest season, when the travelling troupe head out to interior rural regions, and ends before the Monsoon sets in, and the beginning of the planting season, around June. Performances of Jatras are commonplace after festivities and religious functions, ceremonies in traditional households, and fairs, throughout the region, where these troupes get invited in advance.\n\nThe recent origins of the Jatra can be traced back to rise of Vaishnavism, and the Bhakti movement especially in Krishnaism, in the 16th century, propelled by the advent of mystic Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The \"Krishna Jatra\", evolved through the devotional singing and dancing of the followers of the Krishna Bhakti movement, inspired by Raslila and dramatic poetry like, \"Gita Govinda\" written by Jayadeva in the 12th century and \"Srikrishna Kirtan\" by Chandidas in the 15th century. Historians also mention, the existence of \"Nata Gita\", an operatic folk drama for in medieval Bengal, filled with singing, dancing and music sans dialogue, which provided an early model for the \"Krishna Jatra\".\n\nIn an era, when there were no theatre houses or fixed stages in Bengal, jatra evolved its idiom in actual jatras or religious processions (yatra) of devotees that moved from one place to another singing and dancing to the tunes of kirtan or religious songs, often amongst them were artists, adept in singing and dancing, who would often enact scenes from mythology. Later these troupes found place on moving tableaux, which became part of the processions organised on special occasions such Rath Yatra. Gradually these small plays started being performed also at the end of the processions, and on open arenas, known as \"asar\" in Bengali, surrounded by people on all sides. In time, these open-air stages became the mainstay of these plays, though the name stuck with the genre; and as it evolved it absorbed all the prevalent folk traditions of music, dance and singing, be it Jhumur, Gambhira, Gajangan, or Panchali into its folds, to create a new template for folk theatre in the coming centuries.\n\nAfter Chaitanya, his followers like Ramananda Rai and Rupa Goswami wrote plays based on the life of Sri Krishna, and many received royal patronage as well, like from the King of Puri, Prataprudradeva, which helped this form evolve further. Gradually this evolved into performances of traditional mythological plays with stories of Rama (Ram jatra), Sita, Krishna and Shiva (Shiv jatra), taken from the Ramayan, Mahabharat, Puranas, various historical tales and folklore. Soon the form was adopted by devotees of other Bhakti cults, like Chandi devotees brought in \"Chandi Mangal\", a narrative poem by Mukunda Chakravarti, to start \"Chandi Jatra\", the Behula myth gave rise to \"Bhasan Jatra\", while a Manasa serpent myth took form of the \"Bisahara Yatra\"\n\nThe jatra movement gradually moved to the urban areas, and even brought literary works to the rural masses which were predominantly illiterate at the time, this meant that the plot, storyline and narrative remained simple, and often didactic. Another development that occurred in the 19th century was its departure from the \"Krishna Jatra\" format of musical, as dances were introduce which were to become staple in the coming years, and prose dialogues and free verse speech soon made inroads into this traditional theatre format, giving rise to \"Natun Jatra\", or the New Jatra. Another new trend in jatra during this period was introduction of secular themes, in what was traditionally a religious theatre.\n\nIn the early 20th century, at the onset of the Indian independence movement, jatra which had already experienced its artistic and popularity peak in the previous century, now evolved yet again, with the changing tide of Indian milieu. It took on political themes and became a vehicle of political satire and protest, and was called \"swadesi jatra\". It began to reflect the rise current of social and political awareness, and depicted far ranging social themes from Mahatama Gandhi's anti-untouchability movement to the non-violence movement in the coming decades, many of the jatra plays opposing colonialist ideologies, oppression and eulogising patriots were even banned by the British. This was also the time, when Communism was taking roots in Bengal, and jatras increasingly saw dramatisation of the life of Lenin, and portrayal communist ideologies and thought. During World War II, Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) used jatra, to garner support of Communist Party amongst the Allies, when Germany invaded Russia. Even after the war, noted directors like Utpal Dutt continued to use the jatra element in urban theatre of IPTA, as did Sombhu Mitra with his Bohurupee Company. When the art form travelled to the Tripura region, with its performers, it gave birth to the Kokborok drama, amongst the Kokborok speaking population of the region.\n\nWith the rise of Western theatre in Bengal it acquired the themes of political protest and social radicalism, and finally fell into disrepute in the post War era, and especially after the entry of Radio and television and the rise of upmarket theatre industry, though it continued to exist in the rural areas. Jatra remained a living tradition of musical theatre, and some of the popular jatra songs got recorded and became popular Bengali songs, once more ever widening audience base, also scripts of old jatras found their way into books, and newspapers started reserving space for jatra discussion.\n\nThis revival seen in the recent decades, started in the early 1960s, with various theatre groups experimenting with the Jatra form, and started attracting serious theatre patrons along with official recognition. 1961, saw the first Jatra festival organised in Kolkata and every year since, and in 1968, Phanibhusan Bidyabinod became the first jatra artist to receive the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. Earlier most jatra companies were owned by actor-managers or singers, today most are owned by businesses and are more prone to commercialisation, both in the content as well as in presentation. Even today, in majority the presentation style still is inspired by cinemas of the regions and television soaps, many a times reflected in the risque content. Yet, within its musical theatre genre jatra remains highly adaptable and rapidly evolving form. Several jatras today pick contemporary news events like the London bombings, 9/11 or the war in Iraq, and highlight local issues as well. Further as productions are often put up within a month, a clear advantage over theatre and film, jatras remain topical by drawing upon current imagery of the populace, like when Phoolan Devi became notorious the 80s, a play staged by the same name gained immense popularity not to mention big revenue.\n\n\n"}

The list of the films that have been submitted by Albania for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony as follows.\n\nAlbania's first three films were historical tales set against the backdrop of the Enver Hoxha dictatorship which ruled Albania for over forty years. \"Bunker\" and \"Slogans\" take place in Albania in the late 1970s while \"Sadness\" takes place in 1961 Czechoslovakia. \"Colonel Bunker\" is a drama about a soldier tasked by Hoxha to build a network of impossibly elaborate structures ('bunkers') designed to resist a potential foreign invasion. \"Slogans\" is a lighter film satirizing the ideological obsessions of the Hoxha regime, and their suffocating influence over the life of a small, rural school. Both films are among the few Albanian films to win awards at international Film Festivals- \"Bunker\" won an award at Venice and \"Slogans\" was the very first Albanian film to play at Cannes. \"The Sadness of Mrs. Schneider\", a Czech co-production, tells the story of a multi-ethnic group of friends studying cinema in Prague in the 1960s, and their travels around the Czechoslovak countryside.\n\nIn 2009, the selection committee originally considered three films. Two of these films were directed by Artan Minarolli.

It became an instant success in Europe and was translated into 18 languages. The French version of the book was a derivative work based on the original with the title \"Survivre avec les loups\" that was published in 1997 by the Éditions Robert Laffont; this second version was adapted into the French film \"Survivre avec les loups\" (\"Surviving with Wolves\").\n\nOn 29 February 2008, the author as well as her lawyers admitted that the bestselling book was a hoax, despite its having been presented as autobiographical.\nIn 2014 a court ordered Defonseca to repay her publisher $22 million.\n\nMonique De Wael was four when her parents were arrested by the Nazis on September 23, 1941, for resistance to the occupier. According to sources, Robert De Wael, her father, a municipal employee in Schaerbeek, would have accepted the deal proposed by the Nazis: in order to be able to see his daughter Monique De Wael, he had to deliver the names of the members of his group. He even took part in interrogations of his fellow soldiers and thus helped dismantle the \"Grenadiers Group\", the resistance network he had founded in November 1940. He was then sent to Cologne and imprisoned in various places before being transferred to Sonnenburg on the German-Polish border where he died of exhaustion. Joséphine Donvil, his wife, was also transported from prison to prison before being deported to Ravensbruck where she died in February 1945\n\nAfter the liberation, her father's name was erased from the stone plaque in honor of the local Nazi-victim employees on the walls of the Schaerbeek municipality. After her parents' arrest, little Monique was sent to live with her grandparents, then her uncle. In the local community, she was known as the \"daughter of the traitor\".\n\nDefonseca and her husband, Maurice, moved to the United States from Paris in 1988 and bought a house in Millis, Massachusetts. He was unemployed by the mid-1990s. Misha began to fantasize a vivid story about her childhood; suggesting to have wandering across Europe at the age of six after her parents were deported in 1941, being sheltered by friendly packs of wolves, killing a German soldier in self-defence, sneaking into and out of the Warsaw Ghetto, and finally supposedly finding her way home at the end of the war. Jane Daniel, a local book publisher, convinced Defonseca to write a memoir about her alleged past after she heard the writer tell the story in a Massachusetts synagogue. Daniel published \"Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years\" in 1997 through her \"one woman operation\", Mt. Ivy Press.\n\nPrior to the uncovering of the hoax, the book had spawned a multimillion-dollar legal battle between Defonseca and the book's ghostwriter, Vera Lee, against Jane Daniel and her small publishing company, Mt. Ivy Press. Daniel and Defonseca fell out over profits received from the best-selling book, which led to a lawsuit. In 2005, a Boston court ordered Daniel to pay Defonseca and Lee $22.5 million. Defonseca's lawyers said Daniel has not paid the court-ordered sum. Following her admission, a court in 2014 ordered Defonseca to repay the full amount.\n\nDespite its followers, the book also had many critics who pointed to passages that were logically or historically implausible. The first person who publicly doubted the authenticity of the story was Henryk M. Broder, who wrote an article about Defonseca in 1996 for the German newspaper \"Der Spiegel\". In late February 2008, a baptismal certificate from a Brussels church for a Monique De Wael and a register from an elementary school near the De Waels' home that shows Monique enrolled there in September 1943—two years after Misha claimed to have left Brussels—, were posted by Jane Daniel on her blog. Belgian national newspaper \"Le Soir\" soon reported on these findings. Finally the leading historian of the Shoah in Belgium, the late Dr. Maxime Steinberg, pointed out the historic anomalies and errors in the story.\n\nOn 29 February 2008, Defonseca admitted to \"Le Soir\" that she had fabricated the tale, after having been presented with what the paper described as \"irrefutable\" evidence that her story was false. \"The book is a story, it's my story\", said the writer in a statement issued under her real name. \"It's not the true reality, but it is my reality. There are times when I find it difficult to differentiate between reality and my inner world.\" Defonseca told \"Le Soir\" that she had always wanted to forget her real name because she had been called \"the traitor's daughter.\"\n\nForensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen M. Fitzpatrick led the team which was instrumental in uncovering the hoax.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "872518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=872518", "title": "Phaedrus (dialogue)", "text": "Phaedrus (dialogue)\n\nThe Phaedrus (; ), written by Plato, is a dialogue between Plato's protagonist, Socrates, and Phaedrus, an interlocutor in several dialogues. The \"Phaedrus\" was presumably composed around 370 BC, about the same time as Plato's \"Republic\" and \"Symposium\". Although ostensibly about the topic of love, the discussion in the dialogue revolves around the art of rhetoric and how it should be practiced, and dwells on subjects as diverse as metempsychosis (the Greek tradition of reincarnation) and erotic love.\n\nSocrates runs into Phaedrus on the outskirts of Athens. Phaedrus has just come from the home of Epicrates of Athens, where Lysias, son of Cephalus, has given a speech on love. Socrates, stating that he is \"sick with passion for hearing speeches\", walks into the countryside with Phaedrus hoping that Phaedrus will repeat the speech. They sit by a stream under a plane tree and a chaste tree, and the rest of the dialogue consists of oration and discussion.\n\nThe dialogue, somewhat unusually, does not set itself as a re-telling of the day's events. The dialogue is given unmediated, in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story or give it to us; it comes first hand, as if we are witnessing the events themselves. This is in contrast to such dialogues as the \"Symposium\", in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.\n\n\nLysias was one of the three sons of Cephalus, the patriarch whose home is the setting for Plato's \"Republic\". Lysias was perhaps the most famous \"logographos\" (λογογράφος, lit. \"argument writer\") in Athens during the time of Plato. Lysias was a rhetorician and a sophist whose best-known extant work is a defense speech, \"On the Murder of Eratosthenes.\" The speech is a masterpiece in which a man who murdered his wife's lover claims that the laws of Athens required him to do it. The outcome of this speech is unknown.\n\nThe dialogue consists of a series of three speeches on the topic of love that serves as the subject to construct a discussion on the proper use of rhetoric. They encompass discussions of the soul, madness, divine inspiration, and the practice and mastery of an art.\n\nAs they walk out into the countryside, Socrates tries to convince Phaedrus to repeat the speech of Lysias which he has just heard. Phaedrus makes several excuses, but Socrates suspects strongly that Phaedrus has a copy of the speech with him. Saying that while Lysias is present, he would never allow himself to be used as a training partner for Phaedrus to practice his own speech-making on, he asks Phaedrus to expose what he is holding under his cloak. Phaedrus gives in and agrees to perform Lysias' speech.\n\nPhaedrus and Socrates walk through a stream and find a seat in the shade, and Phaedrus commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with \"You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out\", the speech proceeds to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is \"more sick than sound in the head\" and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.\n\nSocrates, attempting to flatter Phaedrus, responds that he is in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.\n\nSocrates retorts that he is still in awe, and claims to be able to make an even better speech than Lysias on the same subject.\n\nPhaedrus and Socrates both note how anyone would consider Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to his love of learning which \"trees and open country won't teach,\" while \"men in the town\" will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading him out of his native land: \"Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for getting me out (\"dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai\"). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (\"en bibliois\") I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please.\"\n\nWhen Phaedrus begs to hear it however, Socrates refuses to give the speech. Phaedrus warns him that he is younger and stronger, and Socrates should \"take his meaning\" and \"stop playing hard to get\". Finally, after Phaedrus swears on the plane tree that he will never recite another speech for Socrates if Socrates refuses, Socrates, covering his head, consents.\n\nSocrates, rather than simply listing reasons as Lysias had done, begins by explaining that while all men desire beauty, some are in love and some are not. We are all ruled, he says, by two principles: one is our inborn desire for pleasure, and the other is our acquired judgment that pursues what is best (237d). Following your judgment is \"being in your right mind\", while following desire towards pleasure without reason is \"outrage\" (\"hubris\").\n\nFollowing different desires leads to different things; one who follows his desire for food is a glutton, and so on. The desire to take pleasure in beauty, reinforced by the kindred beauty in human bodies, is called \"Eros\".\n\nRemarking that he is in the grip of something divine, and may soon be overtaken by the madness of the nymphs in this place, he goes on.\n\nThe problem, he explains, is that one overcome with this desire will want to turn his boy into whatever is most pleasing to himself, rather than what is best for the boy. The boy's intellectual progress will be stifled, his physical condition will suffer, the lover will not wish the boy to mature and take a family, all because the lover is shaping him out of desire for pleasure rather than what is best. At some point, \"right-minded reason\" will take the place of \"the madness of love\", and the lover's oaths and promises to his boy will be broken.\n\nPhaedrus believes that one of the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.\n\nThe non-lover, he concludes, will do none of this, always ruled by judgment rather than desire for pleasure. Socrates, fearing that the nymphs will take complete control of him if he continues, states that he is going to leave before Phaedrus makes him \"do something even worse\".\n\nHowever, just before Socrates is about to leave, he is stopped by the \"familiar divine sign\", his daemon, which always occurs and only just before Socrates is about to do something he should not. A voice \"from this very spot\" forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias' repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, and seemed to be showing off. Socrates states that he is a \"seer\". While he is not very good at it, he is good enough for his purposes, and he recognizes what his offense has been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him. Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the Muses, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.\n\nSocrates begins by discussing madness. If madness is all bad, then the preceding speeches would have been correct, but in actuality, madness given as a gift of the gods provides us with some of the best things we have. There are, in fact, several kinds of divine madness (\"theia mania\"), of which he cites four examples:\n\nAs they must show that the madness of love is, indeed, sent by a god to benefit the lover and beloved in order to disprove the preceding speeches, Socrates embarks on a proof of the divine origin of this fourth sort of madness. It is a proof, he says, that will convince \"the wise if not the clever\".\n\nHe begins by briefly proving the immortality of the soul. A soul is always in motion and as a self-mover has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source of everything else that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary.\n\nThen begins the famous chariot allegory, called by R. Hackworth the \"centrepiece\" of \"Phaedrus\", and \"the famous and moving account of the vision, fall and incarnation of the soul.\" A soul, says Socrates, is like the \"natural union of a team of winged horses and their charioteer\". While the gods have two good horses, everyone else has a mixture: one is beautiful and good, while the other is neither.\n\nAs souls are immortal, those lacking bodies patrol all of heaven so long as their wings are in perfect condition. When a soul sheds its wings, it comes to earth and takes on an earthly body that then seems to move itself. These wings lift up heavy things to where the gods dwell and are nourished and grow in the presence of the wisdom, goodness, and beauty of the divine. However, foulness and ugliness make the wings shrink and disappear.\n\nIn heaven, he explains, there is a procession led by Zeus, who looks after everything and puts things in order. All the gods, except for Hestia, follow Zeus in this procession. While the chariots of the gods are balanced and easier to control, other charioteers must struggle with their bad horse, which will drag them down to earth if it has not been properly trained. As the procession works its way upward, it eventually makes it up to the high ridge of heaven where the gods take their stands and are taken in a circular motion to gaze at all that is beyond heaven.\n\nWhat is outside of heaven, says Socrates, is quite difficult to describe, lacking color, shape, or solidity, as it is the subject of all true knowledge, visible only to intelligence. The gods delight in these things and are nourished. Feeling wonderful, they are taken around until they make a complete circle. On the way they are able to see Justice, Self-control, Knowledge, and other things as they are in themselves, unchanging. When they have seen all things and feasted on them, coming all the way around, they sink back down inside heaven.\n\nThe immortal souls that follow the gods most closely are able to just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, having to deal with their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while straining to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.\n\nSouls then begin cycles of reincarnation. It generally takes 10,000 years for a soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life three times in a row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.\n\nOne comes to manifest this sort of love after seeing beauty here on earth and being reminded of true beauty as it was seen beyond heaven. When reminded, the wings begin to grow back, but as they are not yet able to rise, the afflicted gaze aloft and pay no attention to what goes on below, bringing on the charge of madness. This is the best form that possession by a god can take, for all those connected to it.\n\nWhen one is reminded of true beauty by the sight of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that can remember are startled when they see a reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.\n\nBeauty, he states, was among the most radiant things to see beyond heaven, and on earth it sparkles through vision, the clearest of our senses. Some have not been recently initiated, and mistake this reminder for beauty itself and only pursue desires of the flesh. This pursuit of pleasure, then, even when manifested in the love of beautiful bodies, is not \"divine\" madness, but rather just having lost one's head. The recent initiates, on the other hand, are overcome when they see a bodily form that has captured true beauty well, and their wings begin to grow. When this soul looks upon the beautiful boy it experiences the utmost joy; when separated from the boy, intense pain and longing occur, and the wings begin to harden. Caught between these two feelings, the lover is in utmost anguish, with the boy the only doctor for the pain.\n\nSocrates then returns to the myth of the chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is controlled by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can to go up to the boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.\n\nThe lover now pursues the boy. As he gets closer to his quarry, and the love is reciprocated, the opportunity for sexual contact again presents itself. If the lover and beloved surpass this desire they have won the \"true Olympic Contests\"; it is the perfect combination of human self-control and divine madness, and after death, their souls return to heaven. Those who give in do not become weightless, but they are spared any punishment after their death, and will eventually grow wings together when the time comes.\n\nA lover's friendship is divine, Socrates concludes, while that of a non-lover offers only cheap, human dividends, and tosses the soul about on earth for 9,000 years. He apologizes to the gods for the previous speeches, and Phaedrus joins him in the prayer.\n\nAfter Phaedrus concedes that this speech was certainly better than any Lysias could compose, they begin a discussion of the nature and uses of rhetoric itself. After showing that speech making itself isn't something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks what distinguishes good from bad writing, and they take this up.\n\nPhaedrus claims that to be a good speechmaker, one does not need to know the truth of what he is speaking on, but rather how to properly persuade, persuasion being the purpose of speechmaking and oration. Socrates first objects that an orator who does not know bad from good will, in Phaedrus's words, harvest \"a crop of really poor quality\". Yet Socrates does not dismiss the art of speechmaking. Rather, he says, it may be that even one who knew the truth could not produce conviction without knowing the art of persuasion; on the other hand, \"As the Spartan said, there is no genuine art of speaking without a grasp of the truth, and there never will be\".\n\nTo acquire the art of rhetoric, then, one must make systematic divisions between two different kinds of things: one sort, like \"iron\" and \"silver\", suggests the same to all listeners; the other sort, such as \"good\" or \"justice\", lead people in different directions. Lysias failed to make this distinction, and accordingly, failed to even define what \"love\" itself is in the beginning; the rest of his speech appears thrown together at random, and is, on the whole, very poorly constructed. Socrates then goes on to say,\n\nSocrates's speech, on the other hand, starts with a thesis and proceeds to make divisions accordingly, finding divine love, and setting it out as the greatest of goods. And yet, they agree, the art of making these divisions is dialectic, not rhetoric, and it must be seen what part of rhetoric may have been left out.\n\nWhen Socrates and Phaedrus proceed to recount the various tools of speechmaking as written down by the great orators of the past, starting with the \"Preamble\" and the \"Statement Facts\" and concluding with the \"Recapitulation\", Socrates states that the fabric seems a little threadbare. He goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor who knows how to raise and lower a body's temperature but does not know when it is good or bad to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or came across some potions knows nothing of the art. One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing tragedies; if one were to claim to have mastered harmony after learning the lowest and highest notes on the lyre, a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, but it is not the knowledge of harmony itself. This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through \"Preambles\" and \"Recapitulations\"; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only what is necessary to learn as preliminaries.\n\nThey go on to discuss what is good or bad in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, critically commenting on the gift of writing from the Egyptian god Theuth to King Thamus, who was to disperse Theuth's gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.\n\nNo written instructions for an art can yield results clear or certain, Socrates states, but rather can only remind those that already know what writing is about. Furthermore, writings are silent; they cannot speak, answer questions, or come to their own defense.\n\nAccordingly, the legitimate sister of this is, in fact, dialectic; it is the living, breathing discourse of one who knows, of which the written word can only be called an image. The one who knows uses the art of dialectic rather than writing:\n\nIn the \"Phaedrus\", Socrates makes the rather bold claim that some of life's greatest blessings flow from madness; and he clarifies this later by noting that he is referring specifically to madness inspired by the gods. It should be noted that Phaedrus is Plato's only dialogue that shows Socrates outside the city of Athens, out in the country. It was believed that spirits and nymphs inhabited the country, and Socrates specifically points this out after the long palinode with his comment about listening to the cicadas. After originally remarking that \"landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me, only people do\", Socrates goes on to make constant remarks concerning the presence and action of the gods in general, nature gods such as Pan and the nymphs, and the Muses, in addition to the unusually explicit characterization of his own daemon. The importance of divine inspiration is demonstrated in its connection with and the importance of religion, poetry and art, and above all else, love. Eros, much like in the \"Symposium\", is contrasted from mere desire of the pleasurable and given a higher, heavenly function. Unlike in the \"Ion\", a dialogue dealing with madness and divine inspiration in poetry and literary criticism, madness here must go firmly hand in hand with reason, learning, and self-control in both love and art. This rather bold claim has puzzled readers and scholars of Plato's work for centuries because it clearly shows that Socrates saw genuine value in the irrational elements of human life, despite many other dialogues that show him arguing that one should pursue beauty and that wisdom is the most beautiful thing of all.\n\nJacques Derrida makes an extensive study on the untranslatable concept of what is at once a \"'remedy, 'recipe,' 'drug,' 'philter,' etc.\", namely, the \"pharmakon.\" During this study, Derrida not only divulges the exact instances Socrates or his interlocutors make use of this concept, but he also reveals the relationship between Plato and Socrates, which scholars have kept in secret by questioning the validity of authorship in Plato's letters, where in the Second Letter, Socrates writes: \"Consider these facts and take care lest you sometimes come to repent of having now unwisely published your views. It is a very great safeguard to learn by heart instead of writing. It is impossible for what is written not to be disclosed (\"to me graphein all' ekmanthanein\"). That is the reason why I have never written anything about these things, and why there is not and will not be any written work of Plato's own (\"oud' estin sungramma Platonos ouden oud' estai\"). What are now called his are the work of a Socrates embellished and modernized (\"Sokratous estin kalou kai neou gegonotos\"). Farewell and believe. Read this letter now at once many times and burn it.\" (\"Letter II\", 314)\n\nThe pederastic relationships common to ancient Greek life are also at the fore of this dialogue. In addition to theme of love discussed in the speeches, seeming double entendres and sexual innuendo is abundant; we see the flirtation between Phaedrus and Socrates as Phaedrus encourages Socrates to make his first speech, Phaedrus makes a remark at noon-time that Socrates should not leave as the heat has not passed and it is \"straight-up, as they say,\" Socrates wishes to know what Phaedrus is holding under his cloak, and so on. The relationships discussed in the speeches are explicitly pederastic. And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, as they are in the \"Symposium\". Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as \"friends\"–equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty. In the beginning, they sit themselves under a chaste tree, which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as \"monk's pepper\", it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an antaphrodisiac. Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.\n\nThe \"Phaedrus\" also gives us much in the way of explaining how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a \"midwife of the soul\" in the \"Theaetetus\"; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is \"for\" and what it can help one achieve.\n\nThe role of divine inspiration in philosophy must also be considered; the philosopher is struck with the fourth kind of madness, that of love, and it is this divine inspiration that leads him and his beloved towards the good—but only when tempered with self-control.\n\nWriting, examined separately but ultimately equated with philosophy and rhetoric, is somewhat deprecated; it is stated that writing can do little but remind those who already know. Unlike dialectic and rhetoric, writing cannot be tailored to specific situations or students; the writer does not have the luxury of examining his reader's soul in order to determine the proper way to persuade. When attacked it cannot defend itself, and is unable to answer questions or refute criticism. As such, the philosopher uses writing \"for the sake of amusing himself\" and other similar things rather than for teaching others. A writer, then, is only a philosopher when he can himself argue that his writing is of little worth, among other requirements.\n\nThis final critique of writing with which the dialogue concludes seems to be one of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.\n\nThere is an echo of this point of view in Plato's Seventh Epistle (Letter), wherein Plato says not to write down things of importance. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Introduced to the market in 1967, it could be carried and operated by one person.\n\nEarlier television cameras were large and heavy, required a specialized vehicle for transportation, and were mounted on a pedestal. The Portapak made it possible to shoot and record video easily outside of the studio without requiring a crew. Although it recorded at a lower quality than television studio cameras, the Portapak was adopted by both professionals and amateurs as a new method of video recording. Before Portapak cameras, remote television news footage was routinely photographed on 16mm film and telecined for broadcast.\n\nThe first portapak system, the Sony DV-2400 Video Rover, was a two-piece set consisting of a black-and-white composite video video camera and a separate record-only helical scan ½\" video tape recorder (VTR) unit. It required a Sony CV series VTR (such as the CV-2000) to play back the video. Following Sony’s introduction of the Video Rover, numerous other manufacturers sold their own versions of Portapak technology. Although it was light enough for a single person to carry and use, it was usually operated by a crew of two: one carrying and controlling the camera, and one carrying and operating the VTR.\n\nThis model was followed up by the AV-3400/AVC-3400, which used the EIAJ-1 format, and had 30-minute capacity, as well as playback capability. Later Portapaks by Sony, JVC, and others used such formats as U-Matic videocassettes (with reduced-size 20-minute \"U-Matic S\" cassettes) and Betacam SP (for which a Portapak, unlike a camera-mounted deck, allowed the use of the larger \"L\" cassettes, for up to 90-minute recording time).\n\nThe introduction of the Portapak had a great influence on the development of video art, guerrilla television, and activism. Video collectives such as TVTV and the Videofreex utilized Portapak technology to document countercultural movements apart from the Big Three television networks. The Portapak was also a crucial technology for the Raindance Foundation, a collective consisting of artists, academics, and scientists, motivated by the potential of the Portapak and video to develop alternative forms of communication. Because of its relative affordability and immediate playback capability, the Portapak provided artists, experimenters, and social commentators the ability to make and distribute videos apart from well-funded production companies.\nA generation whose childhood had been dominated by broadcast television was now able to get its hands on a means of TV production. The machine was relatively inexpensive ($1,500), light- weight, easy to use and reliable, and it produced a decent black-and-white image with acceptable audio. Tape was reusable and inexpensive. The video portapak helped trigger a range of activity linking video with social change.\n\nThe Portapak would seem to have been invented specifically for use by artists. Just when pure formalism had run its course; just when it became politically embarrassing to make objects, but ludicrous to make nothing; just when many artists were doing performance works but had nowhere to perform, or felt the need to keep a record of their performances; just when it began to seem silly to ask the same old Berkleean question, ‘If you build a sculpture in the desert where no one can see it, does it exist?’; just when it became clear that TV communicates more information to more people than large walls do; just when we understood that in order to define space it is necessary to encompass time; just when many established ideas in other disciplines were being questioned and new models were proposed — just then the Portapak became available.\n"}

{"id": "262232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262232", "title": "Prosthetic makeup", "text": "Prosthetic makeup\n\nProsthetic makeup (also called Special make-up effects and FX prosthesis) is the process of using prosthetic sculpting, molding and casting techniques to create advanced cosmetic effects. Prosthetic makeup was revolutionized by John Chambers in such films as \"Planet of the Apes\" and Dick Smith in \"Little Big Man\".\n\nThe process of creating a prosthetic appliance begins with lifecasting, the process of taking a mold of a body part (often the face) to use as a base for sculpting the prosthetic. Lifecast molds are made from prosthetic alginate or more recently, from skin-safe silicone rubber. This initial mold is relatively weak and flexible. A hard mother mold, typically made of plaster or fiberglass bandages is created overtop the initial mold to provide support.\n\nOnce a negative mold has been created, it is promptly filled with gypsum cement, most commonly a brand called \"Ultracal-30\", to make a \"positive\" mold. The form of the prosthetic is sculpted in clay on top of the positive. The edges of the clay should be made as thin as possible, for the clay is a stand-in for what will eventually be the prosthetic piece. Along the edges of the mold, \"keys\" or mold points are sculpted or carved into the lifecast, to make sure that the two pieces of the mold will fit together correctly. Once sculpting is completed, a second mold is made. This gives two or more pieces of a mold - a positive of the face, and one or more negative mold pieces of the face with prosthetic sculpted in. All clay is carefully removed and the prosthetic material is cast into the mold cavity. The prosthetic material can be foam latex, gelatin, silicone or other similar materials. The prosthetic is cured within the two part mold - thus creating the beginning of a makeup effect.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of prosthetic make-up is keeping the edges as thin as possible. They should be tissue thin so they are easy to blend and cover giving a flawless look.\n\nAs the film/television industry continues to grow, so do the capabilities of the technologies behind it. Since the debut of newer technologies, many have feared that CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) will put practical SFX makeup out of business. More can be done with CGI than can be done with makeup as some things simply aren't possible when working in reality. Many views circulate on the subject.\n\nTom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, two experienced SFX artists from Amalgamated Dynamics near L.A., share what they see as the middle ground on the subject. In an interview, they explain that most movies use (out of necessity) a combination of practical effects and CGI. They see CGI as a tool that can be utilized in a good way or a bad way, just like practical effects. Tom Savini (an SFX artist known for his work in \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Creepshow\") states: \"They still use the make-up guys to design the creatures and that’s what they work from. I don’t think you’ll see make-up effects guys hanging out on corners with signs that say: \"WILL DO EFFECTS FOR FOOD\".”\n\nSpecial Effects Makeup isn't only used in films. A branch of SFX called Moulage is the process in which makeup is used to simulate different wounds and trauma in order to prepare medical, emergency, and military personnel for what they could experience in the field and lessen psychological trauma.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Iraqi penal code outlaws prostitution, with the pimp, the prostitute and the client all being liable for criminal penalties. Punishment can be severe, including life imprisonment.\n\nMany women fleeing the war in Iraq have been forced into prostitution. Some sources claim up to 50 thousand Iraqi refugee women in Syria, many of them widows or orphans, have been forced into prostitution. Sources claim the women are exploited by Gulf Arabs. After the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, private contracting companies used foreign prostitutes smuggled into bases and the Green Zone to use as bribery for other contracts.\n\nThe Iraqi Kurdistan region has reportedly received \"women and children trafficked from the rest of Iraq for prostitution\". Criminal gangs have prostituted girls from outside of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region in the provinces of Erbil, Dahuk, and Sulaymaniyah. NGOs have alleged that some personnel from the Kurdistan Regional Government’s Asayish internal security forces have facilitated prostitution in Syrian refugee camps in Iraqi Kurdistan. Iraqi women were sold into “temporary marriages” and Syrian girls from refugee camps in Iraqi Kurdistan were forced into early or “temporary marriages”, and it was alleged that KRG authorities ignored such cases.\n\nSoran Mama Hama, a young reporter for Livin Magazine wrote an article entitled \"Prostitutes invade Kirkuk\", which was published on June 15, 2008. Hama said that he had the names of police brigadiers, many lieutenants, colonels, and many police and security officers involved in and covering up a prostitution network in Kirkuk. The network involved 200 brothels in the city, each with 2 - 6 prostitutes.\n\nThe Kurdistan Journalists Syndicate (KJS) said Mama Hama had received a threatening message from an unidentified person on May 15.\n\nHama was shot and died in front of his home in Kirkuk. In the mobile phone Hama was using, there were messages discovered to be from a PUK politician who had threatened him with death prior to assassination.\n\nIn some cases, Iraqi teenage boys and young men are the prostitutes. In these cases the prostitutes are typically motivated by poverty and are mostly heterosexual.\n\nIraq is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. The violent conflict with ISIS exacerbated the population’s vulnerability to trafficking, in particular women and children. Refugees and IDPs face heightened risk of trafficking due to their economic and social vulnerability and lack of security and protections. NGOs report trafficking networks in the IKR target refugees and IDPs, operating with assistance from local officials, including judges, officials from the Asayish forces, and border agents. In 2015, members of the IKR Parliament and NGOs reported some personnel from the Asayish forces facilitated the sex trafficking of women and girls in Syrian refugee camps in the IKR, primarily in Domiz refugee camp, as well as sex trafficking of girls outside of the camps. In 2016, NGOs reported Asayish guards not only allowed men to enter a camp to solicit commercial sex with refugee girls, but the guards also solicited sex from the refugee girls, including granting them permission to leave the camp in exchange for sex. Reports from 2015 indicated IDPs and some Syrian refugee women were forced into prostitution by a trafficking network in hotels and brothels in Baghdad, Basrah, and other cities in southern Iraq after agents of the network promised to resettle them from the IKR.\n\nReports continue to suggest some Iraqi law enforcement officials have allegedly frequented brothels known for sex trafficking or accepted bribes to allow sex trafficking. Media and other observers reported in 2015 that an Iranian sex trafficking network operated brothels in Erbil where Iranian girls were exploited in commercial sex; the media reported a KRG official allegedly paid $3,000 for an Iranian sex trafficking victim. There were anecdotal reports, including from a June 2016 local television station, of child sex trafficking of girls primarily from Iran and Syria, as well as some from the IKR, in Sulaymaniyah. NGOs also report cases in which girls who have run away from their families out of fear of honor killings are exploited in commercial sex by criminal networks.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Iraq as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.\n\n"}
{"id": "1569170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1569170", "title": "Psycho-biddy", "text": "Psycho-biddy\n\nPsycho-biddy is a colloquial term for a subgenre of the horror/thriller movie that features a formerly-glamorous older woman who has become mentally unbalanced and terrorizes those around her. The genre officially began in 1962 with the film \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (though it had some antecedents) and lasted through the mid-1970s. It has also been referred to by the terms Grande Dame Guignol, hagsploitation and hag horror. Renata Adler, in her \"New York Times\" review for the 1968 film \"The Anniversary\", referred to the genre as \"the Terrifying Older Actress Filicidal Mummy genre.\"\n\nThe subgenre features a mentally unstable, dangerous, or insane woman of advanced years with a somewhat glamorous past, living a life of relative wealth. In some cases, the woman may be in jeopardy of some sort, with another party attempting to drive her to mental instability. Often (but not always), there are two older women pitted against one another in a life-or-death struggle, usually the result of bitter hatreds, jealousies, or rivalries that have percolated over the course of, not years, but decades. These combatants are often blood-relatives. The character is often brought to life in an over-the-top, grotesque fashion, emphasizing the unglamorous process of aging and eventual death. Characters are often seen pining for lost youth and glory, trapped by their idealized memories of their childhood, or younger days, and the trauma of a past episode that haunts them.\n\nThis subgenre includes elements of many other genres, including gothic, Grand Guignol, black comedy, psychodrama, melodrama, revenge, camp and even the musical. Science fiction and Western films have also been part of the genre.\n\nThe genre began in 1962 with \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" directed by Robert Aldrich. \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" bolstered the flagging careers of its stars, Bette Davis as Baby Jane Hudson and Joan Crawford as Blanche Hudson. The 1950 Billy Wilder classic \"Sunset Boulevard\" shares thematic similarities (their respective central characters both psychotically deranged formerly-glamorous older women) with \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" and can be seen as a precursor to the genre.\n\n\"Baby Jane\" set many trends and more-or-less defined the genre: the theatrical performance, the trappings of wealth and Hollywood, and psychologically complex melodrama. Jane goes quite insane over the course of the movie, torturing her crippled sister and venting long-pent up hostilities and guilt. At the end of the film, Blanche makes a confession which details and admits of her own complicity in the whole affair. The film was quite successful, garnering Academy Award nominations, including one for Davis.\n\nCrawford then starred in director and producer William Castle's \"Strait-Jacket\" (1964) as Lucy Harbin, the accused axe-murderer of her husband and his mistress, who is released from the asylum for the criminally insane after 20 years to be reunited with her beloved daughter and other friends. When a new string of axe-murders begins, it is naturally assumed that it is Lucy committing them.\n\nThe two actresses were reunited again with director Robert Aldrich for a \"Baby Jane\" \"follow-up\", \"Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte\" (1964), despite a hyped, somewhat exaggerated feud. But genuine mutual dislike between the two actresses led to Crawford bowing out. She was replaced by Olivia de Havilland, who knew how to get along with Davis. Veteran actresses Agnes Moorehead and Mary Astor also appeared in the film.\n\nIn \"Charlotte\", Davis was not only the one going insane, but was the \"officially\" sympathetic character, who is gaslit by her cousin (De Havilland) and her doctor, the cousin's lover (Joseph Cotten). In this movie, Davis' character is again haunted by guilt, though this time the ante is upped: instead of believing herself responsible for a crippling, she believes she is responsible for the murder of her lover. \"Charlotte\" is one of the most successful examples of the genre, and is noted for using Southern Gothic atmosphere.\n\n\"Mad\" Magazine poked fun at the genre in 1966 with a movie musical satire entitled \"Hack, Hack Sweet Has-Been-or Whatever Happened to Good Taste?\"\n\nWealth is a more prominent theme than revenge in \"What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?\" (1969). Claire Marrable (Geraldine Page), a socialite, finds herself (apparently) penniless when her husband dies. She then begins hiring financially independent older cleaning women, murdering them, taking their savings and planting the corpses in her garden. The corpses apparently make the ground quite fertile, and it's not until the third cleaning woman drops out of sight that someone (Ruth Gordon) begins to suspect something is amiss. Gordon applies to be Page's maid to figure out what happened to her friend, the third maid. The movie has a certain status as a cult classic, and is fairly well-regarded.\n\n\"What's the Matter with Helen?\" (1971) features two older women, Helen Hill (Shelley Winters) and Adelle Bruckner (Debbie Reynolds), who move out to Hollywood during the heyday of Shirley Temple. Their sons have gone to prison for a Leopold and Loeb-like murder and the two mothers are on the run from a man who threatens to kill them for revenge. Helen, an increasingly unstable and violent religious fanatic and repressed lesbian, may have murdered her husband years before (and possibly led to her son's criminal behavior). Helen's increasing obsession with Adelle, her roommate, leads to a graphically violent climax, which would recur in future excursions into the genre.\n\n\"Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?\" (1971) has only one older woman, Mrs. Rosie Forrest, a.k.a. Auntie Roo (Shelley Winters), featured prominently in the cast. A young orphan becomes a surrogate in the troubled woman's mind for her own long-dead daughter. Roo visits the mummified remains in her daughter's bedroom. The themes of deep-seated past guilt and youth are explored. The story is a variant of the Hansel and Gretel theme; however, unlike the witch in the story, Roo is seriously unstable, as well as subject to con-artist clairvoyants and blackmailing servants. She tries to keep the young orphan girl with her, as the girl reminds her of her daughter, but the girl and her brother fight back, and are quite cunning, having stolen, by the film's end, the woman's valuable jewelry. Roo dies in a fire the children set while trying to escape.\n\nOther examples of the genre are the 1965 UK films \"The Nanny\", starring Bette Davis in the lead role as the said nanny, and \"Fanatic\" with Tallulah Bankhead, released in the US as \"Die! Die! My Darling\".\n\nLater films like \"Mommie Dearest\" (1981) and \"Requiem for a Dream\" (2000) also contain elements of the psycho-biddy genre in their respective portrayals of aged women who descend into mental instability.\n"}
{"id": "173429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173429", "title": "Simon Says", "text": "Simon Says\n\nSimon Says (or Simple Simon Says) is a game for 3 or more players where 1 player takes the role of \"Simon\" and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as \"jump in the air\" or \"stick out your tongue\") to the other players, which should only be followed if prefaced with the phrase \"Simon says\". Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase, or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase \"Simon says\". It is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands, rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted.\n\nThe object for the player acting as Simon is to get all the other players out as quickly as possible; the winner of the game is usually the last player who has successfully followed all of the given commands. Occasionally however, 2 or more of the last players may all be eliminated at the same time, thus resulting in Simon winning the game.\n\nThe game is well embedded in popular culture, with numerous references in films, music and literature.\n\nThe tradition behind the use of 'Simon' as the controller of the game may trace back to the year 1264, when at the Battle of Lewes, Simon de Montfort captured King Henry III and his son, the future King Edward I. For the next year, any order Henry III gave could have been countermanded by de Montfort, until his defeat at the Battle of Evesham.\n\nThis game has translated across multiple cultures from seemingly common routes and some international versions also use the name Simon such as:\n\nA version also exists in India, Pakistan, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary where an analogy to what can fly and what cannot is emphasized instead of Simon saying or not, i.e. \"Chidiya ud\" (Hindi) which translates to \"Bird fly\" or \"Alle Vögel fliegen hoch\" (German) which is \"All birds fly high\". The term 'bird' can then be replaced with a thing that cannot fly. These games are usually played more with gestures than actual jumping.\n\nIn a Swedish version, Gör si, gör så (\"Do this, do thus\"), the leader says either \"do this\" or \"do thus\" while performing an action. For failing to follow the correct command, \"do this\", or following the wrong command, \"do thus\", a child must sit down until a new leader is chosen.\n\nIn the late 1930s in New Zealand, non commissioned officers were leading troops in a brain stimulation game as part of training classed as informal activities called, 'do this, do that.'\n\nA command starting with \"Simon says\" means that the players must obey that command. A command \"without\" the beginning \"Simon says\" means do not do this action. Anyone who breaks one of these two rules is eliminated from the remainder of the game. Often, anyone who speaks is also eliminated.\n\nThere can be very complex and difficult command chains, such as \"Simon says: Arms up. Simon says: Arms down. Arms up.\" Anyone ending with their arms up is eliminated, because a command that doesn't begin with \"Simon says\" cannot be obeyed.\n\nA variation on the instruction phrases is used. \"Simon says\" is said once at the start of a series of instructions, and an action along with the phrase \"do \"this\"\" must be obeyed while an action with the phrase \"do \"that\"\" must not be obeyed. Obeying a \"do that\" command or not obeying a \"do this\" command will eliminate a player.\n\nIt is considered cheating to give impossible commands (\"Simon says, lift both of your legs up and keep them there!\") or phrase the commands in such a way that the other player has no option but to 'go out' (\"Simon says, jump up. Come down.\"). However, at least in some versions, it is allowed for Simon to eliminate players by asking them to do something seemingly unrelated to the game (example: \"Anyone remaining join me up here.\").\n\n\n"}

In 1944, a special bureau on propaganda for foreign countries was set up as part of Sovinformburo. In 1961 Sovinformburo was transformed into Novosti Press Agency which was succeeded by RIA Novosti and, in 2013, International Information Agency Russia Today.\n\nThe radio announcements were performed on Radio Moscow (known for its Wide is My Motherland beeping) by Yuri Levitan.

The game is set in a science-fiction universe where various thriving technological directions exist side by side. Players will freely traverse the rich and filled vastness of the Gemini star system, fight skirmishes with rogue ships, trade commodities, mine ore from asteroids, research anomalies, buy new vessels, enlarge their fleet, upgrade their ships with state-of-the-art technology, increase their experience and rank to learn more powerful maneuvers and ultimately use all that in large scale engagements against other fleets and battlestations.\n\nThe player navigates a large and powerful spaceship. Every vessel in the game can be controlled and upgraded with over 300 ship systems ranging from Shield emitters and Grappling beams to Plasma cannons and Shockwave generators, to better suit the player. In addition, the player can create their \"captain avatar\" in the beginning of the game with some starting maneuvers (skills) which they then later upgrade during the game. He can also add new maneuvers by spending maneuver points he gained with experience levels.\n\nStarpoint Gemini features a combination of tactical combat and extensive role-playing features that support a wide variety of overall strategy. The player is able to undertake any of the game’s possible career paths, such as trade, repair, piracy, research, salvaging, mining, or a mixture. While most games of the space adventure ilk offer the same possibilities, Starpoint Gemini offers up to thirty-eight skills and eighteen perks earned through experience (and officers the player can hire for additional skills), along with twenty-one special abilities spread across fifty ships. The game has a large amount of variety, allowing the player to forge any path of your liking. Missions are also varied, providing your primary source of income in the game since the trade interface leaves room for improvement.\n\nStarpoint Gemini offers the main storyline of some thirty missions, but also leaves a free choice to every individual player, whether they will actually follow the main plot or roam around at their own leisure. The entire Gemini star system is a living universe where commerce, mining, talking and fighting happens all around you. It is up to the player to survey the Gemini world, and choose their career. Since, in a way, your main character in a game is a large starship, the game offers many ways to customize it and adjust to your way of doing things. The captain can be a specialist in some technical field or warfare area, and he gains levels and perks in time. The ships themselves have unique abilities, and can also be customized with large numbers of weapons, shields, power cores and science equipment. In addition, a player can also employ several crew members, each with his own bonuses and abilities, depending on their position and who is currently available. Once that is done, one can travel around Gemini sectors in search of wealth,(trading, mining), glory,(fighting,taking up freelance missions), or investigate anomalies. One can use everything from small gunships to large battlecruisers. The player has many tactics: frontal assault, cloaking approach, subtargeting enemy ship's subsystems, boarding the enemy vessel, and many more.\n\nStarpoint Gemini 2 is the sequel to original PC game released in 2010. Players will once again be offered a chance to experience unrestricted life in Gemini starsystem. Most of the game elements are unchanged, but on the technical side game is greatly improved. Movement is now in full 3D universe, combat controls are more direct and action based, while most significant changes are visible in graphics features aimed at keeping the game up to date.\n\n\n"}

It was created to allow people in a public place to turn off nearby television sets. Its inventor has referred to it as \"an environmental management device\". The device is part of a key-chain, and, like other remote devices, is battery-powered. Although it can require up to 72 seconds for the device to find the proper code for a particular television receiver, the most popular televisions turn off in the first few seconds.\n\nTV-B-Gone was invented by Mitch Altman and is sold by his company Cornfield Electronics. Altman was one of the pioneers of Virtual Reality, working with Jaron Lanier at VPL Research, and it was during his research in this field that he started to believe in the hypnotic power of television programs. The standard model TV-B-Gone consists of an infra-red LED, two CR2032 cells and an integrated circuit containing the television power code database, all in a plastic case. The original case aesthetics and design were created by Robert Ellis.\n\nThe TV-B-Gone Pro SHP (Super High Power) is the latest TV-B-Gone to be announced. It is considerably more powerful than the standard model, using eight infra-red LEDs to allow TVs to be turned off from distances of up to 100 meters (300 feet). TV-B-Gone Pro SHP is switchable between its North American and European databases of POWER codes. Later, in 2009, Mitch Altman\nmade a new kind of TV-B-Gone Pro SHP. Instead of disguising it as an iPhone, Mitch Altman has made the new and improved TV-B-Gone look like an iPod Nano and go ten more yards than the old one.\n\nThe recent invention of >1W 850 and 970 nm IREDs makes a miniature long range version of the TV-B-Gone feasible.\n\nAt several hacker conventions Mitch Altman has run workshops that allow participants to build their own TV-B-Gones using Adafruit Industries' micro controller-based mini-POV kit.

Taylor, published in 2001. It is the fifth and final book of the Logan Family saga started with \"Song of the Trees\". It is a prequel to the whole series that recounts the life of Cassie Logan's grandfather Paul-Edward as he grows from a nine-year-old boy into a man in his mid-twenties. This book won the 2002 Coretta Scott King Author Award and the 2002 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.\n\n\"The Land\" follows the life of Paul-Edward Logan. Paul is the child of a white man and a black/Native American woman. Paul has three entries from Paul's journal, after the main story ends. The dialogue uses the Southern dialect from the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nThe novel begins with Paul-Edward, as a nine-year-old. \"The Land\" describes how Paul's life has been different from that of most freed slaves. The book is narrated from Paul's perspective, and quickly introduces his three brothers, his sister, and Mitchell Thomas, a black boy whose father works for Paul's father and who becomes a vital member of the story-line. In the beginning, Mitchell continually bullies Paul for being multiracial. Paul's father and brothers' only advice for Paul is to \"use his head,\" and come up with a solution by himself. In \"Childhood,\" Paul's parents are constant reminders of the trials and tribulations of being born biracial. After several months of incessant bullying, Paul strikes a deal with Mitchell. Their deal states that if Paul teaches Mitchell to \"read English, write English, and figure,\" then Mitchell will teach Paul how to fight and to fend for himself; but as he reminded Paul, Mitchell \"can't teach him how to win.\"\n\nPaul and Mitchell soon grow tired of obeying Edward Logan (Paul's Father). Paul comes across the opportunity to race another man's horse. Edward Logan forbids it, saying that it would be unwise of Paul to ride, let alone race, a horse with whom he is not acquainted. Paul wins the race but has trouble collecting his pay. The owner of the horse will not give Paul his pay. Due to Paul being of mixed heritage, the owner of the horse doesn't even have to give Paul his earned money. If Mitchell hadn't used violent force to ensure that the white man kept his word by paying Paul his money, Paul would have never seen any dime of \"four times a rider's pay.\" After this incident, the two flee aboard a train.\n\nPaul and Mitchell are working in a lumber camp and wish to escape. The pair start their journey together, but they decide to separate to avoid drawing attention to themselves. While they are separated, Mitchell goes to more lumber camps, and Paul's eyes land upon J.T. Hollenbeck's land. Upon seeing this land, Paul knows that this is 'The Land.' His land. The book then goes on to describe life in different types of work camps. The story follows Paul as he works at a general store owned by Luke Sawyer, and as a woodworker in a small town called Vicksburg.\n\nEventually, Paul and Mitchell meet a man by the name of Filmore Granger and make a deal to work for the possession of 40 acres. Although it is not The Land, clearing the forty will help Paul obtain the money needed for J.T. Hollenbeck's land. A deal was struck between Paul and Mr. Granger that stated, if Paul could clear the forty within about two years, Paul and Mitchell would own the forty.\n\nAfter a few months of working hard at the forty, Paul realizes that he needs the help of some hired hands. Mitchell suggests Tom Bee, with whom he had worked a lumber camp. A white boy Paul had met before, and a young black boy named Nathan Perry, who later becomes Paul's brother-in-law are also hired hands. For a while, a white boy by the name of Wade Jamison helps Paul clear the forty.\n\nMitchell marries Caroline, who soon becomes pregnant, while Paul continues to work for his land. To disrupt this happiness, Digger Wallace fulfills his promise to get Mitchell back for embarrassing him. One day while Mitchell is working on Filmore Granger's land, the drunken Digger shoots Mitchell from behind. Mitchell was in the middle of felling a tree when shot. Being paralyzed with searing pain, Mitchell is crushed by the tree. When Paul gets back from The Land, he arrives on the scene; Mitchell is almost dead. Mitchell's last request of Paul is that he marry Caroline and take care of their unborn child. After Mitchell dies, Paul tries to hunt down Digger, but is unsuccessful. Later, Digger is found dead, face down in a river, with a bottle of moonshine floating next to him.\n\nLater that year, their work of clearing the forty is almost completed and should soon be in Paul's possession, even with all of the extra conditions that Granger adds to the deal in a last-ditch attempt to keep his land. When Granger claims that they cut trees outside of the perimeter, he declares that he wants Paul off of the land; unless he wishes to sharecrop. Cassie, Paul's sister, sends their brother Robert up to deliver an envelope with the money he needs to purchase J.T. Hollenbeck's land. His brother tells Paul of the family's condition and gives Paul the envelope. Enclosed is the money and two letters. Paul's sister explains in her letter that their mother owned the patch of land that they lived on as children, and that ten years after their mother's death, she sold the land to their father for $500, much more than it was worth. This combined with his sister's savings made more than enough money to pay for the land. After burying Mitchell's body, Paul asks Caroline to marry him, and confessing that she too, loves him, Caroline says yes. From this point in the story, Paul purchases the land, moves onto it, and lives the life he wants.\n\nIn Legacy, Paul's father was sick when Paul takes his boys back to see his family. He saw Robert, Hammond, Cassie, and Cassie's husband Howard. Though Paul had visited Hammond in his store several times over the years, Paul had never heard from brothers Robert and George. No one had heard from George in years. The day after Paul arrived home, his father died. Paul then bought the other 200 acres of Hollenbeck land, from Wade Jamison.\n\n\nMildred D. Taylor's novels are often based on stories that she read, heard, or was told about her family's history. \"I remember my grandparents' house, the house my great-grandfather had built at the turn of the century, and I remember the adults talking about the past. As they talked, I began to visualize all the family who had once known \"The Land\" and I felt as if I knew them too,\" Taylor explained.\n\nMildred Taylor, \"The Land\".

Although the theater was selling out every night, it was noted that many of the same people were returning to see the movie. This turned out to be an exception, not the rule as it was not doing well elsewhere in the US.\n\nThe film was then re-launched as a midnight movie, beginning its run at the Waverly Theatre in New York City on April 1, 1976. The Riverside Twin in Austin, Texas, became the second location to run the film as a midnighter. Over time, people began shouting responses to the characters' statements on the screen. Schoolteacher Louis Farese, Jr., Theresa Krakauskas and Amy Lazarus, who attended together at the Waverly, are credited with having started the convention of talking back to the screen, bringing props and making up one-liners. The purpose of which was basically to make one another laugh. They had no idea that in doing so, they'd create something that would last decades. As Amy Lazarus once said, \"we just trying to have a good time.\" (These mostly included puns, or pop culture references.) A showing of the film at the 1976 World Science Fiction Convention spread its fame to a new cadre of enthusiasts.\n\nA part of audience reception can be recreating the art. This is how the fandom of \"Rocky Horror\" developed into a standardized ritual. The performances of the audience was scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters. \"Rocky Horror\" helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to grind-house style. Early participation with the film took place at the original Westwood location of the film's first run with fans heard singing along. Waverly Theatre fans in New York are credited with the call back lines. Performance groups became a staple at \"Rocky Horror\" screenings due in large part to the prominent New York City fan cast. The cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic Sal Piro and by Dori Hartley, one of several performers in a flexible, rotating cast to portray the character of Frank N. Furter, shadowing the film above. According to J. Hoberman, author of \"Midnight Movies\", it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be yelled by the audience. The first person to yell out an audience participation line during a screening was Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher who, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \"Buy an umbrella you cheap bitch\". This self-proclaimed \"counter point dialogue\" was soon helped into standardization by Piro and repeated nearly verbatim at each screening. By that Halloween, people were attending in costume and talking back to the screen. By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres.\n\nThe National Fan Club began in 1977 and would merge with the International Fan Club; the fan publication \"The Transylvanian\" printed a number of issues. A semi-regular poster magazine was published as well as an official magazine.\n\nThe Los Angeles area performance groups originated in 1977 at the Fox Theatre, where Michael Wolfson, portraying Frank, won a look-alike contest, as well as another at the Tiffany Theater on Sunset Blvd. Wolfson's group would perform in all of the LA area theaters screening \"Rocky Horror\", including the Balboa Theater in Balboa, The Cove at Hermosa Beach and The Sands in Glendale, and was invited to perform at the Sombrero Playhouse in Phoenix, Arizona. At the Tiffany Theatre, the audience performance cast had the theater's full cooperation; the local performers entered early and without charge. The Frank N. Furter for this theatre was performed by a transgender performer. D. Garret Gafford, was out of work in 1978, trying to raise enough funds for a sex change operation while spending the weekends performing at the Tiffany.\n\nIn San Francisco \"Rocky Horror\" would move from one location to the Strand Theatre located near the Tenderloin on Market Street. The performance group there would act out and perform almost the entire film, unlike the New York cast at that time. The Strand cast was put together from former members of the Berkeley group, disbanded due to less than enthusiastic management. Their Frank N. Furter was portrayed by Marni Scofidio who, in 1979, got many of the older group from Berkeley over to San Francisco. Other members included Mishell Erickson and her twin sister Denise Erickson, who portrayed Columbia and Magenta, Kathy Dolan playing Janet and Linda Woods as Riff Raff. The Strand group had performed at two large science fiction conventions, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and were offered a spot at The Mabuhay, a local punk club; and even performed for children's television in Argentina.\n\nAnnual \"Rocky Horror\" conventions are held in varying locations lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has hosted a few times including 1999 with “El Fishnet Fiesta”, and “Queens of the Desert” held in 2006. To the fans, \"Rocky Horror\" is a repeated cycle, of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend, making the practice a ritual of compulsive, re-affirmation of community that has been compared to a \"religious event\". The audience call backs are similar to responses in church during a mass. \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" has a global following and remains popular well into the 21st century.\n\nThe film gained popularity because of fan participation as much as anything else. \"Shadow Casts\" of fans acting out the entire movie below, or in some cases directly in front of the screen, are almost always present at showings. At the Strand Theatre in San Francisco, fans came to see a well-organized group coordinated by Grady Broyles, performing with sets and props like a professional theatre troupe. At the Tiffany Theater on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, fans included a transsexual individual performing as Frank N. Furter, just a few blocks away from the Roxy Theatre where \"The Rocky Horror Show\" made its American debut.\n\nAudience participation also includes dancing the Time Warp along with the film, and throwing toast, water, toilet paper, hot dogs, and rice at appropriate points in the movie. Many theatres forbid throwing items that are difficult to clean up. In many cases, a total ban on throwing objects has been instituted due to severe damage to movie screens. Fans often attend shows in costume as the characters. At a now-defunct theater in New Orleans, the local \"Eddie\" would ride his motorcycle down the aisle during Meat Loaf's/Eddie's song, \"Hot Patootie.\"\n\nDuring a showing of \"Rocky Horror\", ad-lib responses, more commonly known as \"call backs\", are lines the audience may shout out in response to events occurring on screen, as a form of audience participation. In some venues, audience members who provide incorrect or poorly timed responses may find themselves angrily shouted down just as if they were being disruptive in a normal movie. However, creative new lines are usually applauded and even added to the local repertoire. There have been audience participation albums recorded and scripts published. However, most fans feel that it is preferable for responses to grow organically from the local culture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10950312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10950312", "title": "Tote betting", "text": "Tote betting\n\nThe Tote is a bookmaker in Britain which offers parimutuel betting on British horse racing in Britain. Until July 2018 the Tote was the only bookmaker in Britain allowed to offer parimutuel betting on horse racing, although as of July 13th 2018 the existing monopoly protection the Tote ceased, and a number of other tote or parimutuel suppliers entered the British market. Other bookmakers offer a Tote service through syndication, while other bookmakers will accept a Tote bet and pay out on exactly the same terms as the Tote.\n\nThe pooled bets offered by The UK Tote are:\n\nWin, Place, Exacta, Trifecta, Quadpot, Placepot, Jackpot, Scoop6 and Swinger.\n\nAs other bookmakers can offer similar gambling services it is necessary to disambiguate the bets. A bookmaker win-only bet (on-the-nose) isn't the same as a Tote Win bet, as the bookmaker is offering fixed odds for that particular outcome, while the Tote is a dividend paid out from the betting pool. The betting pool is generated from individuals placing money on a Tote bet.\n\nA price quote for a horse on the Tote is the current dividend payout on the event of that outcome happening. This tends to be similar to normal bookmaker odds, and tracks the market in a similar way, but at any given time may be better or worse than a bookmaker's quoted odds. However, since all bets are pooled, all bets are essentially \"starting price\" (SP), that is, until the race has started (and all betting finished) one cannot calculate what the final payout will be; whereas bookmakers can offer either SP or a \"board price\", that is, a guaranteed payout at a given price for a winning bet. (The SP for horse races is the average price offered by bookmakers when the race starts, as inspected by employees of the Jockey Club).\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that Tote odds are generally less favourable than bookmakers' SPs. This claim is controversial, some assert they vary little from bookmakers' odds.\n\nThe minimum stake for this bet is £2. One selects a horse from the field. This can be on any horse at any race meeting. The betting slip can be denoted with the horse's race card number, or the horses name (and if at another course, the name of the course), or it can be marked as the 'favourite', where the horse is not nominated but the bet is placed on whichever horse is favourite (has the largest amount of money put into the pool) at the start of the race. This will, obviously, have the lowest payout (since the pool will be shared with the largest number of winners) but the assumption is that if others have bet on it, it must have a good chance of winning.\n\nA Tote Place bet is still on one, but the horse may come second, third or even fourth for the bet to win. Not every race qualifies for this type of bet. There must be a minimum of 5 horses in the field, the minimum stake is £2 and the following rules apply:\n\nIt is also possible to have an each-way (\"e/w\") bet, which is simply a combination of a Tote Win with a Tote Place bet. A £1 e/w bet is a total of £2, £1 for the Tote Win and the other £1 is for the Tote Place, and the money is split between the two separate pools (the Win pool and the Place pool).\n\nBookmakers other than the Tote do not generally offer a place-only bet, but only an each-way bet. This can be seen as a waste by bettors who believe their selection will finish 2nd or 3rd but will not come 1st; since half the money falls on the \"win\" it is wasted. A non-Tote bookmaker will offer a quarter or a fifth for the e/w component, whereas the Tote place payout, and as such the e/w payout, is as always the betting pool dividend. With the advent of the exchanges, more and more bookmakers are beginning to offer 'place only' markets in an attempt to rival the exchanges. However, there is not a set in stone way for a punter to calculate the place odds as there is with an each-way bet, and the special place only odds offered by bookmakers can vary quite a bit, both bigger and smaller, from the place odds you would receive if betting each-way. This is particularly true in \"bad each-way\" races, where the place odds are much less generous than if you bet each-way. The upside to this however goes back to what was said above; since the punter does not have to \"waste\" half their stake on the win part of the bet.\n\nThe Tote Exacta operates in the same way as a normal bookmaker's straight forecast. As always the Tote price for the forecast is always based on the betting pool dividend. A forecast is to predict the correct order of the horses finishing first and second. The minimum bet is £2 and the multiples of 10 pence over this, multiples can also be used to reach the initial minimum of £2. If the bet contains a non-runner the bet becomes void and unnamed favourites are not allowed.\n\nThere are three Exacta bets:\n\nSingle Exacta (straight forecast). Pick in the correct order the horses which will finish first and second.\n\nCombination Exacta (reverse forecast). Pick in either order the horses which will finish first and second. This bet is actually two bets in one, it is exactly equivalent to two straight forecasts, the first of which you select horse A to beat horse B, and then the second is for horse B to beat horse A. It's possible to specify more than two horses, at which point the bet becomes more complex, for example with three horses the individual bets are now a-b, a-c, b-a, b-c, c-a, c-b.\n\nBanker Exacta (banker forecast). Pick a horse which you think is going to finish first, and then any number of horses to finish second. For instances, with a banker horse a, and with three additional horses, the bets are a-b, a-c, a-d.\n\nBookmakers that are not Tote-syndicated will offer their own forecast prices based on their own odds that they are quoting. However bookmakers will normally allow you to place a 'Tote forecast' and will pay out whatever the Tote dividend payout was.\n\nAlso known as a Trifecta: pick the first three horses in the right order. This is generally really difficult to do and the dividend for getting it right is correspondingly better. The Tote can nominate races containing more than 8 runners as Trifecta races. There are three types of Trifecta, the Single, Combination and Banker and they work the same way as Exacta bets, only with three horses instead of two. The minimum stake is £2.\n\nA Quadpot is operated on one race at every meeting in the UK and it takes place on the third to sixth races on the card. The aim is to pick a horse that will be placed in each one of these races, according to the placing rules stated in the Tote Place section above. The minimum bet is 10p. The dividend is declared after the result of the last race is known and thus the betting pool divided by the remaining stakes which are left. One may select the favourite instead of naming a specific horse.\n\nThe Placepot is identical to the Quadpot except it operates over the first six races of a race card. All UK race meetings have six races as a minimum, occasionally seven and rarely eight, but the Placepot is always operated on the first six. This bet is very popular as it has the potential to allow a gambler involvement in the whole of the race card. The minimum bet is 5p.\nHere is a worked example:\n\nThe first race the gambler has opted to choose two horses. Maybe the gambler isn't confident of his abilities or maybe it is a large field and the gambler feels unable to just place one horse. On race two the gambler has elected to roll with the favourite, whatever it may be. In the final race the gambler has chosen three selections. This is often driven by the motive that if the gambler reaches the last race and still has a bet on, he doesn't want to lose out in the last race by only having one selection. The number of combinations in this bet is therefore 2 × 1 × 2 × 1 × 1 × 3 = 12. The gambler has decided to risk 20p per bet, so the total cost of this bet is £2.40.\n\nIf after the first race the gambler has failed to pick a selection which was placed then the bet is over. If a selection is placed, then the bet continues, and the winnings are transferred as the stake on the second race. In this example, horse 2 may be placed and horse 7 unplaced, which means the bet continues – but there are now only 6 valid combinations for winning left.\n\nIf the gambler is lucky and managed to get through to the end, then the Tote will calculate the dividend for a £1 unit stake. In this example the Tote is going to declare the dividend as £30, and the lucky gambler has 2 winning combinations. Two combinations at a stake level of 20p is 40p, so 40% of £30 is £12, a profit of £9.60.\n\nIf a favourite is placed in every single race the Placepot payout is typically as low as it can get, and it could be anywhere from £3 to £15, although anything less than £6–£7 is quite unusual. If favourites fail to finish in the places for half of the races then something around the £40–£200 could be anticipated, placepots of over £25,000 have been known but they are extremely uncommon. However, there isn't a science to guessing what the placepot might be, the placepot dividend is the calculation of the number of tickets left divided by the pool money.\n\nThere are a couple of additional rules which affect the operation of the Placepot (and indeed the Quadpot/Jackpot/Scoop6). If a selection becomes a non-runner it will be replaced by the Starting Price favourite. Where there are joint favourites and the gambler has selected to roll on the Favourite, then the horse with the lowest race card number will be taken. If the favourite withdraws (for instance, the horse refuses to enter its starting gate) and the market has no time to select a new favourite the horse with the next shortest odds will become the favourite. It's rare for a race card to progress without a couple of non-runners so a gambler will be affected by these rules from time to time.\n\nThe Tote Jackpot is a bet where you have to pick the first 6 winners at a meeting nominated by The Tote. The bet is available every day of the week. The minimum stake is £1 and multiples are in multiples of 50p. Typically the payouts are very good for the Jackpot as it is very difficult to pick six winners in a row. The betting pool will roll into the next Jackpot event if there is no dividend to pay.\n\nSimilar to the Tote Jackpot, Tote Scoop6 is run on Saturdays and occasionally on other days such as Boxing Day, and has been branded this way for television audiences, generally Scoop6 races are shown on terrestrial television in the UK. The stake for one line is £2, as opposed to a minimum 50p in the case of the Jackpot. As the pool will roll-over in the event of there being no dividends to pay the pool can become very large and wins in excess of £500,000 have been known. There is also a bonus fund whereby the winner of a Scoop6 event can attempt to pick the winner of the most difficult race in next week's Scoop6. This bet is also a Placepot bet, as the Tote also payout a dividend for selecting a horse to be placed in each race. According to the Tote, the average dividend is over £500 for a winning place line.\n\nThere is a major operational difference to this bet as compared to the Jackpot/Placepot/Quadpot: the six races on the Scoop6 card are nominated by the Tote from any of the race meetings on that day, typically the Scoop6 card will have a number of very difficult races such as handicap races with over 20 horses running, and races with 2- or 3-year-olds where many horses have no track record, making it difficult to select a winner. It is also the reason why the placepot payouts are correspondingly higher than a normal placepot as well. The televised coverage usually announces how many Scoop6 tickets are left after each Scoop6 race, and it is quite common to be left with only three or four tickets after the first four races.\n\nAs with other Tote bets, non-syndicated bookmakers will normally accept a Tote bet and pay out in line with the Tote dividend.\n\nThis is a single-race exotic bet available on all races of six or more runners at every meeting, every day, players have to pick two horses to finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd in any order.\n\nEach bet offers three chances to win as follows:\n\nA different dividend is declared for each outcome.\n\nThe minimum unit stake for a toteswinger bet is 10p (shops and online). Minimum unit stake on-course is 50p with minimum total spend £2 as per all totepool on-course bets. Toteswinger is unique to the tote; there is no other equivalent fixed odds or SP bet.\n\nThis is an extremely popular bet in overseas racing markets, particularly South Africa where it accounts for 40% of pool turnover.\n\n"}
{"id": "8753457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8753457", "title": "Turnip Prize", "text": "Turnip Prize\n\nThe Turnip Prize is a spoof UK award satirising the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize by rewarding deliberately bad modern art. It was started as a joke in 1999, but gained national media attention and inspired similar prizes. Credit is given for entries containing bad puns as titles, displaying \"lack of effort\" or \"is it shit?\". Conversely, entries with \"too much effort\" or \"not shit enough\" are immediately disqualified. The first prize is a turnip nailed to a block of wood.\n\nThe prize (now awarded in the New Inn) was conceived in 1999 by management and regulars of The George Hotel, Wedmore, Somerset, after the exhibition of Tracey Emin's \"My Bed\" was shortlisted for the Turner Prize. It is organised by Trevor Prideaux and was announced thus: \"The Turnip Prize is a crap art competition ... You can enter anything you like, but it must be rubbish.\" The competition is based on the supposition, \"We know it's rubbish, but is it art?\". Competitors submitted entries of ridiculous objects posing as contemporary art, mostly made from junk titled with spoofs or puns. The prize is a turnip impaled on a rusty six-inch nail.\n\nIn May 2000, the nominees appeared on the BBC TV \"Esther\" show, presented by Esther Rantzen and featured by national and international media.\n\nIn 2001, the competition was held in the public conveniences in Wedmore.\n\nIn 2002, the \"Monster Raving Loony Party\" attempted to hijack the competition at The Trotter, Crickham, Wedmore.\n\nIn 2003, the winner was James Timms with \"Take a Leaf out of My Chook\", an exhibit of a raw chicken stuffed with leaves. James Timms subsequently appeared on BBC Radio Scotland's \"Fred MacAulay Show\" with Ed Byrne.\n\nIn 2005, Ian Osenthroat, a 69-year-old former photocopier salesman, won with the exhibit \"Birds Flew\", a bird's nest with a flu remedy box. He commented satirically, \"I have entered this most coveted art award on several occasions and I really feel that the lack of effort this year has really paid off.\"\n\nWinner in 2006 was Ian Lewis with the exhibit \"Torn Beef\", an empty corned beef can. He stated, \"The work took no time at all to create.\" Trevor Prideaux commented, \"I believe that over the last seven years the bad artists of Wedmore and surrounding areas have created far better works than Nicholas Serota and The Tate Britain Gallery could ever wish to exhibit.\" Also in 2006, the BBC's Chief Somerset Correspondent, Clinton Rogers, was immortalised as \"Clint on a Row of Jars\".\n\nIn 2007, the competition gained more publicity with the entry of artwork with the title \"By the Banksea\". The painting bears a striking resemblance to work by the famous Bristol graffiti artist Banksy, and its origins are likewise a closely guarded secret. \"By the Banksea\" portrays a seaside Aunt Sally in the form of a stencil of the \"Mona Lisa\", but in true Banksy style, Mona Lisa is depicted holding a rocket launcher firing a turnip over the wreckage of a seaside pier and an emergency exit sign. Competition organiser Trevor Prideaux commented: \"It does seem to be in Banksy's style. But someone has thought too much about this one and tried too hard. So for that reason it's not likely to win.\" The piece was duly disqualified for \"too much effort, and not shit enough.\" The 2007 competition was won by Bracey Vermin with \"Tea P\", a group of used tea bags in the shape of a letter P.\n\nCompetition entries for 2010 included \"Ivor Crush\"s clothes hanger linking the letter U in \"Crush\", entitled \"Hung up on You\", and an entry by Banksy, which focused on the recent student protests of the day.\n\nEntries for 2011 included a piece of cheese carved into the letter E, entitled \"CheeseE\", \"A fish full of dollars\", and an exhibit of an Action Man toy – called \"First Class Mail\" – with a carefully placed stamp, and a coloured rock called \"Half a Stone Lighter\". This year's prize featured on the BBC's \"Have I Got News For You\" for two weeks running.\n\n2012 – 87 entries.\n\n2013 – 69 entries, which included entries from Ireland, Italy, Paris, and the USA.\n\n2014 – 69 entries, which included entries from Canada, USA, Germany, and Italy.\n\n2015 – 69 entries, which included entries from France, Czech Republic, Norway and Macedonia.\n\n2016 – 99 entries, which included entries from Brisbane, Australia (delivered by hand), Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Lundy.\n\n2017 – 100 entries, which included entries from Guernsey and Germany.\n\n\"This list is nearly complete\"\n\n\nMany independent \"Turnip Prize\" competitions are now held around the world, with differing rules made up by those who are running the competitions. Competitions generally aspire to concept, \"We know it's rubbish, but is it art?\" and competitors submit entries made from junk with titles that are nonsensical or puns. Marks are awarded for amusement and lack of effort, and competitors are frequently disqualified for applying too much effort. In 2001, \"The Sun\" tabloid newspaper featured its own Turnip Prize.\n\nIn 2002 \"The Turnip Award\" was opened annually for students at Edinburgh College of Art to \"carve or design something out of the humble vegetable\". The 2005 prize was a mountain bike. In 2005 a Turnip Prize was staged at St Paul's Gallery in Tower Hamlets, London, for local residents.\n\nThe term was previously used in 1998 by YBA Jake Chapman of the Chapman Brothers (2003 Turner Prize nominees): \"We thought if we couldn't get the Turner Prize we should get the Turnip Prize.\"\n\n\n"}

His uncle was William Saurin, Attorney-General for Ireland. The Saurin family was partly of French Hugenot extraction. Another of his uncles was James Saurin, Bishop of Dromore. At the age of 13, Lyster, after an illness, was sent on a voyage round the world and visited Sydney and Melbourne in 1842. After his return to England he went to India, intending to become a planter, but, the climate not suiting him, he again returned to England. In 1847 he was in South Africa and fought in the 7th Cape Frontier War, and a year later was in the United States where he tried his fortunes as an actor with little success.\n\nIn 1855 Lyster was a member of General Walker's expedition to Nicaragua with the rank of captain. About two years later he formed an opera company which included Madame Lucy Escott, Henry Squires, and Miss Georgia Hodson whom he married. This company had some success in the western states of America, and in 1861 Lyster brought it to Australia. For about seven years it gave performances of the operas of Italian, German, French and English composers, including \"Don Giovanni\" in 1861, and the \"Les Huguenots\" in 1862. Other companies were brought out in later years, and at times comic opera was alternated with grand opera. His opera company gave 1,459 performances between 1861 and 1869.\n\nClassic operas like \"Lohengrin\", opened 18 August 1877, and \"Tannhäuser\" in 1878, were box office failures, although the company had included a distinguished singer, Antoinetta Link. Lyster, however, made the lighter operas bear the cost of others which were artistic successes only. Among other singers brought out by Lyster were Signor Pietro Paladini and Madame , grandmother of Frances Alda. The Australian tenor, Armes Beaumont joined his company in 1870. Among concert artists introduced to Australia were pianists Arabella Goddard and Henry Ketten, and Jules Levy, a well-known English cornet player of the period. Lyster's companies toured the principal cities of Australia and New Zealand, but for the last seven years of his life he made the Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne his headquarters. Though most renowned for his productions of operas, he was interested also in the drama, and seasons were played at the opera house by the distinguished actress Madame Ristori, and by good comedy companies.\n\nLyster fell into bad health about 1877 and never fully recovered. He died in Melbourne on 27 November 1880 and was survived by his wife, there were no children. Lyster was buried in the Anglican section of the Melbourne General Cemetery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58413453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58413453", "title": "Yaogu", "text": "Yaogu\n\nThe Yaogu is a traditional instrument in China. it is known as the symbolic of Chinese musical drums. It has unique performing forms as well as traditional customs, and it contributes to Chinese culture since it was created.\n\nThe Yaogu is a traditional instrument in China. In Chinese, the word “yao” means the waist of a human and “gu” refers to the drum. Different from other percussion instruments, especially other drums, the Yaogu is not only played using hands and arms, but is played using the whole body, driven by specific dance movements. Just as its name implies, the Yaogu is a type of Chinese musical drum, which is played on people’s waists, using hands or by holding two wood-made sticks. The Yaogu is tied by a piece of long red silk ribbon which wraps around one side of the shoulders and waist. It is in the shape of a short cylinder and it looks like a hourglass, and the ends of the two sides are slightly smaller than the middle section. In general, the drum is approximately 34 cm in length.\n\nAccording to relevant data records, in ancient times, in the Yellow River valley, the male in every tribe used the sheepskins to wrap around the trunk of a tree and carried around the waist, in order to threaten the beasts and drive them away from the tribes.\n\nThe first percussion instrument originated four thousand years ago in China. It was in Shang Dynasty, which was defined by a neolithic time. During this period, percussion instruments including drums were widely used in celebration of Dynasty and the conflicts between vibes. Drums are the symbol of spirit and power, represent the universe, which are the materials to show authority.\n\nThe most well-known waist drum around world is the culture of the Ansai Yaogu in northern Shanxi province, northwest China. Ansai is known as \"the hometown of drums\". The historical reason for the origin of the name of \"Ansai' in Chinese is its meaning of the ambition to settle the frontier and remain stable and safe. Therefore, the Ansai Yaogu is an auspicious sign to Shanxi citizens.\n\nDating back to Qing and Han Dynasties, the Yaogu was a significant tool to send signals for frontier guards, in order to inform their leaders that the foreign enemies were approaching towards the edge of territory. If the leaders heard the sound of the Yaogu from the frontier, it was the time to prepare weapons for the coming battle. Moreover, once the war began and two armies fought against each other, the Yaogu played the role of encouraging soldiers to keep up high morale. Besides the warning and encouraging roles, the Yaogu was also played to celebrate the victory when soldiers won the war. With the passage of time, the Yaogu became a type of instrument with the folk customs and popularity among plain citizens. People played the Yaogu if there was a great harvest of crops and festival celebration. It is believed that the sound of the Yaogu brings luck to local areas when they were praying.\n\nAt the beginning of 20 century, the yaogu was combined with dance when the peasants were working in the fields. For the original motivation, in order to recover from fatigue as well as boredom, peasants in northwest of China developed a dance named \"Yangko\" from the fieldwork. Yangko, named Yangge as well, is a popular rural folk dance today. Back then, the peasants noticed that they were just simply dancing without sounds, thus, they played the Yaogu together with Yangko. This mode of dancing and the combination of the Yaogu was made for entertaining the peasants and praying for the harvest of crops.\n\n\nThe Yaogu is widely used in Chinese traditional sacrificial ceremony. Especially peasants pray to the gods for protection and rains. Once it is approaching to Autumn, the local percussion team usually start to prepare for the event of blessing a good harvest. Two head leaders guide the whole team towards the blessing destination, dancing with the dance movements and the roll of drums. Identically, when the new year begins, the Yaogu teams contribute their performance to pray for world peace and prosperity. In local traditions in, the family hosts in Shanxi believe that the drumbeats given out by the team emblems the elimination of disasters and unfortunates. If two Yaogu team meets on the road, the thing happens more often is that two teams will intend to start a battle. The battle is made up of singing in antiphonal style part and playing drumbeats in improvisation. The way to determine a win or a loss of this battle is to look at who is the first one to stop singing or whose drum team is in disarray. The team which lose the battle will show their respect and leave the road for the winner. The existence of battle aims to raise the culmination of their performing atmosphere by competing skills, which reflects the sprits of competition for Shanxi people.\n\n\nThere are two main types of performing strategies of the Yaogu: one is \"Wengu\", which means that the performers twist theirselves heavily and hit lightly; on the contrary, another one is \"Wugu\", performers hit heavily and twist lightly. \"Wengu\" trends to show the vivacity of the Yaogu and it is similar to \"Yangko\". Inversely, \"Wugu\" focus on power and the integration with Chinese acrobatic fighting movements, which preaches passion. The Yaogu has organically formed a mixture of waist drum, dance, percussion music, folk song and Wushu (martial arts in China, such as shadow-boxing, swordplay etc.). The combination of Chinese traditional features impels the influence of the Yaogu to spread it culture worldwide.\n\nIn adddition, the Yaogu has two performing forms including \"Lugu (road drum)\" and \"Changdigu (court drum)\". \"Lugu\" is a form that a long team of players walk and do the hitting in the street. The team has two head leaders in the front to navigate the passing road, following a major director who controls the rhythm and speed of the whole group and make sure the quality of this show. Performers ususally have their own characters to set the personal dance movement and the Yaogu actions. For \"Court Drum\", it refers to a form that performance begins in a specific place. To begin with, two head leaders give out \"starting\" commands when they are ready. Dancers move with the Yaogu, and the movements are aiming to warm up the court in order to attract audience's attention. Moving to the second part, folk music and percussion actions are to connect while others dancing and singing beside the group. This part is large-scale for that performers are doing more complex steps than that in first part before. Once the sound of the Yaogu and music stops, participants will call out words of blessing for health, family and crops. After that, the Yaogu activity moves to the final part, which is the most challenging section for the performers. They have to do as many as they can to show the charm of waist drum and their individual talent. It is the most difficult but would reaches the climax of the whole show.\n\nMoreover, the Yaogu can also play a leading part in a performance by standing in front of an orchestra.\n\nAs its performance indicates, the Yaogu has a strong artistic shock with its unique style, moving charm, colourful movements and strong image. It is said that the Yaogu makes people feel passionate and looks refreshed. The artistic image of \"beauty\" and \"power\" reflected by it fully reproduces the spirit of the times and the image of the nation, and is an indispensable part of the culture of the Yellow River Basin.\n\nGenerally, the Yaogu not only can be performed by less than ten people, but also sometimes played by a large number of hundreds of people. Waist drum pays attention to collective, grand and magnificent momentum. Individuals in the Yaogu team has their own characters during the performance.\n\nThe Yaogu opened a channel for traditional Chinese percussion instruments. For a long time ago, the Yaogu has been integrated into Shaanxi local culture and Chinese national culture and it has become the benchmark and symbol in the history of Chinese music culture.\n\nFrom the personal and local aspects, the Yaogu illustrates the simple and unconstrained character of the farmers in the northwest loess plateau and the unique artistic personality. Furthermore, its performance form expresses the collective spirit of the Shanxi people and good wishes for life.\n\nFrom the social aspects, the value of the Yaogu is reflected in the fact that it represents Shaanxi Province and even China to play a significant role in propaganda on the world cultural stage. As its highly spiritual status, on May 20 in 2006, the Ansai Yaogu was approved by the state council to be included in the first batch of national intangible cultural heritage list.\n"}
