{"id": "47282762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47282762", "title": "AdVenture Capitalist", "text": "AdVenture Capitalist\n\nAdVenture Capitalist is a free-to-play incremental video game developed and published by Hyper Hippo Productions. It was first released for Browsers and Android in 2014, for iOS (published by Kongregate), Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in 2015, and for PlayStation 4 in 2016. \"AdVenture Capitalist\" allows players to live like a capitalist and invest funds into certain products to generate revenue, by starting out with a single lemonade stand. The more revenue generated, the higher the player's cash is. A player can receive an angel bonus when resetting their progress, which provides a boost in all products' revenue for the next progress timeline. New areas of business have been added since the game's release, allowing the purchase of property on the Moon and Mars. A spin-off, \"AdVenture Communist\", was released on Steam as early access on August 10, 2016, with the completed game being released on iOS and Android on November 16, 2017.\n\nThere are three areas: Earth, Moon, and Mars. The player starts out on Earth with a single investment: a lemonade stand. Tapping it rewards money over time. When enough money is earned, more stands can be bought. Saving up allows the purchase of different investments at the cost of more time until payout. Once managers are hired for investments, they will run automatically, allowing successful idle play, even when offline. Upgrades can be bought to add multipliers to any investment.\n\nWhen the player reaches 1 trillion dollars on Earth, they can start investing in a new area. Once invested in, an area will unlock in 72 hours, but the process can be sped up using video advertisements, angel investors/mega bucks, or gold. Gold can be bought via in-app purchase with real money and can be used for purposes such as gaining angel investors without resetting, instantly earning money for a day's worth of idling, and more. Mega Bucks are bought starting at 1 decillion of an area's currency, and their price is multiplied upon purchase by a fixed increment (the game describes this as inflation). When the player has 10 Mega Bucks, they can purchase a golden ticket, which when used on a single investment boosts its profits permanently by ×7.77. After one has boosted a whole planet, they will gain an additional ×10 boost, which adds (not multiplies) to a ×17.77 multiplier. This multiplier can be upgraded further using Mega Bucks.\n\nSince October 2015, players can also play a limited-time special event, usually around holidays and other annual events, such as Halloween or Black Friday. They occur once per month for several days. These events are themed like the three areas, having their own set of businesses and upgrades, but are only available during that their event. If a player reaches at least one of the objectives of that event, they will get a badge shown in the Swag & Stats page. As the player progresses in some events, they may acquire free gold or Mega Bucks based on unlocks, even a special badge that provides investment specific boosts when equipped. The events recycle, so if a player has missed a passed event, they will have a second opportunity to complete the tasks. Generally, these events last anywhere from three days to a week.\n\nSince \"The Love Of Money\" update, the 'Swag & Stats' section was renamed 'Career', along with the option for the player to make their character female.\n\n\"AdVenture Capitalist\" received mostly negative or mixed reviews from critics. Pocket Gamer criticized the game for giving little reward for progress, and stated that the achievements were dull. The review also found the in-app purchases to be too expensive, calling the game \"a pointless waste of time\" and \"not much of an adventure.\" A review from 148Apps had similar opinions, calling the game \"upbeat\" but \"a waste of time.\"\n\n\"AdVenture Communist\" is the sequel of \"AdVenture Capitalist\", and was released on Steam on Aug 10, 2016. The goal of the game is to manage a communist state and buy different productions that produce resources. Specifically, there are five industries that all act as a different currency: Potato, Land, Ore, Military, and Placebo. The game currently has over five million installations on all platforms.\n\n\"Adventure Communist\" has received generally positive reviews, but has been criticized for being too similar to its predecessor and an excessive use of microtransactions. \"Edamame Reviews\" gave the game 8.8 out of 10, labeling it as \"awesome\". As of December 2, 2018, the recent reviews for the game on Steam indicate it as mostly positive.\n"}

Film historians have said \"the scale and blatant progpaganda of [the film]... made it the least typical of Longford's thirty narrative films\".\n\nThe film begins with a prologue, 'The Warning', showing a Sydney horse race, then a football match in front of thousands of spectators. Living on an outback station, Beatrice Evans (Lottie Lyell) rejects the advances of a suitor. An unnamed Asian country lands 20,000 troops (called \"Mongolians\") on the New South Wales coast, and Australia issues a call to arms, mobilising its forces. The invading army attacks Sydney, setting buildings on fire and taking over the Min, Treasury Building and wireless telegraph station. The rejected suitor turns traitor and Beatrice is captured by the enemy. However she is rescued by plane with the help of aviator William E. Hart and the Australians are victorious.\n\nA contemporary review said \"the synopsis contains scenes of Australians at play, at the races, at football, the call to arms, the burning of Sydney, the enemy in possession, Australian mobilising, the capture of the wireless station, treachery, in the hands of the enemy, Australian bushmen rallying, tapping the overhead telegraph wires, the charge of the lancers, and ride for life, William E. Hart (Australia's aviator) to the rescue.\"\n\n\nThe movie was written by two journalists from the magazine \"The Bulletin\" and sought to exploit Australia's fear of the Yellow Peril. Filming was done with the assistance of the Australian Defence Department and took over a year to complete, including model work to convey the burning of Sydney.\n\nThe cast includes early Australian aviator William Edward Hart, who made the first cross-country flight in New South Wales, and later tenor Alfred O'Shea. Ernest Higgins shot some aerial photography for the film on a flight with Hart. Scenes involving Hart were shot at Richmond.\n\n"}

The toy can be flipped and twirled around the fingers to perform tricks. Begleri originated in Greece, and originally derived from the Greek rosary or komboloi, which serve the function of worry beads, and are often flipped around to pass the time or keep the hands busy. While komboloi have beads forming a closed circle, begleri beads are threaded on an open strand, usually in a symmetrical formation, with equal weighting at either end. Begleri come in many forms, consisting of semi-precious stone or metal beads. They can be similar in form to the percussion instrument kashaka, but are much smaller in size.\n\nHistorically, begleri was associated with the Greek mangas subculture, and the rebetiko style of music, popular until the 1960s. In recent years, begleri has grown in popularity outside of Greece, as a skill toy and everyday carry item. This has led to a proliferation of begleri designs and styles, using all manner of modern materials. The recent uptick in interest among collectors and skill toy enthusiasts dates back to at least the early 2010s, when it began gaining popularity on hobbyist sites. As the popularity grew in online forums and social media, different styles of play began to emerge. A wide range of different styles of play and categories of tricks have developed, many of which can only be performed with relatively long-stringed begleri, termed \"long game\" by enthusiasts.\n\nModern begleri as a skill toy has gained popularity with many people across the world. Due to the nature of play, begleri have shifted from the traditional ornate beads to simpler performance oriented beads. Two common begleri types are monkey-fist \"beads\", and solid type beads. Monkey-fist begleri are commonly made by people beginning to practice \"slinging\" the common term for begleri manipulation. Solid type beads are becoming more and more common, and there a few companies that are developing new geometries of beads based on feedback from consumers.\n\nAxel Schönberg, a character in John M. Green's thriller, The Trusted, is almost always twirling a set of gold begleri in his fingers.\n"}
{"id": "28643681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28643681", "title": "Bhand", "text": "Bhand\n\nBahānds (Devanagari: भांड, Urdu: بھانڈ, Gurmukhi: ਭਾਂਡ) are the traditional folk entertainers of India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. In India and Nepal, the Bahand are now an endogamous Muslim community, which is no longer involved in their traditional occupation of folk entertainment. They include actors, dancers, minstrels, storytellers and impressionists.\n\nPayment for performances is usually voluntary: often, one performer goes around the audience collecting money on a \"pay-what-you-can\" basis while the others continue to perform. While most \"bahands\" belong to families that are engaged in folk entertainment as their hereditary profession, their specific art forms vary greatly by region, community and language. The term \"bahand\" itself can also mean both a specific dramatic story or an entire form/school of drama.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the Bahand are an endogamous Muslim community. Their ancestors were employed at the court of the various local rulers as folk entertainers, in particular at the court of the Nawabs of Awadh. Most Bahand in Uttar Pradesh are no longer involved with folk entertainment. What now binds the community is a sense of stigma attached to the community on account of their ancestral occupation. They are now mainly involved in wage labour; many Lucknow city are rickshaw puller. Little is known about the origin of this community, other than that their ancestors were \"bahands\". The community has been granted Other Backward Class status, which gives the community some benefits with regards reservation in public sector jobs. They are Sunni Muslims, and speak Urdu, and rarely dialects of Hindi. The Naqqal sub-group has done better, and now prefer the self-designation Kashmiri Shaikh. They are now a community of successful businessmen.\n\n\"Bahand Pather\" is a \"bahand\" of the Kashmir region in which stories commemorating the lives of \"reshis\" (Sufi Sages, both Hindus and Muslims) or more contemporary real or fictional figures are enacted. The storylines (or \"pathers\") are often humorous and satirical, and farce is an essential component of the plays.\n\n\"Naqal\" (mimicry) is a strong \"bahand\" tradition in the Punjab region. The \"naqalchi\" (mimic, sometimes called the \"bahrupiya\") adopts the persona of a well-known person or character and improvises, using satire and farce extensively, to entertain the audience.\n\nThe \"ustad-jamoora\" format (\"ustad\" means master in Hindustani, while \"jamoora\" is an assistant or follower who is usually younger than the \"ustad\") is a popular one in Hindi-speaking regions and involves only two \"bhand\" actors. Usually, the storylines consist of the \"ustad\" tutoring the \"jamoora\" to do or say something, and the \"jamoora\" responding with mechanical obedience with a subtle variation thrown in that creates a strong comical or satirical effect.\n\n"}
{"id": "32545505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32545505", "title": "Bill Cosby in advertising", "text": "Bill Cosby in advertising\n\nAmerican comedian Bill Cosby was a popular spokesperson for advertising from the 1960sbefore his first starring television roleuntil the early 2000s. He started with White Owl cigars, and later endorsed Jell-O pudding and gelatin, Coca-Cola (including New Coke), Texas Instruments, E. F. Hutton & Co., Kodak, and the 1990 United States Census. , Cosby held the record for being the longest-serving celebrity spokesperson for a product, through his work with Jell-O. In 2011, he won the President's Award for Contributions to Advertising from the Advertising Hall of Fame.\n\nCosby was one of the first black people to appear in the United States as an advertising spokesperson. He was known for his appeal to white consumers in the second half of the 20th century, in an industry seen as slow to accept diversity. In spite of making contradictory soft drink pitches and endorsing a disgraced financial company, he continued to be considered effective and believable. In the 1980s, studies found Cosby the \"most familiar\" and \"most persuasive\" spokesperson, to the point where Cosby attributed his wealth to these contracts, as opposed to his television series. However, in 2014, allegations of sexual assault significantly damaged Cosby's public image; public opinion polling following the news placed him near the bottom of a list of 3,000 personalities, when rated on trust and effectiveness.\n\nPublic opinion of him dropped substantially in 2014, by many sexual assault accusations, the earliest of which dates back decades. More than 60 women accused him of rape, drug-facilitated sexual assault, sexual battery, child sexual abuse, and sexual misconduct, although the statute of limitations had by then expired in nearly all cases. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault in April 2018, and sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison in September 2018.\n\nAnthony Tortorici, director of public relations at Coca-Cola, told \"Black Enterprise\" magazine in 1981 that the \"three most believable personalities are God, Walter Cronkite, and Bill Cosby.\" At the peak of his advertising career in the mid-1980s, Cosby had a Q Score of 70, meaning that 70 percent of those responding to a survey of 1,000 United States residents thought highly of him, thus deeming him the most familiar and persuasive endorser. In 2003, industry publication \"Advertising Age\" said that \"during [Cosby's] 14-year reign over the ad industry's public approval index [he had only been surpassed by] the Pope. In 2012, the separate Celebrity DBI index listed Cosby as second most-trusted celebrity on a list of celebrities people pay attention to on television, behind Morgan Freeman.\n\nProfessionally, Coca-Cola advertising director John Bergin considered Cosby the company's \"greatest weapon\"; he said, \"magic happens when the camera starts.\" His enthusiasm was tempered on a personal level, finding him \"inconceivably arrogant\" and mentioned \"blow-ups\" on the set.\n\nOne biographer of Cosby, Linda Etkin, said, \"Cosby comes across as a father figure, a teacher, and a friend\" in his advertisements. William Turner, in 1982 the marketing manager for Texas Instruments' consumer products group, said Cosby \"represents comfort, and people trust him\". In 2014, one educator asked for comment said he remembered Cosby as a \"black male authority figure, one of those people who folks that don't live on the edges of the country think of as a good black guy; they trust that guy\".\nIn 1988, a representative for Kodak said Cosby had become \"synonymous with quality products and quality services\". \"Ebony\" agreed, saying Cosby has the advantage of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, \"if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what I think I do better than anybody\".\n\nAn article in \"Black Enterprise\" said part of Cosby's mystique is \"that he can endorse a number of products and still retain credibility in each individual sell\". Shortly after being signed by Coca-Cola, Cosby appeared at a bottlers' convention. He refused to drink the bottle of Coke he carried on stage, saying, \"I'm waiting for all the Jell-O pudding I ate to settle\". Cosby said that in childhood, he experienced \"periods of addiction\" to Coca Cola, consuming fifteen bottles by 2 pm.\n\nThe American advertising industry was initially reluctant to use black spokespeople for fear of angering white customers. \"The Nat King Cole Show\" (1956-1957), the first nationally syndicated U.S. television series to be hosted by an African American, never found a national sponsor; after its cancellation Cole said, \"Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark\".\n\nCosby's first advertisement was for White Owl cigars. His agent approached them in 1965, before the debut of \"I Spy\", but after several appearances on the late-night talk program \"The Tonight Show\", a signifier of success in American comedy. He told agent Norman Brokaw of William Morris Agency that he liked their tagline, \"We're going to get you.\" Cosby later said there were no commercials \"with a black person holding something, buying a product, so the absence of pictures, in retrospect, said a lot\". Despite the stigma among advertisers around using a black spokesperson, sales of the product rose. According to an entry in \"Ad Age Encyclopedia\", the public acceptance of Cosby and Robert Culp appearing as equals on \"I Spy\" made it possible for advertisers to show black people and white people together in their commercials.\n\n\"The Bill Cosby Radio Program\", which debuted in 1968, was sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. The series was syndicated to over 200 radio stations by McCann Erickson, Coca-Cola's advertising agency.\n\nIn 1974, Cosby began promoting Jell-O pudding for General Foods. Cosby said comedian Jack Benny, whose program the brand sponsored, was the only previous spokesman for Jell-O, but Kate Smith, Lucille Ball, and Andy Griffith have also pitched the brand. In previous campaigns since the brand's launch in 1902, it was targeted towards parents rather than to children, a practice from which the company departed in 2001. Cosby's early commercials were unscripted, but later were written by comedy writers. Cosby disagreed with the writers, who wanted to say the food was for when you were \"hungry\"; Cosby thought there was not enough substance to satisfy hunger and wanted to use the word \"appetite\". In 1979, General Foods introduced Pudding Pops, the company's first frozen dessert product. With Cosby as spokesperson, it sold US$100 million its first year. After introducing Gelatin Pops and frozen Fruit Bars, the company's frozen desserts sales reached $300 million. Cosby was engaged to promote the flagging Jell-O gelatin product line in the mid-1980s, when General Foods introduced a holdable Jell-O product called \"Jigglers\". Sales increased seven percent during the first year of the promotion.\nCosby appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola's 1979 campaign, \"Have a Coke and a Smile,\" and made a guest appearance at the Great Get-Together, a major bottlers' convention held that year. This campaign continued into 1981.\n\nHis work in this decade was well received. \"Advertising Age\" named Cosby the top advertising personality of 1978. In 1999, \"Advertising Age\" magazine named Cosby's 1975 Jell-O commercials, which they called \"Bill Cosby with kids\", the 92nd best advertising campaign of all time.\n\n\"Black Enterprise\" magazine found that Cosby was one of only a very few African Americans who could command among the highest fees paid for advertising spokespeople. The 1981 feature also highlighted how rare it was for African Americans to be hired for a complete campaign, as opposed to a single advertisement, despite an overall increase in opportunities. Cosby's agents told the magazine he had earned at least $3 million in current advertising contractsabout one-fifth of his incomethe rest of which he earned from live performances.\n\nCosby returned as Coca-Cola's spokesperson in its 1982 \"Coke Is It\" campaign, a series of commercials mocking the Pepsi Challenge. One advertisement in this series showed a Pepsi vending machine to mock the brand, which author Mark Pendergrast called \"unthinkable\". Another said Pepsi Challenge commercials were misleading because they never showed anyone choosing Coke. John Bergin, who directed the series of commercials, personally disliked Cosby but said his presence in Coca-Cola advertising ended the first Pepsi Challenge campaign in 1983.\n\nIn mid-1982, Cosby was hired by Texas Instruments to appear in television advertisements for the company's TI-99/4A home computer. He was to be paid $1 million a year for the campaign. \n\nAt the height of the Cola Wars, marketer Sergio Zyman persuaded Coca-Cola executives to create and air commercials with Cosby praising Coke for being less sweet than Pepsi, which was aired only in areas where sales of Pepsi were dominant. One commercial from the series features Cosby \"rubberfacing an icky frown\" and describing Pepsi as \"gooey\". These advertisements were broadcast from October 1984; Coca-Cola's independently owned bottlers demanded the commercials were run in their markets as well. Zyman said despite the upcoming contradiction, the ads were the first boost to Coke's image in years. Coca-Cola was simultaneously testing possible new variations of its soft drink and decided it would sell more product if it used a sweeter formula. Once New Coke was launched, Pepsi prepared its public response to the change; among its talking points for journalists writing about New Coke was to \"Ask them about those Bill Cosby ads\". One of a new series of Coke advertisements showed Cosby dressed in a toga; this campaign was described as unconvincing. Coca-Cola faced a widespread public backlash, internal dissent, and ultimately the original drink recipe returned as \"Coca-Cola Classic\". In the days following the reversal, an editorial cartoon featured Cosby pouring a can of Pepsi into a can of Coke. Marcio Moreira, a McCann Erickson creative executive behind the New Coke introduction, said in 2011 that the decision to hire Cosby was not made until other commercials were being edited.\n\n\"The Cosby Show\" debuted in 1984, becoming \"TV's biggest hit in the 1980s\" and reviving both the sitcom genre and NBC. Before the series premiere, Cosby told reporters his income from commercials for Coke and Ford, as well as his Las Vegas shows, had made him financially secure. At some point before 1985, Cosby featured in advertisements for Bird's Eye frozen foods.\n\nIn 1986, Cosby's only contract was with Jell-O, but by the end of the year he had added two more endorsements. By August, Cosby began promoting E. F. Hutton & Co. with a series of print and television advertisements, and comedy concerts. The company had been accused of fraud and needed a spokesperson who was well-liked. Soon after Cosby's commercials aired, the company merged with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. In late December, he added J. Walter Thompson agency account Kodak Colorwatch System photographic processing system to his list. The estimated $10 million contract included commercials featuring Cosby to run in print, on television, as point of sale, and in promotional programs.\n\nCoca-Cola purchased Columbia Pictures in 1982. In 1987, Columbia decided revenues from its spy comedy \"Leonard Part 6\" (1987) would offset its losses on \"Ishtar\" (1987). Leading up to release, Columbia announced it would spend $12 million on \"synergies\" with the film, taking into account the success of Cosby's television series and record sales for his parenting book, \"Fatherhood\". Promotions included posters, spy cameras, point of sale standees of Cosby, and a contest to win Porsche cars. Cosby, who acted in and produced the film, was initially supportive of it, but close to the release date he publicly distanced himself from it. The film failed, with a net loss of $33 million.\n\nIn the 1980s, Cosby also appeared in public service announcements. To increase black participation in the 1990 United States Census, the bureau recruited Cosby, Magic Johnson, Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople.\n\nCosby continued to be a Jell-O spokesman through the 1990s. He was present for the lighting of the brand's first billboard in New York's Times Square in 1998. In 1999, Cosby's 25th year as spokesman for Jell-O, was also the final year he appeared in its advertising. The company distributed 120,000 copies of his picture book series, \"Little Bill\", into American public libraries. Despite the transitions of advertising agencies and the 1989 merger of General Foods into Kraft, Cosby remained with Jell-O. He appeared at the Utah State Senate in 2001 to designate Jell-O the official state snack, and made a promotional visit to the Jell-O Gallery in 2004. In 2010, Cosby returned to Jell-O as executive producer for the company's \"Hello Jell-O\" campaign. In return, the brand sponsored his weekly web show \"OBKB\", a children's interview series similar to \"Kids Say the Darndest Things\". As of 2002, Cosby's time with Jell-O was considered the longest-standing celebrity endorsement in American advertising history.\n\nIn the 1990s, Bill Cosby was also the spokesperson for Service Merchandise. \n\nAt the Advertising Hall of Fame induction ceremonies on March 30, 2011, Cosby was the first winner of the American Advertising Federation's President's Award for Contributions to Advertising, for special achievements in the field.\n\nIn 1973, \"The Village Voice\" writer Terry Guerin said Cosby was past his prime. Among the reasons, \"making spokesman commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He has evolved into a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been\". \"The Noble Cos,\" a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for \"The Nation\", was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, \"So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars ... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa ... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't understand my commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man can be just as money-hungry as a white man ... I'm proving that all men are brothers.\"\n\nIn 1981, Cosby told \"Black Enterprise\" magazine:\n\nIn October 2014, a stand-up comedy routine by Hannibal Buress, addressing allegations of rape against Cosby, went viral on YouTube. On November 10, Cosby posted a message requesting meme images, using a hashtag of #CosbyMeme, on his Twitter feed. Many of the images posted in response related to the allegations, which were fresh in the respondents' minds. After numerous women came forward as victims of Cosby's alleged actions, a television special and a series in development were cancelled. Cosby refused to address the situation; his lawyer said such actions would dignify \"decade-old, discredited\" allegations. Many media outlets commented on the way such actions clashed with his image as \"America's Dad\". One of the accusers felt nobody would believe her claims at the time of the alleged incident, given Cosby's status in advertising. Joan Tarshis told the media that Cosby was \"Mr America; Mr Jello, as I called him\".\n\nThe publicity surrounding the allegations had a drastic effect on Cosby's reputation, as seen in the following drop in his ratings. In March 2013, Cosby had a 76.3 rating on the Davie-Brown Index, a rating of the public perceptions of roughly 3500 personalities published by Omnicom Group company The Marketing Arm, placing him as the third most-trusted celebrity, behind Morgan Freeman and Dr. Mehmet Oz. By November 19, this had fallen to 57.1, placing him at either the 2,626th spot or 2615th, depending on the source. The same company's separate rating on who consumers view as an \"effective product spokesperson\" saw Cosby drop to 2,746th spot; at one point, he had been 5th. Awareness of Cosby increased from 63rd to 51st. The Marketing Arm warns about misinterpreting the ratings fall; it said 900 celebrities were within the margin of error for Cosby's rating. At the time of the accusations, E-Poll Market Research had not updated its scores; a Q Score for Cosby was not expected until 2015. The executive vice-president of Q Scores Co. said polling in the midst of a scandal would likely overstate the score's longterm effects. All three companies' scores are updated at different intervals, meaning they are not directly comparable. Jell-O was relatively unaffected on social media by allegations against Cosby. The brand was mentioned in one percent of posts about Cosby, which was considered low. Still, negative connections continued, including by rapper Eminem in a freestyle rap, and an article by \"Food Drink and Franchise\" magazine pointed out moments in commercials that were awkward in retrospect.\n\nThe numerous accusations of rape, drug facilitated sexual assault, sexual battery, child sexual abuse, and sexual misconduct spanned from 1965 to 2008 across ten U.S. states and one Canadian province.

Yaqub Kateb Razi by Blochet. He was a poet of the Ghaznavid court and died around 1078-1079. The language of the Borzu-nama is characteristics of texts of the 11th century. The story is versified in the same meter and style of Ferdowsi's Shahnama. The Borzu-nama is possibly the longest of the post Shahnama epic poems and includes material from Iranian national legends not used by Ferdowsi.\n\nThe story starts with Sohrab the son of Rostam. On his way from Turan to fight the Iranians he marries a woman named Shahru. Before leaving, he gives her a token to give to their unborn child. The child is named Borzu by Shahru and she raises him without disclosing his father's identity. The young Borzu is recruited into Afrasiab's, the King of Turan, army. Borzu eventually forces his mother to reveal his father's name. On finding that it was Sohrab, he sets off to battle Rostam to avenge his father's death. Afrasiab then sends him with an army to Iran, but Borzu is captured by Rostam's son Faramarz and taken to Sistan. Shahru is informed of Borzu's capture, and helps him escape. He is recaptured by Rostam, and not recognizing his grandfather, Borzu battles Rostam. His life is spared at the last minute when Shahru reveals their relationship. Borzu and Rostam embrace and Borzu joins the Iranian forces. Afrasiab learns of this and sends Susan-e Rameshgar, a musician and sorceress to capture Rostam and Borzu. Afrasiab arrives with his army and the epic takes up a long series of battles and adventures that include famous Iranian and Turanian heroes from the Shahnameh, along with Divs, Paris (fairies) and wizards. The tale concludes with the death of Borzu at the hands of a Div.\n\nThe Borzu-nama has not yet been published in a critical edition, but versions of the text have been included in the Shah Nama editions of both Turner Macan (pp. 2160–296) and Dabirsiāqi.\n\nFriedrich von Suhtschek, in a discussion of the Iranian sources of the Grail legend, claimed, but did not prove, that the Borzu Nama is the direct source of Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzifal.\n\n"}
{"id": "11988471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11988471", "title": "Boudoir photography", "text": "Boudoir photography\n\nBoudoir photography is a photographic style featuring intimate, romantic, and sometimes erotic images of its subjects in a photographic studio, bedroom or private dressing room environment, primarily intended for the private enjoyment of the subject and his or her romantic partners. It is distinct from glamour and art nude photography in that it is usually more suggestive rather than explicit in its approach to nudity and sexuality, features subjects who do not regularly model, and produces images that are not intended to be seen by a wide audience, but rather to remain under the control of the subject.\n\nNude or sexualized female forms have been a theme of photography since as early as 1840. Early erotic photography, such as French postcards from the late 19th and early 20th century, pin-up girls, and Hollywood culture have influenced the visual style of boudoir photography. Notable early boudoir photographers include Albert Arthur Allen, who photographed larger women against ornate backgrounds. \n\nBoudoir photography was popularised in the millennium with the arrival of digital photography. It became popular with women seeking to create a private collection of professional studio portraits. Boudoir photography dates from the mid-1980s onwards, and is characterized by the empowerment of its female subjects, who now are typically the photographer's direct clients rather than being hired models.\n\nIt is common for women to have boudoir photographs of themselves made as a gift to a partner, conventionally on the occasion of their engagement, marriage, or before an enforced separation such as a military deployment. In the United Kingdom it became popular for brides-to-be to commission photoshoots as a wedding gift for the groom. Boudoir photography is also sometimes given as a gift with the intention of re-affirming and encouraging the romance and sensuality between partners in a long-term relationship.\n\nIncreasingly, boudoir photography is seen as something that a person might do purely for their own enjoyment, for the pleasure and affirmation of seeing themselves as attractive, daring, sensual, and sexually-desirable.\n\nBoudoir photography encompasses a range of styles and moods. Named categories of boudoir photography include so-called \"naughty girl\", \"fun and giggles\", and \"provocative and sensual\", with varying degrees of explicitness and nudity.\n\nVisually the genre is characterized by diffuse high-key images that flatter the appearance of skin, short focal distances, and shallow depth of field, which together impart an intimate, \"dreamy\" mood. Other common styles include a low-key, deliberately grainy black-and-white, reflecting the influence of art nudes, early erotic photography, and film noir. Also common are poses and lighting setups intended to replicate the mood and appearance of classic pin-up photographs and paintings.\n\n"}

{"id": "2688507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2688507", "title": "DJ mixer", "text": "DJ mixer\n\nA DJ mixer is a type of audio mixing console used by Disc jockeys (DJs) to control and manipulate multiple audio signals. Some DJs use the mixer to make seamless transitions from one song to another when they are playing records at a dance club. Hip hop DJs and turntablists use the DJ mixer to play record players like a musical instrument and create new sounds. DJs in the disco, house music, electronic dance music and other dance-oriented genres use the mixer to make smooth transitions between different sound recordings as they are playing. The sources are typically record turntables, compact cassettes, CDJs, or DJ software on a laptop. DJ mixers allow the DJ to use headphones to preview the next song before playing it to the audience. Most low- to mid-priced DJ mixers can only accommodate two turntables or CD players, but some mixers (such as the ones used in larger nightclubs) can accommodate up to four turntables or CD players. DJs and turntablists in hip hop music and nu metal use DJ mixers to create beats, loops and \"scratching\" sound effects.\n\nDJ mixers are usually much smaller than other mixing consoles used in sound reinforcement systems and sound recording. Whereas a typical nightclub mixer will have 24 inputs and a professional recording studio's huge mixer may have 48, 72 or even 96 inputs, a typical DJ mixer may have only two to four inputs. The key feature that differentiates a DJ mixer from other types of larger audio mixers is the ability to redirect (\"cue\") the sounds of a non- playing source to headphones, so the DJ can find the desired part of a song or track and the presence of a crossfader, which allows an easier transition between two sources (or, for hip hop music turntablists, enables them to do scratching effects)..\n\nA crossfader has the same engineering design as fader, in that it is a sliding control, but unlike faders, which are usually vertical, crossfaders are usually horizontal. To understand the function of a crossfader, one can think of the crossfader in three key positions. For a DJ mixer that has two sound sources connected, such as two record turntables, when the crossfader is in the far left position, the mixer will output only turntable A's music. When the crossfader is in the far right position, the mixer will output only turntable B's music. When the crossfader is at its midpoint (which is always marked with a horizontal line), the mixer will output a blend of turntable A's music and turntable B's music. The other points along the crossfader's path produce different mixes of A and B.\n\nDJ mixers typically have phono preamplifiers to hook up turntables. The signal that comes directly out of a vinyl turntable is too weak to be amplified through a PA system. Before a turntable can be usable in a mix, it needs to be preamplified. DJ mixers are also used to create DJ mixes, which are recorded and sold. DJ mixers usually have equalization controls for bass and treble of each channel. Some 2010-era DJ mixers have onboard electronic or digital effects units such as echo or reverb. Some DJ mixers also feature a built-in USB sound card to connect to a computer running DJ software without requiring a separate sound card. DJ mixers typically have a microphone input, so that a microphone can be plugged into the mixer, enabling the DJ to announce songs or act as a master of ceremonies (MC) for an event. Some DJ mixers have a kill switch, which completely cuts out a channel, or, on some models, completely cut out a frequency band (e.g., all the bass).\n\nThe output from a DJ mixer is typically plugged into a sound reinforcement system or a PA system at a dance, rave, nightclub or similar venue or event. The sound reinforcement system consists of power amplifiers which amplify the signal to the level that can drive speaker enclosures, which since the 1980s typically include both full-range speakers and subwoofers for the deep bass sounds. If the DJ is performing a mix for a radio station or television station, the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the main audio console being used for the broadcast. If the DJ is performing a mix that is being recorded by a recording studio, the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the main audio console used for the recording, which is in turn plugged into the recording medium (audiotape, hard disk, etc.). In some cases, such as when a DJ is performing a set at a club for dancers that is also being simultaneously broadcast over the radio or television system or recorded for a music video or other show, the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the sound reinforcement system and into the main audio console being used for the broadcast and/or recording. At club sets, some DJs may use a monitor speaker to hear the house's main mix. This monitor speaker can have its volume increased or decreased by the DJ as needed.\n\nDJ mixers have an AC mains plug that is connected to the wall to supply electric power for the unit. Some DJ mixers can take batteries, which enables users to mix songs outside or away from electric power sources, with the output being plugged into a portable boom box or other battery-powered sound system. \nDJ mixing played a key role in the development of the African-American style of hip hop music. In hip hop music and occasionally in other genres that are influenced by hip hop (e.g., nu metal), the turntable is used as a musical instrument by DJs, who use turntables along with a DJ mixer to create unique rhythmic sounds and other sound effects. Manipulation of a record as part of the music, rather than for normal playback or mixing, is called turntablism. The basis of turntablism, and its best known technique, is \"scratching\", pioneered by Grand Wizzard Theodore. It was not until Herbie Hancock's \"Rockit\" in 1983 that the turntablism movement was recognized in popular music outside of a hip hop context. In the 2010s, many hip hop DJs use DJ CD players or digital record emulator devices to create scratching sounds; nevertheless, some DJs still scratch with vinyl records.\n\nDJ mixing also played a key role in disco music in the 1970s. In disco clubs, DJs would use mixers to transition seamlessly from one song to another and create a mix of songs that would keep the dancers energized. One of the pioneers of DJ mixing equipment design was Rudy Bozak. Beatmatching and beatmixing with a DJ mixer were first used to encourage dancers not to leave the dancefloor between songs. By beatmatching song A and song B, a DJ can transition seamlessly between two songs, without creating a break in the music. Typically, when a DJ is using beatmatching, they will let song A play until it nears its end. As song A is playing, the DJ \"cues up\" song B in their headphones and adjusts the speed of record player B until the beats of song A and song B are synchronized (\"synced up\"). Then, once the two songs' beats are synchronized, they can slowly fade in song B while song A is nearing its ending. In the 2000s, DJ mixers have been used for harmonic mixing.\n"}

There are a total of 10 Super eggs that can be obtained. At first, the game only featured a single Challenge game mode. Later versions featured a Speedrun mode, where the player was able to unlock numerous unique levels by exchanging bones collected during previous plays. In 2010, a new mode for the game was announced - Planet D, a set of \"weird\" levels, which are similar to the levels in the Challenge mode, but alter the physics of the game in various ways. before the release of Dino Run DX, (September 2015) the difficulty level for Planet D could not be changed.

Combined with its sequel, Hill Climb Racing 2, the entire franchise surpassed 1 billion downloads in April 2018. \n\nThe object of the game is to collect coins while driving through racing stages. Driving consumes gas or battery for electric powered vehicles (even if you're not moving), which players can replenish by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can \"die\" in various ways, such as if they run out of gas or hit the avatar's head on the ground or ceiling (in levels such as Cave). Coins may also be earned by performing \"tricks\", difficult maneuvers in the air, or by reaching set distances during given stages. Coins may be spent on upgrades, or to unlock new stages and vehicles. Different stages have different attributes, such as different gravity, traction, terrain (elevation) or obstacles that will slow the player down.\n\nThe Garage was a new element of Hill Climb Racing introduced in Version 1.31.0, and it allowed players to make their own custom car based on the use of 'parts'. Consequently, Gems were also introduced as the 'premium' currency of the game. Gems can be found on the stage, before every second group of coins, unless there is a Gas canister. The Garage introduces the use of Cards, which are used to unlock and upgrade parts. Initially, the Garage costs 300 gems to unlock. Gems can be used to purchase Chests, which contain more cards of the four rarities, Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Each of the custom parts has a special characteristic, such as '-50% fuel' or '+80% power'. A Gift chest is available for every new stage or car purchased, and usually contains about 3 cards. A Free chest is available every 4 hours and usually contains about 5 cards. The Free chest requires an Internet connection to claim. Version 1.32.1 saw the introduction of Boosters.

Electromagnetic devices, using a solenoid coil to control a visible flag or flap, were the earliest type, and were used for text displays such as stock market prices and arrival/departure display times. The cathode ray tube was the workhorse of text and video display technology for several decades until being displaced by plasma, liquid crystal (LCD) and solid-state devices such as LEDs and OLEDs. With the advent of microprocessors and microelectronic devices, many more individual picture elements (\"pixels\") could be incorporated into one display device, allowing graphic displays and video.\n\nOne of the earliest electronic displays is the cathode ray tube (CRT), which was first demonstrated in 1897 and made commercial in 1922. The CRT consists of an electron gun that forms images by firing electrons onto a phosphor-coated screen. The earliest CRTs were monochrome and were used primarily in oscilloscopes and black and white televisions. The first commercial colour CRT was produced in 1954. CRTs were the single most popular display technology used in television sets and computer monitors for over half a century; it was not until the 2000s that LCDs began to gradually replace them.\n\nA derivative of CRTs were storage tubes, which had the ability to retain information displayed on them, unlike standard CRTs which need to be refreshed periodically.

Jay Jason's interest in show business began when he would imitate the dialects of some of the residents from different countries who lived in boarding houses his parents owned. Born in Rochester, NY, Jay Jason attended the University of Rochester where he majored in languages. He traveled to Buffalo for amateur shows, and success in these comedy contests led him to pursue a career as an entertainer.\n\nBarely 19 years of age, he left the University of Rochester after two years for his first major club date, and changed his name from Jonas Levy to Jay Jason (sometimes in the media his last name was spelled Jayson). It was a common practice in those days for Jewish entertainers to change their names, to be more accepted. He performed throughout the Midwest during the 1930s. During World War Two, he entertained for the USO, and during one show, he performed in front of hundreds of Hollywood and night club personalities including Red Skelton and Mickey Rooney.\n\nAfter the war, he continued to entertain in the Midwest.

He played frequently at the Granit, Concord, Kutsher's Hotel, the Nevele, The Laurels Hotel and Country Club, The Pines Resort, Raleigh, the Overlook, the Tamarack Lodge, Stevensville, the Windsor, and Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel.\n\nAs mentioned by Grosswirth, \"Jay's name will be familiar to those of you who used to frequent what was commonly referred to as 'The Borscht Belt'\". In a \"Newsday\" magazine article in 1992, reporter Stuart Vincent mentioned that Jay “is the consummate Catskills comic... You’ve probably seen him if you’ve been to one of the Borscht Belt hotels in the Catskills with your temple, your church, your parents, your cousins. A funny man. A comic’s comic. An entertainer for 60 years—impressionist, singer, even has a few dance steps in him…he’s played the Las Vegas hotels and Manhattan night clubs, appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show” three times.”\nJason's humor had self-deprecating aspects, and all subjects were grist for his comedy routines. He also impersonated celebrities such as Alfred Hitchcock, Jackie Mason, Jack Benny, Maurice Chevalier, Rudolph Valentino, Jimmy Stewart, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Arthur Godfrey, and Franklin Roosevelt, and he also did voice-overs for cartoon characters.\nIn addition to being mentioned as one of the comics who regularly performed at the Borscht Belt, Jason was mentioned on internet sites listing famous comedians, and his YouTube videos are featured on a number of internet comedy sites.\n\nJason’s jokes were often quoted in different newspapers such as the News and Courier in South Carolina, the Toledo Blade in Ohio, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in Ohio, and the Miami News in Florida. As an example, Martin Burden of the New York Post wrote: “Feud-in-the-making: Jack E. Leonard at the Blue Angel and Jay Jason at the Latin Quarter are telling the same quip: I always thought Chubby Checker was a fat taxicab.” In addition, Earl Wilson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune wrote: “Today’s Best Laugh. New York has more psychiatrists than plumbers says Jay Jason, proving the city has more stuffed-up heads than toilets.” In the syndicated Parade Magazine, Jason was quoted as saying: “You’ve all heard of kleptomaniacs. Well I know a guy who suffers from mania-klepto. He walks into department stores backward, sneaks up to the counter when no one is watching and leaves things. People talk about doctors and unethical practices—splitting fees, over-charging, all that stuff. But not my doctor. He’s a great physician, honest, sincere, above-board. He never operatives on you unless he really needs the money.” \nDuring his career, he appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", Mike Wallace's Nite Beat, the Dorsey Brothers television Stage Show, \nIn the late 1980s, he appeared as the comedy star of \"Sugar Daddy,\" a vaudeville-type show with music, comedy, illusion and costumes. In Moore's book on comedians, he mentions that Jay Jason was one of the great comics he would watch at the Downingtown Inn, and Jay’s name was mentioned in a number of other books. For example, Rudd is quoted in \"Jazz and its discontents\", saying that \"Comedians are like the jazz musicians of the Borscht Belt, ... then there's Ralph Pope, Jay Jason, Lenny Rush, and Mickey Marvin...they’re incredible. And they do improvise, within a set form. They work with a set number of variables—like a musician would with, say, twelve notes—and they shift the order of things according to how the audience is reacting. They usually start out the same and have a big thing they do at the end that brings it to a peak and lets then bow out gracefully. Like a final coda or cadenza. But in the middle, you never know where they’re going next. That’s the exciting part\".\n\nJay married Lynn Peltz in 1947, and had two children named Diana and Leonard. After moving throughout the Midwest for much of his early career, in the mid-1950s, Jay and Lynn settled in Teaneck, NJ, which allowed Jason easy access to the Catskills Mountains.\n\nA number of comedians worked for Jason over time as drivers to the Borscht Belt hotels, including the comedian Kenny Kramer, who was used as the basis for the character from the American sitcom \"Seinfeld\". Kramer is quoted as saying: “Through a friend of mine, I ended up getting a job as a chauffeur for a comedian named Jay Jayson,who was very popular in the Catskills. I used to drive Jay to his gigs, and carry his wardrobe, and I started writing jokes for Jay. Jay is doing my jokes and they’re getting great laughs, and I realize, hey, I could do these jokes myself. So on November 7, 1971, I stepped on a stage for the first time as a comedian…” Jason's nephew, Sid Roth, host of a noted messianic radio and television show, also drove Jason to the hotels in the Catskills.\n\nJason was well-liked among entertainers. This is illustrated by a newspaper story about his son's bar mitzvah: \"The boy’s father is the current comedy star at the Latin Quarter in New York city. Many show business personalities attended the service including Jackie Mason, Phil Foster, Norman Dean, Lew Black, Davey Starr, Jack Kahane, Corbett Monica, Gene Baylos, Marilyn Maxwell, Tony Drake, Laura Lane, Tina Robin and Bea Kalmus.\" At his daughter Diana's wedding, comedians who attended included: Reginald Stanbach, Lou Menchell, Allan Tresser, Dusty Brooks, Al Bernie and Murray Waxman. Jason associated with other leading comics (e.g., Don Rickes, Morty Gunty, etc.) and entertainers of the second-half of the 20th century.\n"}
{"id": "48484372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48484372", "title": "Legends of the Three Kingdoms", "text": "Legends of the Three Kingdoms\n\nLegends of the Three Kingdoms (; literally Three Kingdoms Kill), or sometimes Sanguosha, LTK, 3KK for short, is a Chinese card game based on the Three Kingdoms period of China and the semi-fictional novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (ROTK). The rules of the basic LTK are almost identical to the rules of the older Italian card game Bang!. LTK was released by YOKA games (游卡桌游) on January 1, 2008, and has been followed to date by a total of seven official expansion sets, an online version LTK Online, as well as a children's version LTK Q Version. There are self-created cards by players, but these are mostly unofficial.\n\nLTK initially began with a strong following in China since the entire game is in Chinese. Sales of LTK totaled 20 million yuan in 2009, and 100 million yuan in 2010. However the game has begun to reach an international audience after players began translating the game into the English language and posting these translations on blogs and forums. Site visit statistics from one of these blogs showed that readers outside of China come primarily from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Malaysia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe cards and characters of LTK are all related to the ancient history of China, the most telling of which are the characters and their abilities. Each character is given an ability in the game which usually mirrors the historical character's personality, actions, strength/weakness, cause of death, and historical events in which the character was involved, etc. For example, Liu Bei's ability Kindness(仁德) allows him to give away his cards to other players, mirroring the benevolent and kind nature of Liu Bei in ROTK. Cao Cao, on the other hand, is given the ability Treachery(奸雄), which allows him to keep any card which causes him damage. This mirrors Cao Cao's style of coaxing able advisers of his enemies to defect and join him, then utilizing them for his cause.\n\nThe relevance of these abilities to ROTK and the Three Kingdoms history is interesting enough to inspire players to discover more about ROTK and Three Kingdoms history for themselves. One blog author describes his knowledge of Three Kingdoms evolving from uninterested to semi-expert after immersing in the study of LTK abilities. In August 2012, UC Berkeley offered a course in LTK. The faculty sponsor of the course, Professor Robert Berring, wants to get undergrads \"acquainted with essential philosophy dating back to China's ancient dynasties\".\n\nThe standard mode of LTK can be played by 2 to 10 people. Each player plays one of these four roles: Monarch (主公), Minister (忠臣), Rebel (反贼) and Traitors(内奸). There can be only one monarch in the game at all times, but the number of ministers, rebels and traitors are determined by the total number of players, as shown in the table on the right. Each player may have 3 or 4 Health points (see below), depending on their character.\n\n\nDifferent roles have different victory conditions:\n\nThe game ends immediately if:\n\nAs long as one of the scenarios listed above occur at the endgame, the associated roles can claim victory even if the character has already been killed. In general, the Monarch and his ministers must work together to kill the rebels and traitors, while the rebels can cooperate to kill off the ministers before attacking the Monarch. Meanwhile, the traitor(s) can guise as a minister and help to kill the rebels, before revolting against the ministers and finally confronting the Monarch.\n\nLTK consists of a few types of cards, which serve different purposes in the game.\n\n\nThere are six main phases to playing when it comes to any player's turn.\n\n\nWhen a player's Health points is reduced to 0, he faces imminent death and must instantly take action: he may request to be saved by a \"Peach\" card (thus letting other players play the card), or may use one immediately if he has it. If he is successful, his health will be recovered to 1 point. Otherwise, he dies (except some special character like Zhou Tai), and must reveal his role card and discard all other cards. If he is a Rebel and killed by a card from another player, that player may draw 3 cards.\n\nIt is possible for a player's health to have a negative value (such as suffering from a Lightning attack). In this case, the player will need as many \"Peach\" cards as he requires to raise his health back to 1 point in order to continue the game (for example, a Health point of -1 requires 2 \"Peach\" cards). The abilities of certain cards or characters may involve healing more than 1 points of health, or even prolonged living below 1 Health point.\n\nCertain special characters (such as Xun Yu) may initiate point duels with another player to unleash their special abilities. This is done when the initiator plays a card, and the other player does the same, and both players compare the numerical digit on the upper left corner.\nThe player with the larger number on the wins, with \"Ace\" as the smallest value and \"King\" as the largest value. In the case of ties, the initiator of the duel is considered to have \"lost\" the duel. Suits such as diamonds, hearts, etc. do not matter. Both cards are discarded into the discard deck; players cannot retrieve back the cards into their hands.\n\nAll LTK characters are separated into four historically relevant allegiances. They are Shu Kingdom, Wei Kingdom, Wu Kingdom, and Neutral Heroes. In the original LTK, there are no repeated characters. However, as later character expansions are introduced, some characters are duplicated in different allegiances. This is because of the complex changes of each historical figure. Some characters, such as Jia Xu, were under the allegiance of different kingdoms through the course of their lives.\n\nWith the introduction of the first LTK expansion pack, a new fictional allegiance known as the Demi-Gods was introduced. Demi-God characters are typically very significant characters in ROTK and Three Kingdoms history, and these characters are given abilities that are much more powerful than regular characters. The presence of Demi-God characters can severely imbalance a regular game, and thus most players choose not to include Demi-God characters into gameplay. Since Demi-God characters are obtained by chance in expansion packs, Demi-God character cards have become collectible pieces. Prices of single Demi-God cards have been known to equal, or exceed, the price of the whole expansion pack.\n\nIn 2011, YOKA released collectible SP cards that comes with every purchase of Zhuo You Zhi 桌游志 magazine, a monthly magazine discussing board and card-games in China. Many SP cards are remakes of existing LTK characters with different allegiances, representing that character from a different time period in his or her career.\n\nAs of October 2012, seven different official LTK expansion packs have been released. Two different Collector's Editions have also been released. Beginning January 2011, ultra-collectible SP cards were released monthly with every purchase of Zhuoyouzhi 桌游志 magazine. As of October 2012, the SP Yang Xiu character released with the inaugural issue of Zhuoyouzhi magazine has been seen to sell for 500 yuan, which is over forty times the original price of the magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariations to the original game are played by people from all over China. The game has since been translated into English. Many people created different ways of playing LTK with no roles.\n\n\nLTK is considered by some observers as a close replica of Bang!, due to similarities between the basic cards and tool cards. However, LTK has managed to entrench its position through the game's strong relations to ROTK. The similarity has motivated the creators of Bang! to sue LTK and its Western distributor.\n\nPoor build quality of the Collector's Editions product is also a regular criticism, where the plastic trays holding the cards are easily crushed and the matte finish of the box is prone to scratches. One online shop selling LTK has discouraged customers from purchasing the Collector's Edition altogether to avoid product exchanges and refunds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7006862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7006862", "title": "List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer home video releases", "text": "List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer home video releases\n\nDVDs of the television show \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" were produced by 20th Century Fox and released beginning in 2000. As well as containing the episodes, the DVD sets have extra features such as: audio commentaries by the show's producers, documentary features, blooper reels, and shooting scripts.\n\nThe \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" DVD sets were released in at least three encoding formats:\n\n\nAside from the region encoding (and the packaging), the Region 2 and Region 4 DVDs are identical. However, there are several content differences between the Region 1 DVDs and the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.\n\nThe Region 2 and 4 DVDs include the scenes from previous episodes (\"Previously on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"\") at the beginning of each episode (except season 2); the Region 1 DVDs do not.\n\nThis even applies to the final episode of season five, \"The Gift\", in which the \"previously\" scenes are a montage leading into the episode itself. This montage was deleted from \"The Gift\" on the Region 1 DVDs. This montage was later included as an easter egg on the Season 7 DVD set, even in Region 2 and 4.\n\nBeginning in season four, the Region 2 and 4 DVDs include the version of the television show. The Region 1 DVDs include the version, which is identical to the broadcast version.\n\nThe reason for this difference is that the Region 2 and 4 DVDs were released before the Region 1 DVDs, with less involvement from Mutant Enemy Productions. When the Region 1 DVDs were released, Joss Whedon decided that they should not have the widescreen version, because the show was directed and filmed for a 4:3 ratio. The extra material in the widescreen versions is never important for the plot, although it gives additional views of the sets and backgrounds.\n\nIn 2011 Netflix began streaming Seasons 4-7 in the 16:9 ratio, but would ultimately revert to the 4:3 ratio. In Nordic Region 2 countries Netflix streams those seasons in 4:3 ratio, despite the local DVDs being in widescreen.\n\nAs of August 4, 2016 Netflix (and later Hulu) began streaming all 7 seasons in an updated HD version, replacing the original broadcast version. This version of the series is a remaster of the series in HD produced by the studio 20th Century Fox against the wishes of original production team. Many of the original production team, including Whedon himself, and fans have criticized the HD remaster for poor transferring of standard definition to high definition, the poor transition from 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 aspect ratio, improper lighting, lack of lens filtering and poorly redone special effects that were either upscaled or redone in HD not true to the original. For all of season 1 each episode had to be cropped, leaving everything in frame looking zoomed. In other instances the 16:9 aspect ratio shows goofs in frame like crew members or filming equipment on screen. 20th Century Fox originally released the HD remaster as a syndicated broadcast on the network Pivot. Currently the HD remaster is not available for purchase on home media.\n\nThe Region 2 and 4 DVDs play the episodes at 4% faster than the Region 1 DVDs. This reduces the running time of each episode by about two minutes (not counting the \"scenes from previous episodes\"). It also causes the sound to be raised by two-thirds of a semitone. For example, a C note is raised to a note two-thirds of the way from C to C♯.\n\nThe speeds of the different region DVDs match the speeds used during the original television broadcasts in the respective countries. Thus the Region 1 DVD plays the video at the same speed as the American broadcasts (which is the speed at which the show was taped), while the Region 2 and 4 DVDs plays the video at the slightly faster speed that was used during the original British broadcasts. This effect is not particular to the \"Buffy\" DVDs but affects all television shows, because film that uses 23.976 frames per second is sped up for PAL that uses 25 (in the NTSC standard it is telecined and there is no speed variation). But since the signal from a DVD player is ultimately analog, the Region 2 and 4 DVDs will still play at the faster speed when played on an American television with a multi-region DVD.\n\nIn Brazil the standard color system is not PAL, but PAL-M which is also 24 frames per second. In addition to that, all DVD releases, despite being Region 4 are in NTSC, so the frame rate is also 24 frames per second.\n\nIn the Region 2 and 4 releases, episodes with commentaries include two English subtitles: the show itself, and the commentary. The Region 1 releases do not offer subtitles for the commentaries.\n\nThe Region 1 DVDs also offer a smaller choice of non-English languages subtitles than the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Region 1 \"Buffy\" 40-disc boxed set includes an extra disc (the 40th) with all-new special features:\n\n\nA repackaged 39-disc version was released on October 12, 2010, excluding the extra disc of bonus features.\n\nThe entire series was re-released on DVD in 2006, in a \"slimmer\" package with the same bonus materials that were featured in the original fold out versions. Even \"slimmer\" versions were issued in 2008.\n\nTwo special Region 1 DVD releases contain assorted episodes from various seasons:\n\n\nIn Region 2, there have been several single-disc releases named after individual characters from the show, under the overarching title of \"The Slayer Collection\". Each contains four episodes and a character profile. The Spike-centric DVD contains the same episodes as the Region 1 \"Love is Hell\" collection. Other discs focus on Willow, Xander, Giles, Cordelia, Dawn, Angel, and Faith.\n\nTwo other single-disc Region 2 DVDs have been released. The first is titled \"The Very Best of...\". It contains these four episodes: \"Becoming, Part One\", \"Graduation Day, Part Two\", \"Hush\", and \"The Gift\". The second contains the episode \"Once More, with Feeling\" and a number of special features including a featurette on season 1 of \"Angel\" and a featurette titled \"\"Buffy\", Inside the Music\".\n\nIn October 2008, a limited edition bonus DVD was made available exclusively to the retail chain Best Buy. The Region 1 85-minute DVD documents the 2008 \"Buffy\" Reunion at the Paley Festival, filmed on March 20, 2008. The DVD features interviews with Amber Benson, Nicholas Brendon, Charisma Carpenter, Emma Caulfield, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seth Green, David Greenwalt, James Marsters, Michelle Trachtenberg & Joss Whedon. The DVD is available on Amazon and manufactured on-demand using DVD-R media.\n\n\n"}

Since the release of the original \"Tomb Raider\" in 1996, the series developed into a franchise of the same name, and Lara went on to become a major icon of the video game industry. The \"Guinness Book of World Records\" has recognised Lara Croft as the \"Most Successful Human Videogame Heroine\" in 2006. Six games in the series were developed by Core Design, and the latest four by Crystal Dynamics. The games were first published by Eidos Interactive; Eidos became part of Square Enix on 22 April 2009. Square Enix owns the rights to the \"Tomb Raider\" trademark and characters of the franchise. Three films, \"\", \"\" and \"Tomb Raider\", have been produced. The first two star American actress Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, the third Swedish actress Alicia Vikander.\n\nThe \"Tomb Raider\" video games have together sold over 45 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game series of all time.\n\nThese games are not part of the main series as they are either handheld, mobile or spin-off games.\n\n\"The Tomb Raider Trilogy\" is a collection of the three second era \"Tomb Raider\" games: \"Tomb Raider: Legend\", \"Tomb Raider: Anniversary\" and \"Tomb Raider: Underworld\". It was released on 22 March 2011 in North America and 25 March 2011 in Europe exclusively on PlayStation 3 as part of the Classics HD line. The games were originally developed by Crystal Dynamics, in association with Buzz Monkey Software and Nixxes Software BV, and were ported to the PS3 by Buzz Monkey Software.\n\nThe collection includes the PlayStation 2 versions of \"Legend\" and \"Anniversary\" remastered in high definition plus \"Underworld\", which was previously released on the PS3 in 2008, all on one Blu-ray Disc. Also included is PlayStation Network Trophy support, bonus Lara Croft and Viking Thrall avatars for use in PlayStation Home, a theme pack for the XrossMediaBar and making-of videos.\n\nThe two downloadable episodes available for the Xbox 360 version of \"Underworld\" are not included, and Crystal Dynamics has no current plans to make them available on PS3. \"The Angel of Darkness\", the first \"Tomb Raider\" game to be released on the PS2, is also not included in the collection as it was developed by Core Design rather than Crystal Dynamics and has no relation to the story told in \"Legend\", \"Anniversary\" and \"Underworld\".\n\nThe \"Tomb Raider Level Editor\", Room Editor, is a tool released by Eidos Interactive with the video game \"Tomb Raider Chronicles\" in late 2000. Later, it was made available free to download from the Internet. Since then it has enabled players to design new levels of their own, set in locations from the original games or in new locations.\n\nAn interactive DVD was released by Bright Entertainment under license from Eidos in 2006, called \"Tomb Raider: The Action Adventure\". The game takes advantage of standard DVD player audiovisual capabilities, and the remote control. It has puzzles and action elements, while the story is based on \"The Angel of Darkness\".\n\nThere were initially two film adaptations made in the early 2000s that starred Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft: \"\" in 2001 and its sequel, \"\", in 2003. While both films were financially successful, neither of them were well-received by critics. A reboot starring Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft was released on 16 March 2018, which in turn was better received.\n\nA short film called \"Tomb Raider: The Trilogy\" was produced in 1998 by Silver Films for the \"Tomb Raider III\" launch party, the film was not screened outside the event at the Natural History Museum in London. Producer Janey de Nordwall, who recently found the original digibeta tape, released the short film on the \"Tomb Raider\" YouTube page in 2016. Lara Croft makes a minor appearance in the 2018 film \"Ready Player One\".\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nRumours of a third film adaptation appeared in 2007, and it was announced in 2009. The film rights were acquired by GK Films in 2011, and in 2015 it was confirmed that a director was attached to the project, and that it would be developed by GK Films, Warner Bros. and MGM. The film is a reboot, showing Lara's first adventure and is based on the 2013 video game with Lara searching for her father. On 28 April 2016, it was announced by Variety that Alicia Vikander had been cast as Lara Croft in the reboot. On 7 December 2016, Variety reported that Walton Goggins had been cast as the film's villain. He told Collider that his character is confused, angry, and desperate. He later called the plot \"\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" meets a genre version of the Joseph Conrad novel \"\"\". On 11 January 2017, Variety reports that Daniel Wu is cast as Lu Ren, a ship captain who will join forces with the adventurous Lara Croft on her quest to find her father. The film was scheduled to start filming in January 2017, with a release date of 16 March 2018. Filming began on 23 January 2017.\nAdrian Askarieh told IGN in an interview that he may oversee a film universe with \"Just Cause\", \"\", \"Tomb Raider\", \"Deus Ex\" and \"Thief\".\n\nIn 2007, an animated series based on the character was produced and broadcast by GameTap as part of a series of re-imaginings of popular video game series. Titled \"\", the series ran between May and June 2007. Multiple noted animators and writers were involved with the series, including Peter Chung, Warren Ellis, Gail Simone and Jim Lee. While the production team had great creative freedom, they were given a basic guideline for the character by the developers so that Lara would not do anything out of character.\n\nSeveral soundtrack albums have been released over the course of the franchise's history. Initially, music from the game was only released on promotional samplers. However, the 2013 reboot and its 2015 sequel received full soundtrack releases. Additionally, there has been at least one album release for each of the three \"Tomb Raider\" films.\n\nBeginning in 1997, Lara Croft was featured in multiple comics produced by Top Cow Productions. Her first appearance is a cameo in \"Witchblade\". She later appeared in a titular comic book series which ran for fifty issues from 1999 to 2005. An attempt by Top Cow to restart the comic in 2007 stalled due to licensing issues. A new comic book series began in 2014, set within the 2013 reboot's continuity and bridging the narrative gap between the reboot and its sequel.\n\nFour official novels have also been written. The first three, set within the original timeline, were published between 2003 and 2005. The first novel, \"The Amulet of Power\", was set after the events of \"The Last Revelation\", while its sequels \"The Lost Cult\" and \"The Man of Bronze\" are set after the first novel. Another novel set within the 2013 reboot timeline, \"Tomb Raider: The Ten Thousand Immortals\", was published in 2014 as a continuation of the original story. A fifth book, titled \"Lara Croft and the Blade of Gwynnever\", also written by Dan Abnett and Nik Vincent was published in late 2016, and is a stand-alone adventure.\n"}

A popping move, the moonwalk became popular around the world after Michael Jackson performed it during a performance of \"Billie Jean\" on \",\" broadcast May 16, 1983. It became his signature move.\n\nAn illusion is involved in creating the appearance of the dancer gliding backwards. Initially, the front foot is held flat on the ground, while the back foot is in a tiptoe position. The flat front foot remains on the ground but is slid lightly and smoothly backward past the tip-toe back foot. What is now the front foot is lowered flat, while the back foot is raised into the tiptoe position. These steps are repeated over and over creating the illusion that the dancer is being pulled backwards by an unseen force while trying to walk forward. Variations of this move allow moonwalking to appear to glide forward, sideways, or even in a circle.\n\nThere are many recorded instances of the moonwalk; similar steps are reported as far back as 1932, used by Cab Calloway. In 1985, Calloway said that the move was called \"The Buzz\" when he and others performed it in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1944, Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien featured something like the move in their performance of \"Under the Bamboo Tree\" in \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" though their performance lacks the illusion created by the genuine moonwalk.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dick Van Dyke performed a similar variation of the moonwalk and camel walk in his comedy routine called \"Mailing A Letter On A Windy Corner\".\n\nIn 1955, it was recorded in a performance by tap dancer Bill Bailey. He performs a tap routine, and at the end, backslides into the wings. The French mime artist Marcel Marceau used it throughout his career (from the 1940s through the 1980s), as part of the drama of his mime routines. In Marceau's \"Walking Against the Wind\" routine, he pretends to be pushed backwards by a gust of wind.\n\nIn 1958, Mexican dancer-comedian Adalberto Martinez \"Resortes\" also performed the moonwalk in the film \"Colegio de Verano\" (Summer School).\n\nIn a November 1969 episode of \"H.R. Pufnstuf\", Judy the Frog teaches everyone a new dance called \"The Moonwalk\", which includes two instances of a stationary moonwalk.\n\n1972 Lucie Arnaz in Here's Lucy Episode 9 of Season 5 \"Lucy and Jim Bailey\" Lucie does the Moonwalk whilst singing \"Fever\" with Jim Bailey\n\nChoreographer Bob Fosse moonwalks in his role as the Snake in the 1974 film \"The Little Prince\". \n\nIt has also a been acknowledged that the professional wrestlers Michael \"Pure Sexy\" Hayes, Terry Gordy, and Buddy Roberts started doing the moonwalk as their trademark ring entrance by 1979 when they formed a wrestling stable known as The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\nJames Brown used the move and can be seen performing it in the 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers\". In 1981 in the promotional single and music video \"Crosseyed and Painless\" by new wave band Talking Heads, authentic street dancers, picked by David Byrne, are featuring, including Stephen \"Skeeter Rabbit\" Nichols doing the moonwalk. It reached to 20 on the US dance charts. Another early moonwalker was popper and singer Jeffrey Daniel, who moonwalked in a performance of Shalamar's \"A Night To Remember\" on \"Top of the Pops\" in the UK in 1982 and was known to perform backslides in public performances (including weekly \"Soul Train\" episodes) as far back as 1974. Michael Jackson was a fan of Jeffrey Daniel's dancing and would eventually seek him out.\n\nAlso in 1982, Debbie Allen performs a moonwalk during a scene with Gwen Verdon in Season 1, Episode 10 (\"Come One, Come All\") of the TV series \"Fame\".\n\nIn \"Flashdance\", the move was used in the B-boy scene, where Rock Steady Crew's Mr. Freeze (Marc Lemberger), with an umbrella prop, mimed the wind blowing him backward as he first walks forward, fighting the wind, then starts moonwalking backwards. Mr. Freeze's version was also shown in the first hip hop movie \"Wild Style\" and Malcolm McLaren film clip \"Buffalo Gals\".\n\nJeffrey Daniel taught Michael Jackson the moonwalk. Jackson saw Daniel do the moonwalk dance on \"Soul Train\" and had his manager call \"Soul Train\" to introduce him to the dancer. Daniel was touring with Shalamar at the time so Cooley Jackson and Caszper Candidate went to teach Jackson. However, Jackson was not able to pick up and master the technique until Daniel returned from tour and worked with him. The dance was popularized in 1983 when Jackson performed it during a television special, \"\", on March 25 of that year. Dressed in his signature black trousers, silver socks, silver shirt, black-sequined jacket, sequined glove, and black fedora, Jackson spun around, posed, and began moonwalking. Music critic Ian Inglis later wrote that Jackson encapsulated a long tradition of African-American dance movements in that one performance. Moonwalking received widespread attention, and from then on, the moonwalk became Jackson's signature move for his song \"Billie Jean\". Nelson George said that Jackson's rendition \"combined Jackie Wilson's athleticism with James Brown's camel walk\". Michael Jackson's autobiography was titled \"Moonwalk\", and he also starred in a 1988 film titled \"Moonwalker\".\n\nIn the 1984 movie \"Streets of Fire\", actor and performer Stoney Jackson executed a moonwalk as the leader of a fictional group, The Sorels, who lip-synced to the Dan Hartman song \"I Can Dream About You\".\n\nAlexei Kovalev has been known for using the moonwalk in his National Hockey League career. He performed the move after scoring a goal on February 7, 2001, and on January 3, 2010. Kovalev moonwalked onto the ice after being named one of the stars of the game and again after scoring in a 2008 celebrity charity soccer game.\n\nIn 2018, Alessia Cara briefly used the moonwalk in the music video for her song \"Trust My Lonely.\"\n"}

French Chilean architect Claudio Brunet des Baines was commissioned for its design, and its construction was entrusted to another French Chilean, civil engineer Felipe Charme de l´Isle. Brunet des Baines created a French Neoclassical exterior for the theater, though his 1855 death left the supervision of the design to his countryman, Lucien Henault, and to the latter's assistant, Manuel Aldunate. The new team also benefited from a collaboration with Charles Garnier, the architect of the Opéra National de Paris.\nThe Teatro Municipal was inaugurated on September 17, 1857, with the opera \"Ernani\" by Giuseppe Verdi, performed by an Italian company brought in specially for the occasion. At the time, the theatre held 1,800 spectators, and included distinctive interior details such as a teardrop crystal chandelier. A December 8, 1870, performance by opera diva Carlotta Patti was followed by a massive fire, which practically destroyed the building. A quick response by both the local government and Chilean high society resulted in the theatre's prompt reconstruction, designed by Henault and completed on July 16, 1873. Its reinauguration was accompanied by a performance of Verdi's \"La forza del destino\".\n\nThe theatre went through a devastating 1906 earthquake, suffering the loss of most of its interior, and a second, serious fire in 1927, although it recovered quickly on both occasions. Following these reconstructions, the theatre's capacity was reduced to 1,500 in the main hall; however, its interior became more opulent. It was further modernized in 1952 and 1959, and numerous cultural institutions were created for the theatre during that era. The \"Santiago Philharmonic Orchestra\" was established in 1955, the Cultural Corporation of Santiago was formed to administer the center in 1957, the \"Santiago Ballet\" in 1959, and the \"Teatro Municipal Chorus\", in 1962.\n\nThe Teatro Municipal was declared a National Monument, in 1974. The theatre hosted the two editions of the OTI Festival in Chile: in 1978 and in 1986. Renowned Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau, who had left his homeland in 1941, returned for a visit in 1984, on which occasion the Claudio Arrau Salon, seating 250 spectators, was inaugurated. The stage curtain, installed in 1926, was replaced in 1995 with funds raised by offering donors a piece of the older curtain as a keepsake. \n\nThe institution continues to maintain an active repertoire, and some of its most illustrious recent international guest performers and conductors have included: names in ballet such as Julio Bocca, Mikhail Baryshnikov, the Bolshoi Ballet and the Mariinsky Ballet; pianists Claudio Arrau, Valentina Igoshina and Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Daniel Barenboim; violinists Mischa Elman, Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin, Gil Shaham and Isaac Stern; conductors Zubin Mehta, Charles Dutoit, Kurt Masur and Pierre Boulez; and stage performers such as Plácido Domingo, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Charles Aznavour, Vivien Leigh, Luciano Pavarotti, Tito Schipa and Renée Fleming.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "4494157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4494157", "title": "Page playoff system", "text": "Page playoff system\n\nThe Page playoff system is a playoff format used primarily in softball and curling at the championship level, the Pakistan Super League, and the Indian Premier League cricket tournament. Teams are seeded using a round-robin tournament and the top four play a mix of a single-elimination and double-elimination tournament to determine the winner. It is identical to a four-team McIntyre System playoff, first used by the Victorian Football League in Australia in 1931, originally called the Page–McIntyre system, after the VFL delegate, the Richmond Football Club's Secretary, Percy \"Pip\" Page, who had advocated its use.\n\nThe Page playoff system was used at the Australian Rugby League Championship 1954-1972. In Australia, its most notable use today is in netball, having been adopted by Suncorp Super Netball when it began play in 2017.\n\nThe system has been used since 1990 by the International Softball Federation and its successor, the World Baseball Softball Confederation, for the Women's Softball World Championship and from 1996 to 2008 at the Olympic Games.\n\nIts first use in curling was by the Canadian Curling Association in the 1995 Labatt Brier, the men's championship, and was adopted the next year at the 1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts, the women's championship. It gained acceptance and in 2005 the World Curling Championships started using it, but it has not yet been adopted in curling at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe format is used in the Indian Premier League cricket tournament since 2011.\n\nThe format has also been used in some much lower-key, internet gaming events, such as chess and backgammon.\n\nThe system requires teams to be ranked in some way, as the top two teams have an advantage over the bottom two. This is usually accomplished through a round-robin tournament, which eliminates all but the top four teams.\n\nA standard round-robin tournament is used, in which all teams play each other once. Because the number of total games increases quadratically with respect to the number of teams, scheduling too many teams will result in an unwieldy number of games, particularly when there are a limited number of playing surfaces (curling rinks usually only have four sheets). Therefore, the number of teams is usually capped at around a dozen; if this is not possible or desirable, teams may be separated into groups playing separate round-robins and either having the top teams combining for the Page playoff or playing separate ones in each group and having the winners play each other after.\n\nThe system was invented in Australia in the early 1930s and adopted soon after by the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League). The top four teams advance to the playoffs, which are played over three rounds with one team being eliminated in each round. \n\nThe format progresses as follows:\n\nThis system gives the top two teams a double chance, in that they can lose their first game and still go on to win the title, producing a similar though not identical effect to a double-elimination tournament. This gives the top two teams a significant advantage over the next two, since winning the title from third or fourth place requires winning one more game than winning from first or second, and also requires defeating every other team in the playoffs. Additionally, the higher ranked team in any pairing (which, in the final, is automatically the team which won Game 2) will play as the home team to provide an additional advantage; in the case of curling teams, where teams rarely play national or international tournaments at their home rink, the advantage is that the first-placed team is given the hammer (last rock) in the first end, which is a reasonable advantage between comparably skilled teams.\n\nIn the 2008 World Women's Curling championship, a fifth match was added to the format: a bronze medal playoff match, which was played between the two teams which did not qualify for the final (the losers of Games 1 and 3). This game is normally scheduled between Games 3 and 4. Previously, the bronze would have automatically been awarded to the team which lost Game 3, so this game provides a chance for the loser of Game 1 to still receive a medal. This was also introduced at the national level at the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts and the 2011 Tim Hortons Brier. The bronze medal game was heavily criticized for being \"meaningless\" in part because simply winning a \"medal\" does not carry the same sort of prestige it does in the Olympic Games. The bronze medal game was eliminated prior to the 2018 Canadian championship curling season.\n\nIn Australia, Games 1 and 2 are known as \"Semi-Finals\"; Game 3 is called the \"Preliminary Final\", and the final is known as the \"Grand Final\". To distinguish between the two Semi-Finals, which are different in nature, the match between 3rd and 4th is known either as the \"First Semi-Final\" or the \"Minor Semi-Final\"; and the match between 1st and 2nd is known either as the \"Second Semi-Final\" or the \"Major Semi-Final\".\n\nIn Curling, Games 1 and 2 are usually known as the \"Page Playoffs\" (and Game 2 is usually played first, to give the higher-ranked team more rest before Game 3); Game 3 is called the \"Semi-Final\", and the final is known by that name. However, some sources, in order to distinguish between Games 1 and 2, refer only to Game 2 as a \"Page Playoff\" while referring to Game 1 as the \"Quarter-Final.\"\n\nIn India, Game 1 is known as the \"Eliminator\", Games 2 and 3 are called \"Qualifiers\", and the final is known by that name.\n\n1931 Victorian Football League playoffs\n\nThe first-ever use of the system was in Australia in 1931 after the Victorian Football League adopted it. The regular season ended with Geelong winning the minor premiership, followed by Richmond, Carlton and Collingwood. The finals proceeded as follows:\n\nPage playoff results from the 2004 Nokia Brier:\n\nPage playoff, including a bronze medal match, from the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts.\n\nPlayers and fans alike have had a mixed reaction to the system. Broadcasters enjoy it as it produces one more game than the single elimination format.\n\n"}
{"id": "5200321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5200321", "title": "Primal Scream (Harvard)", "text": "Primal Scream (Harvard)\n\nPrimal Scream is a tradition at Harvard University that forms part of the streaking at educational institutions. At midnight on the last night of reading period and before final exams begin, students streak through the Old Yard. The streakers begin in the north end of The Yard and generally make one lap around, but the more adventurous sometimes aim for more. This is done both semesters, even during New England winters.\n\nSome of the streakers will \"dress up\" in capes and masks, or top hat and tails, or other costumes, but their genitalia are still exposed. The walkways through which students run are lined with spectators and the Harvard University Band plays beforehand to excite the crowd.\n\nBefore it became a \"night when the whole student body comes together to gawk at just that\" it was a night with a closer association to its name. Beginning in the 1960s students would congregate in the Yard or open their windows and just yell for 10 minutes. It was designed as a way to release stress. By the 1990s, the streaking aspect of the evening had become prominent. It is still designed to give stressed out students a chance to \"step outside the box.\"\n\nThe transition from yelling to streaking is unclear. Old administrators that have been at Harvard since the 1970s speak of an earlier day of adventurous streakers. Before there was streaking in the yard began the Quad Howl—streaking in what used to be old Radcliffe. These administrators of the Quad houses speculate that the change from the Quad to the Yard, which happened during their time, was because the narrow pathways of the Quad could not accommodate the increasing multitudes of people with an urge to get naked in public. The natural choice was to go join those in the Yard, giving them something to get excited about.\n\nA small tradition of Quad Howl continues today: after each Primal Scream, a few Quad residents return to the Quad for a naked lap there. Another related tradition is the Lingere Study Break where undergraduates in Lamont Library strip off their clothes, piece by piece, in front of hundreds of other students studying.\n\nWhile the records are not entirely clear, it appears that when Charles Adams, son of John Adams and brother of John Quincy Adams, was a student at Harvard, he and a few friends were disciplined for getting drunk and streaking naked across the Yard. He was later readmitted.\n\nThursday, December 11, 2014 at 12:00 midnight marked the first time that students ran the naked lap in a clockwise direction. The tradition of the naked lap has been to start outside of Hollis Hall and then take off initially running west around the Old Yard, counterclockwise. However, Black Lives Matter protesters gathered and linked arms just west of Hollis blocking the traditional path. A bit past midnight students decided to break tradition and run the naked lap clockwise in order to avoid the protesters and complete the lap.\n\n"}

However, the teachers do it in an improper way, leading the boys to wage war against the girls.\n\nCartman and Kenny learn from the 5th graders that \"milking\" a dog is possible, when it is in fact just stimulating a dog to the point of ejaculation. They show the act to Stan and Kyle, who are impressed.\n\nStan performs the technique on his own dog Sparky in front of his parents and their friends during a book club meeting, for which he is grounded for ten months. Stan cannot understand why he is being punished, as his parents are too embarrassed to explain sexual stimulation to him, and decide that the school should be responsible for teaching sex education.\n\nMr. Mackey tries to teach the fourth grade boys about a male anatomy and female anatomy and the mechanics of sexual intercourse. Not having had sex since he was 19, Mr. Mackey cannot teach the boys anything of use. Ms. Choksondik, intending to scare the girls into safe sex, spends her lesson teaching the girls about all the different types of STDs that they might catch if the boys are not wearing condoms, but does not mention that in order to catch these diseases, they would first need to have sex. The boys try talking to Chef, the only person who actually has had much sexual experience, but he (who was opposed to the sex ed class and wanted the children to keep their naivety) doesn't tell them anything. The girls become so terrified of the boys that upon being approached by them at lunch, they back away and scream in fright when they learn the boys aren't wearing condoms. Afraid they will spread a disease, the boys go to the pharmacy to purchase condoms.\n\nHearing from the pharmacist that condoms were purchased, the school believes this is due to the students being sexually active. As a result, Ms. Choksondik says they should start teaching kindergarten students about sex education. \n\nMs. Choksondik teaches the girls about pregnancy, which scares them even more than before when she shows them a detailed video of childbirth. The boys then buy the condoms and wear them at all times, not understanding how they work. Mr. Mackey tells them they are only worn during sexual intercourse. Angry that the girls misled them, and thinking that the girls are the ones carrying diseases, they come to believe that they must get rid of the girls. The girls build a massive fort to keep the boys out. The boys tell them to leave town in a siege reminiscent of \"Mad Max 2\", but the girls refuse and attack the boys (killing Kenny with a boomerang), which escalates into a battle.\n\nWhile preparing the lesson plan, Ms. Choksondik and Mr. Mackey become aroused by the sexual nature of their conversation, and admit to having sexual fantasies about each other. The two undress, and engage in unprotected sexual intercourse.\n\nMeanwhile, the battle draws the attention of the adults and the parents, who get angry at the children for the conflict. Ms. Choksondik apologizes to the girls for not telling them that an STD is transmitted through sexual intercourse.\n\nChef, however, states that the parents are to blame since they were so quick to let the schools handle sex education rather than teach it to their kids themselves. The episode ends with Cartman stimulating another dog as everyone looks on without any objection.\n\nOver the closing credits, Garrison can be heard still teaching kindergarteners different sexual positions.\n\nIn Australia, this episode received an MA rating, due to its strong sexual content throughout, and graphic violence near the end of the episode. Because of its content, this episode also aired at 9:00 at night instead of the programme's usual 8:30 timeslot. The British satellite channel Sky One refused to air this episode for its strong sexual and violent content, even though it aired a TV trailer with scenes from the episode. The UK terrestrial channel Channel 4 and the UK cable channels Paramount Comedy 1 and MTV UK aired the episode with no edits made. Also, this episode is not aired on television syndication in the United States and has only been shown on Comedy Central.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to drastically shorten the part where Garrison demonstrates how to put on a condom by using his mouth with a condom around the lips and deep-throating the model penis used in the lesson. They retained the scene for when the show originally aired, but repeat episodes cut Garrison putting his lips on the dildo to the children staring in shock at what Garrison is doing off-screen.\n\nIn the episode Mr. Mackey states he has not had sex in \"about 21 years\" despite the fact that in the episode \"Ike's Wee Wee\" Mackey got briefly married and went on a honeymoon in India. Similarly, Mackey tells Choksondik that, while growing up, his head \"just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of [his] body stayed the same\", contradicting the explanation for Mackey's large head provided in \"Ike's Wee Wee\" in which Mackey's head shrunk back to a regular size when he removed his tie. \n\n\"Proper Condom Use\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n\"Proper Condom Use\" was released on DVD in June 2002, along with the episodes \"Cripple Fight,\" \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" and \"It Hits the Fan\", on a video titled \"Insults to Injuries\".\n\n"}

These films are typically preceded by the disclaimer, \"\"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content\".\" Reasons for this type of editing may range from the distributor's demands to accommodating different audience groups. Fan-made movie edits are often met with controversy, as they bring up issues of copyright law.\n\nThere are three main types of film editing: format, length, and content.\n\nThere are two main techniques for re-editing films:\n\nPurchased film content is downloaded onto an editing work station hard drive and third-party editors manually re-edit the video and audio tracks, removing objectionable content. The re-edited version is then copied onto media (VHS or DVD) and made available for rental or purchase provided an original version has been purchased in correlation with the re-edited copy. Some manual re-edits are done by fans (see \"The Phantom Edit\") to cut a film to their own – or their peers – specifications.\n\nAlthough the recent court ruling prohibits business from manually re-editing commercial films, the law still allows for individuals to self censor and edit their own films for personal use.\n\nProgrammed re-editing occurs when software (such as that employed in a DVD player) is used to skip portions of the video and/or audio content on-the-fly according to pre-programmed instruction sets which are knowingly used by the consumer.\n\nIn any case, theatrical films that aired on television in the 1970s and most of the 1980s would simply have an \"Edited For Television\" disclaimer superimposed right after the opening credits, or, in a few cases, superimposed over the movie title card itself, just below the title. However, today, when a theatrical film or television special is aired on network or syndicated television or is re-issued on video in a form different from its original version, variations of the following disclaimers appear:\n\nEarly cases of this practice go back to the Nazis, who regularly stole prints of American movies from European countries during their Blitzkrieg raids. They would then either cheaply reanimate the movie (see \"Hochzeit im Korallenmeer\"), or they would change the names in the credits (as with Max and David Fleischer's cartoons).\n\nAs theatrical movies began to air on television, networks successfully sought permission to air shortened versions of movies. These TV version of theatrical films had scenes or sections of movies cut out, in order to provide a length short enough to fit in fixed number normal television half-hour-based time slots (often four half-hour slots). This also allowed scenes unsuitable for television to be cut or trimmed such as those with sex or graphic violence. On the other hand, networks would also often add footage deleted from a film's theatrical release to pad out a certain running time (3 to 4 hours).\n\nIn response to consumer demand, families began to re-edit purchased VHS tapes literally by making cuts and splices to the tape. A hotbed for this activity has been Utah with its conservative and entrepreneurial population. When \"Titanic\" was released on VHS, a video store owner in Utah began offering to re-edit purchased copies of the film for a $5 service fee. The service became very popular. Before long, several video rental businesses purchased VHS tapes and had them re-edited for their rental club/co-op members to watch.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, some small companies began selling copies of movies, without the violent, indecent or foul language parts, to appeal to the family audience. By 2003, Hollywood reacted against these unauthorized modifications, as it considered them to be a destruction of the filmmakers work, and a violation of the controls an author has over his or her works. Famous directors and producers, such as Steven Spielberg, have publicly criticized this practice in magazines.\n\nWhen DVD technology emerged, the re-editing industry began offering for sale or rental a disabled DVD accompanied by a re-edited version of the film on a coupled DVD-R Several companies attempted this business. First, some tried to do it via physical brick and mortar stores, the most successful being the deal model and proprietary stores owned by CleanFlicks, Inc. of Utah. Clean Films later became the largest and most successful company in the business by employing an online rental model (similar to Netflix) and avoiding any physical stores. CleanFlicks and CleanFilms were sued with several others and a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the companies were violating copyright. Those named in the lawsuit ceased renting and selling edited films. The legal argument was that the editing resulted in a derivation on a fixed media. At all times, for instance, CleanFilms sold edited films with a legitimately purchased original copy. Furthermore, every rented unit in edited format had a corresponding original copy that was purchased at retail. The judge ruled that the fixed media caused the violation. ClearPlay was not affected by this ruling, as they did not sell fixed media, and editing took place as the unaltered streamed media was altered by the consumer's control of ClearPlay's software.\n\nThe lawsuit started because a CleanFlicks franchisee in Colorado pre-emptively sued major directors. The franchisee feared the directors were going to sue because the DGA's website said as much. The Directors Guild of America and the Motion Picture Association of America counter-sued and also included several edited film companies for copyright infringement and claims regarding derivative works. In 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado ruled that it was a copyright violation to distribute re-edited films without the consent from the film studios (key was the fixed media aspect of the businesses).\n\nIn an odd twist, despite Judge Matsch's decision and order to the re-editing companies to destroy all their re-edited inventory, shortly after the studios' victory in the Denver court, the lawyers for the studios negotiated with lawyers for the re-editing companies allowing for the sale of existing inventory. One of the companies in the first three days of a \"going out of business sale\" generated more than a quarter of a million dollars in revenue and eventually sold enough re-edited movies to provide original investors a five times or better return on investment. This is an unexpected investor outcome given the loss of a major infringement case.\n\nLess controversial than external bodies editing movies were the rise of director's cut editions of movies, which flourished with the advent of DVDs. These restore (and occasionally also shorten or omit, as in the case of Alien) scenes or footage from movies which had been shortened for whatever reason (including studio interference with the directors creative vision, inability to finish what was intended due to technology, or even the reactions of test audiences).\n\nClearPlay was sued by the DGA and MPAA, but the case was rendered moot by The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, which clarified that ClearPlay's filtering approach was legal and did not violate copyright law. As a result, ClearPlay has been able to offer its products to consumers in the U.S. while others have discontinued for legal reasons.\n\nAnother aspect of re-editing comes with consumer made edits, which are called fan edits (or fanedits). It is when consumers load the films into their computers and use video editing software to produce mostly a version with changed content for their own entertainment. Fan edits are becoming more popular since they are spread over the internet.\n\nIt is unclear where this industry is headed. There is demand for the product. A 2005 ABC News poll of 1,002 adults from across the United States found that 39% of those polled were interested in purchasing re-edited films, while 58% of respondents said that would not be interested in such a purchase (with a 3-point error margin).\n\nDespite the aforementioned legal rulings, companies continue to sell re-edited movies via the Internet. Some have been shut down as well. Yet, search engine results on the web reveal companies continue to provide fixed media products, such as Clean Play DVDs. Sometimes they use \"going out of business\" tactics to move inventory. However, physical \"brick and mortar\" stores have been shut down, such as Cougar Video in Provo, Utah, which remained open long after the named companies in the aforementioned lawsuit were closed down.\n\nOne company, Swank, offers re-edited movies created by the studios themselves, supposedly for showings in correctional facilities and other non-theatrical locations. It is not clear if these versions are the same re-edited versions that studios create for airlines or television showings.\n\n"}

UBA is the national member society representing Belgium in the International Amateur Radio Union.\n\nThe UBA was founded on 25 January 1947, when separate amateur radio organizations based in Flanders and Wallonia merged. The Réseau Belge (literally, \"Belgian Network\") was founded in September, 1923 in Brussels and drew its membership primarily from the French-speaking radio amateurs in Brussels and Wallonia. In February 1926, the Réseau Belge began publishing a membership magazine called \"QSO\". Flemish amateur radio operators were eager to see Dutch language articles in \"QSO\", but were unable to persuade the editor of Réseau Belge to publish them. With the support of the publisher of a small Dutch language magazine called \"Radio\", the Vlaamsche Radio Bond (\"Flemish Radio Association\") was founded in Ghent on September 22, 1929. The new organization established its own magazine called \"CQ VRB\". After World War II, the two organizations agreed to combine into a unified national radio society for Belgium.\n\nOn January 9, 2001, the Royal Union of Belgian Radio Amateurs was officially recognised as an amateur association by ministerial decree under legislation dealing with the establishment of amateur radio stations.\n\nUBA supports amateur radio operators in Belgium by sponsoring amateur radio operating awards, radio contests, and Amateur Radio Direction Finding competitions. The UBA also operates a QSL bureau for those members who regularly communicate with amateur radio operators in other countries. UBA represents the interests of Belgian amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners before Belgian and international telecommunications regulatory authorities. The UBA also publishes a monthly membership magazine called \"CQ QSO\".\n"}

For example with countries such as San Escobar or Belize\".\n\nA governmental spokeswoman said it had been a slip of the tongue for \"San Cristóbal y Nieves\", which is Spanish for Saint Kitts and Nevis. News about San Escobar swept over numerous media outlets all over the world.\n\nAs a result, the country gained a significant presence on the Internet, and was spontaneously given a fictitious identity on social media (Twitter, Facebook), including a flag (blue, white, and green stripes, with a yellow 5-pointed star in a red triangle), photos and maps. The Facebook page was created by Jarek Kubicki, a member of the Razem political party. Within a day the hashtag #SanEscobar was tracked by over 2 million people and has become the most popular within the Polish segment of Twitter. San Escobar has also become a subject of numerous joke news, e.g. about an appointment of a military attaché and its nice ecology. A good deal of them play upon drug lord Pablo Escobar, popularized via the TV series \"Narcos\".\n\nA Twitter account for 'República Popular Democrática de San Escobar' (@rpdsanescobar) was established, which quickly rose to prominence. It announced full support for Waszczykowski in his endeavor, and proceeded to issuing various news releases in Spanish and English, including a reproach towards Saint Kitts and Nevis: the correction of the Polish spokeswoman was interpreted as an attempt to foil Poland—San Escobar relations. San Escobar issues a newspaper, \"San Escobar Times\" (also on Twitter). San Escobar has also become a popular travel destination via El Niño Airlines. For a while the phrase \"Maybe I better drop it all and fly to San Escobar?\" has become very popular (Polish: „A może rzucić to wszystko i polecieć do San Escobar?”, a play with the Polish saying \"A może rzucić to wszystko i wyjechać w Bieszczady\"). Ticketing service Fru wrote that there are only one-way tickets to San Escobar. Netflix (the creator of \"Narcos\") also allegedly claimed it already has airline tickets to sell. For a while Wikipedia had a full-blown article about the country, including its population count, capital city (Santo Subito), and all. Other accounts were soon created for political and other entities within San Escobar, like one for 'El Frente Comunista de San Escobar' (The Communist Front of San Escobar), which leads a guerrilla war against the fictional country's government.\n\nQuickly Waszczykowski became a target of all kinds of derision. For example, a newspaper published suggestions of other countries for Waszczykowski to consider, such as San Serriffe or various micronations.\n\nOn January 20, 2017 Comedy Central Poland recorded an anthem of San Escobar sung by Eric Cartman, an animated \"South Park\" character.\n\nWaszczykowski has won the listener's poll \"Silver Lips\" for 2017 for the most surprizing or funniest utterance by a Polish politician, carried out by Polskie Radio Program III. While receiving the award, Waszczykowski commented: \"I'd rather expect the note of recognition from the Geographical Society. It did not arrive.\" \n\nThe phenomenon of San Escobar became a subject of a scholarly paper.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "299409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299409", "title": "Schlager music", "text": "Schlager music\n\n\"For people with the surname, see Schlager (surname).\"\nSchlager music (, \"hit(s)\") is a style of popular music which is generally a catchy instrumental accompaniment to vocal pieces of pop music with easy to understand, happy-go-lucky and often sentimental lyrics. It is prevalent in Central and Northern Europe, and Southeast Europe (in particular Germany, Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Poland, Hungary, Switzerland, Turkey, Scandinavia and the Baltic States), and also (to a lesser extent) in France, Belgium, Netherlands and the UK. In the United States it is also known as 'entertainer music' or 'German hit mix'.\n\nThe style emerged in Europe after the Second World War, partly as a backlash against American rock and roll, and uses simple patterns of music. Typical schlager tracks are either sweet, highly sentimental ballads with a simple, catchy melody or light pop tunes. Lyrics typically center on love, relationships and feelings. The northern variant of schlager (notably in Finland) has taken elements from Nordic and Slavic folk songs, with lyrics tending towards melancholic and elegiac themes. Musically, schlager bears similarities to styles such as easy listening music.\n\nThe German word \"Schlager\" (itself a calque of the English word \"hit\") is also a loanword in some other languages (Hungarian, Russian, Hebrew, Romanian, for example), where it retained its meaning of a \"(musical) hit\". The style has been frequently represented at the Eurovision Song Contest and has been popular since the contest began in 1956, although it is gradually being replaced by other pop music styles.\n\nOver time, schlager music has gradually shifted on to electronic music rather than generic pop music, due to its widespread use of synthesizers throughout its various implementations in the recent decades.\n\nDutch schlager is called \"levenslied\" (literally 'life song', \"i.e.\" 'song about real life'). It is a sentimental, Dutch-language subgenre of pop music. Typical \"levenslied\" lyrics treat subjects such as love, misery, and nostalgia, besides longing for sunny, exotic holiday places. A typical \"levenslied\" has catchy, simple rhythms and melodies (in common with many pop and folk tunes) and is structured in couplets and refrains. Traditional instruments in \"levenslied\" music are the accordion and the barrel organ. For example Nicole and Hugo.\n\nThe roots of Finnish schlager () date back to the interwar period, when popular singers included Georg Malmstén and Matti Jurva. A particularly notable song was opera singer Ture Ara's \"Emma\" in 1929. Schlager tradition had (and still has) an important place in Finnish popular music, and its melodic language has also influenced Finnish rock. Schlager music shares its audience with Finnish tango music, since both are popular among older and even middle-aged Finns. A particular feature of Finnish schlager music were \"translation schlagers\" (). Noteworthy Finnish schlager composers include Juha Vainio. According to the polls conducted among Finnish audiences, \"\"Hopeinen kuu\", (originally \"Guarda che luna\" by Walter Malgoni and Bruno Pallesi), recorded in Finnish by Olavi Virta and \"Satulinna\"\" (composed by Jukka Kuoppamäki and sung by Jari Sillanpää) are the most popular Finnish schlagers of all time.\n\nThe roots of German schlager are old: the word refers to songs by Heinz Rühmann and other movie actors/ singers of the 1930s. The antecessor of the schlager might be the operettas, which were extremely famous in the early twentieth century. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Comedian Harmonists and Rudi Schuricke laid the foundations for this new type of music. Well-known schlager singers during the 1950s and the early 1960s include Lale Andersen, Freddy Quinn, Ivo Robić, Gerhard Wendland, Caterina Valente, Margot Eskens and Conny Froboess. Schlager reached its peak in popularity in Germany and Austria during the 1960s (featuring Peter Alexander and Roy Black) and the early 1970s. From the mid-to-late 1990s into the early 2000s, however, German-language \"schlager\" saw an extensive revival in Germany by, for example, Guildo Horn, , Michelle and . Even reputable dance clubs would put in a stretch of schlager titles during the course of an evening, and numerous new bands specialising in 1970s schlager cover versions and \"new\" material were formed. In Hamburg, schlager fans still (as of 2013) gather annually by the hundreds of thousands and dress in 1970s clothing for a street parade called \"Schlager Move\". Due to its popularity, the Schlager Move brand is also used for a number of smaller Schlager music parties in several major German cities throughout the year. This revival is associated with kitsch and camp.\nGermans view Schlager as their country music and in fact American country and Tex-Mex music are both major elements in the Schlager culture (Is This the Way to Amarillo is regularly played in Schlager contexts, usually in the English original).\n\nPopular Schlager singers include Michael Wendler, Roland Kaiser, Hansi Hinterseer, Jürgen Drews, Andrea Berg, Helene Fischer, Nicole, Claudia Jung, Andrea Jürgens, Michelle, Kristina Bach, Marianne Rosenberg, Simone Stelzer, Christian Lais, Semino Rossi, Vicky Leandros, , DJ Ötzi and Andreas Gabalier who was voted best 'Schlager' singer in 2012. Stylistically, schlager continues to influence German \"party pop\": music most often heard in après-ski bars and Majorcan mass discos. Contemporary schlager is often mingled with Volkstümliche Musik. If it is not part of an ironic kitsch revival, a taste for both styles of music is commonly associated with a lower and lower middle class habitus, typically heard in folksy pubs, at fun fairs, and bowling league venues.\nBetween 1975 and 1981 German-style schlager has become more disco-oriented, in fact in many ways merging with the mainstream disco music of the time. Singers like Marianne Rosenberg were recording both schlager and disco hits which sounded pretty much the same.\n\nThe song \"Moskau\" by Dschinghis Khan was widely recognized as one of the earliest form of modern, dance-based schlager, and that again proves that schlager of the 70-s and early 80-s basically evolved into a mainstream disco and Euro-disco. German band Dschinghis Khan was primarily a disco band that performed and recorded both disco and disco-influenced schlager music.\n\nIn Sweden, schlager has waxed and waned in popularity since at least the 1930s. It still enjoys a large place in Swedish culture, although it is considered to be too \"popular and commercial\" by many people. Although the original schlager was heavily influenced by operettas, cabaret- and variety-style music and jazz, this started to change during the 1960s and 1970s when schlager music became more pop-oriented. Since the early 1990s, schlager songs began to include elements of rock and techno. Therefore, modern schlager music little resembles that of the 1940s. Despite this, many old schlager tunes are still popular; they are performed by many artists and at the Allsång på Skansen.\nThe Melodifestival (which selects the Swedish competitor at the Eurovision Song Contest) is popularly also called \"Schlagerfestivalen\" (\"the Schlager Festival\") or Schlager-SM (Swedish schlager championship), since it has traditionally been characterised by schlager songs. The Eurovision Song Contest has also been called \"Eurovisionsschlagerfestivalen\" (Eurovision schlager festival) or schlager-EM (\"European schlager championship\"). The amount of schlager has decreased drastically in recent years, but schlager songs are the most likely genre to win the competition (\"Evighet\" ( in 2006 by Carola and \"Hero\" by Charlotte Perrelli in 2008, for example). \"Melodifestivalen\" is the most popular TV program in Sweden. It is broadcast annually, and in 2006 an estimated 47 percent of the Swedish population watched the final. In Sweden \"schlager\" is often used to refer to Eurovision-participating songs.\n\nTwo characteristics of Swedish schlager are a pronounced key change before the final chorus and their three-minute length (the maximum song length permitted at the Eurovision Song Contest). Some Swedes dispute the meaning of \"schlager\" with respect to Swedish music; it may be used indiscriminately to describe all popular music, \"older-sounding\" popular music, \"Melodifestivalen\" songs, Eurovision songs, songs with a \"catchy\" chorus or dansband music. Both Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA were influenced by schlager music early in their careers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, schlager is often categorized simply as pop. The style has long been popular there, especially between the 1950s and 1980s, with singers such as Tony Christie, who enjoyed success among schlager audiences in both Germany and the UK; Engelbert Humperdinck, most notably with schlager hit \"Release Me\"; and Petula Clark, who gained her first number 1 in the UK Singles Chart with \"Sailor\", the English schlager version of \"Seemann (Deine Heimat ist das Meer)\", originally performed by Austrian singer Lolita. Artists from other countries have also had schlager hits in the UK. American singers Al Martino and Roy Orbison both entered the British charts with schlager hits \"Blue Spanish Eyes\" and \"Only the Lonely\" respectively. Billy Fury's \"Halfway to Paradise\" reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. From the Netherlands and the UK, Dutch band Pussycat reached number 1 with the song \"Mississippi\". German and Austrian singers have also had hits in the UK, such as German singer Nicole reached the UK chart with \"A Little Peace\" peaking at number 1. The song won Germany the Eurovision Song Contest in 1982. The UK has itself entered many schlager artists into the Eurovision Song Contest, for example music group Brotherhood of Man won for the UK in 1976 with \"Save Your Kisses for Me\".\n\nGerman schlager, although mainly sung in German including volksmusik and its modern version volkstümliche Musik, has attracted a small fan base in the United Kingdom, including BBC Radio Manchester commentator Ian Cheeseman. Germany's current top selling schlager singer Helene Fischer released the album \"The English Ones\" in 2010 with several versions of her German language hits in English for her English speaking fans of schlager music. British schlager singers including Ross Antony, Tony Christie and Roger Whittaker have appeared on shows such as \"Musikantenstadl\" and \"ZDF Fernsehgarten\".\n\nThe first schlager music in the former Yugoslavia began to appear in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The first (and most influential) festival of schlager music was the Zagreb Festival of Popular Music (later known as Zagrebfest), which began in 1953 and still takes place annually in Zagreb. Many schlagers () performed at Zagrebfest over the past five decades are an integral part of the Croatian and Yugoslav pop-music scene. The first schlager singers were Ivo Robić and Rajka Vali, but over time Zagreb school of schlagers came to include such singers as Vice Vukov, Arsen Dedić, Hrvoje Hegedušić, Ivica Percl, Gabi Novak, Frano Lasić, Jasna Zlokić, Zdravko Čolić, and many others. Main composers of schlagers included Fedor Kopsa, Krešimir Oblak, Ferdo Pomykalo, Miljenko Prohaska, Nikica Kalogjera, Bojan Hohnjec, Vanja Lisak, Zvonko Špišić, Ivica Stamać and Hrvoje Hegedušić. Some Zagrebfest artists (such as Ivo Robić and Tereza Kesovija) would later have successful careers in Germany and France. Other pioneers of schlagers include Darko Kraljić (from Zagreb), who worked in Belgrade. He is best known by his hit \"Čamac na Tisi\" (sung by Lola Novaković and popular in revolutionary Hungary) and his music for the film \"Ljubav i moda\" (\"Devojko mala\" and \"Pod sjajem zvezda\", performed by Vokalni kvartet Predraga Ivanovića).\n\nSchlager became popular in the 1950s Turkey. The first, most popular artist to publish schlager in Turkey was Ajda Pekkan. She published a lot of Schlager music, before shifting her genre to schlager-disco pop. Furthermore her stage name \"Diva\" is caused by Schlager. There are many singers in this genre today, such as Tarkan, Burcu Güneş, Petek Dinçöz, Aylin Vatankoş, Nilüfer Yumlu, Erol Evgin, Funda Arar and Hülya Avşar.\n\n"}

It is the sequel to \"Shanghai Noon\". Directed by David Dobkin and written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.\n\nIn 1887, Chon Lin (Fann Wong) tells her father (Kim Chan), the Keeper of the Imperial Seal of China in the Forbidden City, that her brother, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), is doing well as a sheriff in Carson City, Nevada, but her father replies that her brother is dead to him. At that moment, Lord Nelson Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), leads a band of Boxers into the city, who attack the Keeper. Despite Lin's efforts, her father is killed and the seal is stolen. With his last breath, he gives Lin a box and tells her to give it to her brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Chon Wang is doing well as sheriff, having captured an impressive array of fugitives. His deputy (Matt Hill) is relaxing with a book called \"Roy O'Bannon Vs. The Mummy\", a highly fictionalized account of the events of the first film that now portrays Wang's \"Shanghai Kid\" as a cowardly sidekick, which dismays Wang. Wang receives a parcel containing a puzzle box and a letter from Lin telling him that their father is dead and that she has tracked the murderer to London.\n\nChon Wang travels to New York City to find his old partner Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). and uses his share of the first film's gold to buy a ticket to London. Chon finds that Roy has left his brief stint in law enforcement, broken off his romance with Falling Leaves, spent most of the gold investing in the Zeppelin, and is now a hotel waiter and part-time gigolo. (Later Roy reveals that he has lost all of the gold on publishing his novels). After they attempt prostitution to pay for a trip to the United Kingdom, the Mayor of New York arrives in search of his daughters who are Roy's latest clients. The pair escapes and ship themselves to London in a crate.\n\nIn London, Wang and O'Bannon have their duster and watch stolen, respectively, by a number of street thugs including a young boy named Charlie (Aaron Johnson). After an extensive battle to reclaim these items, they are arrested by the police. In Scotland Yard, Inspector Artie Doyle (Thomas Fisher) thanks the two for defeating the Fleet Street gang. He tells Wang that Lin is also in Scotland Yard, having attempted to kill Lord Rathbone. Meanwhile, Rathbone finds he is not alone in his carriage as Wu Chow (Donnie Yen) has sneaked his way on; Rathbone slips him the dagger that killed the Keeper of the Imperial Seal. Sometime later, Roy and Wang wander through London and see Buckingham Palace. They encounter Charlie, who lets them into the empty house of a nobleman and finds an invitation to a gala at the castle.\n\nRoy and Wang arrive that night at the gala, wearing disguises: Roy masquerades as Major General \"Sherlock Holmes\" (a name he derives from the face of a clock), and Wang is the \"Maharaja of Nevada\". Wang and Roy follow Lord Rathbone to a private library, but Rathbone slips quickly through a secret passage before they can reach him. As Roy occupies himself with a copy of the \"Kama Sutra\", Wang looks for the secret passage and discovers it in the fireplace. Wang enters the secret room, which contains treasures from throughout the British Empire and asks for Roy's help which Roy repeatedly ignores, as he thinks it is something minor, and continues to read his book. Rathbone's guards then attack Roy, but he is rescued by Lin, who has escaped from Scotland Yard. The three see Rathbone hand the Imperial Seal to Wu Chow, the illegitimate brother of the Emperor of China, which is then stolen by Charlie who leaves his hat. Rathbone spots the three, and after a brief battle, he sets the barn on fire and escapes, and then the three also manage to escape.\n\nThey find Artie drunk after being sacked at his home. Artie deduces that Charlie is in Madame Tussauds by inspecting Charlie's hat. They arrive just in time to save Charlie from the Boxers at the expense of losing the seal again and being captured outside by police. Taken away in a police buggy, they are rescued in turn by Charlie, who later reveals his full name to be Charlie Chaplin. After an interlude in a brothel where Wang tries to convince Lin that Roy is unsuitable, Roy has overheard this and is upset with Wang, but forgives him when Roy arranges a pillow fight with the ladies of the night. When Lin sees this she runs into the night followed by Roy and Wang. They are all captured by Rathbone, who tells them that he is going to kill the royal family and frame \"Loony\" Lin. They escape and manage to stop Wu Chow from killing the royal family. Just as Wu Chow is about to kill Wang, Lin blasts and kills him with a rocket. The three then follow Rathbone to the top of Big Ben. He throws Roy out of the tower, but he survives when he grabs a hand of the clock. Thinking Roy is dead, Wang fights with Rathbone, and the pair is both thrown outside. Roy saves Wang as Rathbone falls to his death.\n\nRoy and Wang are knighted, as is Artie, whose full name is now revealed to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Artie decides to become a writer of detective stories revolving around his deductive reasoning technique, and asks Roy if he can use the \"Sherlock Holmes\" name. Roy proposes that he and Wang go to Hollywood to get in on the ground floor with motion pictures. They roll off in a buggy, with Charlie (wearing a fake mustache) stowed away. Wang also manages to open the box his father sent him, finding a message inside reminding him of the importance of family.\n\n\n\nDirector David Dobkin was personally chosen by Jackie Chan. Director David Dobkin had a difficult time choosing a suitable Asian actress who could do movement work, emote well and speak excellent English. He then saw clips of Fann Wong's videos \"Wo lai ye\" (2001) and \"Qing she yu bai she\" (2001) and requested to audition her in London, which she did attend. She subsequently got the role and her number of scenes was increased by thirty percent.\n\nAside from establishing shots of iconic landmarks, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nThe film has received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and holds a fresh score of 66% at Rotten Tomatoes. It holds a Metacritic score of 58 out of 100.\n\nA third film was meant to be produced under the title \"Shanghai Dawn\". Plans for the film were posted on Jackie Chan's website, but after some news of casting and production plans, no film has been produced. While unconfirmed, it is speculated that the project has been halted indefinitely as there is no news nor a release date. In a February 7, 2003, interview, Owen Wilson said: \"We're talking about it maybe starting in Hollywood and then going from there to Africa or the Pyramids ... I feel like we have the freedom to take them anywhere in time we want.\"\n\nOn May 14, 2015, MGM announced that they are moving forward with \"Shanghai Dawn\". Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu and Owen Wilson are expected to reprise their roles as Chon Wang, Princess Pei-Pei and Roy O'Bannon respectively. In September 2016, Jared Hess signed on as director for the film while both Millar and Gough will develop a screen story with Theodore Riley and Aaron Buchsbaum writing the script for the film.\n\nIn November 2016, Gough said the third film will be set in China because Chan \"wants to showcase China in the way that the first film showcased the old West.\" Gough added that Chan and Wilson also have a hand in the creative process, saying \"With those films, the collaboration of Jackie and Owen comes out on screen as they get along very well. With that in mind, you want to get their input in the story phase, so that when we got to script, it's based into the DNA of the story.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "284613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=284613", "title": "Sound editor (filmmaking)", "text": "Sound editor (filmmaking)\n\nA sound editor is a creative professional responsible for selecting and assembling sound recordings in preparation for the final sound mixing or mastering of a television program, motion picture, video game, or any production involving recorded or synthetic sound. Sound editing developed out of the need to fix the incomplete, undramatic, or technically inferior sound recordings of early talkies, and over the decades has become a respected filmmaking craft, with sound editors implementing the aesthetic goals of motion picture sound design.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing with the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.\n\nThere are primarily three divisions of sound that are combined to create a final mix, these being dialogue, effects, and music. In larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles, sound editors often specialize in only one of these areas, thus a show will have separate dialogue, effects, and music editors. In smaller markets, sound editors are expected to know how to handle it all, often crossing over into the mixing realm as well. Editing effects is likened to creating the sonic world from scratch, while dialogue editing is likened to taking the existing sonic world and fixing it. Dialogue editing is more accurately thought of as \"production sound editing\", where the editor takes the original sound recorded on the set, and using a variety of techniques, makes the dialogue more understandable, as well as smoother, so the listener doesn't hear the transitions from shot to shot (often the background sounds underneath the words change dramatically from take to take). Among the challenges that effects editors face are creatively adding together various elements to create believable sounds for everything you see on screen, as well as memorizing their sound effects library.\n\nThe essential piece of equipment used in modern sound editing is the digital audio workstation, or DAW. A DAW allows sounds, stored as computer files on a host computer, to be placed in timed synchronization with a motion picture, mixed, manipulated, and documented. The standard DAW system in use by the American film industry, as of 2012, is Avid's Pro Tools, with the majority running on Macs. Another system in use presently is Yamaha owned Steinberg's cross platform DAW Nuendo running on Macs using operating system Mac OS X but also on Windows XP. Other systems historically used for sound editing were:\n\nThe WaveFrame, Fairlights, and Audiofile were of the \"integrated\" variety of DAW, and required the purchase of expensive proprietary hardware and specialized computers (not standard PCs or Macs). Of the two surviving systems, Pro Tools still requires some proprietary hardware (either a low cost portable device such as the \"Mbox\" or the more expensive multichannel A/D,D/A converters for more professional high end applications), while Nuendo (a successor to Cubase) is of the \"host based\" variety.\n\nSound-effects editors typically use an organized catalog of sound recordings from which sound effects can be easily accessed and used in film soundtracks. There are several commercially distributed sound-effects libraries available, the two most well-known publishers being Sound Ideas and The Hollywood Edge. Online search engines, such as Sounddogs, A Sound Effect and Sonniss allow users to purchase sound effects libraries from a large online database.\n\nMany sound effects editors make their own customized sound recordings which are accumulated into highly prized personal sound effects libraries. Often, sound effects used in films will be saved and reused in subsequent films. One exemplary case in point is a recording known as the \"Wilhelm Scream\" which has become known for its repeated use in many famous films such as \"The Charge at Feather River\" (1953), Pierre Marette Story (1957), \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), and \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992). Credited with naming and popularizing this particular recording is sound designer Ben Burtt.\n\nThe first sound process to substantially displace silent films in the moviegoing market was the Vitaphone process. Under the Vitaphone process, a microphone recorded the sound performed on set directly to a phonograph master, which made Vitaphone recordings impossible to cut or resynchronize, as later processes would allow. This limited the Vitaphone process to capturing musical acts or one-take action scenes, like Vaudeville routines or other re-creations of stage performances; essentially, scenes that required no editing at all. However, Warner Brothers, even as early as \"The Jazz Singer\", began experimenting with the mixing of multiple phonograph recordings and intercutting between the \"master\" sync take and coverage of other angles. The original mixing console used to make the master recording of \"The Jazz Singer\", still viewable in the Warner Bros. Studio Museum, has no more than four or five knobs, but each is still visibly labeled with the basic \"groups\" that a modern sound designer would recognize: \"music\", \"crowd\", and so on.\n\nWarner Bros. developed increasingly sophisticated technology to sequence greater numbers of phonograph sound effects to picture using the Vitaphone system, but these were rendered obsolete with the widespread adoption of sound-on-film processes in the early 1930s.\n\nIn a sound-on-film process, a microphone captures sound and converts it into a signal that can be photographed on film. Since the recording is imposed linearly on the medium, and the medium is easily cut and glued, sounds recorded can be easily re-sequenced and separated onto separate tracks, allowing more control in mixing. Options expanded further when optical sound recording processes were replaced with magnetic recording in the 1950s. Magnetic recording offered a better signal-to-noise ratio, allowing more tracks to be played simultaneously without increasing noise on the full mix.\n\nThe greater number of options available to the editors led to more complex and creative sound tracks, and it was in this period that a set of standard practices became established which continued until the digital era, and many of the notional concepts are still at the core of sound design, computerized or not:\n\n\nHistorically the Dubbing Mixer (UK) or Re-Recording Mixer (US) was the specialist who mixed all the audio tracks supplied by the Dubbing Editor (with the addition of 'live sounds' such as Foley) in a special Dubbing Suite. As well as mixing, he would introduce equalization, compression and filtered sound effects, etc. while seated at a large console. Often two or three mixers would sit alongside, each controlling sections of audio, e.g., dialogue, music, effects.\n\nIn the era of optical sound tracks, it was difficult to mix more than eight tracks at once without accumulating excessive noise. At the height of magnetic recording, 200 tracks or more could be mixed together, aided by Dolby noise reduction. In the digital era there is no limit. For example, a single predub can exceed a hundred tracks, and the final dub can be the sum of a thousand tracks.\n\nThe mechanical system of sound editing remained unchanged until the early 1990s, when digital audio workstations acquired features sufficient for use in film production, mainly, the ability to synchronize with picture, and the ability to play back many tracks at once with CD-quality fidelity. The quality of 16-bit audio at a 48 kHz sampling rate allowed hundreds of tracks to be mixed together\nwith negligible noise.\n\nThe physical manifestation of the work became computerized: sound recordings, and the decisions the editors made in assembling them, were now digitized, and could be versioned, done, undone, and archived instantly and compactly. In the magnetic recording era, sound editors owned trucks to ship their tracks to a mixing stage, and transfers to magnetic film were measured in hundreds of thousands of feet. Once the materials arrived at the stage, a dozen recordists and mix technicians required a half an hour to load the three or four dozen tracks a predub might require. In the digital era, 250 hours of stereo sound, edited and ready to mix, can be transported on a single 160 GB hard drive. As well, this 250 hours of material can be copied in four hours or less, as opposed to the old system, which, predictably, would take 250 hours.\n\nBecause of these innovations, sound editors, as of 2005, face the same issues as other computerized, \"knowledge-based\" professionals, including the loss of work due to outsourcing to cheaper labor markets, and the loss of royalties due to ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n\nIn the field of animation, traditionally the sound editors have been given the more prestigious title of \"film editor\" in screen credits. As animated films are more often than not planned to the frame, the traditional functions of a film editor are often unnecessary. Treg Brown is known to cartoon fans as the sound effects genius of Warner Bros. Animation. Other greats of the field have included Jimmy MacDonald of the Walt Disney Studios, Greg Watson and Don Douglas at Hanna-Barbera, and Joe Siracusa of UPA and various TV cartoon studios.\n\nIn the production of radio programs and music, persons who manipulate sound recordings are known simply as \"editors\", in cases where the producers themselves do not perform the task.\n\n"}
{"id": "27070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27070", "title": "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "text": "Star Trek: The Next Generation\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation (TNG and ST:TNG) is an American science fiction television series in the \"Star Trek\" franchise created by Gene Roddenberry that ran from 1987 to 1994. It follows the adventures of the starship USS \"Enterprise\"-D and its crew set in the Alpha Quadrant (nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy). \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" was the first live action \"Star Trek\" television series since the original \"\" went off the air in 1969. The first episode takes place in the year 2364, 99 years after the start of the five-year mission described in the original series, which began in 2265.\n\n\"TNG\" featured a new crew that starred (for the majority of its seven-year broadcast run) Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker, Brent Spiner as Lt Commander Data, Michael Dorn as Lieutenant Worf, LeVar Burton as Lt Commander Geordi La Forge, Marina Sirtis as counselor Deanna Troi, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, and a new \"Enterprise\". An introductory statement featured at the beginning of each episode's title sequence stated the ship's purpose in language similar to the opening statement of the original \"Star Trek\" series, but was updated to reflect an ongoing mission and to be gender-neutral: \n\nRoddenberry, Maurice Hurley, Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor served as executive producers at various times throughout its production. The show was very popular, reaching almost 12 million viewers in its 5th season, with the series finale in 1994 being watched by over 30 million viewers.\n\n\"TNG\" premiered the week of September 28, 1987, drawing 27 million viewers, with the two-hour pilot \"Encounter at Farpoint\". In total, 176 episodes were made (including several two-parters), ending with the two-hour finale \"\" the week of May 23, 1994. The series was broadcast in first-run syndication with dates and times varying among individual television stations. Several \"Star Trek\" series followed \"The Next Generation\": \"\" (1993–1999), \"\" (1995–2001), \"\" (2001–2005), and \"\" (2017–present). The series formed the basis for the seventh through the tenth of the \"Star Trek\" films, and is also the setting of numerous novels, comic books, and video games. In its seventh season, \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" became the first and only syndicated television series to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. The series received a number of accolades, including 19 Emmy Awards, two Hugo Awards, five Saturn Awards, and \"The Big Goodbye\" (S1E12) won a Peabody Award. Some of the highest rated episodes (by Nielsen ratings) were the pilot (\"Encounter at Farpoint\"), the finale (\"All Good Things...\"), the two-part \"\", \"Aquiel\", \"\", and \"\". Four episodes (\"Encounter at Farpoint\", \"Sarek\", \"Unification\", and \"Relics\") featured actors Leonard Nimoy, Mark Lenard, James Doohan, and DeForest Kelley from the original \"Star Trek\" reprising their original roles.\n\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" aired for 7 seasons beginning on September 28, 1987 and ending on May 23, 1994. \n\nThe series begins with the crew of the \"Enterprise\"-D put on trial by an omnipotent being known as Q, who became a recurring character. The god-like entity threatens the extinction of humanity for being a race of savages, forcing them to solve a mystery at nearby Farpoint Station to prove their worthiness to be spared. After successfully solving the mystery and avoiding disaster, the crew departs on its mission to explore strange new worlds.\n\nSubsequent stories focus on the discovery of new life and sociological and political relationships with alien cultures, as well as exploring the human condition. Several new species are introduced as recurring antagonists, including the Ferengi, the Cardassians, and the Borg. Throughout their adventures, Picard and his crew are often forced to face and live with the consequences of difficult choices.\n\nThe series ended in its seventh season with a two-part episode \"All Good Things...\", which brought the events of the series full circle to the original confrontation with Q. An interstellar anomaly that threatens all life in the universe forces Picard to leap from his present, past, and future to combat the threat. Picard was successfully able to show to Q that humanity could think outside of the confines of perception and theorize on new possibilities while still being prepared to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the greater good. The series ended with the crew of the \"Enterprise\" portrayed as feeling more like a family and paved the way for four consecutive motion pictures that continued the theme and mission of the series.\n\nAs early as 1972, Paramount Pictures started considering making a \"Star Trek\" film because of the show's popularity in syndication. However, with 1977's release of \"Star Wars\", Paramount decided not to compete in the science fiction movie category and shifted their efforts to a new \"Star Trek\" television series. The \"Original Series\" actors were approached to reprise their roles, sketches, models, sets and props were created for \"\" until Paramount changed its mind again and decided to create feature films starring the \"Original Series\" cast.\n\nBy 1986, 20 years after the original \"Star Trek\"s debut on NBC, the franchise's longevity amazed Paramount Pictures executives. Chairman Frank Mancuso Sr. and others described it as the studio's \"crown jewel\", a \"priceless asset\" that \"must not be squandered\". The series was the most popular syndicated television program 17 years after cancellation, and the Harve Bennett-produced, \"Original Series\"-era \"Star Trek\" films did well at the box office. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy's salary demands for the film \"\" (1986) caused the studio to plan for a new \"Star Trek\" television series. Paramount executives worried that a new series could hurt the demand for the films, but decided that it would increase their appeal on videocassette and cable, and that a series with unknown actors would be more profitable than paying the films' actors' large salaries. Roddenberry initially declined to be involved, but came on board as creator after being unhappy with early conceptual work. \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" was announced on October 10, 1986, and its cast in May 1987.\n\nParamount executive Rick Berman was assigned to the series at Roddenberry's request. Roddenberry hired a number of \"Star Trek\" veterans, including Bob Justman, D. C. Fontana, Eddie Milkis and David Gerrold. Early proposals for the series included one in which some of the original series cast might appear as \"elder statesmen\", and Roddenberry speculated as late as October 1986 that the new series might not even use a spaceship, as \"people might travel by some [other] means\" 100 years after the USS \"Enterprise\". A more lasting change was his new belief that workplace interpersonal conflict would no longer exist in the future; thus, the new series did not have parallels to the frequent \"crusty banter\" between Kirk, Spock, and Leonard McCoy. According to series actor Patrick Stewart, Berman was more receptive than Roddenberry to the series addressing political issues.\n\nThe series' music theme combined the fanfare from the original series theme by Alexander Courage with Jerry Goldsmith's theme for \"\" (1979). Some early episodes' plots derived from outlines created for \"Star Trek: Phase II\". Additionally, some sets used in the \"Original Series\"-era films were redressed for \"The Next Generation\", and in turn used for subsequent \"Original Series\" films. Part of the transporter room set in \"TNG\" was used in the original \"Star Trek\"s transporter set.\n\nDespite \"Star Trek\"s proven success, NBC and ABC only offered to consider pilot scripts for the new series, and CBS offered to air a miniseries that could become a series if it did well. That the Big Three television networks treated Paramount's most appealing and valuable property as they would any other series offended the studio. Fox wanted the show to help launch the new network, but wanted it by March 1987, and would only commit to 13 episodes instead of a full season. The unsuccessful negotiations convinced the studio that it could only protect \"Star Trek\" with full control.\n\nParamount increased and accelerated the show's profitability by choosing to instead broadcast it in first-run syndication on independent stations (whose numbers had more than tripled since 1980) and Big Three network affiliates. The studio offered the show to local stations for free as barter syndication. The stations sold five minutes of commercial time to local advertisers and Paramount sold the remaining seven minutes to national advertisers. Stations had to commit to purchasing reruns in the future, and only those that aired the new show could purchase the popular reruns of the \"Original Series\".\n\nThe studio's strategy succeeded. Most of the 150 stations airing reruns of the original \"Star Trek\" wanted to prevent a competitor from airing the new show; ultimately, 210 stations covering 90% of the United States became part of Paramount's informal nationwide network for \"TNG\". In early October 1987, more than 50 network affiliates pre-empted their own shows for the series pilot, \"Encounter at Farpoint\". One station predicted that \"\"Star Trek\" promises to be one of the most successful programs of the season, network or syndicated\".\n\nThe new show indeed performed well; the pilot's ratings were higher than those of many network programs, and ratings remained comparable to network shows by the end of the first season, despite the handicap of each station airing the show on a different day and time, often outside prime time. By the end of the first season, Paramount reportedly received $1 million for advertising per episode, more than the roughly $800,000 fee that networks typically paid for a one-hour show; by 1992, when the budget for each episode had risen to almost $2 million, the studio earned $90 million from advertising annually from first-run episodes, with each 30-second commercial selling for $115,000 to $150,000. The show had a 40% return on investment for Paramount, with $30 to $60 million in annual upfront net profit for first-run episodes and another $70 million for stripping rights for each of the about 100 episodes then available, so did not need overseas sales to be successful.\n\n\"The Next Generation\" was shot on 35mm film, and the budget for each episode was $1.3 million, among the largest for a one-hour television drama. While the staff enjoyed the creative freedom gained by independence from a broadcast network's Standards and Practices department, the first season was marked by a \"revolving door\" of writers, with Gerrold, Fontana, and others quitting after disputes with Roddenberry. Roddenberry \"virtually rewrote\" the first 15 episodes because of his \"dogmatic\" intention to depict human interaction \"without drawing on the baser motives of greed, lust, and power\". Writers found the show's \"bible\" constricting and ridiculous and could not deal with Roddenberry's ego and treatment of them. It stated, for example, that \"regular characters all share a feeling of being part of a band of brothers and sisters. As in the original \"Star Trek\", we invite the audience to share the same feeling of affection for our characters.\"\n\nMark Bourne of \"The DVD Journal\" wrote of season one: \"A typical episode relied on trite plot points, clumsy allegories, dry and stilted dialogue, or characterization that was taking too long to feel relaxed and natural.\" Other targets of criticism included poor special effects and plots being resolved by the \"deus ex machina\" of Wesley Crusher saving the ship. However, Patrick Stewart's acting skills won praise, and critics noted that characters were given greater potential for development than those of the original series. Both actors and producers were unsure whether Trekkies loyal to the original show would accept the new one, but one critic stated as early as October 1987 that \"The Next Generation\", not the movies or the original show, \"is the real \"Star Trek\" now\".\n\nWhile the events of most episodes of season one were self-contained, many developments important to the show as a whole occurred during the season. The recurring nemesis Q was introduced in the pilot, the alien Ferengi had their sentinel showing in \"\", the holodeck was introduced, and the romantic backstory between William Riker and Deanna Troi was investigated. \"The Naked Now\", one of the few episodes that depicted Roddenberry's fascination (as seen in the show's bible) with sex in the future, became a cast favorite.\n\nLater episodes in the season set the stage for serial plots. The episode \"Datalore\" introduced Data's evil twin brother Lore, who made several more appearances in episodes in subsequent seasons. \"\" dealt with Wesley Crusher's efforts to get into Starfleet Academy while also hinting at the threat to Starfleet later faced in \"\". \"Heart of Glory\" explored Worf's character, Klingon culture, and the uneasy truce between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, three themes that played major roles in later episodes. Tasha Yar left the show in \"Skin of Evil\", becoming the first regular Star Trek character to die permanently (although the character was seen again in two later episodes) in either series or film. The season finale, \"\", established the presence of two of \"TNG\" most enduring villains: the Romulans, making their first appearance since the \"Original Series\", and, through foreshadowing, the Borg.\n\nThe premiere became the first television episode to be nominated for a Hugo Award since 1972. Six of the season's episodes were each nominated for an Emmy Award. \"11001001\" won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, \"The Big Goodbye\" won for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series, and \"\" won for Outstanding Achievement in Makeup for a Series. \"The Big Goodbye\" also won a Peabody Award, the first syndicated program and only \"Star Trek\" episode to do so.\n\nThe top two episodes for Nielsen ratings were \"Encounter at Farpoint\" with 15.7, and \"Justice\" with 12.7. The season ran from 1987 to 1988.\n\nThe series underwent significant changes during its second season. Beverly Crusher was replaced as Chief Medical Officer by Katherine Pulaski, played by Diana Muldaur, who had been a guest star in \"Return to Tomorrow\" and \"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\", two episodes from the original \"Star Trek\" series. The ship's recreational area, Ten-Forward, and its mysterious bartender/advisor, Guinan, played by Whoopi Goldberg, appeared for the first time. Owing to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, the number of episodes produced was cut from 26 to 22, and the start of the season was delayed. Because of the strike, the opening episode, \"\", was based on a script originally written for \"\", while the season finale, \"\", was a clip show.\n\nNevertheless, season two as a whole was widely regarded as significantly better than season one. Benefiting from Paramount's commitment to a multiyear run and free from network interference due to syndication, Roddenberry found writers who could work within his guidelines and create drama from the cast's interaction with the rest of the universe. The plots became more sophisticated and began to mix drama with comic relief. Its focus on character development received special praise. Co-executive producer Maurice Hurley has stated that his primary goal for the season was to plan and execute season-long story arcs and character arcs. Hurley wrote the acclaimed episode \"Q Who\", which featured the first on-screen appearance of the Borg. Season two focused on developing the character Data, and two episodes from the season, \"Elementary, Dear Data\" and \"\", featured him prominently. Miles O'Brien also became a more prominent character during the second season, while Geordi La Forge took the position of Chief Engineer. Klingon issues continued to be explored in episodes such as \"A Matter of Honor\" and \"\", which introduced Worf's former lover K'Ehleyr. Five second-season episodes were nominated for six Emmy Awards, and \"Q Who\" won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series. The season ran from 1988 to 1989.\n\nBefore the production of the third season in the summer of 1989, some personnel changes were made. Head writer Maurice Hurley was let go and Michael Piller took over for the rest of the series. Creator and executive producer Gene Roddenberry took less of an active role due to his declining health. Roddenberry gave Piller and Berman the executive producer jobs, and they remained in that position for the rest of the series' run, with Berman overseeing the production as a whole and Piller being in charge of the creative direction of the show and the writing room. Doctor Crusher returned from her off-screen tenure at Starfleet Medical to replace Doctor Pulaski, who had remained a guest star throughout the second season. An additional change was the inclusion of the fanfare that was added to the opening credits of the second season, to the end of the closing credits. Ronald D. Moore joined the show after submitting a spec script that became \"The Bonding\". He became the franchise's \"Klingon guru\", meaning that he wrote most \"TNG\" episodes dealing with the Klingon Empire (though he wrote some Romulan stories, as well, such as \"\"). Writer/producer Ira Steven Behr also joined the show in its third season. Though his tenure with \"TNG\" lasted only one year, he later went on to be a writer and showrunner of spin-off series \"\". Six third-season episodes were nominated for eight Emmys. \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and \"\" won for Best Art Direction for a Series. After a chiropractor warned that the cast members risked permanent skeletal injury, new two-piece wool uniforms replaced the first two seasons' extremely tight spandex uniforms. The season finale, the critically acclaimed episode \"\", was the first season-ending cliffhanger, a tradition that continued throughout the remainder of the series. The season ran from 1989 to 1990.\n\nBrannon Braga and Jeri Taylor joined the show in its fourth season. The fourth season surpassed the \"Original Series\" in series length with the production of \"The Best of Both Worlds, Part II\". A new alien race, the Cardassians, made their first appearance in \"The Wounded\". They later were featured in \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\". The season finale, \"Redemption\", was the 100th episode, and the cast and crew (including creator Gene Roddenberry) celebrated the historic milestone on the bridge set. Footage of this was seen in the \"Star Trek\" 25th-anniversary special hosted by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy which aired later in the year. Seven fourth-season episodes were nominated for eight Emmys. \"\" won for both Outstanding Sound Editing in a Series and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Series. Character Wesley Crusher left the series in season four to go to Starfleet Academy. \"\" was the only \"Star Trek\" episode not to have a bridge scene during the entire episode and is the only \"TNG\" episode where Data does not appear on-screen. The season ran from 1990 to 1991.\n\nThe fifth season's seventh episode, \"\", opened with a dedication to \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry (though the prior episode, \"The Game\", aired four days after his death). Roddenberry, though he had recently died, continued to be credited as executive producer for the rest of the season. The cast and crew learned of his death during the production of \"\", a later season-five episode. Seven fifth-season episodes were nominated for eight Emmys. \"\" won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Series and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series, and \"\" and \"\" tied for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Special Visual Effects. In addition, \"\" became the first television episode since the 1968 original series \"Star Trek\" episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" to win a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Season five had the introduction of a jacket for Picard, worn periodically throughout the rest of the show's run. The observation lounge set was altered with the removal of the gold model starships across the interior wall and the addition of lighting beneath the windows. Recurring character Ensign Ro Laren was introduced in the fifth season. The season ran from 1991 to 1992.\n\nWith the creation of \"\", Rick Berman and Michael Piller's time was split between \"The Next Generation\" and the new show. Three sixth-season episodes were nominated for Emmys. \"\" won for both Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Series and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Hairstyling for a Series, and \"A Fistful of Datas\" won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Drama Series. The highest Nielsen-rated episode of Season 6 was \"Relics\", with a rating of 13.9. The episode featured \"Original Series\" character Scotty played by James Doohan. Additionally, NASA astronaut Mae Jemison played Lt. Palmer in \"Second Chances\". The season 6 finale cliffhanger includes a cameo by Stephen Hawking (Part I of \"Descent\"). The season ran from 1992 to 1993.\n\nThe seventh season was \"The Next Generation\"s last, running from 1993 to 1994. The penultimate episode, \"\", concluded the plot line for the recurring character Ensign Ro Laren and introduced themes that continued in \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" and \"Star Trek: Voyager\". \"The Next Generation\" series finale, \"\", was a double-length episode (separated into two parts for reruns) that aired the week of May 19, 1994, revisiting the events of the pilot and providing a bookend to the series. Toronto's SkyDome played host to a massive event for the series finale. Thousands of people packed the stadium to watch the final episode on the stadium's JumboTron. Five seventh-season episodes were nominated for nine Emmys, and the series as a whole was the first syndicated television series nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. To this day, \"The Next Generation\" is the only syndicated drama to be nominated in this category. \"All Good Things...\" won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Special Visual Effects, and \"\" won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Drama Series. \"All Good Things...\" also won the second of the series' two Hugo Awards. \"All Good Things...\" also achieved the highest Nielson rating for all of Season 7, with a rating of 17.4.\n\nAlthough the cast members were contracted for eight seasons, Paramount ended \"The Next Generation\" after seven, which disappointed and puzzled some of the actors, and was an unusual decision for a successful television show. Paramount then made films using the cast, which it believed would be less successful if the show were still on television. An eighth season also would likely have reduced the show's profitability due to higher cast salaries and a lower price per episode when sold as strip programming.\n\nThe show's strong ratings continued to the end; the 1994 series finale was ranked number two among all shows that week, between hits \"Home Improvement\" and \"Seinfeld\", and was watched by over 30 million viewers. \"TNG\" was the most-watched \"Star Trek\" show, with a peak audience of 11.5 million during its fifth season prior to the launch of \"DS9\". Between 1988 and 1992 it picked up half a million to a million additional viewers per year.\n\nAdjusted Nielsen Ratings for Star Trek TV shows:\n\nIn the 2010s, \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" was re-produced in high-definition (1080p) with a format of 4:3 (1.33:1). \"TNG\" was shot on 35 mm film, which meant the film could be re-scanned to a higher resolution, however, many of the special effects had to be re-produced. Also a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound option was created.\n\nSeason 1 sold 95,000 units in its launch week in 2012. In addition to the , the HD format was sold to many online streaming TV providers such as Netflix. The Netflix version included some additional special effect changes. The Blu-ray sets include many special features and videos, such as a 1988 episode of \"Reading Rainbow\" where Levar Burton (who plays Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge on \"TNG\") documents the making of a \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode.\n\nIn June 2016 a 41-disc set was released with over 8,000 minutes of \"TNG\"-content, including the entire show in 1080p (4:3).\n\n\n\nFor a more complete list, see \n\n\"Star Trek\" had a number of story arcs within the larger story, and oftentimes different episodes contributed to two or more different story or character arcs. Some are epitomized by the aliens the characters interact with, for example, \"TNG\" introduced the Borg and the Cardassians. The Klingons and Romulans had been introduced in the original series (1966–69); however, the Klingons were somewhat rebooted with a \"turtle-head\" look, although a retcon was given to explain this in an \"Enterprise\" episode. Other story arcs are epitomized by the appearances of a certain character such as Q or Ro Laren or by technology like the holodeck.\n\nCertain episodes go deeper into the Klingon alien saga, which are famous for having an actual Klingon language made for them in the \"Star Trek\" universe. The Klingon stories usually involve Worf, but not all Worf-centric shows are focused on Klingons. The famous Duras sisters, a Klingon duo Lursa and B'Etor, were introduced on \"TNG\" in 1991 in the episode \"Redemption\" and they later appeared in the film \"Generations\".\n\n\"The Next Generation\"s average of 20 million viewers often exceeded both existing syndication successes such as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and network hits including \"Cheers\" and \"L.A. Law\". Benefiting in part from many stations' decision to air each new episode twice in a week, it consistently ranked in the top ten among hour-long dramas, and networks could not prevent affiliates from preempting their shows with \"The Next Generation\" or other dramas that imitated its syndication strategy.\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" received 18 Emmy Awards and, in its seventh season, became the first and only syndicated television show to be nominated for the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series. It was nominated for three Hugo Awards and won two. The first-season episode \"The Big Goodbye\" also won the Peabody Award for excellence in television programming.\n\nIn 1997, the episode \"\" was ranked No. 70 on \"TV Guide\"s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2002, \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" was ranked #46 on \"TV Guide\"s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time list, and in 2008, was ranked No. 37 on \"Empire\"s list of the 50 greatest television shows.\n\nOn October 7, 2006, one of the three original filming models of the USS \"Enterprise\"-D used on the show sold at a Christie's auction for US$576,000, making it the highest-selling item at the event. The buyer of the piece was Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, owner of the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. The piece is on display within the Science Fiction Museum.\n\nIn 2012, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed the show at No. 7 in the \"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years\", saying, \"The original \"\" was cult TV before cult TV was even a thing, but its younger, sleeker offspring brought, yes, a new generation into the Trekker fold, and reignited the promise of sci-fi on television.\" Although TNG did develop a cult following, it was noted for its prime-time general audience viewership also.\n\nThe flute from \"Inner Light\" was valued at only a few hundred to perhaps 1000 USD when it went to auction, but was sold for over 40,000; in this case the auctioneers admitted they had underestimated the appeal of the prop. In the days leading up to the auction, Denise Okuda, former \"Star Trek\" scenic artist and video supervisor, as well as co-writer of the auction catalog, said: \"That's the item people say they really have to have, because it's so iconic to a much-beloved episode.\"\n\n\"DS9\"s \"The Emissary\", which came out half-way through season 6 of \"TNG\" achieved a Nielsen rating of 18.8. \"Star Trek\"s ratings went into a steady decline starting with Season 6 of \"TNG\", and the second to last episode of \"DS9\" achieved a Nielsen rating of 3.9.\n\nVideo games based on \"The Next Generation\" TV series, movies, and characters include:\n\nThe Enterprise and its setting is also in other Trekiverse games like \"\" (2000). For example, in \"Star Trek: Armada\" voice actors from \"The Next Generation\" returned to their characters in the game including Patrick Stewart reprised the roles of Jean-Luc Picard and Locutus, Michael Dorn voiced Worf, Denise Crosby reprised Sela, and J. G. Hertzler voiced Chancellor Martok. Several other voice actors who had been previously unaffiliated with \"Star Trek\" also voiced characters in the game, among them was Richard Penn.\n\n\"Star Trek: Armada II\" was set in the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" era of the Star Trek universe.\n\n\"\" (1999) included voice acting by Brent Spiner as Data and Patrick Stewart as Picard, and was a follow-up from the ninth \"Star Trek\" film \"\".\n\nFour films feature the characters of the series: \"Star Trek Generations\" (1994), \"\" (1996), \"\" (1998), and \"\" (2002).\n\nAn ancestor of Worf, also played by Dorn, also appeared in \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\".\n\nAll episodes of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" were made available on VHS cassettes, starting in 1991. The entire series was gradually released on VHS over the next few years during the remainder of the show's run and after the show had ended.\n\nThe VHS for TNG were available on mail-order usually two episodes per VHS cassette.\n\nParamount published all episodes on the LaserDisc format from October 1991 using an extended release schedule that concluded in May 1999. Each disc featured two episodes with Closed Captions, Digital Audio, and CX encoding. Also published were four themed \"collections\", or boxed sets, of related episodes. These included \"The Borg Collective\", \"The Q Continuum\", \"Worf: Return to Grace\", and \"The Captains Collection\".\n\nThere was a production error with episode 166, \"Sub Rosa\", where a faulty master tape was used that was missing 4½ minutes of footage. Though a new master copy of the episode was obtained, no corrected pressing of this disc was issued.\n\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" was also released on LaserDisc in the non-US markets Japan and Europe. In Japan, all episodes were released in a series of 14 boxed sets (two boxed sets per season), and as with the US releases were in the NTSC format and ordered by production code. The European laserdiscs were released in the PAL format and included the ten two-part telemovies as well as a disc featuring the episodes \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" and \"Cause And Effect\". The pilot episode, \"Encounter At Farpoint\", was also included in a boxed set called \"Star Trek: The Pilots\" featuring the pilot episodes from \"Star Trek: The Original Series\", \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\", and \"Star Trek: Voyager\".\n\nThe first season of the series was released on DVD in March 2002. Throughout the year the next six seasons were released at various times on DVD, with the seventh season being released in December 2002. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment released \"Star Trek: The Next Generation – The Complete Series\" on October 2, 2007. The DVD box set contains 49 discs. Between March 2006 and September 2008, \"Fan Collective\" editions were released containing select episodes of \"The Next Generation\" (and \"The Original Series\", \"Deep Space Nine\", and \"Voyager\") based on various themes. The individual episodes were chosen by fans voting on StarTrek.com. In total, six \"Fan Collectives\" were produced, along with a boxed set containing the first five collectives. In April 2013 all seven seasons of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" were re-released in new packaging featuring a silhouette of a different cast member on each box. However, the discs contained the identical content that was previously released in 2002.\n\nThe original show was shot on high-quality 35 mm film, but had to be downscaled before editing and postprocessing to standard '80s and '90s TV resolution (video quality) for broadcast. The show's final visual effects (e.g. all exterior shots of the starship \"Enterprise\", phaser fire or beaming fade-ins and -outs) were also composed only in standard resolution video. All previous home video and DVD releases used this severely downscaled version. To include such footage on Blu-ray, using only upscaling, would have resulted in a larger but blurred image, so CBS decided to use a more detailed approach to bring the show to high definition. They also opted to adhere to the show's original 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nA news release on the official website announced on September 28, 2011, in celebration of the series' twenty-fifth anniversary, that \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" would be completely re-mastered in 1080p and 4k high definition from the original 35 mm film negatives (consisting of almost 25,000 reels of original film stock). All the visual effects for each episode would be digitally recomposed from original large-format negatives and newly created CGI shots. The release would be accompanied by 7.1 DTS Master Audio.\n\nAn initial disc featuring the episodes \"Encounter at Farpoint\", \"\", and \"\" was released on January 31, 2012 under the label \"The Next Level\". The six-disc first season set was released on July 24, 2012. The remaining seasons were released periodically thereafter, culminating in the release of the seventh season on December 2, 2014.\n\nThe entire re-mastered series is available on Blu-ray as individual seasons, and as a 41-disc box set titled \"The Full Journey\". Eventually, all remastered episodes will also be available for television syndication and digital distribution. Mike Okuda believes this is the largest film restoration project ever attempted.\n\nWhen \"TNG\" was re-made into 1080p, several episodes were released as stand-alone single show Blu-ray products.\n\n\"The Measure of a Man\" was released in HD in 2012 with an extended cut. The extended version includes an extra 13 minutes of footage as well as recreated special effects. It was released as part of the Season 2 collection set.\n\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" spawned different media set in its universe, which was primarily the 2370s but set in the same universe as first \"Star Trek\" TV shows of the 1960s. This included the aforementioned films, computer games, board games, theme parks, etc. In the 2010s there were rumors of a Captain Worf spin-off, the bridge officer that debuted on \"TNG\" and was also featured in the \"TNG\" spin-off show \"Deep Space Nine\".\n\nStar Trek \"TNG\"-era novels (examples):\n\n\nIn 2005, the last episode of \"Enteprise\" called \"These Are the Voyages...\" (S4E22) featured a holodeck simulation on the USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701-D) from \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" during the events of the episode \"\" and the return of Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). It was written by Berman and Braga, who noted \"... this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it\".\n\n\"\" was the TV show launched following the conclusion of \"Star Trek: Voyager\" and was set 100 years before \"TOS\" and 200 years before \"TNG\", in addition to including some soft reboot elements with an all new cast. Some episodes connected to \"TNG\" directly including guest stars by Brent Spiner and connections to the events in \"TNG\"'s fictional universe. The three-episode story arc consisting of \"\", \"Cold Station 12\", and \"The Augments\", with a Soong ancestor portrayed by \"The Next Generation\" regular Brent Spiner provides some backstory to Data's origins. Also, the \"Enterprise\" episode \"\" also helps explain the smooth-headed Klingons that sometimes appeared, a retcon that helped explain this varying presentation between \"TOS\", \"TNG\", and the films.\n\n\"Star Trek\" would not return to television as a show for over 12 years, until the debut of \"Star Trek: Discovery\" on CBS, but thereafter exclusively available on the internet service CBS All Access (Netflix internationally) at that time. The film franchise was rebooted in 2009.\n\nOn August 4, 2018, Patrick Stewart stated on social media that he would return to the role of Jean-Luc Picard in a project with CBS All Access.\n\nStewart wrote, \"I will always be very proud to have been a part of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", but when we wrapped that final movie in the spring of 2002, I truly felt my time with \"Star Trek\" had run its natural course. It is, therefore, an unexpected but delightful surprise to find myself excited and invigorated to be returning to Jean-Luc Picard and to explore new dimensions within him. Seeking out new life for him, when I thought that life was over.\n\"During these past years, it has been humbling to hear stories about how \"The Next Generation\" brought people comfort, saw them through difficult periods in their lives or how the example of Jean-Luc inspired so many to follow in his footsteps, pursuing science, exploration and leadership. I feel I'm ready to return to him for the same reason – to research and experience what comforting and reforming light he might shine on these often very dark times. I look forward to working with our brilliant creative team as we endeavor to bring a fresh, unexpected and pertinent story to life once more.\"\n\nIt is believed that the new project will be a continuation of the story after \"Star Trek: Nemesis\", and will not be a reboot of the series storyline as was done with the J.J. Abrams \"Star Trek\" films.\n\nThis infographic shows the first-run production timeline of various Star Trek franchise shows and films, including \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"\n\n\n"}

In 2014, the population was 7,776 on an area of 0.6 sq km with a density of 14,113 inhabitants per sq km. After Reeperbahn, it's Hamburg's best known entertainment and nightlife district. It is also known as Schanzenviertel () and nicknamed Schanze ().\n\nThe name of the quarter originates from a sconce (German: Schanze) formed like a star which has been built in the area in 1682 in front of the Hamburg city walls. From the 1930s to the 1970s the quarter was home for a large number of working-class people. Since the 1970s, families and students have started to move into the area. It is nearly, but not fully, congruent with the entertainment district of Schanzenviertel with its many bars and clubs, which is dubbed \"Schanze\" by its inhabitants. In the local slang, residents here live \"in the sconce\" (\"in der Schanze\").\n\nThe former concert house/theater building Rote Flora (built in 1888 as Flora concert hall) is also located here, at the street of Schulterblatt. It was squatted by leftist groups in 1989, after there were plans since 1987/88 to rebuild it as a new musical theater. These plans were later realized near Holstenstraße station as Neue Flora. Since the beginning of the occupation, Rote Flora was used for cultural events by the squatting groups. In 2000, the building was acquired by real-estate agent Klausmartin Kretschmer, under a contract where the city of Hamburg prohibited him to make any alterations. Because he planned to make alterations anyway, conflicts arose with residents. In 2014, Hamburg city re-bought the building to avoid further conflicts; the building was renovated in 2015 by volunteers.\n\nSince the beginning of the new millennium, Sternschanze is \"en vogue\" and subject to gentrification. Nevertheless, political demonstrations, mostly by leftist groups, take place here and sometimes lead to clashes with the police, frequently on 1 May (German Labour Day). Graffiti paintings can be found on many walls throughout the quarter. In 2008, the area of Schanzenviertel, which formerly was cut into three parts by the boundaries of Hamburg-Mitte, Eimsbüttel, and Altona, was merged into the new quarter of Sternschanze, which since then \nhas belonged only to the Altona borough.\n\nSternschanze is located between the quarters of St. Pauli, Altona-Altstadt, Eimsbüttel, and Rotherbaum.\n\nSternschanze station is serviced by Hamburg S-Bahn (lines S11, S21, S31) and U-Bahn trains (U3 line), Feldstraße - which is officially located in neighbouring St. Pauli quarter - by the underground line U3 only. Schlump station is located on the north eastern boundaries of the Sternschanze quarter and served by underground lines U2 and U3.\n\n"}

Released as a single with \"409\" in June 1962, it peaked at number 14 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song also appeared on the 1962 album of the same name.\n\nThe Beach Boys first recorded the song at World Pacific Studios on February 8, 1962 in what was the band's second ever recording session. However, the recordings from that session, engineered by Hite Morgan, would ultimately remain unreleased until the late sixties. The only difference instrumentally on this early version as opposed to the officially released version was the presence of Al Jardine on guitar instead of David Marks.\n\nThe instrumental track as well as the vocals for the officially released version were recorded at Western Recorders on April 19, 1962. The session, produced by Brian, featured David Marks and Carl Wilson on guitar; Brian Wilson on bass guitar and Dennis Wilson on drums. The song features Mike Love on lead vocals with backing vocals by Brian, Carl & Dennis Wilson and Mike Love. Also recorded during that session were \"409\", \"Lonely Sea\" and \"Their Hearts Were Full Of Spring\". This session was recorded and given to Capitol Records as a demo tape. The label was impressed and immediately signed the band to their first major label. \"Surfin' Safari\" and \"409\" would be the band's first single to be issued under Capitol Records.\n\nThe \"Surfin' Safari\" single backed with \"409\" was the band's second single and the first single to be released on the band's new label Capitol Records in the United States in June 1962. Originally Capitol Records felt \"409\" should be the 'A' Side, and first promoted the car song (according to Beach Boys biographers Badman, Gaines and Carlin) instead of \"Surfin' Safari\". However, as noted in the booklet to the 1993 CD box set \"\", radio station airplay in Phoenix, Arizona jump-started the B-side into a major nationwide hit (to date no copy of the first Capitol single with \"409\" as the A side has been discovered). The \"Billboard\" issue of July 14, 1962 cited Detroit as the major market of its national \"break out\".\n\nThe single peaked at the number 14 position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, with \"409\" also charting at number 76, making it the band's first double-sided hit single. It placed at number 10 on the \"Cash Box\" sales chart, and number 5 on UPI's national weekly survey used by newspapers. According to English pop music statistician Joseph Murrells in \"The Book of Golden Discs\", 1978 edition, it placed number 3 on one of the four major national charts then recognised, probably \"Variety\". Certainly its regional sales backed up these higher placings (than \"Billboard\"). As well as its Capitol-record sales in New York, it was No. 1 in Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Minneapolis, Buffalo and Hartford; and top five in Chicago, San Francisco, Phoenix, Tucson, Nashville, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Springfield MASS.\n\nCapitol A&R executive Nick (Nik) Venet, who signed the group and is listed as producer on their first two albums, is quoted in the Steven Gaines book as saying regarding the release that \"The biggest order Capitol had from a single market all year [1962] was from New York City - where there was no surfing. It sold approximately nine hundred thousand records, but not enough for a gold.\"\n\nIn October 1962, the \"Surfin' Safari\" single was the first to be released by the band in the United Kingdom. However, given mediocre reviews at best, the single failed to make any impact on the charts. It did qualify as the Beach Boys' first international chart-topper, however. By the end of September it had peaked at number seven in Australia's \"Music Maker\" chart — only reaching the Billboard top 20 the following week — then in November spent three weeks at number one in Sweden (both charts cited by contemporary issues of \"Billboard\"). In Germany, the World Pacific Studios recording of the song was used as the single release instead of the more well-known version. The single failed to chart.\n\nIn January 1970, the World Pacific Studios sessions recording of the song was issued on Trip Records as the B-side of a \"Surfin'\" single re-issue. The single however failed to make any impact on the charts.\n\nThe song was first released on a single 45 RPM record and then later, it was released on the band's debut \"Surfin' Safari\" album, and on a number of later 'greatest hits' compilations. The song's appearance on the 1993 \"Good Vibrations\" box set is sourced from the original demo tape master, lacking the fade-out added before its release as a single.\n\nThree takes of the early World Pacific Studios recordings of the song were eventually released on CD in 1991 on the archival release \"Lost & Found (1961-62)\" as well as subsequent re-issues of that album which featured alternate album titles. A live concert performance of the tune \"Surfin' Safari\" is featured in the short documentary \"One Man's Challenge\", written and directed by Dale Smallin. Filmed July 28, 1962 (with the same lineup as the official Capitol single) at the Azuza Teen Club, this particular visual version of the song is, according to author Jon Stebbins in 'The Lost Beach Boy', \"The only known performance footage of the Pendleton-shirt era Beach Boys.\"\n\n\nJan & Dean, with uncredited instrumental and vocal support from the Beach Boys, recorded the song for their 1963 album \"Jan and Dean Take Linda Surfin\"'. The song was also recorded by the Hot Doggers (a studio-only group headed by future Beach Boy Bruce Johnston along with Terry Melcher) on their 1963 album \"Surfin' U.S.A.\", by The Challengers on their 1963 album \"Surfbeat\", by The Lively Ones on their 1963 album \"The Great Surf Hits!\", and by the Rincon Surfside Band on their 1965 album \"The Surfing Song Book\". Alvin and the Chipmunks included it in their 1990 TV special \"Rockin' Through the Decades\" and its soundtrack. More recently it has been recorded by The Ramones on their 1993 album \"Acid Eaters\" and by Rockapella on their 2002 album \"Smilin'\".\n\n"}

It is the tenth game in \"The King of Fighters\" series and the last one released for the Neo Geo, which served as the primary platform for the series since \"The King of Fighters '94\". It was ported to PlayStation 2 and Xbox (not compatible with the Xbox 360), was released in North America] as a two-in-one bundle with the preceding game in the series, \"The King of Fighters 2002\".\n\nThe 3-on-3 Team Battle Format is applied in the game once again, just like the past editions. It also uses a Multi-Shift format that allows players to change characters during the middle of battle. When the \"Change OK\" sign is displayed above the Power Gauge, the player can do a Quick Shift and change characters immediately, or perform a Switch-Off Attack against the opponent that will consume one Power Gauge stock.\n\nThe game also features a Tactical Leader System, in which one of the members of the team is designated as the Leader. The chosen Leader can have an access to an exclusive move known as the \"Leader Super Special Move\" (in addition to the regular \"Super Special Moves\"). However, this usually requires two Power Gauge stocks to be able to perform it.\n\nAs in the last game in the series, the players' Power Gauge can hold up to 3 stocks at the beginning of a match. Unlike the previous game, however, the player starts with a full gauge of three stocks right away. When one team loses one of its members, the maximum capacity of Power Gauge stocks is increased by one, giving the losing team a handicap against the opposing team. In addition, unlike the previous \"KOF\" games, each hit only earns the player 100 points.\n\nThe game revolves around The King of Fighters, an elite fighting tournament. From within the history of this remarkable and extraordinary competition, Rugal Bernstein was defeated, the Orochi was sealed away, and the NESTS cartel had fallen. The tournament at the center of the game is sponsored by an unknown patron, whose identity becomes a matter of public interest in the country. Perhaps as a result of this, it attracts a large number of contestants.\n\nWith the inception of the new \"multi-shift\" rule in this KOF tournament, wherein competitors can freely tag off during battles, the competition becomes a 'hot topic' and provokes widespread discussion. It also leads to a speedy execution of the match with unified team strategies.\n\nIn preparation for the tournaments, stadiums with the capacity to hold tens of thousands of people are procured from cities across the world and established in city centers. Schedules are completed and spectators move from one location to another to watch the preliminary matches.

{"id": "5806746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5806746", "title": "Tri-Ergon", "text": "Tri-Ergon\n\nThe Tri-Ergon sound-on-film system was developed from around 1919 by three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), and Hans Vogt (1890–1979).\n\nThe system used a photoelectric recording method and a non-standard film size (42mm) which incorporated the sound track with stock 35mm film. With a Swiss backer, the inventors formed Tri-Ergon AG in Zurich, and tried to interest the market with their invention.\n\nThere were a number of companies which used the Tri-Ergon name:\n\nUfa acquired the German sound film rights for the Tri-Ergon process in 1925, but dropped the system when the public showing of their first sound film suffered technical failures.\n\nThe Tri-Ergon system appeared at a time when a number of other sound film processes were arriving on the market, and the company soon merged with a number of competitors to form the Tobis syndicate in 1928, joined by the Klangfilm AG syndicate in 1929 and renamed as Tobis-Klangfilm by 1930. While Tri-Ergon became the dominant sound film process in Germany and much of Europe through its use by Tobis-Klangfilm, American film companies were still squabbling over their respective patents. For a time Tri-Ergon successfully blocked all American attempts to show their sound films in Germany and other European countries, until a loose cartel was formed under an agreement in Paris in 1930.\n\nHowever, William Fox of the Fox Film Corporation acquired the US rights for the Tri-Ergon system and, backed by Tri-Ergon AG, began a patent infringement battle in the courts in 1929 against much of the American film industry. The dispute wasn't settled until 1935, when Fox lost his final appeal in the US Supreme Court. A new Paris accord was signed in March 1936, which held until the start of the Second World War. The Tri-Ergon system continued in use in Germany and the continent during the war.\n\nThe name Tri-Ergon means \"the work of three\", and is derived from ), meaning three, and , , meaning 'deed, action, work, labour, or task'; cognate with (English work). The erg also derives from the same word .\n\nThe Tri-Ergon process involved recording sound onto film using the \"variable density\" method, used by Movietone and Lee De Forest's Phonofilm, rather than the \"variable area\" method later used by RCA Photophone.\n\nTri-Ergon used a special form of microphone without mechanical moving parts (Cathodophone) for sound pickup and a special electric discharge tube for variable density film recording. For reproduction of sound, the system used an electrostatic loudspeaker.\n\nTwo specific patents in the Tri-Ergon system would later cause controversy. The Tri-Ergon film used an extra 7mm sound strip attached to the edge of a standard 35mm film, resulting in a new film 42mm wide. This was achieved by a \"double-printing\" method by which the film and sound tracks were recorded and developed separately, then printed together onto a common positive. This required special adjustments on the standard projectors, which was not well received by the industry. The other patent was a \"flywheel\" which allowed the film to flow smoothly through sound reproducing equipment.\n\nAn original Tri-Ergon sound movie projector (dated to 1923) is in the collection of the Deutsches Museum in München, Germany.\n\nMassolle, Engl and Vogt secured patents from 1919 in Germany, and applied for a US patent on 20 March 1922.\n\nThe first public showing of Tri-Ergon sound films took place in the at 68 Kurfürstendamm, Berlin on 17 September 1922. The inventors sold their patent to Swiss financial backers (St. Gallen) who formed Tri-Ergon AG) in Zürich, Switzerland to continue developing their process.\n\nIn 1924 Universum-Film AG (Ufa) produced three hours' worth of vaudeville shorts with sound, similar to those produced by Warner Brothers, who used a sound-on-disc system. Tri-Ergon AG licensed the recording film rights to Ufa in January 1925 and Masolle briefly became technical director of Ufa's first sound-film division.\n\nHowever, the non-standard film format was not popular: even a well-publicized tour of Germany in 1925 failed to generate much interest.\n\nUfa's first sound film, the 20-minute short \"\" ('The Match Girl') was directed by Guido Bagier. Bagier (who worked at Ufa between 1922 and 1927 as producer and musical advisor) also wrote the music for the film; the screenplay was by Hans Kyser. It premièred at the Mozartsaal in December 1925, but was a total flop in terms of technical sound quality. According to Bagier, the fiasco was due to technical problems with the playback equipment.\n\nIn the meantime, Ufa, having ducked the whole issue of sound fims, had still fallen into severe financial difficulties with productions of vastly expensive silent films accompanied by a live symphony orchestra playing a specially-composed score, such as F. W. Murnau's \"Der Letzte Mann\" (1924), with Emil Jannings and \"Faust (1926 film)\"; and both parts of Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen, with a score by Gottfried Huppertz.\nParamount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stepped into the financial breach with the highly restrictive Parufamet agreement of December 1925, whereby the American firms took control (and revenue) of all Ufa's first-run theatres to show American films. Only one significant German film was shown in Ufa first-run cinemas in Berlin during this whole time the agreement was in effect: Joe May's silent \"The Farmer from Texas\". The film received no publicity build-up and was dropped after only one week at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo. Almost no German films were shown in US cinemas: and Ufa made no new films in Germany at all while the Parufamet contract was in force.\n\nAlthough this injection of foreign capital allowed the construction in 1926 of Ufa's enormous new Große Halle studios at Neubabelsberg (designed by Carl Stach-Urach, who had re-built the Ufa-Palast am Zoo the previous year), the Ufa management with Erich Pommer in charge of production continued to over-spend by enormous amounts. Lang's \"Metropolis\" cost over an (estimated) 5,100,000 Reichsmarks. Yet the only venue where \"Metropolis\" could be seen in the whole of Germany was at a single, small—yet equisitely decorated—cinema showing second-rate films, the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz. The box office receipts amounted to approximately 75,000 Reichsmarks, slightly over 0.01% of the budget.\n\nFrom 1926, needing more revenue, Tri-Ergon AG sought backers in the US. On 5 July 1927 the Hungarian-American William Fox of the Fox Film Corporation personally purchased the U. S. rights to the Tri-Ergon patents for $50,000, forming the American Tri-Ergon Corporation.\n\nFox Film had also purchased sound-on-film patents from Freeman Harrison Owens and Theodore Case, although it seems that only the Case patents were actually used in creating the new sound-on-film system he dubbed Fox Movietone. One of the first feature films to be released in Fox Movietone was \"Sunrise\" (1927) directed by F. W. Murnau. Fox also used the system for the long-running newsreel series \"Fox Movietone News\".\n\nOn 5 March 1927 Alfred Hugenberg's industrial Hugenberg-Gruppe took over Ufa and, as part of their initial cost-cutting measures, closed down the Tri-Ergon department. Ludwig Klitzsch, the managing director, dismissed Bagier and his team, sidestepping the problem of \"the talkies\" with their vast technical, financial, and legal problems.\n\nOn 12 May 1927, Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (Berlin), a subsidiary of Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (St. Gallen) was formed by Joseph Masolle. By 1931 it was a subsidiary of IG Farben, which was founded in 1925. In December 1927 the Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister founded a new company, International Maatschappij voor Sprekende Films NV (Sprekende Films NV) to profit from its patented 'Meisterton' system. Within a year the Dutch company would have almost total control of the Tobis and the Tri-Ergon patents.\n\nAt the 1927 Baden-Baden festival of contemporary chamber-music, pioneering sound films with original scores by leading avant-garde composers were shown at special 'Film and Music' sessions. Walther Ruttmann's abstract experimental film \"Opus III\" (1924), with an original score for chamber orchestra by Hans Eisler, was shown twice: firstly as a silent film with the music performed live and synchronized using Blum‘s Musikchronometer, and then as a sound film (no longer extant) using the Tri-Ergon process. The sound-film recording was supervised by Bagier, now working for Tri-Ergon-Musik A.G.\n\nOther films shown at the festivals in 1928-9 included American cartoons with music by Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch, newsreels (Darius Milhaud), and abstract films by Hans Richter (Hindemith).\n\nBy mid-1928 a number of short films had been made using the Tri-Ergon process, produced by Tobis-Industrie GmbH (TIGes) (Berlin). Some of them were shown at the first public showing of sound films in Austria on 8 June 1928 at the cinema in the Urania, Vienna, a public educational institute and observatory (\"see also\" ) They included:\n\nIn September 1928 Walter Ruttman's full-length \"Stätten von deutscher Arbeit and Kultur\" was shown in the Vienna Urania cinema, along with \"Hans Moser als Wiener Dienstmann\" (1928), starring the Viennese comic actor Hans Moser. In the autumn of a touring exhibition of sound films was shown throughout Austria. The German première of \"Ein Tag auf dem Bauernhof\" took place on 12 September 1928 at the Mozartsaal.\nIn July 1928 German State Radio commissioned Tri-Ergon-Musik A.G. to produce a sound film for the opening of the fifth German Radio Exhibition in Berlin. Their film \"Deutscher Rundfunk\", with music by Edmund Meisel, showed at the exhibition in August. Reviewers of the Radio Exhibition screenings were impressed by the reproduction of natural sounds, such as street noises, marching soldiers, hammering machines, steam ships and zoo animals. It was later released in a shorter version, \"Tönende Welle\".\n\nCompeting American sound film companies such as RKO (formed by RCA) were becoming more organised in Germany. To protect the market from American domination the German government lobbied for a cartelization of all important German sound film patents, and on 30 August 1928 the Tobis Tonbild-Syndicate A.G. was formed to consolidate the Tri-Ergon patents and several hundred more. The four original main companies who made up the Tobis syndicate were: \n\nIn this deal, Tobis acquired the option to purchase outright Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin), and made an agreement with Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (St. Gallen) to use the Tri-Ergon sound film patents. Tobis was almost completely controlled by Küchenmeister by 1929.\n\"I Kiss Your Hand, Madame\" ('Ich küsse ihre Hand, Madame') was the first Tobis film with sound. Starring Harry Liedtke and Marlene Dietrich it premièred on January 16, 1929. Free of dialogue, the film's only sound segment occurs when the tenor Richard Tauber sings the title song on the soundtrack (00:32). Although Tauber appears with Liedtke and Dietrich in publicity shots for the film, he didn't appear on screen himself. The film was distributed by Deutsche Lichtspiel-Syndikat (DLS), a chain of 800 cinemas which had installed Küchenmeister's 'Meisterton' sound system in 1928.\n\nThe main competitor of Tobis was the Klangfilm syndicate, a partnership formed in early 1929 between the electrical manufacacturers Siemens & Halske, AEG, and Polyphon-Werke A.G. (who sold Polydor records). By March 1929 Tobis merged with Klangfilm, and the resulting syndicate was renamed Tobis-Klangfilm in 1930.\n\nTobis-Klangfilm made a deal with the British and French Phototone companies, and British Talking Pictures, Ltd. This made the patents of Lee de Forest available to Tobis-Klangfilm. Tobis-Klangfilm now had branches for production, distribution and equipment throughout Europe (including Tobis Portuguesa) and the United Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, also in 1929, Ufa and Klangfilm planned a separate contract to develop their own sound film production. Tobis (possibly because its earlier failure with Ufa in 1925) stood in direct competition with the giant Ufa as a producer of film.\n\nThe premiere in March 1929 at the Baden-Baden Festival of Walther Ruttmann's Tobis film \"Melodie der Welt\" (\"Melody of the World\"), introduced the longest German sound film at the time with some 40 minutes running time.\n\nThe Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister planned a massive expansion of Tobis across Europe, and on 19 May 1929 issued 5,000 shares of its new company, 'Internationale Maatschappij voor Accoustiek NV' (Accoustiek NV) on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. This was the largest Dutch flotation to date, netting 5 million Dutch guilders (approx. 8.3 million reichsmarks, $2 million, £500,000). It was over-subscribed by 3 billion guilders (about 5 billion RM), in keeping with the general stock exchange euphoria of the times.\nAlthough Tobis-Klangfilm's preparations were complete by the spring of 1929, Warner Bros. was still technically far ahead and in May 1929 tried to present \"The Singing Fool\" in Germany, a Part-Talkie with Al Jolson in a follow-up to \"The Jazz Singer\".\n\nTobis-Klangfilm sued both Warner Bros. and Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI)—Western Electric's subsidiary for distributing its sound motion picture equipment—for patent infringement. After a number of court cases, on 22 July 1929 the German appeals court upheld Tobis-Klangfilm's exclusive rights to sound-on-film recording in Germany: the company was victorious in all subsequent appeals.\n\nTobis-Klangfilm won further injunctions in Switzerland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Holland, and Austria. Even William Fox, owner of Tri-Ergon's American rights, was prevented from presenting films in Berlin. No American films were shown at all in Berlin, and Tobis-Klang refused an offer from ERPI, Will H. Hays organised an American boycott through his company Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA).\n\nThe première of Carmine Gallone's Tobis production, \"Das Land ohne Frauen\" ('The Land Without Women') - almost two hours long - on September 30, 1929, was hailed by reviews in the press as \"the first feature-length German sound film\".\n\nOn 29 October 1929 the Wall Street Crash occurred, triggering a worldwide financial crisis.\n\nUfa's first major sound film, Melody of the Heart, was released in December 1929, followed in April 1930 by \"The Blue Angel\" with Dietrich and Emil Jannings, and music by Friedrich Hollaender; and in September that year \"The Three from the Filling Station\" with Lilian Harvey, Willy Fritsch and songs by the Comedian Harmonists. The success of these early sound films led the Berlin Chamber of Commerce to comment: \"By now, sound film has become firmly established.\"\n\nThe stalemate in the ongoing patent wars between the US and European interests was broken by RCA. In the summer of 1929 General Electric (GE) acquired a part interest in AEG, one of the companies making up the original Klangfilm AG syndicate. With GE's influence, RCA and Tobis-Klangfilm signed a cooperative agreement. On 22 July 1930, at a conference in Paris, France, RCA, ERPI, and Tobis-Klangfilm formed a loose cartel to divide the world into three regions for selling sound recording and reproducing apparatus.\n\nAll pending litigation was dropped. ERPI and RCA acquired exclusive rights to sell their own recording and reproduction equipment, and distribute films in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Soviet Union. Royalties collected in the United Kingdom were split, 25 percent going to Tobis-Klangfilm, who also acquired similar exclusive rights in Central Europe and Scandinavia.\n\nIn 1930 Tri-Ergon AG's 1922 patent application was still pending in the United States. William Fox (who had bought the US Tri-Ergon rights in 1926) had lost control of his own company, Fox Studios, to ERPI. Backed by Tri-Ergon AG in Switzerland, he intensified the attempt to get the patent granted. In September 1931 the efforts of American Tri-Ergon Corporation's patent lawyers paid off, and he was finally assigned the US patent for the Tri-Ergon rights in the United States. The assignor was Tri-Ergon AG, who had originally applied for the US patent back in 1922. The Tri-Ergon patents named particular technical features that claimed to precede all other sound-on-film patents, such as the flywheel on the sound drum.\n\nFox then separately sued (as test cases) Altoona Publix Theatres Inc., which leased and operated the projection equipment from RCA; and Paramount for infringement of the \"double printing\" method. He then sued RCA and ERPI - and the all the US film companies which used the Tri-Ergon design - for infringement, specifically the flywheel on the sound drum. During a series of legal tussles Fox at first won his lawsuit on appeal and then lost it after an unusual reversal of decision by the U. S. Supreme Court in October 1934 not to review the case. The Supreme Court surprisingly relented, heard the appeal and finally ruled in March 1935 that neither system was 'new', and that there were prior inventions. An appeal by Alttona Publix was rejected on 1 April 1935.\n\nAlthough this brought a swift end to the sound film wars between various competing US and European (Dutch, German, and Swiss) interests, it also meant that the original Tri-Ergon system was never formally adopted in the United States. As a result, William Fox's own American Tri-Ergon Corporation failed to collect an estimated $100 million in licensing fees.\n\nIn 1931 the effects of the Wall Street Crash eventually hit Küchenmeister's Sprekende Film NV, which owned Tobis. The Dutch firm had over-extended itself with bank loans which were not renewed, and its Ultraphone business went bankrupt. The hugely complex chain of inter-linked Tobis companies fell to pieces, necessitating a complete reorganisation of the whole business. Dutch bankers and creditors began re-financing the profitable parts of the company, which emerged in 1932 as 'International Tobis NV' or Intertobis \n\nThe cartel rules began to irk foreign film companies, who had to pay ERPI a license fee (royalties) to shoot the film, and then had to pay Tobis-Klang to show the film in the areas allotted to them under the 1930 accord. Another conference was held in Paris during February 1932, but Tobis-Klangfilm demanded extra royalty fees, and American companies began withholding payments.\n\nFollowing the Reichstag fire, the NSDAP (Nazi Party) began to suspend civil liberties and eliminate political opposition. The Communists were excluded from the Reichstag. Adolf Hitler called on Reichstag members to vote for the Enabling Act on 24 March 1933, completing his rise to power from 1919 through the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 to Chancellor ('Reichkanzler') of the German Reich.\n\nDuring the nationalisation of the German film industry in 1935, the interests of Intertobis and Ufa were clandestinely transferred to Cautio GmbH. Cautio was personally set up in 1929 by Max Winkler, its sole owner and shareholder, as a front company for the secret transfer of funds from the NSDAP regime. In 1935 Winkler was named by Hitler as \"Reich Plenipotentiary for the German Film Industry\". He had links to Max Amann, Hitler's sergeant from 1915 to 1918, president of Eher Verlag since 1922, and president of the Reich Media Council and Reich Press Leader from c1933.\n\nThe new head of Tobis-Klang-film, Dr. Hans Henkel, journeyed to New York for personal negotiations in March 1936 to effect a new agreement. After two weeks' discussion all parties signed the new 1932 Paris accord on 18 March 1936 which included payment of royalties in the local currency where the film was being shown. Most American companies had withdrawn anyway from the German market by 1936, since much of their revenues were frozen under strict currency laws under the NSDAP.\n\nA subsidiary, Tri-Ergon Musik AG of Berlin, made commercial phonograph records for the German, French, Swedish and Danish markets from about 1928 to 1932. The records were advertised and sold as \"\".\n\nThe company released records of popular jazz and dance bands, and classical music. The Hungarian dance band leader made a numerous records under both his own name and under the pseudonym of 'Harry Jackson', along with Bernard Etté, and Friedrich Hollaender with the New Yorkers dance orchestra (\"It's a Million to One You're in Love\", TE 5137).\n\nClassical artists included the conductor and pianist (who later made arrangements for the Comedian Harmonists) and the Tri-Ergon-Trio consisting of the cellist Gregor Piatigorsky, the pianist , and the violinist Max Rostal.\n\nThe Tri-Ergon records were made by a partial reversal of the photoelectric process used to encode the sound track in the first place. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5832046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5832046", "title": "Valis: The Fantasm Soldier", "text": "Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\n\n, also known as either just Valis or The Fantasm Soldier, is a video game developed by Wolf Team and published by Telenet Japan in 1986 originally for the MSX and PC-88 home computers and then ported to, remade or re-released for several other systems over the years. It is the first video game in the \"Valis\" series which stars a Japanese teenager named Yuko who uses a mystical sword called Valis to defend Earth and other worlds. Its critical reception has varied depending on the version, including critical acclaim for the 1992 PC Engine remake.\n\nIn its original PC-88 and MSX version, \"Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\" is a side-scrolling platform game. Wielding the game's titular sword, the main character fights through each level's enemies while jumping across ledges, then confronts a boss at the end of each level. At certain points in the game, gameplay pauses, and cinematic cutscenes regarding the game's storyline play. There is also a gameplay-tweaked and content-cut version for the FM-7.\n\nThe Family Computer (Famicom) side-scrolling action role-playing game version of \"Valis\" differs considerably from the other versions of the game. While the basic plot remains the same, gameplay has moved from linear stage design to larger maze-style levels with multiple paths, often of a questionable design, resulting in a very high difficulty level especially since there is neither a password nor save system.\n\nThe Mega Drive/Genesis remake features gameplay system more similar to later games in the series, in particular \"Valis III\". Like other side-scrolling games of the era, the four D-pad buttons move the character, and the three fire buttons perform three actions for the main character: sliding, jumping, and swinging her sword that can be upgraded in three stages and there are alternative firing modes. The player can also use magic spells, gaining them after defeating bosses.\n\nThe PC Engine remake features improvements in the gameplay system (such as single high jumps instead of two-phase jumps and the sliding move damaging enemies) and voiced cutscenes. The mobile remake further added new stages and alternate costumes.\n\n (voiced by Sumi Shimamoto) is a schoolgirl in late 1980s Japan who is fated to protect three different realms – our own Earth, the land of spirits, and Vecanti, the Dream World – by wielding a mystical sword known as Valis. Demon lord (voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka) extinguishes a light in Vecanti which functions as a source of power for those who live there, and in a desperate plea for salvation, its queen (voiced by Yoshiko Sakakibara) reaches out for a brave soul who can help them in their time of despair. Yuko on Earth is the one who answers the call, being summoned by magical forces into Vecanti to liberate them from the evil of Rogles, who brainwashes Yūko's classmate and girlfriend (voiced by Yūko Mita) into helping him try and put an end to the Valis warrior.\n\nAgainst increasingly difficult odds, Yuko prevails. Although Reiko is killed in the process, her memory returns as she dies in Yuko's arms.\n\nThe original PC-88 and MSX were all developed by Wolf Team and published by Telenet Japan. Tokuma Shoten would later develop and release an almost completely redone version for the Famicom in 1987 only in Japan.\n\nIn 1991, Telenet and Renovation (United States) released versions for the Mega Drive/Genesis, developed by Riot. An enhanced remake of the Mega Drive version was also developed by Riot and released by Telenet for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM² add-on in 1992. In 2005-2006, Bandai Namco released another remake of the game, this time for mobile phone platforms in Japan.\n\nProject EGG released various emulated versions of the game for Windows, along with the compilation \"Complete Plus\" that came with a soundtrack CD and a figure. The PC Engine version was released by Konami on the PlayStation Store in 2010, and in 2014 was given for free for the Japanese subscribers to the PlayStation Network service.\n\nA short promotional anime by Sunrise, directed by Hideaki Anno and Katsuhiko Nishijima, featuring music by Kohei Tanaka, was released in 1987 on the VHD attached to an issue of \"Anime Vision\" magazine. The artist PiXEL who was responsible for the game's character design also published three doujinshi books. The orchestral arrangement of the game's soundtrack was released in 2011. It is also one of the video games was adapted by Kouta Hirano into the manga titled , published in the \"Gamest Comics\" collection in April 1999.\n\nSam Derboo from Hardcore Gaming 101 wrote the original versions \"might be a horrible, unplayable mess, but its call to fame to begin with wasn't the gameplay, but the pioneering in cinematic cutscenes - two years even before \"Ninja Gaiden\". (...) What's left is the quite excellent chiptune music, really the only part the original \"Valis\" is worth being remembered for.\" Derboo further described the Family Computer version as a \"typical Famicom action RPG - competently executed, but super obfuscate and endlessly frustrating.\" Nevertheless, \"MSX Club\" \"highly recommended\" the MSX version as an \"excellent\" action game, even as \"Arcades\" gave it a score of only 9/20.\n\nThe Mega Drive / Genesis remake received rather mediocre but mostly positive review scores in the West, including 65% from \"Sega Visions\", 76% from \"Consoles+\", 65% from \"Joystick\", and 5/10 from \"ASM\". Hardcore Gaming 101's Derboo opined \"\"Valis\" on the Genesis isn't a bad game, definitely leagues above the original, but still not particularly enjoyable. It's just so slow and boring.\" \"Sega Force\" bashed its \"dull and repetitive\" gameplay and declared: \"High graphical content, low playability level. That's \"Valis\" in a nutshell.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the PC Engine / TurboGrafx version of \"Valis\" was acclaimed by critics. Its review scores included 81% from \"Consoles +\", 78% from \"Génération 4\", 77% from \"Joypad\", and 83% from \"Joystick\". According to Hardcore Gaming 101, \"by its mechanics and level design, it is no doubt the most well-executed game in the entire series. It's still a bit too derivative and pedestrian to be counted among the genre greats like \"Castlevania\" and \"Ninja Gaiden\", but at least very, very high second tier.\" \"Retro Gamer\" highlighted it as \"arguable the best\" entry in a \"great series\". Lucas M. Thomas from IGN included \"Valis\" among top ten unreleased TurboGrafx games: \"If you're the kind of gamer who likes to know the exact color of panties being worn by your platforming hero girls, \"Valis\" is where you want to invest your time.\"\nThe game was followed by three sequels (\"Valis II\", \"Valis III\", \"Valis IV\"), an eroge spin-off \"Valis X\", and two manga series.\n\n"}
