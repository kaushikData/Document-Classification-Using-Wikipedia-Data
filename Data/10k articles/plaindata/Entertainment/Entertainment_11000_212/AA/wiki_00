The event took place on December 12, 2004 in the Diamondback Saloon in Belleville, Michigan, and was organized by Canadian professional wrestling promoter Scott D'Amore, veteran professional wrestling manager Jimmy Hart and Raven, a close friend of Sabu.\n\nThe event was attended by approximately 700 people, with some turned away due to insufficient capacity. Tickets were priced at $15 for adults and $10 for children, with VIP tickets (entailing select seating and access to an autograph session) priced at $30. The event was later released on DVD.\n\nThe Master of Ceremonies was Jimmy Hart, and the ring announcer was \"Irish\" Bobby Clancy. The matches featured wrestlers from D'Amore's Windsor, Ontario-based Border City Wrestling (BCW) promotion, wrestlers from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where Sabu was employed before being hospitalized, and friends of Sabu such as the Insane Clown Posse and fellow Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni Shane Douglas, Raven and Mick Foley.\n\nEvery performer worked for free and paid their own travel costs, while the building used, the lighting and sound equipment and the ring itself were all provided without charge. In addition, several wrestlers and fans donated items that were subsequently auctioned or raffled, including a World Championship Wrestling t-shirt signed by Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, and a two by four signed by Jim Duggan.\n\nThe proceeds of the event were given entirely to Sabu, who went on to make a complete recovery, and returned to the ring on May 21, 2005.\n"}

The speech compares the world to a stage and life to a play and catalogues the seven stages of a man's life, sometimes referred to as the seven ages of man: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, Pantalone, and old age, facing imminent death. It is one of Shakespeare's most frequently quoted passages.\n\nThe comparison of the world to a stage and people to actors long predated Shakespeare. Juvenal, the ancient Roman poet, wrote one of the earliest versions of this line in his “Satire 3”: “All of Greece is a stage, and every Greek’s an actor.” Richard Edwards' play \"Damon and Pythias\", written in the year Shakespeare was born, contains the lines, \"Pythagoras said that this world was like a stage / Whereon many play their parts; the lookers-on, the sage\". When it was founded in 1599 Shakespeare's own theatre, The Globe, may have used the motto ' (All the world plays the actor), the Latin text of which is derived from a 12th-century treatise. Ultimately the words derive from ' (because almost the whole world are actors) attributed to Petronius, a phrase which had wide circulation in England at the time.\n\nIn his own earlier work, \"The Merchant of Venice\", Shakespeare also had one of his main characters, Antonio, comparing the world to a stage:\n\nIn his work \"The Praise of Folly\", first printed in 1511, Renaissance humanist Erasmus asks, \"For what else is the life of man but a kind of play in which men in various costumes perform until the director motions them off the stage.\"\n\nLikewise the division of human life into a series of ages was a commonplace of art and literature, which Shakespeare would have expected his audiences to recognize. The number of ages varied: three and four being the most common among ancient writers such as Aristotle. The concept of seven ages derives from mediaeval philosophy, which constructed groups of seven, as in the seven deadly sins, for theological reasons. The seven ages model dates from the 12th century. King Henry V had a tapestry illustrating the seven ages of man.\n\nAccording to T. W. Baldwin, Shakespeare's version of the concept of the ages of man is based primarily upon Palingenius' book \"Zodiacus Vitae\", a school text he would have studied at the Stratford Grammar School, which also enumerates stages of human life. He also takes elements from Ovid and other sources known to him.\n\n"}

The film's music was composed by Anu Malik, and the lyrics by Sameer. It has a plot loosely inspired by \"The Whole Nine Yards\", and features action scenes choreographed by stunt director Dion Lam, who worked on \"The Matrix\" and Hong Kong action films. \"Awara Paagal Deewana\" was one of the highest grossing Hindi films of the year 2002. It was notable for lavish and exotic song picturisations, stunts/action scenes by Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal's popular comical chemistry with Johnny Lever, who played a funny character called Chhota Chhatri.\n\nThe story centres on the legacy of a dead Indian underworld don Baba Baldev Prasad (Om Puri), who dies of a heart attack. He leaves a diamonds worth $200mn at the New York Bank, to be distributed equally between his son Vikrant (Rahul Dev), his daughter Preeti (Preeti Jhangiani), and Preeti's husband Guru Gulab Khatri (Akshay Kumar). To claim the diamonds, all three benefactors must be present at the bank or, if dead, their death certificates must be presented.\n\nShortly after the Don's death, Vikrant attempts to eliminate Guru by assassinating the Indian home minister in full view of television cameras while disguised as him. Guru flees to the US disguised as someone else to escape prosecution. Guru moves to the street where Anmol (Aftab Shivdasani) and his family live. Anmol recognizes him from the news. His mother-in-law (Supriya Pilgaonkar) forces him to go to India, along with his father-in-law, Manilal (Paresh Rawal) to tell Vikrant about Guru and get the reward.

Later, they find out that Yeda Anna was a double agent: He was working for Guru the whole time because he offered more money. The group receive Vikrant and Preeti at the airport and drive to the hotel. At the hotel, Vikrant is kidnapped by a mysterious group of Chinese goons. Yeda Anna receives a phone call and finds out that the kidnapped Vikrant was a duplicate of the real one and the real one was going to come later by plane. They kill the second Vikrant and put his body in a car by the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nWith Vikrant's death, Preeti and Guru each get half of the diamonds. When they are outside the bank, a group of policemen arrest them and take them to an unknown desert area. It is revealed that Vikrant is still alive and the first Vikrant was kidnapped by Chinese goons. Vikrant gets the diamonds and tries to kill Guru. A fight occurs. At the end of the fight, Guru kills Vikrant. When it's all over, they ask each other to find out who has the diamonds. Anmol has them and says he will give them to Guru if he gives Preeti a divorce. Guru arrives at the location selected by Anmol and gets the diamonds, while giving Anmol the divorce papers. Yeda Anna betrays Guru and tries to steal the diamonds. Guru wins in a fight and gives the diamonds to Yeda Anna while hanging him to a bar and having him stand on Chota Chathri's shoulders. In the end, Anmol and his love, Preeti, are seen going to India. Anmol's ex-father-in-law gives him some diamonds that he received from Guru.

{"id": "23729853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23729853", "title": "Balibo (film)", "text": "Balibo (film)\n\nBalibo is a 2009 Australian war film that follows the story of the Balibo Five, a group of journalists who were captured and killed while reporting on activities just prior to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor of 1975. While historically accurate, the film is loosely based on the book \"Cover-Up\" by Jill Jolliffe, an Australian journalist who met the men before they were killed.\n\nThe film follows dishevelled journalist Roger East, played by Anthony LaPaglia, who travels to East Timor in 1975 to investigate the deaths of the Balibo Five during the buildup to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. Oscar Isaac plays the young José Ramos-Horta, who would later receive the Nobel Peace Prize and become the second President of East Timor, who joins East in the movie.\n\nFilming began on 30 June 2008, in Dili, East Timor, and the film was released the following year. It was produced by Arenafilm in Australia with Robert Connolly as director, David Williamson as screenwriter, and Professor Clinton Fernandes as historical consultant.\nLaPaglia, also an Executive Producer, named East as \"probably the best role I've ever had\".\n\nThe story is seen through the eyes of veteran journalist Roger East. Introduced as a once-fearless foreign correspondent now working in PR in Darwin, East is drawn to East Timor by José Ramos-Horta of Fretilin; then the fledgling republic's charismatic young secretary of foreign affairs. Initially refusing to become involved, East changes his tune after Ramos-Horta shows him photos of five Australian TV reporters missing in the border town of Balibo.\n\nVignettes then show Greg Shackleton, Gary Cunningham, Malcolm Rennie, Brian Peters and Tony Stewart, all under 30, saying goodbye to loved ones and setting out on their assignments a month earlier.\n\nParallel action follows with the Balibo Five tracked from East Timor's capital to their terrifying end after filming the Indonesian advance, and East and Ramos-Horta retracing their steps through by now extremely dangerous territory. Shackleton's last surviving report is recreated: sitting in a village, he says its inhabitants don't know if they will be alive tomorrow and have asked him why no one in Australia or anywhere else will help.\n\nDrawing attention to the techniques of news gathering and delivery in 1975, the film raises the idea of what might have happened had the Balibo Five not been cut off from communicating with the world and slowed by heavy 16mm film equipment.\n\nBookended by contemporary scenes of a fictional East Timorese woman remembering East and life under Indonesian occupation, the film closes with a tribute to the nation's rebirth in 1999 and the many tens of thousands of lives lost in the struggle for independence.\n\n\n\"Balibo\" was the first feature film to be made in East Timor. Shooting in Dili began on 31 July 2008, with United Nations police closing off roads, to allow the scenes to be filmed. Gritty 16mm-to-35mm visuals shot at the actual locations where the events took place give a documentary-style texture.\n\nThe film's version of events was validated by an Australian coroner in 2007. After a fresh review of the evidence, the coroner ruled that the journalists were executed as they tried to surrender to Indonesian forces.\nThe filmmakers hope that Balibo will spur the Australian government into action. Almost 18 months on, it has not responded to the coroner's findings - a reticence which may stem from its fear of upsetting diplomatic relations with Jakarta. Robert Connolly said that he did not set out to provoke Jakarta but wanted to examine a seminal moment in Indonesia's 24-year occupation of East Timor, when an estimated 183,000 people died: \"I think it had to be graphic because otherwise you dangerously dilute what happened.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives a score of 100% based on 11 reviews, 81% of audiences like the film.\n\n\"Balibo\" received its world premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival on 24 July 2009 at Melbourne's Hamer Hall. The then President of East Timor, José Ramos-Horta was in attendance and an address alleged that the Balibo Five were tortured and killed by Indonesian forces. On changes over recent years in Indonesia Ramos-Horta said \"It is better. Indonesian democracy today is one of the most inspiring in the south-east Asia region.\" Also in attendance were the families of the Balibo Five. Relatives of Tony Stewart held aloft a banner bearing his name which had been embroidered by East Timorese women. Maureen Tolfree, sister of Brian Peters, said she hoped many Australians would see the film and that she thought \"...it will bring to the Australian public what's gone on,\" she said.\n\n\"Variety\"s Richard Kuipers dubbed the film \"a tense, character-driven thriller with political comment on the side, allowing viewers with little or no prior knowledge of the subject matter to engage instinctively with the Balibo Five,\" filmed where it happened and \"packing a huge emotional punch\". Kuipers continues: \"LaPaglia is particularly good as the weary scribe who slowly rediscovers his old fire, and Isaac sparks off him impressively as the younger man whose ability to read people is as sharp as his political acumen.\"\n\n\"Screen International\"s Frank Hatherley opined: \"Shot on location with loving attention to period detail, the film's take on these long-buried events is convincing. Connolly's three strands are expertly woven together, coming to twin climaxes where terror and cruelty overwhelm everyone. These ‘killing field' scenes are not for the squeamish.\"\n\n\"The Monthly\"s Luke Davies wrote: \"Jill Jollife's book ... argues that the Australian government has always known the exact circumstances of the newsmen's deaths. Connolly doesn't try to answer such questions, but rather lets them echo in the film.\" Davies commended Connolly and co-screenwriter David Williamson for having \"crafted an engaging film in which we come to care about the destiny of an entire people as well as for individual characters\", and that \"the film's denouement is terrifying\", making it a realistic and confronting experience.\n\n\"Balibo\" grossed $1,330,863 at the box office in Australia.\n\nThe film was to have premiered in Indonesia at the 2009 Jakarta International Film Festival. However, in advance of a private screening, the film was banned by the Indonesian Film Censorship Agency. Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said the ban was to avoid a negative \"global perception of Indonesia\". The Indonesian military supported the ban, with a spokesman saying the film could harm Indonesia's relations with Timor Leste and Australia. He also repeated the official version of events, namely that the journalists were killed in a crossfire, and not by Indonesian troops.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "556584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=556584", "title": "Bill DeMott", "text": "Bill DeMott\n\nWilliam Charles DeMott II (born November 10, 1966) is an American retired professional wrestler and road agent. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Hugh Morrus and World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) under his real name. DeMott also performed as Crash the Terminator in both Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Japan. He was most recently the head trainer for WWE's developmental system NXT until his resignation in 2015 following allegations of misconduct, which he denied.\n\nGenerally used as a jobber to the stars in WCW, he attained championship success during the promotion's dying days in late 2000 and early 2001, holding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship twice. After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's \"Tough Enough\" program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories Deep South Wrestling, Florida Championship Wrestling, and NXT.\n\nWilliam Charles DeMott II was born on November 10, 1966, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He grew up in Paramus, New Jersey, graduating from Paramus High School in 1983.\n\nDeMott was trained by Johnny Rodz in his New York City wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the American Wrestling Federation and started using the name Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in Puerto Rico, before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with Mr. Pogo. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhen DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for Extreme Championship Wrestling for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation at a Monday Night Raw taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge. He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a battle royal. Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.\n\nIn 1995, DeMott was signed to a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) contract at the behest of Kevin Sullivan who had been impressed by him. He debuted in dark matches as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange gimmick that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of The Dungeon of Doom as \"The Laughing Man\" Hugh Morrus (a pun on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a vignette inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his (kayfabe) father, The Master, that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\"\n\nUpon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to Bill Goldberg during the September 22, 1997 episode of \"Nitro\". As a part of the growing hardcore wrestling style in WCW, Morrus joined Jimmy Hart's First Family stable. Although the Family found success and received a push following a victory over their rivals The Revolution, the stable was suddenly disbanded.\n\nAt this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but squashing a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.\n\nAfter getting on Russo's bad side (in kayfabe), Morrus was fired from his New Blood stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including Chavo Guerrero, Jr. and Booker T) formed the comedic Misfits In Action stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against The Filthy Animals.\n\nThe group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel Team Canada, the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and United States Heavyweight Champion Lance Storm, with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a turncoat \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan in a handicap match on October 29 at Halloween Havoc to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of \"Nitro\" before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at Mayhem.\n\nAfter his feud with Storm, the next night on \"Nitro\", DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; Bill Goldberg grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\"\n\nAt Sin on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to Shane Douglas. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were honorably discharged, which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) bought out WCW.\n\nWhen WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of The Invasion angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of The Alliance. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of \"Raw\" by attacking Edge. Aside from a pay-per-view match at Invasion on July 22 where he, Shawn Stasiak and Chris Kanyon defeated Big Show, Billy Gunn and Albert and an Intercontinental Championship match on the August 27 episode of \"Raw\" which he lost to Edge via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows \"Heat\" and \"Jakked\" much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at Survivor Series following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was kayfabe fired by Vince McMahon. While off television, Morrus performed at house shows and worked in company's developmental territory Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with Raven to defeat Lance Cade and Steve Bradley to win the Tag Team Champions on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.\n\nIn April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of \"Jakked\" alongside fellow WCW alumnus Chavo Guerrero and defeated The Hurricane and Funaki. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on \"Jakked\" and later \"Velocity\" until late July 2002, when he was legitimately injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of \"Tough Enough\", WWE's reality television show.\n\nWhen he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of \"Velocity\" under his real name. DeMott made his \"SmackDown!\" debut on December 5 as a heel, where he defeated Funaki in a squash match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a push that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, Shannon Moore, Chuck Palumbo, Crash Holly, and Rikishi weekly on \"SmackDown!\". However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to \"Velocity\" beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a face turn that also saw him tell knock-knock jokes as part of the turn. As the gimmick failed to get over, he remained on \"Velocity\" while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of \"Velocity\", where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus Chris Kanyon. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the color commentator for \"Velocity\", beginning on the November 1 episode, and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.\n\nWhen \"Tough Enough 4\" wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to \"Velocity\". Instead, he became a full-time trainer for WWE and began working in the company's Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. DeMott also worked as a booker for DSW, although his direction in the promotion received criticism, most notably by former WWE developmental wrestler Kenny Omega, who soon requested to be released from his developmental contract due to poor treatment. DeMott was released from his WWE contract on January 19, 2007, with Tom Prichard taking his place as DSW's head trainer.\n\nIn March 2015, Devon Nicholson described an incident from 2006 that DeMott was involved with while he was head trainer for the WWE's Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. Nicholson described an incident where Drew Hankinson was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked stinkfaces to Zack Ryder and Melissa Coates while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with because they wanted to skip the session.\n\nAfter parting ways with WWE, DeMott competed for several independent promotions, including the Carolina Wrestling Association and the United Wrestling Federation. In addition to wrestling, he also began operating his own wrestling school called New Energy Wrestling School from 2009 to 2010 in McDonough, Georgia, while also running a brief series of wrestling events in Locust Grove, Georgia.\n\nIn 2011, WWE announced that DeMott would return to the company to perform as the head trainer on the revived \"Tough Enough\" series. Following the conclusion of \"Tough Enough\", DeMott replaced Tom Prichard as the head trainer for the Florida Championship Wrestling developmental territory on June 2, 2012. After FCW was rebranded into NXT, DeMott retained his position as the head trainer, and continued in that role when the WWE Performance Center was opened in 2013. He was featured as a trainer in the WWE 2K15 video game, however, also included his negative comments towards fictional and actual NXT trainees.\n\nDeMott resigned from the company on March 6, 2015 following widespread accusations of misconduct and abuse by a number of ex-trainees, allegations which DeMott denied.\n\nSeveral former FCW, DSW, and NXT employees previously working within or with the WWE developmental system made public allegations of misconduct by DeMott during his time as trainer, including accusing DeMott of making trainees perform dangerous drills, physically assaulting and bullying trainees, using homophobic and racial slurs amongst other derogatory terms, letting trainees train while naked, and condoning sexual harassment. These allegations were made by Kevin Matthews, Mike Bucci and Devon Nicholson in 2012, Chad Baxter and Chase Donovan in 2013, Curt Hawkins in 2014, as well as several wrestlers including Judas Devlin, Briley Pierce, Brandon Traven, Derrick Bateman and independent wrestler Terra Calaway from late February to March 2015. Devlin and Traven claimed to have submitted complaints to WWE management about DeMott in March 2013 when they were still employed with WWE, but only publicized the complaints in 2015. WWE released statements regarding some of the claims that came to light in 2013 and 2015, claiming that investigations were done and no wrongdoing was found. Pierce questioned the thoroughness of the investigations, stating that WWE did not question him despite him allegedly being one of the claimed victims. The allegations caused a negative reaction on social media in March 2015, with the #FireDeMott hashtag trending on Twitter. On March 6, 2015, DeMott publicly denied the allegations on Twitter, but also announced his resignation from WWE \"to avoid any embarrassment or damage\" to the company.\n\nDeMott voiced himself in the video game \"WWE 2K15\". He worked as a guide of sorts during the MyCareer mode.\n\nDeMott married his first wife, Rose Azzolino, in 1987. The marriage was annulled in 2004. They had two daughters: Casey, who was born two months premature on July 7, 1993, and Keri, who was born on January 9, 1995 and died in a car accident in Orlando, Florida on October 10, 2015.\n\nDeMott married his second wife, Lacey Storey, on December 18, 2004. They have a son, William Charles DeMott III, who was born on November 2, 2008.\n\n\n"}

Alluding to the management-speak idiom \"It's like herding cats\" that refers to the impossibility of controlling the uncontrollable, it posits an analogy between herding cats and the solution of seemingly impossible problems by EDS.\n\nUsing a \"giant Western metaphor\", it features \"grizzled cowboys\" herding thousands of cats across the Montana prairie, terminating in the satisfactory resolution \"EDSolved\". The commercial was shown on 30 January 2000 at the Super Bowl XXXIV and was cited by then-President Bill Clinton as his favorite commercial.\n\nEDS retained Fallon in 1999 to create a campaign with strong brand awareness with a dual purpose: to change the company's image for present and future growth and also to improve the morale and self-image of its employees. Fulfilling this remit, the advertisement \"gave EDS employees an image that was serious, despite the humor of the commercial, and it highlighted EDS’s problem-solving capabilities for its customers.\"\n\nThe title \"Cat Herders\" applied to both the initial advertisement and the campaign, which was presented as a trilogy. \nThe two sequels, \"Airplane\" and \"Running with Squirrels\", had visual impact but did not replicate the success of \"Cat Herders\".\n\nAuthentic cowboys were required, and a casting call was put out across Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and California. Some of the cast had never acted previously but others were SAG-accredited.\n\nActor Tony Becker points out that many of the actors were \"real-life cowboys\", and gives a comprehensive cast list:\n\n\nNotwithstanding the listing of only two participants as stunt performers, many of the actors are skilled cowboy professionals, with credits as horse trainers, wranglers, doubles, trick-roper and also as stunt performers. A few operate ranches or rodeo or stunt performing services, as per the citations given above.\n\nFor the shoot, some actors wore their own clothes, but their faces were made up to look cat-scratched, tanned or weatherbeaten.\n\nNumbers of cats used to create the illusion of thousands running wild vary from 50 to 60. According to Becker, \"only about 60 cats were used in the actual filming (with about 1 trainer per 5 cats). The rest were computer-generated\".\n\nCat Herders was filmed during December 1999 at Tejon Ranch, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles. Established in 1843, it is, at nearly 270,000 acres, the largest continuous expanse of private land in California. The landscape features a \"dramatic tapestry of rugged mountains, steep canyons, oak-covered rolling hills, and broad valleys\" and cowboys on horseback still herd cattle along the open grazing land.\n\nFilming was accomplished over five days of wintry conditions, workers in goggles and full face masks battling through rain, snow, fog, sleet, blowing sand and fierce 40mph winds. As one worker recalls: \"Shooting this spot was the most cold and miserable shooting days I've ever had. Out in the plains, freezing cold, wind so strong it would catch your car door and bend it back.\" On set, the cats were housed in individual cages in \"trucks filled with movie cats\". At night, \"interspecies bonding\" occurred with crew members bringing cats back to their hotels:\"we actually snuck a cat into our motel room because he had had surgery and needed to recuperate. So he lived under the bed\".\n\nThe copywriter was Greg Hahn, but \"the script came largely out of the improvised quips of the cowboys, replacing cattle with cats\".\n\nThe commercial called for differing feline skills, including running, water scenes, or staying motionless. To prepare for filming, 50 cats and their trainers travelled to Tejon Ranch a week before the crew.\n\nFor the dramatic river-crossing, Art Director Dean Hanson told \"Adweek\", Trainers taught the cats to swim by starting them out in one-quarter inch of water, then gradually building the pool to swimming depth. . . . Since we were shooting in nippy weather, our 'river' was actually a small pool warmed by a portable heater, like a little cat Jacuzzi.\n\nCats worked in shifts to film the herding scenes, with head trainer Karin McElhatton hiding in tumbleweeds to issue verbal directions.\n\nThe illusion of cats stampeding was achieved by using clickers normally associated with food. During filming, clickers prompted the felines to run downhill, towards food which was out of shot. At other times, cats were lured by \"strategically smeared tuna\".\nMonitored by the American Humane Association, horses and cats were filmed separately in order to prevent \"accidental tramplings\".\nFor scenes where both are required, a computer-operated motion-control camera is used to film the same shot over and over with each animal. The horses, background and layers of kitties are filmed separately, and each will be stripped in during post-production to create the illusion of an elaborate cat drive.\n\n\nAmong others, Cat Herders won the First \"Boards\" Award (2000), a Cannes Silver Lion (2000), a bronze Clio (2001), Advertising Age’s Best Visual Effects Award (2001), and a silver EFFIE Award (2001).\n\nIt received a nomination for an Emmy for Outstanding Commercial (2000).\n\n"}
{"id": "159939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159939", "title": "Christian music industry", "text": "Christian music industry\n\nThe Christian music industry is a small part of the larger music industry, that focuses on traditional Gospel music, Southern gospel, contemporary Christian music, and alternative Christian music. It is sometimes called the gospel music industry, although this designation is not a limitation on the musical styles represented.\n\nChristian artists generally use secular styles, pairing them with lyrics that display faith and spirituality to varying degrees. Generally speaking, the industry is influenced by mainstream culture. Musical trends, for instance, follow those of the secular scene, though usually a few years behind. The Christian music industry carries the distinction of being the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music. Still, music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content.\n\nChristian music's critics point to the divergent interests of commercialization and ministry, which have, according to some, polar opposite goals. Aspects of Christian music have long struggled to gain general acceptance, even within the Christian community. What some see as secularization and a lacking of direct theology, others see as artistic ministry. This opens up questions of the definition of \"Christian music\" that have lingered over the industry since its inception.\n\nThe Christian music industry experienced tremendous growth in the 1990s. Christian music sales grew to exceed those for classical, jazz, and new age music. Even so, the Christian music industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years.\n\nThe contemporary Christian music industry has roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s Jesus movement and its Jesus music artists. The \"Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music\" points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry. First, the Jesus movement produced a large number of bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb. This was in part due to a lack of appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists. Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations. According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure. Petra, for instance, struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.\n\nEven so, the 1970s saw established corporations become involved in the Christian music market. Word Records, founded in 1951, was bought in 1976 by ABC. Other music industry giants also got involved, CBS started a short-lived Christian label, Priority Records, and MCA also fielded a label, Songbird Records, for a time.\n\nWhile the Jesus movement had ended by the 1980s, the Christian music industry was maturing and transforming into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The early 1980s saw an increase Christian booksellers taking product, and an increase in sales followed, despite the recession. As a percentage of gross sales, Christian music rose from 9% in 1976 to 23% in 1985. By her 1982 release Amy Grant had saturated the Christian marketplace and made significant inroads into the general market. Sandi Patti and Michael W. Smith also gained influence within Christian music, each playing significant roles in the development of the industry.\n\nHarder forms of Christian music, such as heavy metal, also began to gain acceptance. This is largely credited to Stryper, who had begun making inroads into the general market by 1985. Still, rock and alternative acts faced a longer battle for acceptance than contemporary acts, as the form was opposed by prominent religious leaders such as Jimmy Swaggart and others on the Christian right. While in 1981 total gospel music industry revenues were approximately $180 million, only ten years later they would total $680 million, according to \"CCM Magazine\".\n\nAccording to RIAA data, market share for sales of Christian music albums more than doubled between 1993 and 1997. In the 1990s the Christian music industry became the fastest growing segment of the music industry. This was due to several factors, including consolidation of record labels, and independent Christian bookstores into chains.\n\nThe Christian music industry began adopting SoundScan in 1995, although implementation was spotty even into the millennium. Even so, the adoption caused the visibility of Christian artists to increase significantly, and brought credibility to the industry as Christian albums became integrated into all \"Billboard\" charts.\n\nIn 1985, 90% of Christian music sales originated at Christian bookstores. By 1995, that number had dropped to 64%, with general retailers taking 21%, and the remainder accountable through other methods, such as direct mail. At that same time, the industry was estimated to gross $750 million, with $381 million in album sales. In the late 1990s, general market retailers, especially big box stores such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Target, and Blockbuster began carrying a wider selection of Christian music products. By 2000 those stores had surpassed Christian retail in terms of the number of Christian albums sold, according to Soundscan numbers. This phenomenon was partially responsible for crossover successes. P.O.D., for example, sold 1.4 million albums in 2001, although sales at Christian retail outlets accounted for only 10%.\n\nThe new millennium has brought challenges for the record industry as a whole, and these have affected the Christian music industry as well. Contemporary worship music, a long time staple of the industry, began to gain significant market share in about the year 2000. By focusing on marketing worship music to youth culture, this genre became a growth driver despite the downturn in the general music industry.\n\nGrowth continued until about 2003, but has generally followed the trends of the larger music industry since that point. In 2009 a The New York Times op-ed placed the entire music industry on a \"deathwatch,\" pointing out that new forms of media, piracy, and new pricing options are driving gross sales down. In another example of parallelism, the Christian music industry has experienced largely the same phenomenon. In the Christian marketplace, music consumption has risen by as much as 30% since 2005, but overall album sales have dropped to about half of their 1999 levels. However, some critics point out that the current downturn may have long term positive effects for the industry. John J. Thompson told \"Christianity Today\" that \"The lack of monetary benefit has filtered out some of the people who should not have been doing this in the first place. If the people who are in it for the money are gone, it leaves more turf for those who had something a little bit loftier in mind.\"\n\nChristian music is sometimes cited as a \"ghetto,\" meaning that the majority of artists in the industry are pigeonholed to operate solely in it. These artists are isolated from the mainstream public, to Christian media, including radio, magazines, and book stores. For many this is a conscious choice, however others, not content to stay in an isolated industry segment, attempt to \"cross over\" and gain acceptance in the general market. For many artists, being called Christian becomes a stigma.\n\nA 1997 study revealed that a self-identified audience of \"Christian music listeners\" had what was considered a lacking recognition of Christian artists. The survey was commissioned by the Christian Music Trade Association and Z Music Television. The study looked at several artists including Amy Grant, BeBe and CeCe Winans, Carman, Steven Curtis Chapman, dc Talk, Sandi Patty, and Michael W. Smith. At the time of the survey, each of these artists was active in Christian music and had been so for at least nine years, was a multiple Dove Award and/or Grammy Award winner, and had albums certified Gold or higher.\n\nEven so, the survey found that the Christian music audience was no more familiar with artists in the field than they were with Hootie & The Blowfish, a popular act at that time. The study concluded that the word \"Christian\" was the problem, causing a stigma. \"It's the label, not the music, that dissuades,\" one Christian music executive was quoted as saying, agreeing with the survey.\n\nAnother aspect of the \"ghetto\" is that some artists have trouble gaining audience with Christians due to their non-conservative image. Stryper is a well-known example. Stryper received large amounts of criticism from groups on the Christian right, who argue (among other things) that their image as rock stars contradict their espoused faith. One critic wrote that the marriage of secular and religious elements in \"Christian music\" \"violates all that God has commanded in the Bible about separation.\"\n\nThe \"ghetto\" has several effects, critics point out that the audience of such artists are often already Christians, thus limiting the impact of any supposed \"evangelism.\" Another is that artists sometimes have trouble appealing to and maintaining both secular and religious audiences. For example:\n\n\nThe problem, as summed by one critic, was that the music was too religious for secular audience, while simultaneously too aggressive for religious audiences. One critic describes the situation, stating that for a band \"to be taken seriously outside the Christian scene, a band must stay far, far away from that scene.\"\n\nMutemath, for instance sued their record label with the goal of removing their product from the Christian market. Their first release sold almost 30,000 copies, with \"bulk of sales coming from the Christian market,\" according to \"Billboard\". The band had been placed in the Christian market by their record label largely because their lead singer, Paul Meany, was previously with the band Earthsuit, whose only major label release was released on a Christian label.\n\nThis caused the band to not get taken seriously by music critics, and by the release of their full-length album the band began expressing discontent with their situation. Meany told \"Tucson Weekly\" \"...we began to see ourselves getting pigeonholed into this particular world that we weren't necessarily proud to be associated with... We're not trying to preach through our music; we don't have some kind of evangelistic agenda with what we're doing... You know, you don't want to be ashamed of your faith and your beliefs, but you don't want to be marketed by that, either.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some artists operate solely within the \"ghetto\" of Christian music, and find great success in doing so.\n\nAn early Christian record label, Lamb & Lion Records (founded by Pat Boone) reported in 1978 that it was their goal to produce crossover artists, but they were limited by lack of distribution to the secular marketplace. Both problems affected Christian labels into the 1990s. \"Since people don't understand [the term] 'the Blood of Jesus, '\" stated a manager for Lamb & Lion, \"...music that communicates must approach it another way. We've got to present a subtle but sensitive Christian message.\" Lyrics with subdued religious content have become commonplace in the industry; One critic points out that the secular hit \"Spirit in the Sky\" \"has more explicit religious references than do many recent Christian radio hits.\"\n\nSome critics have alleged that CCM often uses \"minimal direct theology,\" and promotes a \"Jesus is my boyfriend\" image of God. Using downplayed religious content in lyrics has allowed some artists to \"cross over\" and make significant impact into the general market. Some Christian bands are able to do this while maintaining their identity in the Christian market. For example, MercyMe, whose double platinum album \"Almost There\" produced the Christian and secular chart hit \"I Can Only Imagine.\" However, the lyrics of the single, while Christian in nature, contain what one critic calls \"rather vacuous theology.\"\n\nSometimes \"crossing over\" creates ambiguity over whether an artist is Christian (a \"Christian band\"), or the artist is composed of Christians and produces music that appeals to Christian music fans but doesn't cater to the Christian market (\"Christians in a band\"). Such artists are:\n\n\nThe trend continues when examining religious videos. Many Christian bands produce videos with rotation on MTV in mind, however, the images can lead to an ambiguous impression of the portrayal.\n\nIn 1982 MTV featured two videos, \"Constantly Changing\" and \"It's Mad\" (which was the first one to be featured), made by the Swedish Christian rock band Jerusalem to promote their 1981 release \"Warrior\". DeGarmo and Key was the first Christian band in the US whose video appeared on MTV, made a video for their single \"Six, Six, Six\" off their 1984 release \"Communication\". While the video was shown on MTV for a short time, it was subsequently pulled for a scene which depicted the Antichrist engulfed in flames, which MTV described as \"senseless violence.\" Eventually the video was re-edited for MTV—however, the unedited version continued to play in Christian bookstores and on Christian television networks, like Trinity Broadcasting. The video received a Dove award in a category created specially for it, \"Gospel Music Visual Song\" in 1985.\n\nAnother artist, Brian Welch, whose \"solo debut\" was released to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for \"Flush\" was released. The video is an interpretation of the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: \"The video for 'Flush' is about crystal meth addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves.\"\nA study of visual elements of Christian music videos on Z Music Television, a now defunct MTV-like channel for Christian music, found that almost one third of the channel's videos could be described as \"Ambiguously Religious\" at best (red area, right). The conclusion was that the channel's programming was designed to make its Christian nature \"apparent only to those willing to listen for it.\"\n\nSome critics describe the Christian music industry as being committed \"to the goals and strategies of the commercial marketplace – industrial growth, increased market share, and greater profits.\" This became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s as the largest Christian record labels became subsidiaries of the \"mainstream\" labels (who are themselves owned by huge media conglomerates like Viacom and Time Warner). Others see the industry as taking on the roles traditionally reserved for the church. Concerts are the equivalent of religious services, and commodities symbols of faith. Under these conditions \"evangelism becomes rhetoric—justifying the propaganda value of the industry's work – not spiritual reality.\" One critic comments that \"perhaps the 'ghettoization' and parallel institutionalism of CCM manifests itself nowhere more apparently than at numerous Christian rock festivals.\"\n\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nIndustry organizations\n\nOther\n"}
{"id": "68090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68090", "title": "Count Basie", "text": "Count Basie\n\nWilliam James \"Count\" Basie (August 21, 1904 – April 26, 1984) was an American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. \n\nIn 1935, Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the Count Basie Orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing, Helen Humes, Thelma Carpenter, and Joe Williams.\n\nWilliam Basie was born to Harvey Lee and Lillian Basie in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area. Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the mellophone, and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for piano instruction for him.\n\nNot much of a student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the silent movies.\n\nThough a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of Sonny Greer, who also lived in Red Bank and became Duke Ellington's drummer in 1919, Basie at age 15 switched to piano exclusively. Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson's \"Kings of Syncopation\". When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in Asbury Park at the Jersey Shore, and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.\n\nAround 1920, Basie went to Harlem, a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the Alhambra Theater. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington's early band. Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were \"making the scene,\" including Willie \"the Lion\" Smith and James P. Johnson.\n\nBasie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including \"Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies\" as part of the \"Hippity Hop\" show; on the Keith, the Columbia Burlesque, and the Theater Owners Bookers Association (T.O.B.A.) vaudeville circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to blues singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White. His touring took him to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong. Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians. This provided an early training that was to prove significant in his later career.\n\nBack in Harlem in 1925, Basie gained his first steady job at Leroy's, a place known for its piano players and its \"cutting contests.\" The place catered to \"uptown celebrities,\" and typically the band winged every number without sheet music using \"head arrangements.\" He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument. (Basie later played organ at the Eblon Theater in Kansas City). As he did with Duke Ellington, Willie \"the Lion\" Smith helped Basie out during the lean times by arranging gigs at \"house-rent parties,\" introducing him to other leading musicians, and teaching him some piano technique.\n\nIn 1928, Basie was in Tulsa and heard Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils, one of the first big bands, which featured Jimmy Rushing on vocals. A few months later, he was invited to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. It was at this time that he began to be known as \"Count\" Basie (see Jazz royalty).\n\nThe following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the Bennie Moten band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten's ambition to raise his band to the level of Duke Ellington's or Fletcher Henderson's. Where the Blue Devils were \"snappier\" and more \"bluesy,\" the Moten band was more refined and respected, playing in the \"Kansas City stomp\" style. In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with Eddie Durham, who notated the music.\nTheir \"Moten Swing\", which Basie claimed credit for, was widely acclaimed and was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the Pearl Theatre in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in who wanted to hear the band perform. \nDuring a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted. The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.\n\nWhen the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group \"Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms.\" When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band. A year later, Basie joined Bennie Moten's band, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935 from a failed tonsillectomy. When Moten died, the band tried to stay together but couldn't make a go of it. Basie then formed his own nine-piece band, Barons of Rhythm, with many former Moten members including Walter Page (bass), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Lester Young (tenor saxophone) and Jimmy Rushing (vocals).\n\nThe Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club and often performed for a live radio broadcast. During a broadcast the announcer wanted to give Basie's name some style, so he called him \"Count.\" Little did Basie know this touch of royalty would give him proper status and position him with the likes of Duke Ellington and Earl Hines.\n\nBasie's new band which included many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor player Lester Young. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece \"One O'Clock Jump.\" According to Basie, \"we hit it with the rhythm section and went into the riffs, and the riffs just stuck. We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F.\" It became his signature tune.\n\nAt the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as \"Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm,\" moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Ballroom. Right from the start, Basie's band was noted for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of Herschel Evans' vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the alto players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in \"duels\". Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.\n\nIn that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer John Hammond later described as \"the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever had anything to do with\". Hammond had heard Basie's band by radio and went to Kansas City to check them out. He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings. Those four sides were released on Vocalion Records under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were \"Shoe Shine Boy\", \"Evening\", \"Boogie Woogie\", and \"Lady Be Good\". After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, \"Boogie Woogie\" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled \"Boogie Woogie\" (Columbia album C44). When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with Decca Records, but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.\n\nBy then, Basie's sound was characterized by a \"jumping\" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Walter Page (bass), Earle Warren (alto sax), Buck Clayton and Harry Edison (trumpet), Benny Morton and Dickie Wells (trombone). Lester Young, known as \"Prez\" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie \"Holy Man\", \"Holy Main\", and just plain \"Holy\".\n\nBasie favored blues, and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: Billie Holiday, Jimmy Rushing, Big Joe Turner, Helen Humes, and Joe Williams. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band's abilities, such as Eddie Durham and Jimmy Mundy.\n\nWhen Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement). Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, \"We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire. Well, the Roseland is still standing\". Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.\n\nThe producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards. They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up. His first official recordings for Decca followed, under contract to agent MCA, including \"Pennies from Heaven\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose\".\n\nHammond introduced Basie to Billie Holiday, whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos). The band's first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and Jimmy Rushing getting the most attention. Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings. There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their \"head arrangements\" and collective memory.\n\nNext, Basie played at the Savoy, which was noted more for lindy-hopping, while the Roseland was a place for fox-trots and congas. In early 1938, the Savoy was the meeting ground for a \"battle of the bands\" with Chick Webb's group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer Ella Fitzgerald. As \"Metronome\" magazine proclaimed, \"Basie's Brilliant Band Conquers Chick's\"; the article described the evening:\n\nThroughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick's forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick's brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick's thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary.\n\nThe publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition. Soon after, Benny Goodman recorded their signature \"One O'Clock Jump\" with his band.\n\nA few months later, Holiday left for Artie Shaw's band. Hammond introduced Helen Humes, whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years. When Eddie Durham left for Glenn Miller's orchestra, he was replaced by Dicky Wells. Basie's 14-man band began playing at the Famous Door, a mid-town nightspot with a CBS network feed and air conditioning, which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap. Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from Jimmy Mundy (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and Earl Hines), particularly for \"Cherokee\", \"Easy Does It\", and \"Super Chief\". In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first West Coast dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the William Morris Agency, who got them better fees.\n\nOn February 19, 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at Southland in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on 20 February.\nOn the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in \"Reveille With Beverly\", a musical film starring Ann Miller, and a \"Command Performance\" for Armed Forces Radio, with Hollywood stars Clark Gable, Bette Davis, Carmen Miranda, Jerry Colonna, and the singer Dinah Shore. Other minor movie spots followed, including \"Choo Choo Swing\", \"Crazy House\", \"Top Man\", \"Stage Door Canteen\", and \"Hit Parade of 1943\". They also continued to record for OKeh Records and Columbia Records. The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as swing began to fade, the effects of the musicians' strikes of 1942–44 and 1948 began to be felt, and the public's taste grew for singers.\n\nBasie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.\n\nThe big band era appeared to have ended after the war, and Basie disbanded the group. For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the Universal-International short film \"\"Sugar Chile\" Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet.\" He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. Basie credits Billy Eckstine, a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band. He said that Norman Granz got them into the Birdland club and promoted the new band through recordings on the Mercury, Clef, and Verve labels. The jukebox era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early rock'n'roll and rhythm and blues artists. Basie's new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on \"head\" and more on written arrangements.\n\nBasie added touches of bebop \"so long as it made sense\", and he required that \"it all had to have feeling\". Basie's band was sharing Birdland with such bebop greats as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, \"so it doesn't matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat\". Basie also added flute to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied. Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, Tommy Turrentine, Johnny Letman, Idrees Sulieman, and Joe Newman (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, Benny Powell, Matthew Gee (trombone); Paul Quinichette and Floyd \"Candy\" Johnson (tenor sax); Marshal Royal and Ernie Wilkins (alto sax); and Charlie Fowlkes (baritone sax). \"Down Beat\" magazine reported, \"(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this.\" In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue Ball and Chain in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.\n\nIn 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many expatriate American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. Neal Hefti began to provide arrangements, notably \"Lil Darlin'\". By the mid-1950s, Basie's band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the \"Birdland Stars of 1955\", whose lineup included Sarah Vaughan, Erroll Garner, Lester Young, George Shearing, and Stan Getz.\n\nIn 1957, Basie released the live album \"Count Basie at Newport\". \"April in Paris\" (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album. The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II, along with Judy Garland, Vera Lynn, and Mario Lanza. He was a guest on ABC's \"The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom,\" a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie's band recorded a \"greatest hits\" double album \"The Count Basie Story\" (Frank Foster, arranger) and \"Basie and Eckstine, Inc.\": album featuring Billy Eckstine, Quincy Jones (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.\n\nLater that year, Basie appeared on a television special with Fred Astaire, featuring a dance solo to \"Sweet Georgia Brown\", followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five John F. Kennedy Inaugural Balls. That summer, Basie and Duke Ellington combined forces for the recording \"First Time! The Count Meets the Duke\", each providing four numbers from their play books.\nDuring the balance of the 1960s, the band kept busy with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, Las Vegas shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.\n\nThrough steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as the Jerry Lewis film \"Cinderfella\" (1960) and the Mel Brooks movie \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), playing a revised arrangement of \"April in Paris\".\n\nDuring its heyday, \"The Gong Show\" (1976–80) used Basie's \"Jumpin' at the Woodside\" during some episodes, while an NBC stagehand named Eugene Patton would dance on stage; Patton became known as \"Gene Gene, the Dancing Machine\".\n\nBasie was a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. On 21 July 1930, Basie married Vivian Lee Winn, in Kansas City, Missouri. They were divorced sometime before 1935. Some time in or before 1935, the now single Basie returned to New York City, renting a house at 111 West 138th Street, Manhattan, as evidenced by the 1940 census. He married Catherine Morgan on 13 July 1940 in the King County courthouse in Seattle, Washington. In 1942, they moved to Queens. The Basies bought a whites-only home in the new neighborhood of Addisleigh Park in 1946 on Adelaide Road and 175th Street, St. Albans, Queens.\n\nOn April 11, 1983, Catherine Basie died of heart disease at the couple's home in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island. She was 67 years old.\n\nCount Basie died of pancreatic cancer in Hollywood, Florida on April 26, 1984 at the age of 79.\n\nBasie hitched his star to some of the most famous vocalists of the 1950s and 1960s, which helped keep the Big Band sound alive and added greatly to his recording catalog. Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album \"One O'Clock Jump\", and 1956's \"Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings\", with \"Every Day (I Have the Blues)\" becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album \"Basie/Eckstine Incorporated\", in 1959. Ella Fitzgerald made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album \"Ella and Basie!\". With the 'New Testament' Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful Quincy Jones, this album proved a swinging respite from her \"Songbook\" recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums \"A Classy Pair\", \"Digital III at Montreux\", and \"A Perfect Match\", the last two also recorded live at Montreux. In addition to Quincy Jones, Basie was using arrangers such as Benny Carter \"(Kansas City Suite)\", Neal Hefti \"(The Atomic Mr Basie)\", and Sammy Nestico \"(Basie-Straight Ahead)\".\n\nFrank Sinatra recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962's \"Sinatra-Basie\" and for a second studio album on 1964's \"It Might as Well Be Swing\", which was arranged by Quincy Jones. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966's live \"Sinatra at the Sands\" which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London's Royal Festival Hall with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Sinatra later said of this concert \"I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting\".\n\nBasie also recorded with Tony Bennett in the late 1950s. Their albums together included \"In Person\" and \"Strike Up the Band.\" Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at Carnegie Hall. Other notable recordings were with Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby, and Sarah Vaughan. One of Basie's biggest regrets was never recording with Louis Armstrong, though they shared the same bill several times. In 1968 Basie and his Band recorded an album with Jackie Wilson titled \"Manufacturers of Soul\".\n\nCount Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, dryly witty, and always enthusiastic about his music. In his autobiography, he wrote, \"I think the band can really \"swing\" when it swings \"easy\", when it can just play along like you are cutting butter.\"\n\n\n\nCount Basie made most of his albums with his big band. See the Count Basie Orchestra Discography.\n\nFrom 1929–1932 Basie was part of Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra:\n\n\nBy 2011, four recordings of Count Basie had been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"\n\nOn May 23, 1985, William \"Count\" Basie was presented, posthumously, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan. The award was received by his son, Aaron Woodward.\n\nOn September 11, 1996 the U.S. Post Office issued a Count Basie 32 cents postage stamp. Basie is a part of the Big Band Leaders issue, which, is in turn, part of the Legends of American Music series.\n\nIn 2009, Basie was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2005, Count Basie's song \"One O'Clock Jump\" (1937) was included by the National Recording Preservation Board in the Library of Congress National Recording Registry. The board selects songs in an annual basis that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n"}

The park opened in May 2010 and was burned down by masked men in September 2010, after being closed by the Palestinian Hamas de facto government for allowing men and women to mingle. In July, one Australian newspaper called it \"the new sensation\" among Gaza's \"privileged.\"\n\nMohammed Al-Araj, a former economics minister for the Hamas de facto government in the Gaza Strip, was one of the owners of the park. Two thousand families visited the Crazy Water Park during the first four days that it was open.\n\nThe landscaped water park, west of Gaza City, featured 3 swimming pools, a canal 100 meters long, three water slides, ponds with pedalos, a restaurant, a cafe, and a quiet area shaded by a tent where adults could sit on carpets and listen to music. The atmosphere was secular, with popular secular tunes playing over the loudspeakers and women in international-style clothing. A lifting of the government ban on women smoking in public made it legal for women to smoke the popular nargilas at the Park's cafe. The park was built with materials assembled from war-torn buildings as well as materials brought through the Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels. Construction was completed in six months. Admission was 10 shekels, the equivalent of about $2.60 as of mid-2010, but using the water slide costs another 5 shekels, and going into the pool costs an extra 20 shekels.\n\nThe park cost $2 million to build. According to Ayman Barawi, the Park's financial manager, \"This park is a form of escape. People need a chance to escape from the stress. We brought 'air' to the people.\" According to The Guardian, the water park was part of an entertainment \"circuit\" for wealthy Palestinians in Gaza, which includes seaside cafes, browsing at the Gaza Mall and riding at the Faisal Equestrian Club, adjacent to the Park.\n\nThe Park had 106 employees, not counting about 80 vendors supplying services and goods such as food. Park employees earned the equivalent of between $250 and $300 a month, considered a good wage in Gaza, where over 80% of the population received welfare payments from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and other international aid agencies.\n\nAccording to the Israeli \"Jerusalem Post\" newspaper, the Crazy Water Park is one of a number of seaside tourist resorts constructed in a $20 million building binge. According to \"The Independent\", some sources regard the Crazy Water Park as one of a group of Hamas business ventures operating since the late 2000s. According to the Reuters, the resort was built by a \"Hamas-linked charity,\" According to Egyptian journalist Ashraf Abu Al-Houl writing in \"Al-Ahram Weekly\", the park was one among a rapidly growing group of Gaza leisure parks, including Zahrat al-Madain, the Al-Bustan resort and the Bisan City tourist village, so many of which were completed between his visit to Gaza in February 2010 and his return in July 2010 as to make Gaza \"almost unrecognizable.\" He continued, \"a sense of absolute prosperity prevails, as manifested by the grand resorts along and near Gaza's coast. Further, the sight of the merchandise and luxuries filling the Gaza shops amazed me. Merchandise is sold more cheaply than in Egypt, although most of it is from the Egyptian market, and there are added shipping costs and costs for smuggling it via the tunnels – so that it could be expected to be more expensive... the siege was broken even before Israel's crime against the ships of the Freedom Flotilla in late May; everything already was coming into the Gaza Strip from Egypt. If this weren't the case, businessmen would not have been able to build so many resorts in under four months\".\n\nIn August 2010, Hamas authorities closed the water park for three days as a \"warning\" to the management against allowing men and women to mingle at parties.\n\nIn early September 2010, Hamas authorities shut down the park again for 21 days, along with other resorts and a horse riding club.\n\nResidents of Gaza criticized the government for not backing investment in housing instead of water parks. One man, interviewed while relaxing at the Water Park, told a reporter that \"If the money put into Crazy Water had been used to construct 10 buildings, 100 families could have been housed by now\".\n\nOn 19 September 2010, the water park was burned down by a group of about 40 masked individuals in a move that was seen by human rights groups as part of the increasing Islamization of Gaza. Ala al-Araj, one of the owners and a former Hamas government minister, said that at about 3 am the men tied up the guards, blindfolded them and beat them. They then set fire to an administrative building; the fire engulfed the park's three-story restaurant and cafeteria, causing extensive damage. The men also dumped gasoline around the plastic slides and torched them.\n\nThe identity of the arsonists was not immediately known, but al-Araj noted that \"all tourism projects in Gaza are threatened by extremists who reject them\" and held the Hamas administration responsible because it had closed the resort. Since seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 after a violent conflict with rival Palestinian group Fatah, Hamas had been closing down restaurants, coffee shops and hotels in the territory, claiming these places violate Islamic tradition. During the same period, other extreme Islamist groups carried out numerous attacks on establishments perceived as un-Islamic, including coffee shops, beauty salons and even UN-run summer camps.\n\nA spokesman for the Hamas interior ministry said it had opened an investigation, and denied a connection between the attack and the closure.\n\n\n"}

This is also the last game released under the Enix name, since the merger between Square and Enix was finalized a few days later, on April 1, 2003.\n\nThe game makes huge changes to the series by removing the breeding system. Instead, when defeating monsters in \"Caravan Heart\", the player can occasionally gain \"monster hearts\" which can be used to merge into a monster for a new more powerful form. Humans also fight in the battles with the monsters in this installment. The human characters have access to 20 character classes, like hunter, bard, fighter, dancer, mage, and mapper.\nOther differences include a caravan that the player must travel around in, allowing them to add both monsters and humans to their party. The caravan can have up to twelve members in it at a time, and each wagon can only hold a certain amount of weight.\n\nOn Prince Keifer's tenth birthday, the prince was looking for a way to cause a little trouble and snuck out of Gran Estard Castle. This makes his father very angry, and when Keifer is finally caught, he hides in his room. While hiding in the closet, a masked figure that calls herself \"The Master of the Illusions, Magarugi\" appears and tells Keifer that if he finds the Orbs of Loto, he will be given one wish. Keifer is pulled into the spirit's realm of Torland, the world of \"Dragon Quest II\". When he first arrives, he encounters a caravan with a weak leader, Luin. Luin is also searching for the Orbs to save his sick parents. After their first battle together, the Caravan asks Keifer to lead them. All together, they must travel the world in order to find the cure for Luin's sick parents and allow Keifer to return to Estard Island.\n\n\"Caravan Heart\" was a top-seller during the time of its release, with over 538,000 units sold within three months of its release and 593,000 units sold to date. The game was given a 35 out of 40 by \"Famitsu\" magazine, netting a Platinum Award from the publication.\n\n"}
{"id": "52268783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52268783", "title": "Female gaze", "text": "Female gaze\n\nThe female gaze is a feminist film theoretical term representing the gaze of the female viewer. It is a response to feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey's term, \"the male gaze\", which represents not only the gaze of the male viewer but also the gaze of the male character and the male creator of the film. In contemporary usage, the \"female gaze\" has been used to refer to the perspective a female filmmaker (screenwriter/director/producer) brings to a film that would be different from a male view of the subject. \n\nMulvey discusses aspects of voyeurism and fetishism in the Male Gaze in her article, \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\". She draws from Alfred Hitchcock's film, \"Rear Window\", applying terms from Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis to discuss camera angle, narrative choice, and props in the movie while focusing on the concept of the male gaze. From what Jeffries, the protagonist in \"Rear Window\", looks at through his camera to the camera angles in his discussion with his girlfriend, the Male Gaze is accentuated by each move in Mulvey's article. Mulvey's article focused on the concept of \"scopophilia\", or a pleasure in gazing and placed women as spectacles to be objectified and viewed, unable to return a gaze and dismissing women in film as adequate representations of human beings.\n\nThe female gaze looks at three viewpoints.\nThese three viewpoints also concern Mulvey's male gaze but focuses, instead, on females. Viewpoints expanded alongside diversity in film genres. Woman's films were a genre that focused on female leads, showing the female as a diegetic story-teller rather than that of a spectacle. Movies such as \"Rebecca\" and \"Stella Dallas\" are examples of such films in which the traditional narrative is told through the female protagonist. This genre of film has evolved into modern day \"chick flicks\" such as \"27 Dresses\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\". The films are meant to represent the desires of female protagonists and, therefore, are to represent the desires of the female movie-viewer.\n\nZoe Dirse looks at the female gaze through the documentary film genre, analyzing aspects of pleasure and viewer identification. She analyzes the gaze at the points of production and reception. She notes that if the cinematographer is female and the subject is also female, the object of the film takes on a different role. Dirse argues that by having a female cinematographer allows females to be viewed as they really are and not the voyeuristic spectacle that the male gaze makes them out to be. While filming in Cairo, Dirse was in a crowd and observed being noticed by the males around her. At first they seemed curious, and Dirse wondered if it was because of her gender or the fact that she had a camera. It was not long before they began to push past her, and she felt a sense of danger that she felt other females in Cairo shared. This is depicted in her film, \"Shadow Maker\". She said that her gender allowed her to be an unobtrusive observer – unlike a man – when filming gypsies singing.\n\nPaula Marantz Cohen discusses the female gaze in the chick flick genre, with specific attention to the attire women wear. Spectacle overrules plot in films such as \"The Awful Truth\". Irene Dunne's wardrobe is regarded as a central aspect of the film. The different dresses that Dunn wears are extravagant but not sexualized. While the clothing may be regarded as comical, they are also supportive to Dunn's independence and femininity. Cohen notes that in the film \"The Wedding Planner\", Jennifer Lopez is fully clothed throughout the entire film. The clothes, as in \"The Awful Truth\", are regarded as comical yet they catch the viewer's eye without sexualizing her. Cohen also analyzes the relationship between the female lead stars of these films and their male co-stars. She states that these films truly depict what women want, that they are accentualized in a positive manner and have a partner who amplifies this accentuation.\n\nCritics have focused attention on the presence of the female gaze in cinema and television, in works such as \"The Handmaid's Tale\", \"I Love Dick\" and \"Fleabag\".\n\nThe controversial lesbian drama film \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" received considerable critical comment for the dominance of the male gaze and lack of female gaze, with some reviewers calling it a \"patriarchal gaze\". The author of the book upon which the film was based was among the harshest critics, saying, \"It appears to me this was what was missing on the set: lesbians.\"\n\nFilmmaker April Mullen has said, \"Women have this vulnerability and connection to a depth of emotions that I can see and feel in certain moments of truth in the films we create. To me, the female gaze is transparency – the veil between audience and filmmaker is thin, and that allows people in more.\"\n\nAt the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, Jill Soloway, in her keynote address, explored the definition of the female gaze in film-making.\n\n"}

It's a travelogue of a Renaissance man who enjoys nature and considers it to be a refuge for man's spirit where it can achieve complete relaxation and invigoration. \"Ribanje\" is the first described tourist journey of a modern, Renaissance man in Croatian literature; it is a first piece of Croatian culture in which world is described by parameters of human's concrete, earthly needs. To sum it up, \"Ribanje\" is the first secular, mimetic, realistic travelogue of Croatian literature.\n\nIn the poem the narrator—the poet himself—describes his journey across Adriatic islands and recounts events that he and his co-travellers experienced along the path. The narrator, great aesthetist and sensitive to beauty, often describes the landscape the company sailed through, admiring the beauties of his homeland.\n\nThe descriptive accounts of \"Ribanje\" combine the narrative parts in which events of the journey are detailed, along with the fishermens' complaints, dialogues and conversations. The poet-narrator often cites the conversation of the fishermen, quoting the truth, as he sees it, of their wise sayings and intelligent conversations.\n\nHektorović meticulously recorded the songs sung by the fishermen along the way, making this one of the earliest examples in Croatian literature to include transcribed folk music within the text. There are two bugaršćicas and three short songs, toasts or honorific songs, sung alternatively by the fishermen. This makes \"Ribanje\" a work that makes an interesting and aesthetically valuable synthesis, a blending of artistic and folk literature.\n\nThe work has been translated from Croatian to English as \"Fishing and fishermen's conversation\" by Edward Dennis Goy in 1979. In 1999 Matica hrvatska published a facsimile reprint of the edition princeps of \"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje\", with parallel translation to modern standard Croatian, conducted by Marko Grčić. The only two extant copies of the first edition are held at the library of Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nCroatian film director Milan Trenc was awarded funds for the feature film adaptation of the work in the spring of 2017 by Croatian audiovisual center. The film is planned to go into production in 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "34764275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34764275", "title": "Humor styles", "text": "Humor styles\n\nHumor styles are a topic of research in the field of personality psychology related to the ways in which individuals differ in their use of humor in everyday life. People of all ages and backgrounds engage in humor, but the way they use it can vary greatly. Although humor styles can vary slightly depending on the situation, they tend to be a relatively stable personality characteristic among individuals. That is, individuals are fairly consistent in the ways they use humor over time.\n\nThe Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) has emerged as a robust model for understanding the individual differences in humor styles. Humor can be used to enhance the self or enhance one's relationship with others. Humor can be relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental (either to the self or others). The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating. Some styles of humor promote health and well-being, while other styles can be potentially detrimental to mental and physical health.\n\nThe Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) was developed by Rod Martin and Patricia Doris (2003) to measure individual differences in styles of humor. Humor has been shown to be a personality characteristic that remains relatively stable over time. Humor is sometimes viewed as a one-dimensional trait. However, individuals seem to differ in the ways in which they use humor in their everyday lives, and different styles of humor seem to have different outcomes. The Humor Styles Questionnaire was developed to identify the ways in which individuals differ in humor styles and how these differences influence health, well-being, relationships, and other outcomes.\n\nThe Humor Styles Questionnaire is a 32-item self-report inventory used to identify how individuals use humor in their lives. Participants respond to the degree to which they agree with each statement (e.g., \"I enjoy making people laugh\") on a scale from 1 (\"totally disagree\") to 7 (\"totally agree\"). The questionnaire measures two main factors in humor. The first factor measures whether humor is used to enhance the self or enhance one's relationships with others. The second factor measures whether the humor is relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental and destructive. The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating.\n\nAffiliative humor is defined as the style of humor used to enhance one's relationships with others in a benevolent, positive manner. This style of humor is typically used in a benevolent, self-accepting way. Individuals high in this dimension often use humor as a way to charm and amuse others, ease tension among others, and improve relationships. They are often spontaneous in their joke telling, frequently participate in witty banter, and enjoy laughing with others. Affiliative humor is similar to self-defeating humor because both styles of humor enhance the relationships with others. However, unlike self-defeating humor, affiliative humor is not used at one's own expense.\n\nA number of outcomes are associated with the use of affiliative humor. Individuals who report high levels of affiliative humor are more likely to initiate friendships. In an organizational setting, affiliative humor has been shown to increase group cohesiveness and promote creativity in the workplace. Affiliative humor is also associated with increased levels of (explicit) self-esteem, psychological well-being, emotional stability, and social intimacy. They are also more likely to exhibit higher levels of implicit self-esteem (independently of their level of explicit self-esteem).\n\nThis style of humor is associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety. Individuals who use affiliative humor tend to have higher levels of extraversion and openness to experience as personality characteristics.\n\nExamples of items targeting affiliative humor on the HSQ include:\n\nSelf-enhancing humor is a style of humor related to having a good-natured attitude toward life, having the ability to laugh at yourself, your circumstances and the idiosyncrasies of life in constructive, non-detrimental manner. It is used by individuals to enhance the self in a benevolent, positive manner. This type of humor is best understood as a type of coping or emotion-regulating humor in which individuals use humor to look on the bright side of a bad situation, find the silver lining or maintain a positive attitude even in trying times.\n\nSelf-enhancing humor is associated with a number of personality variables as well as psychological, physical and health-related outcomes. Individuals who engage more in the self-enhancing humor style are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. In an organizational setting, self-enhancing humor has been shown to promote creativity and reduce stress in the workplace. The self-enhancing style of humor has also been shown to be related to increased levels of self-esteem, optimism, and psychological well-being, as well as decreased levels of depression and anxiety. Individuals who use the self-enhancing humor style are more likely to exhibit extraversion and openness to experience as personality characteristics and less likely to exhibit neuroticism.\n\nExamples of self-enhancing humor on the HSQ include:\n\nAggressive humor is a style of humor that is potentially detrimental towards others. This type of humor is characterized by the use of sarcasm, put-downs, teasing, criticism, ridicule, and other types of humor used at the expense of others. Aggressive humor often disregards the impact it might have on others. Prejudices such as racism and sexism are considered to be the aggressive style of humor. This type of humor may at times seem like playful fun, but sometimes the underlying intent is to harm or belittle others. Aggressive humor is related to higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness.\n\nIndividuals who exhibit higher levels of aggressive humor tend to score higher on measures of hostility and general aggression. Males tend to use aggressive humor more often than women.\n\nExamples of aggressive humor on the HSQ might include:\n\nSelf-defeating humor is the style of humor characterized by the use of potentially detrimental humor towards the self in order to gain approval from others. Individuals high in this dimension engage in self-disparaging humor in which laughter is often at their own expense. Self-defeating humor often comes in the form of pleasing others by being the \"butt\" of the joke. This style of humor is sometimes seen as a form of denial in which humor is used as a defense mechanism for hiding negative feelings about the self.\n\nA variety of variables are associated with self-defeating humor. Individuals who more frequently use self-defeating humor show increased depressive symptoms. Individuals who use this style of humor tend to have higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness. Self-defeating humor is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety and psychiatric symptoms. It is also associated with lower levels of self-esteem, psychological well-being and intimacy.\n\nExamples of self-defeating items on the Humor Styles Questionnaire might include:\n"}

The total area of the zoo was , and the zoo had 6,591 visitors on its first day of operation.\n\nA guide for the zoo was first published in 1905, and by its 10th birthday the zoo was home to 274 individuals representing 156 species.\n\nIn 1923, the zoo opened the Elephant Room and was able to move its elephants from temporary to permanent quarters. In 1927, the Hippopotamus Room was opened.\n\n\nBy 1940, the population of the zoo numbered 965 individuals representing 209 species. During the Second World War, large carnivores were killed by military order, and other animals died from hunger, malnutrition, and cold. At the end of the war, only 274 individuals of 72 species remained at the zoo. The South part of the zoo was taken over by the occupation forces, which did not leave the zoo until 1952.\n\nThe Giraffe Room was opened in 1953, along with a saltwater aquarium (the aquarium was removed in 1968). In 1954, the Sea Lion Pond was completed, and the zoo held its first \"Summer School,\" attended by 180 students. \"Fairyland\" was opened in 1955, an amusement park that now includes a Ferris wheel, fun train, and dodgem cars in the shape of popular characters. The Ape Room was built in 1969, and the Reptile Room in 1974.\n\nThe Red Panda Room was completed in 1980, and the dome aviary (Water Bird Pavilion) was completed in 1983. This aviary is in diameter and high in the center. Other exhibits completed in the 1980s include the Bird Room (1985), the Senow Room (1988), and the Kyotaro Room (1989 - now housing orangutans). 1989 saw the start of the wildlife rescue operation, though the Wildlife Rescue Center was not completed until 1990. The Beast Room was completed in 1993.\n\n\nIn 2003, 100 years after its founding, the zoo was home to 721 individuals representing 175 species. The zoo completed the Monkey Room in 2004, and a new Ape Room, as well as a new East entrance, in 2009.\n\nIn 2005, facilities have redesigned.\n\nAnimals at the zoo include lions, tigers, jaguars, bears, hippos, giraffes, zebras, deer, llamas, gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, monkeys, Red pandas, tanuki, foxes, ostriches, cranes, swans, ducks, flamingos, eagles, hawks, peacocks, Humboldt penguins, and sea lions.\n\n\nThe Animal Data Room includes skeletons and other information about former residents of the zoo. It was started in 1982 with information about red pandas, and tiger information was added in 2010 (year of the tiger).\n\n\nA children's zoo opened in 1955, and lets visitors watch the animals from up close and even touch them. Animals in this area include rabbits, Guinea pig, miniature pigs, goats, tortoises, a donkey, cockatoos, chickens, ducks, a Ural owl, and rockhopper penguins.\n\nThe zoo includes a wildlife rescue center opened in 1989 and operated in cooperation with Kyoto Prefecture and Kyoto City. The center rehabilitates injured wildlife for release by the prefecture. The rescue center is not open to the public.\n\nIn 1932, a lion had to be shot dead after having escaped from the zoo.\nIn June 2008, a zookeeper was killed by a tiger while cleaning its cage.\n\nIn 2007, the animal welfare society \"Animal Concerns Research and Education Society\" conducted an investigation into the conditions of Polar bears at the 24 Japanese Zoos that keep them, and found all, including the Kyoto Zoo, to be in violation of Canadian standards for animal care. The publication of their findings listed Kyoto Municipal Zoo as one of the facilities in which they found concerns.\n"}

{"id": "2435296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2435296", "title": "Léolo", "text": "Léolo\n\nLéolo is a 1992 Canadian coming of age-fantasy film by director Jean-Claude Lauzon. The film tells the story of a young boy named Léo \"Léolo\" Lauzon, played by Maxime Collin, who engages in an active fantasy life while growing up with his Montreal family, and begins to have sexual fantasies about his neighbour Bianca, played by Giuditta del Vecchio. The film also stars Ginette Reno, Pierre Bourgault, Andrée Lachapelle, Denys Arcand, Julien Guiomar and Germain Houde. Gilbert Sicotte narrates the film as the adult Léolo.\n\nWith a story developed by Lauzon as a semi-autobiographical work, the project was supported by producer Lyse Lafontaine as a co-production with France. Filming took place in Montreal and Sicily in 1991. It was Lauzon's final film, as he died in a plane crash in 1997 while working on his next project.\n\nInitially released in the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, \"Léolo\" won three Genie Awards, including Best Original Screenplay for Lauzon, losing Best Motion Picture to \"Naked Lunch\". It later benefited from a resurgence of interest, leading to critics and filmmakers adding it to the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time in 2015.\n\nIn Mile End, Montreal, Léo Lauzon is a young boy living in a tenement with his dysfunctional family, serving as the unreliable narrator. He uses his active fantasy life and the book \"L'avalée des avalés\" by Québécois novelist Réjean Ducharme to escape the reality of his life. He feels his father is insane and denies being his son. After having a dream revealing his mother was impregnated after falling into a cart of tomatoes contaminated by an Italian man's semen, Léo identifies as Italian rather than French Canadian and adopts the name Léolo Lozone.\nGrowing up in an apartment with a rat in the bathtub, a turkey and a family obsessed with regular bowel movements, Léolo continues to write. His writings are discovered by the Word Tamer, a reincarnation of Don Quixote who searches through trash for letters and photographs. Léolo observes a neighbouring young woman named Bianca and imagines her singing to him from a closet, emitting a white light. His grandfather, who Léolo believes attempted to murder him by holding him under a pool, helps her financially and extorts her for sexual favours, revealing her breasts and putting his feet in her mouth. Léolo begins to fantasize about Bianca sexually and discovers masturbation. Meanwhile, his brother Fernand, after being beaten by a bully and failed in a special education class, builds up impressive muscles. The Word Tamer, continuously monitoring Léolo's thoughts, reads of the boy's hopes for how Fernand's muscles will make them invincible. However, upon being confronted by the bully for a second time, Fernand is overwhelmed with fear and is beaten again while Léolo watches in shock.\n\nFinally convinced his grandfather is responsible for all of the family's troubles, Léolo attempts to lower a noose and hang his grandfather while he is in the bath. His grandfather sees Léolo doing it and is choked, before finally being freed, with Léolo injured in the process. Léolo subsequently goes to the hospital, where he is told his actions could constitute attempted murder, though he is not charged. Reacting with horror to the ways other boys are pursuing sex, he seeks out the services of a prostitute named Regina. Upon later becoming ill, he ends up in the same institution where many other members of his family have been treated at.\n\n\"New York\" remarked on the classical allusions in the story:\n\nThe story is also related with a \"dreamlike environment\", with \"choral music\" that evokes \"the possibility of spiritual transcendence\". Part of the way the narrative shifts from natural to fantasy elements is through the Word Tamer character, who becomes \"an omniscient god-like observer\". Author Bill Marshall assessed the Word Tamer as one of the benign elders, as opposed to the bad ones, and hypothesized that the Word Tamer's abode, Federico Fellini's Cinecittà property, symbolizes the film's \"exaggerated, grotesque realism\".\nSome Canadian analysis of \"Léolo\" has related to possible political symbolism and Quebec's national identity. In 1992 at the Toronto International Film Festival, programming director Piers Handling called the film an \"epitaph for Quebec\", in which the title character rejects his Quebecois identity and joins another world by fantasy. Canadian historian George Melnyk remarked that Pierre Bourgault is a prominent Quebec separatist, but is not allowed to say much in the film, which also features the muscular Fernand intimidated by a smaller English Canadian, and non-Quebecois music, concluding the film represented a \"national identity crisis\". Among the cosmopolitan music uses is Tibetan-style chanting, and songs by The Rolling Stones and Tom Waits. Film scholar Jim Leach wrote that in real life, Lauzon would call himself a Canadian director, despite contemporary belief Quebec cinema was distinct. In the narration, the setting \"Mile End, Montreal, Canada\" does not mention Quebec, and Léolo's supposed Italian father refers to the tomatoes as destined for \"America\" rather than Quebec, though they are sold in Montreal. It is also thought the film is set in the late 1950s, in the \"old Quebec\" before the Quiet Revolution.\n\nHowever, Lauzon denied the film had any political meaning, saying he was not an intellectual, and his film \"does not have the flag draped all over it\". He also said he had an admiration for the Italian people. Leach questioned if the film is set before the Quiet Revolution, saying if Léolo was born in the 1950s, the 12-year-old character lived in 1965, and Ducharme's book seen in the film was published in 1967. Marshall noted the Ducharme novel would place the story in the 1960s, but argued \"otherwise the feel is 1950s\".\n\nDirector Jean-Claude Lauzon wrote the screenplay, starting it in Sicily while shooting his first film \"Night Zoo\". It served in part as an autobiography, with Lauzon stating he wrote it \"almost in a state of trance\" and was initially unsure how the storyline would develop or end. Before completing high school and going on to study film in university, Lauzon stated he had lived on \"the criminal fringes\" of Montreal streets, and his dark perspective is found in \"Léolo\". André Petrowski, a friend of Lauzon, also claimed the film depicted the \"gross pathology\" of the Lauzon family in a \"very, very personal way\".\n\nAlthough Lauzon had offers to shoot Hollywood action films after \"Night Zoo\" (1987), he instead presented the \"Léolo\" script to producer Lyse Lafontaine. Lafontaine stated the screenplay had been rejected by other producers and was difficult to read, but she found it \"magic\" and produced it with Aimée Danis. The film had a $5 million budget.\n\nSinger Ginette Reno was cast as the mother after initially rejecting the role, finding the subject matter was \"too violent and rough\". She was persuaded to star in the film, believing it might win her new fans, even if others were shocked by it. For the title role, Maxime Collin was cast at age 11.\n\nFor the part of the Word Tamer, who reads Léolo's writings, Lauzon cast his mentor, university professor Pierre Bourgault. Although in reality Bourgault is a strong proponent of the Quebec sovereignty movement, Lauzon denied he was cast for political reasons. A bodybuilder, Yves Montmarquette, portrayed Fernand for the scenes after the character builds up his muscles.\n\nLafontaine's son Mikaël had a small part as a swimmer. The film's French producers asked Lauzon to use actor Pierre Richard in the film, which he did not.\n\nThe film was shot over 58 days beginning in the fall of 1991, originally in Montreal. In one scene, Léolo is seen sitting in front of a house, which was where Jean-Claude Lauzon was born. Reno spent three months filming \"Léolo\" over the fall of 1991. A second stage of filming took place briefly in Sicily.\n\nLafontaine found shooting the film difficult because of Lauzon's emotional swings, although Reno found him affectionate. Lauzon asserted those who found him too temperamental to work with did not know him well, and he had a history of good relations with film departments. When Lafontaine traveled to Italy with Lauzon, he gave her a letter thanking her for her ineptitude in business, which he considered necessary to make a film with feeling. She kept it as a cherished keepsake.\n\nIn one scene, a boy commits an act of bestiality with a tied-down cat. Lauzon initially intended to use a puppet for the cat in a rehearsal, but the actor objected that it would be ridiculous, insisting on a real cat.\n\nThe film was entered into the Cannes Film Festival and screened on 17 May 1992, where it received a standing ovation. At Cannes, Lauzon supposedly told juror Jamie Lee Curtis he wanted to have sex with her, which \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Kenneth Turan believed compromised the film's prospects of winning the Palme d'Or. It was screened at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival and the New York Film Festival in September 1992, distributed by Fine Line Features. The film opened in Quebec in June, and in the U.S. in February 1993. It had a release in 70 countries in total.\n\nAfter Lauzon was killed in the northern Quebec plane crash in 1997, CBC Television, Télé-Québec and Showcase aired \"Night Zoo\" and \"Léolo\" in August, and Serge Losique announced an outdoor screening for \"Léolo\" at the Montreal World Film Festival in September. In 2014, \"Léolo\" was selected for a 2K digital restoration for a screening in the Cannes Classics selection of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The restoration was carried out by the Elephant project and Cinémathèque québécoise, and it was the first Canadian film screened for Cannes Classics.\n\nAfter opening at Place des Arts in Montreal on June 4, 1992, the film made $100,000 after its first week. The film had a total of 110,000 admissions in Quebec theatres. In its first weekend in two New York theatres, it made $31,009, which was considered a successful launch.\n\nAccording to \"Box Office Mojo\", the film finished its run grossing $611,703 domestically. It was one of the highest-grossing films worldwide for distributor Alliance Films. It did particularly well in Germany and Spain, while it did not perform well in the U.S.\n\nCanadian critic Brian D. Johnson, writing for \"Maclean's\", said the film \"elevates Canadian cinema to new heights of creative ambition and achievement\". Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, writing \"\"Léolo\" is an enchanting, disgusting, romantic, depressing, hilarious, tragic movie, and it is quite original- one of the year's best. I have never seen one like it before\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" called \"Léolo\" \"daring, bracingly original\" and initially \"whimsical\". Kenneth Turan of \"The Los Angeles Times\" praised it as \"extraordinary\". Peter Brunette of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"It's a bizarre, occasionally upsetting film, but its underlying portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man theme couldn't be more classic\". David Denby of \"New York\" magazine panned the film as \"the most maladroit film I've seen in ages\".\n\nIn 2005, \"Time\" magazine named \"Léolo\" one of Time's All-TIME 100 Movies. That year, Ebert added it to his Great Movies list, writing on \"the deep amusement and even love that Lauzon conveys in his material\". Ebert also said \"The technical brilliance of the film is astonishing\". In 2014, Peter Howell of \"The Toronto Star\", writing on \"Léolo\"'s screening in Cannes Classics, called the film \"masterful\", while Bruce Kirkland of \"The Toronto Sun\" called it \"brilliantly deranged\" and speculated Lauzon would have enjoyed seeing the film's revival. Also in 2014, Turan included \"Léolo\" in his book, \"Not to Be Missed: Fifty-Four Favorites From a Lifetime of Film\", citing it as an example of one of the films among the 54 with \"a more limited following\". The next year, the Toronto International Film Festival placed it fifth in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time, regarded as a \"noteworthy\" change in the overall Top 10, which had been compiled once per decade since 1984. The Cannes restoration likely led to the resurgence of interest in the film, resulting in the Top 10 addition.\n\nThe film was selected as the Canadian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 65th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. The film was selected for competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and its loss caused critics to accuse the jury of conservative choices.\n\nAt the 13th Genie Awards, \"Léolo\" received nine nominations and was perceived as being in an unusually tight competition with David Cronenberg's \"Naked Lunch\". \"Naked Lunch\" was considered to have triumphed over \"Leolo\" on awards night.\n\n\n"}

The husband-and-wife vaudeville team of Eva Puck and Sammy White (billed as Puck and White) starred in the Phonofilm \"Opera vs. Jazz\" (1923). Max Fleischer used the Phonofilm process in 1924 when he introduced his animated \"Song Car-Tunes\" series.\n\nThe nearly 2,000 Vitaphone short subjects produced by Warner Bros. and its sister studio First National from 1926 to 1930 included vaudevillians, opera singers, Broadway stars, dancers, bands and popular vocalists. One and two-reel short musical films were valuable to the movie studios as springboards for new talents. Performers who made their film debuts in short films include Joan Blondell, Humphrey Bogart, Burns and Allen, Sammy Davis, Jr., Judy Garland (as Baby Gumm), Cary Grant, Bob Hope, Bert Lahr and Ginger Rogers.\n\nRuth Etting sang \"My Mother's Eyes\" (by Abel Baer and L. Wolfe Gilbert) and \"That's Him Now\" (by Milton Ager and Jack Yellen) in the Paramount Movietone \"Ruth Etting in Favorite Melodies\" (1929), filmed in a single take at the Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. Astoria Studios was built by Paramount in the early days of sound films to provide the company with an audio-capable facility close to the Broadway theater district. Many features and short subjects were filmed there between 1928 and 1933, including the 16-minute \"St. Louis Blues\" (1929), the only film of Bessie Smith.\n\nOrchestra leader Phil Spitalny made a series of musical shorts beginning with \"Phil Spitalny\" (1929) at MGM, followed by shorts for both Vitaphone and Paramount, including \"Big City Fantasy\" (1929), \"Phil Spitalny and His Musical Queens\" (1934), \"Ladies That Play\" (1934), \"Phil Spitalny and His All Girl Orchestra\" (1935) and \"Sirens of Syncopation\" (1935).\n\nFor promotional purposes, major film stars, including Gary Cooper and Clark Gable, made guest appearances in such musical shorts as MGM's \"Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove\" (1934) and \"Starlit Days at the Lido\" (1935), while others featured a single band, such as \"Freddie Rich and His Orchestra\" (1938).\n\nRichard Barrios (author of \"A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film\") provided notes for Kino Video's compilation, \"The Best of Big Bands and Swing\":\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, Betty Hutton made a half-dozen musical shorts before her feature debut in \"The Fleet's In\" (1942) and then continued to make shorts for the war effort.

In the mid-1940s, Louis Jordan made short music films, some of which were spliced together into a feature-length musical Western, \"Look-Out Sister\" (1947).\n\nDuring the 1950s, musical shorts were revived for telecasting on local stations. Feature films in that decade were usually not edited to fit. Instead, if a feature ended 20 minutes before the hour, footage from musical shorts was used to fill the gap.\n\nSnader Telescriptions were musical shorts made for television from 1950 to 1954.

Introduced as a Private Member's Bill, it reduced the legislative burden on newspaper proprietors with regard to the offence of libel; as a \"quid pro quo\", the compulsory registration of proprietors (abolished by the Newspapers, Printers, and Reading Rooms Repeal Act 1869) was reintroduced.\n\nFollowing the removal of compulsory registration in 1869, newspaper owners had begun to look to anonymity as a protection against lawsuits arising out of the publication of libellous statements. At the same time, the judgment in \"Purcell v Sowler\" (1877) saw a newspaper proprietor successfully sued despite recognition that the libellous statements his newspaper had published were merely quoted verbatim from the testimony of a member of the public made at public meeting. Against this backdrop, two successive select committees were established to look at the law of libel; the first made no report, but the second took on the evidence of the first, and made several recommendations. In the words of John Hutchinson, MP for Halifax, \"the Bill embodied the recommendations of [the second] Committee, and was confined to them exclusively\". The bill itself took the form of a Private Member's Bill.\n\nIn terms of content, section 2 of the Act (as it became when it received royal assent on 27 August 1881) introduced a new defence for newspaper proprietors in cases where the libel stemmed from a fair, accurate and non-malicious report of a publicly held meeting. This extension of qualified privilege was then \"amplified\" by the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888, which in doing so repealed section 2 of the 1881 Act. Repealed at the same time was section 3 (\"No prosecution for newspaper libel without fiat of Attorney General\"). The Act also benefited newspaper owners insofar as it instituted provisions (section 4, 5 and 6) for the quicker (and hence cheaper) resolution of newspaper libel cases. Contrary to expectations, however, the passage of the Act correlated with an increase, rather than decrease, in the number of defamatory libel (criminal) actions being brought against newspapers. Whether the two were causally linked is not known, however.\n\nIn return, proprietors were happy to accept the reintroduction of compulsory registration that had been removed in 1869 (now provided for by sections 7 to 15 of the 1881 Act inclusive). These registration clauses, which included an exemption for proprietors who are already registered companies, were not repealed until 2015 and were still enforced. For the purposes of the Act, a newspaper is defined as \"any paper containing public news, intelligence, or occurrences, or any remarks or observations therein printed for sale, and published ... periodically, or in parts or numbers at intervals not exceeding 26 days\". As of 2009, 56 newspapers and their proprietors were centrally registered as a result of these provisions. Under section 19 of the Act, it never applied to Scotland.\n\nThe provisions on registration in sections 7 to 18 were repealed by the Deregulation Act 2015 as being no longer of practical use. As a result, only section 4 remains in force, and that only in relation to Northern Ireland and courts hearing charges there of blasphemous libel.\n\n"}

In the television industry, one-shots sometimes serve as a pilot to field interest in a new series.\n\nIn the Japanese manga industry, the concept of one-shot is expressed by the term , which implies that the comic is presented in its entirety without any continuation. One-shot manga are often written for contests, and sometimes later developed into a full-length manga series (much like a television pilot). Many popular manga series began as one-shot stories, including \"Dragon Ball\", \"Fist of the North Star\", \"Naruto\", \"Bleach\", \"One Piece\", \"Berserk\", \"Kinnikuman\" and \"Death Note\", among others. Some noted manga authors, such as Akira Toriyama and Rumiko Takahashi, have worked on numerous one-shot stories in addition to their serialized works. \"Rising Stars of Manga\" was an annual competition for original English-language one-shot manga, many of which have gone on to become full-length manga series.\n\nIn the United States, one-shots are usually labeled with a \"#1\" despite there being no following issues, and are sometimes subtitled as \"specials\". On occasion, a character or concept will appear in a series of one-shots, in cases where the subject matter is not financially lucrative enough to merit an ongoing or limited series, but still popular enough to be published on a regular basis, often annually or quarterly. A current example of a series of one-shots would be Marvel Comics' \"\" publications. This type of one-shot is not to be confused with a comic book annual, which is typically a companion publication to an established ongoing series.\n\nThe term has also been borrowed into the Franco-Belgian comics industry, with basically the same meaning, although there, it mostly refers to albums.\n\n"}

The film has received favorable reviews, particularly for the performance of lead actress Xu Lu and the depiction of minority group's struggles of Chinese orchestra and Otaku.\n\nIn a fictitious music school, the students of Chinese orchestra and Classical orchestra don't get along with each other. They call each other \"\"tacky\" and \"pretentious\". Chen Jing, a quirky but talented yangqin student, initially doesn't care about the rivalry, until she falls for the piano prodigy Wang Wen. Annoyed at his ignorance and prejudice toward Chinese instruments, she is determined to prove herself to him by forming her own ensemble, which consists of her best friend who secretly loves her Li You and four \"Otaku\" girls whom initially only agreed to join because of Chen Jing's promise to buy them expensive action figures. They named their concert band \"2.5 Dimension\"\", meaning a blend between 2D and 3D worlds, as the Otaku people refer to themselves as living in the second dimension. They perform at an Animation, Comics, and Games convention, and after initial rejection the crowd cheers for them.\n\nThey perform for Wang Wen but he publicly rejects Chen Jing and traditional Chinese music. Crushed, Chen Jing chooses to disband 2.5 Dimension. The four Otaku students, who have grown to love the band, are angry and refuse Chen Jing's gift of expensive action figures. Chen Jing's mother tells her about how the yangqin is a part of her and that she can't give up playing it without its permission. The head of the school announces plans to cancel the Chinese Orchestra but the original members of 2.5 Dimension are joined by other students to protest. After the head of the school continues to refuse them, they organize a music competition with the Classical Orchestra. An inspector comes to the school and both orchestras play their music. The inspector concludes that they played perfectly together, the groups realize that both have value.\n\n\n\"Our Shining Days\" garnered generally-positive response, with a rating of 7.4/10 on the Chinese main review site Douban, leading the film to be nominated for \"Best Chinese Film\" at the site's annual list and 6.9/10 on the Internet Movie Database.\n\n"}

He is best known as the former owner of several prominent New York nightclubs, including Club USA, The Limelight, Palladium, and Tunnel.\nGatien was born in Cornwall, Ontario, the third of five brothers. His first business venture was a jeans store in his home town, which he opened with a $13,000 settlement after he lost an eye in a hockey accident. After that, he turned a former country western bar into a rock club called Aardvark and booked the band Rush to perform. In 1976, he read about a bankrupt nightclub in Florida known as Rumbottoms; the space became the first incarnation of The Limelight. Limelight Atlanta followed. The longest period of time in which The Limelight remained closed was from 1996 to 1998. It reopened from 1998 until Gatien sold it in 2001, to a real estate developer.\n\nGatien produced the film \"A Bronx Tale\" (1993), starring Robert De Niro, after having produced it as a one-man play starring Chazz Palminteri.\n\nA 1996 federal investigation attempted but failed to link Gatien to the sales of party drugs, especially ecstasy, in his clubs, but his acquittal in 1998 left him with huge legal fees. In addition, he was later arrested on tax evasion charges after a series of club raids; he was acquitted of most of the charges. He pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 1999, for which he was sentenced to a fine of $1.6 million and a 60-day prison sentence, along with 5 years' probation. In 2003, he was deported to his native Canada, under the Department of Homeland Security immigration laws which order the removal of any alien (non-citizen) convicted of a felony. However, because he is part Native Canadian, Gatien has since been able to visit the United States again.\n\nGatien relocated to Toronto, where he opened a entertainment venue, Circa. By 2009, he was no longer involved with Circa and has been out of the nightclub business since that time. Circa was forced into bankruptcy and closed its doors in March 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56916541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56916541", "title": "Piposh", "text": "Piposh\n\nPiposh () is an Israeli media franchise that commenced with a series of comedic point-and-click adventure video games developed by Guillotine and published by Hed Arzi Multimedia for Windows. Based around the eponymous actor-turned-detective who embarks on several adventures solving murders, the titles include \"Piposh\", \"Piposh 2\", \"Halom SheItgashem\" (spinoff), and \"Piposh 3D: HaMahapecha\". An English version of \"Piposh\" entitled \"Piposh: Hollywood\" was released in either 2002 or 2004. The series, which began in 1999, was created at a time when the Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak, particularly in terms of adventure gaming, and served as an notable example of a work targeted specifically at the young local market, with aspects such as inside jokes relating to Israeli culture. The games became very popular, although never becoming financially successful, and its developers struggled to live off the proceeds.\n\n\"Piposh\" evolved into a franchise, with a television series, a comic book, and an album being created. The series continues to have a dedicated fanbase, and conventions known as 'Piposh Congresses' have been regularly held as a way for fans to celebrate the games together. While the titles have often been criticised for their amateurish visual style and clunky game mechanics, they are looked at fondly by critics who see \"Piposh\" as a source of Israeli pride and a key milestone in the advancement of the local industry throughout the 21st century.\n\nThe series consists of point and click adventures, requiring players to interact with an inventory and with characters in order to complete puzzles and advance the story. The main character is intended to be a caricature of the arrogant Israeli, with a worldview that \"the whole world is an idiot – and that talk can not be done quietly, only with shouting\".\n\nThe plot of \"Piposh\" follows the quirky adventures of its main character, flawed actor Hezi Piposh, as he boards the wrong boat and encounters various hijinks including being caught up in a murder. He can interrogate characters, break into their rooms, and accuse them of murder. In \"Piposh 2,\" Piposh finds himself trapped on an island populated by dwarves, who help him assemble an aviation device to escape. \"Halom SheItgashem\" sees eight strange acquaintances be invited to the castle of an eccentric man. \"Piposh 3D\" revolves around a political revolution that ensues because the entire country decides to become vegetarian, replacing meat with tofu.\n\nAfter Renen Glutzman left the Israeli army and while his brother Roy was still a member, they set up a small graphics business in Pardes Hanna (פרדס חנה), where they did routine projects for commission. In 1997, one of their projects reached the desk of the CEO of video game distributor Hed Artzi Multimedia (הד ארצי מולטימדיה), the multimedia arm of Israeli record label Hed Arzi Music, who liked the illustration style of the duo and suggested they create a Hebrew-language computer game. He gave them NIS 10,000 in return for 50% of the future profits from the sales.\n\nDespite having no experience in the video gaming industry, the team went to work and after nine months of development, released \"In the Interest of Ratings (בתככי הרייטינג)\", a title which focused on the incompetent detective Elimelech Egoz (voiced by Moshe Ferster), who goes on holiday at the fictional Nofei Hadera Hotel only to be greeted by a bizarre murder case. The game contained intertextuality, inside jokes, irony, and cynicism. \"In the Interest of Ratings\" received negative reviews in the press, including in \"Internet Captain (קפטן האינטרנט\"), the technology/multimedia branch of the leading Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\"; however it received positive reviews in youth-oriented newspapers. Ultimately the game was relatively popular, though it was not financially successful. But it led the duo to decide to try to develop a second video game, which would become \"Piposh\", under their new development company Guillotine (גיליוטין).\n\nThe Gluzman brothers wrote the text and the code, drew the backgrounds and characters, and created the animations; in addition they convinced actors Shai Avivi, Amos Shuv, Anat Magen, Ilan Peled, Dudu Zar, Meni Pe'er, and Ilan Ganani (as Piposh) to voice characters voluntarily. The game was developed by four people in their garage, at a time when the computer gaming industry in Israel was considered non-existent. Glutzman recalls that Guillotine was not particularly well managed, lacked business planning and didn't have a financial focus, and instead consisted of a naive team who wanted to simply make something \"fun and cool\". \"Ynet\" asserts the duo was irrational for choosing set up a development company for Israeli games that only appealed to the local market. Ronen would later describe the contemporary Israeli video gaming industry as an imaginary thing to pursue, for four young developers working from their garage. During development, Renen used the program \"Macromedia Director 4\", and he created each game screens from scratch. At the time of the game's release, Renen published his phone number to allow stuck players to phone in for help.\n\nAfter a year and a half of development, \"Piposh\" was released; it became a hit among teenagers and sold either 6000 copies or over 7000 copies over a period of one year in retail sales. They achieved this without reducing the original selling price. \"Haaretz\" asserts that many thousands more probably illegally pirated it. The game reached 5th place on the sales charts, and for a few weeks was competitive with the best-selling games from abroad. Some of Piposh’s royalties were donated to the animal rights and welfare organizations. The game originally had text and voicework in Hebrew, though a few years later it was made available in both English and Russian, and due to its success Guillotine was able to distribute the games to the United States and Russia. Due to the title's low minimum requirements, it was able to be played on computers with weaker processing power. The game was deemed an adventure gaming success aimed primarily at the local market, having been developed independently, almost underground. While not officially a Piposh title, \"In the Interest of Ratings\" has a link to the series; within \"Piposh\", the main character – a flawed actor – claims to have played Egoz in the previous game.\n\nRoy left the series during production of the second game, believing that in addition to piracy, the distribution networks weren't as efficient at bringing video games to stores as other products like Israeli music. According to Renen, his brother did not have prowess in the business and marketing side to succeed in the industry. After leaving, Roy moved away from sensationalist nature of the entertainment and gaming industry, and instead focused in personal creative projects. On his own Renen began to suffer financially, which would continue for years while making the Piposh games. By 2003 he was living on 30 shekels a day. He would later explain that at the time, to be a video game developer in Israel, one was expected not to make money. While the first game took 1.5 years to make, the team spent a year making Piposh 2, and a year making \"Halom SheItgashem\". Each time the developers made a game, they did it independently and without external funding. Once a title neared completion, Guillotine spoke to their distribution company to print discs and send them to stores. However, as the distribution company was very large they didn't have time to invest into a small local game like \"Piposh\" so the games ended up being sent out two weeks later than intended, once the advertising and buzz had died down. For each title, Renan produced advertising materials such as posters, business cards and funny stickers.\n\n\"Piposh 3D\" was the series' first foray into 3D graphics, after using traditional animation for the previous games; this title was directed by Roy Lazarowitz. By this point the developers had grown tired of their distributor and sought to use Indogram, which represented fewer games and could therefore invest more time into each. It was developed using the A5 engine, which Guillotine had purchase specifically for this title. 2004 saw the English release of \"Piposh\" entitled \"Piposh Holywood\", which was to be published by The Phantom after Phantom Entertainment bought the distribution rights electronically. \"Ynet\" noted that if successful, it would have been a notable achievement for the industry, seeing the first Israeli video game released on console, but noting the unclear outcome of this venture. Guillotine had aimed to translate their first Piposh game to break it into the international market, however the text and dubbing translations became an astronomical task due to the original game having a badly-constructed programming interface. The foreign adaption of the first game is known worldwide by its English title. The games were not intended to meet the technological standards of the global industry, particularly in terms of graphics. They were not targeted to a worldwide audience, instead appealing to Israeli teenagers who were not necessarily gamers, but who wanted immature content with cultural references they would understand. \"Haaretz\" contends that despite the development team tapping into the minds of local youth, the rampant pirate copying phenomenon prevented them from making a living of their games.\n\n\"Piposh\" saw numerous opportunities for franchise expansion over its history. The team gave up a NIS 20,000 offer by Burger Ranch to distribute the games because they were vegetarians. Soon after the release of Piposh, the duo started creating a weekly comic section in the local youth newspapers Rosh 1 and Maariv LeYanar, and also created a comic book which was published by Hed Artzi, released under the title \"Piposh and Other Vegetables\" (פיפוש ושאר ירקות), which could be purchased from the official Guillotine site. They also lectured to youth at an animation and comics festival at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. In 2000, the developers thought of porting Piposh to mobile phones, having already set up documents such as an instillation guide; however this never came to fruition. A spin-off television series named Batheshet Moav (בטשת מואב) – ten episodes in length and about five minutes per episode – first aired on the Beep channel in either 2001 or February 5, 2002. A previous concept for the show – where viewers could interact by choosing which of two outcomes they wanted to watch – was offered to Fox Kids. While Fox wanted to sign a contract, Guillotine refused as they did not want to give up the rights and the artistic freedom, for instance they would be censored from using the swear word קיבינימט and from mentioning that Piposh's father drowned in the Yarkon River. An album featuring music, interviews, and other content entitled \"At the Piposh Tavern\" was released by Guillotine and the Tag Group in 2004. A fourth game (excluding the spinoff) was to be released but this was eventually cancelled. Running until at least 2004, 'Piposh Congresses' have been held as national meeting for all the fans of Piposh and Guillotine. The developers sold an \"I'm Pipposi Proud\" game package, which included 5 game discs including the first three titles, plus a demo of Piposh 3D and a disc with rare files and documents.\n\nThe last title developed by Guillotine was the network-strategy nonsense game Vajimon, which saw players fight against each other over the internet using a variety of vegetables. Around 2003-4, the company's operations were terminated and its managers retired. Ronen left the industry soon after due to the financial and mental burden the series had given him, and became a yacht skipper. He earned money as a writer of games for interactive TV and cell phone in a leading high tech company. In 2005, the brothers lectured for a Gameology course at Beit Berl College as part of the first Israeli curriculum course for video game development. The program was started by Dr. Diana Silverman Keller who discovered while writing her thesis that there was no formal education in the field of game creation in the country. She noted that \"Despite the success of Israeli high-tech, the Israelis do not excel at developing games\". Keller contacted Renen, who at the time was known as the \"spiritual father of the Israeli gaming community\", and he soon became a central figure in the program.\n\nOn May 7, 2008, on Israel's 60th Independence Day, all Guillotine games were re-released for free download from the Internet. Renen Gluzman noted that the games were unplayable unless the gamer had a Windows 95 computer, and commented \"I felt that I had to do this, in order to save the game from falling into the abyss\". By this time, it was impossible to get the games anymore, and there were no orderly backups. He noted it was strange to revisit these games after having not touched them since the series ended in 2003. Tal Dinovich, a fan of the series who had volunteered for years on the site and answered phone called from stuck players, helped locate all the game files and create updated versions that would work on Windows XP. While Renen has since moved on from the series, he did create a Facebook group for the fans who had grown up with the series and wanted to reminisce. According to Calcalist, the series released 7 games, 4 of which are available for free download. As part of the campaign, Ronen aimed to print special nostalgic shirts, as this was a common fan request.\n\nIn December 2008, a group of Piposh fans, believing that it had died prematurely, started a campaign to create a new chapter of the series and started looking for volunteers. The game, to be developed through their company Sellotape (סלוטייפ) was entitled \"Piposh 2.5 and the Stolen Vase\". The official website of the project wrote that while the developers were unable to reach the quality level of the official games, they hoped to emulate it as much as possible. Their aim was to \"remember, save, and enjoy\" the Piposh series. The plot, taking place immediately after Piposh 2, sawthe protagonist try to find the magic 'vase of life' that can be used by his to resurrect characters to died in the prequel. The producer/director was Ben Werchizer, the artist/designer was Daniel Avdo, the music and dubbing producer was Itay Jeroffi, and the writer was Shahar Kraus; they were looking for professional programmers in Director or Flash as well as voice talent. Their site contained a \"build your own character\" minigame from the series as a flash game, and a forum dedicated to the resurrection of Piposh. The project was discontinued around 2010.\n\nVideo game archivist and founder of the \"Movement for Preservation of Games in Israel\" Raphael Ben-Ari got in touch with the series' creators and detailed the story behind its development process and in a documentary film. The documentary was uploaded to YouTube on Ben-Ari's \"Oldschool\" account. Ben-Ari believes the work boosted the Piposh community in Israel and introduced the series to many new people.\n\nThe Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak in the 1990s, with several companies creating games, developing engines, and trying to become successful both at home and abroad. One example is (מחשבת), which began as an importer and translator of games to the Israeli market. In the mid-1990s, the company would create children's video games based on popular legends and fairytales.called 'CD Pedoph' (סי.די פדוף\"). Created during the golden age of the point and click adventure games, two of Machshevet's popular titles are: \"\" (שליט המימדים: מסע ההרפתקאות המופלא) (1996) and \"Armed & Delirious\" (1997). Compedia (קומפדיה), while primarily a technologies, platforms and systems developer, also created educational computer games which were distributed to over 40 countries, including the \"Advanced Thinking Skills\" series (1992–93), the \"Timmy\" series (1994–95), the \"Gordy\" series (סדרת גורדי), the \"Itamar\" series (סדרת איתמר), \"Gordy in the Movie Adventure\" (גורדי בהרפתקה מהסרטים), \"In Search of the Lost Words\" (בעקבות המילים האבודות 1996/1998), and \"Julia: Back to the Sweet 60's\" (2001). Other notable Israeli video games of the time include: \"Xonix\" (1984), \"Intifada\" (אינתיפאדה 1989), and (סוחר הים 1989), \"Bonus\" (בונוס), \"Avish\" (אביש 1993), \"Duvalle\" (דובל'ה 1993-1997), (1998), and \"You Think You're Smart\" (אתה חושב שאתה חכם 1998-2001). Throughout the 1990s, Israeli developers also created various \"silly little games...to promote children's food products\" such as Vered Hagalil and Bamba.\n\nFactor believed that while the 80s and 90s saw the serious development of games within Israel, with the country being at the peak of its video gaming industry, it was still defined by a level of inferiority on the world stage, which had only started to improve in the early 2010s with social and casual gaming apps. Makorrishon wrote that Piposh was created at a time when it was generally accepted that to make good games one had to work abroad in a large company. Video game developer Adiel Gur thinks that Guillotine's did not have many contemporaries because of a lack of interest from high-tech companies to make games, a belief from producers that the sector is unprofitable, a lack of resources and tools for developers to make professional games, and the difficulty in amassing a team of workers from different fields (graphic artists, programmers, scriptwriters etc.). Ynet wrote that considering the number of Israelis studying computer science and the reputation of the country as a hub for high-tech entrepreneurs, it was surprising \"how much an Israeli gaming industry does not exist\", describing it as a \"local vacuum\". Roy explained that in his opinion: \"People who have the ability to develop computer games prefer to develop navigation applications and worm software that will sabotage the reactor in Iran\". In one case, the developers of Ballerium (2001) had to first present a comprehensive business plan in order to lure potential investors.\n\nIn 2001, Ynet wrote that it was difficult to name Israeli games that were not children's edutainment, and though able to recall some popular titles, with exception to \"Jane's IAF: Israeli Air Force\" called them \"negligible in terms of scope and technicality\" and non-competitive in the global market. In 2008, the site asserted that until recently, apart from children's edutainment developer and the Piposh series, there was no video gaming industry in Israel, though expressed hope that the action game \"Rising Eagle\" would change that. Meanwhile, in 2008 Eser wrote: \"It's not that I think there is no future for the Israeli computer games industry, and that there is no need to nurture it\".\n\nThe games became a cult hit in Israel, known for their unique humor, original characters and a satirical look at Israeli society. Ronen is notable for being one of a few Israelis who have managed to develop a computer game within the country and distribute it in Israel. According to \"Timeout\", the games are hilarious and brave. \"Eser\" felt that Piposh was a \"semi-decent adventure game\". Bikorate felt the title had a \"fascinating plot and humor ahead of its time\". The student newsletter Factor thought the game was \"more funny, more ingenious, and generally more universal\" than \"In the Interest of Ratings\" had been a year earlier, and felt the two games were \"exemplary examples of Israeli creativity\". In 2001, \"Ynet\" asserted that the few games of Israeli origin such as Piposh were \"quite negligible in terms of scope and technicality\", and were \"not close to being competitive in the global market\", however in 2003 the site saw the series as a source of Israeli pride. The site would later come to feel that the series offered some of the most \"bizarre, funny and hallucinatory quests\" to come out of gaming, noting that the first title is widely regarded as a cult game, and that many peculiar moments from the series are etched into the minds of players. Bikorate thought Piposh 2 surprised with its \"witty and satirical jokes about Israeli society\".\n\nThe Hebrew site \"Eser,\" despite having sympathy for Israeli game developers, who are \"forced to work in almost impossible conditions\" when compared to their American and European colleagues, gave Piposh 3D a scathing review; while calling its premise amusing, and noting that the patient \"Piposh\" fanbase would overlook its inferior graphics the site felt the game was very bad, likening it to a \"singer singing without makeup\". \"Ynet\" criticised 3D's graphics and interface, though noted its humour and charm might make up for the experience. Ben-Ari feels a sense of patriotism toward the game as a piece of video gaming software that is proudly and unabashedly Israeli. \"Sport5\" listed the game in their article \"There is honor: the greatest Israeli computer games ever\", rating it 10/10 and praising its unique crazy and sharp sense of creativity and humour, as well as for sparking one of the \"most cohesive computer game communities ever in the country\". \"Haaretz\" deemed it ultimately a failed initiative to establish the Israeli video gaming industry, despite its significance. Factor thought the series attempt to enter the 3D market was an \"utter failure\". Even though Walla thought Piposh 3D was a bad game, it thought the game looked like a masterpiece in comparison with \"Dangerous Vaults\", a Lara Croft parody that forces players to have sex with animals. Vgames deemed the series \"the most daring attempt to create computer games for Israeli audiences only\". When news of a fan-made Piposh 2.5 was brought to Nana 10, the site made an emotional appeal to its readers, hoping to attract anyone who could \"help this promising project take shape\", while hoping it would be the first of many. Meanwhile, 2all.co.il wished the developers success.\n\nNoting a recent campaign to name a road in Israel \"Lara Croft street\", Nana 10 hoped that soon there would be a \"Piposh street\" to honour the series. The paper believed Piposh to the possibly the most successful and profitable Israeli computer gaming project, deeming Guillotine a champion of the local industry. Makorrishon deemed Guillotine a \"stubborn pioneer\" due to persisting with making a game in Israel, though noted that despite their bravery, the company did close down a mere 6 years later. Looking back at the games in 2008, Ronen was impressed at how the humour held up, and noted ultimately that Piposh is \"not a game of technology, but of people, behavior and relationships\".\n\n"}
{"id": "25663206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25663206", "title": "Psychoacoustics", "text": "Psychoacoustics\n\nPsychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception and audiology – how humans perceive various sounds. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including noise, speech and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of psychophysics. Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology—i.e., recognition science—which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. It is an interdisciplinary field of many areas, including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.\n\nHearing is not a purely mechanical phenomenon of wave propagation, but is also a sensory and perceptual event; in other words, when a person hears something, that something arrives at the ear as a mechanical sound wave traveling through the air, but within the ear it is transformed into neural action potentials. The outer hair cells (OHC) of a mammalian cochlea give rise to an enhanced sensitivity and better frequency resolution of the mechanical response of the cochlear partition. These nerve pulses then travel to the brain where they are perceived. Hence, in many problems in acoustics, such as for audio processing, it is advantageous to take into account not just the mechanics of the environment, but also the fact that both the ear and the brain are involved in a person’s listening experience.\n\nThe inner ear, for example, does significant signal processing in converting sound waveforms into neural stimuli, so certain differences between waveforms may be imperceptible. Data compression techniques, such as MP3, make use of this fact. In addition, the ear has a nonlinear response to sounds of different intensity levels; this nonlinear response is called loudness. Telephone networks and audio noise reduction systems make use of this fact by nonlinearly compressing data samples before transmission, and then expanding them for playback. Another effect of the ear's nonlinear response is that sounds that are close in frequency produce phantom beat notes, or intermodulation distortion products.\n\nThe term \"psychoacoustics\" also arises in discussions about cognitive psychology and the effects that personal expectations, prejudices, and predispositions may have on listeners' relative evaluations and comparisons of sonic aesthetics and acuity and on listeners' varying determinations about the relative qualities of various musical instruments and performers. The expression that one \"hears what one wants (or expects) to hear\" may pertain in such discussions.\n\nThe human ear can nominally hear sounds in the range to The upper limit tends to decrease with age; most adults are unable to hear above 16 kHz. The lowest frequency that has been identified as a musical tone is 12 Hz under ideal laboratory conditions. Tones between 4 and 16 Hz can be perceived via the body's sense of touch.\n\nFrequency resolution of the ear is 3.6 Hz within the octave of That is, changes in pitch larger than 3.6 Hz can be perceived in a clinical setting. However, even smaller pitch differences can be perceived through other means. For example, the interference of two pitches can often be heard as a repetitive variation in volume of the tone. This amplitude modulation occurs with a frequency equal to the difference in frequencies of the two tones and is known as beating.\n\nThe semitone scale used in Western musical notation is not a linear frequency scale but logarithmic. Other scales have been derived directly from experiments on human hearing perception, such as the mel scale and Bark scale (these are used in studying perception, but not usually in musical composition), and these are approximately logarithmic in frequency at the high-frequency end, but nearly linear at the low-frequency end.\n\nThe intensity range of audible sounds is enormous. Human ear drums are sensitive to variations in the sound pressure, and can detect pressure changes from as small as a few micropascals (µPa) to greater than For this reason, sound pressure level is also measured logarithmically, with all pressures referenced to (or 1.97385×10 atm). The lower limit of audibility is therefore defined as but the upper limit is not as clearly defined. The upper limit is more a question of the limit where the ear will be physically harmed or with the potential to cause noise-induced hearing loss.\n\nA more rigorous exploration of the lower limits of audibility determines that the minimum threshold at which a sound can be heard is frequency dependent. By measuring this minimum intensity for testing tones of various frequencies, a frequency dependent absolute threshold of hearing (ATH) curve may be derived. Typically, the ear shows a peak of sensitivity (i.e., its lowest ATH) between though the threshold changes with age, with older ears showing decreased sensitivity above 2 kHz.\n\nThe ATH is the lowest of the equal-loudness contours. Equal-loudness contours indicate the sound pressure level (dB SPL), over the range of audible frequencies, that are perceived as being of equal loudness. Equal-loudness contours were first measured by Fletcher and Munson at Bell Labs in 1933 using pure tones reproduced via headphones, and the data they collected are called Fletcher–Munson curves. Because subjective loudness was difficult to measure, the Fletcher–Munson curves were averaged over many subjects.\n\nRobinson and Dadson refined the process in 1956 to obtain a new set of equal-loudness curves for a frontal sound source measured in an anechoic chamber. The Robinson-Dadson curves were standardized as ISO 226 in 1986. In 2003, was revised as equal-loudness contour using data collected from 12 international studies.\n\nSound localization is the process of determining the location of a sound source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in loudness, tone and timing between the two ears to allow us to localize sound sources. Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the azimuth or horizontal angle, the zenith or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds). Humans, as most four-legged animals, are adept at detecting direction in the horizontal, but less so in the vertical due to the ears being placed symmetrically. Some species of owls have their ears placed asymmetrically, and can detect sound in all three planes, an adaption to hunt small mammals in the dark.\n\nSuppose a listener cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound is being played (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker does not need to have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.\n\nWhen presented with a harmonic series of frequencies in the relationship 2\"f\", 3\"f\", 4\"f\", 5\"f\", etc. (where \"f\" is a specific frequency), humans tend to perceive that the pitch is \"f\".\n\nThe psychoacoustic model provides for high quality lossy signal compression by describing which parts of a given digital audio signal can be removed (or aggressively compressed) safely—that is, without significant losses in the (consciously) perceived quality of the sound.\n\nIt can explain how a sharp clap of the hands might seem painfully loud in a quiet library, but is hardly noticeable after a car backfires on a busy, urban street. This provides great benefit to the overall compression ratio, and psychoacoustic analysis routinely leads to compressed music files that are 1/10th to 1/12th the size of high quality masters, but with discernibly less proportional quality loss. Such compression is a feature of nearly all modern lossy audio compression formats. Some of these formats include Dolby Digital (AC-3), MP3, Opus, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, WMA, MPEG-1 Layer II (used for digital audio broadcasting in several countries) and ATRAC, the compression used in MiniDisc and some Walkman models.\n\nPsychoacoustics is based heavily on human anatomy, especially the ear's limitations in perceiving sound as outlined previously. To summarize, these limitations are:\n\n\nGiven that the ear will not be at peak perceptive capacity when dealing with these limitations, a compression algorithm can assign a lower priority to sounds outside the range of human hearing. By carefully shifting bits away from the unimportant components and toward the important ones, the algorithm ensures that the sounds a listener is most likely to perceive are of the highest quality.\n\nPsychoacoustics includes topics and studies that are relevant to music psychology and music therapy. Theorists such as Benjamin Boretz consider some of the results of psychoacoustics to be meaningful only in a musical context.\n\nIrv Teibel's \"Environments series\" LPs (1969–79) are an early example of commercially available sounds released expressly for enhancing psychological abilities.\n\nPsychoacoustics has long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with computer science, computer engineering, and computer networking. Internet pioneers J. C. R. Licklider and Bob Taylor both completed graduate-level work in psychoacoustics, while BBN Technologies originally specialized in consulting on acoustics issues before it began building the first packet-switched computer networks.\n\nLicklider wrote a paper entitled \"A duplex theory of pitch perception\".\n\nPsychoacoustics is applied within many fields from software development, where developers map proven and experimental mathematical patterns; in digital signal processing, where many audio compression codecs such as MP3 and Opus use a psychoacoustic model to increase compression ratios; in the design of (high end) audio systems for accurate reproduction of music in theatres and homes; as well as defense systems where scientists have experimented with limited success in creating new acoustic weapons, which emit frequencies that may impair, harm, or kill. It is also applied today within music, where musicians and artists continue to create new auditory experiences by masking unwanted frequencies of instruments, causing other frequencies to be enhanced. Yet another application is in the design of small or lower-quality loudspeakers, which can use the phenomenon of missing fundamentals to give the effect of bass notes at lower frequencies than the loudspeakers are physically able to produce (see references).\n\n\n"}

The term has been applied in several social settings.\n\nIn a business environment, a \"queen bee\" may refer to a woman in upper management who advanced in the ranks without any help of any type of affirmative action programs. Many of those executive women tend to be politically conservative and they choose not to publicly identify with feminism. They often see other, usually younger, women as competitors and will refuse to help them advance within a company, preferring to mentor a male over a female employee. Some such \"queen bees\" may actively take steps to hinder another woman's advancement as they are seen as direct competitors. Such tactics are sometimes referred to as heterophily (in the sense of positive preference and favoritism for opposite-sex colleagues) or the queen bee syndrome.\n\nThe term \"loophole woman\", coined by Caroline Bird in her book \"Born Female: The High Cost of Keeping Women Down\" (1968), has a similar meaning. Marie Mullaney defines the loophole woman as one who, \"successful in a predominantly male field like law, business or medicine, is opposed to other women's attaining similar levels of success. Such success, if attained by women on a large scale, would detract from, if not substantially reduce, her own status and importance.\" (The term \"honorary male\" is related, but does not imply opposition to other women's success).\n\nA queen bee in a school setting is sometimes referred to as a school diva or school princess. These queen bees are often stereotyped in the media as being beautiful, charismatic, manipulative, and wealthy, holding positions of high social status, such as being head cheerleader (or being the captain of some other, usually an all-girl, sports team), the Homecoming or Prom Queen (or both). The phenomenon of queen bees is common in finishing schools.\n\nQueen bees may wield substantial influence and power over their cliques, and are considered role models by clique members and outsiders. Her actions are closely followed and imitated. Sussana Stern identifies the following qualities as characteristic of queen bees:\n\n\nFictional portrayals of queen bees in schools include the films \"Heathers\" and \"Mean Girls\". The latter was partially adapted from the nonfiction book \"Queen Bees and Wannabes\". The television series \"Gossip Girl\" is highlighted for its portrayal of Blair Waldorf as a queen bee, as she has a league of minions for friends and is frequently referred as 'Queen B'\nby her peers. Another television series \"Pretty Little Liars\" is also highlighted for its portrayal of Alison DiLaurentis as queen bee, as she has a clique, seems to be bossy and mean to people who are not her friends, and everyone treats her as a Queen. She is sometimes referred as 'Queen Ali'. Quinn Fabray from \"Glee\" is also described as \"queen bee\" due to her being rich, popular, beautiful and head cheerleader.\n\n\n\n"}

He lived in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285-246 BC). The city was at that time a remarkable center of learning, with a great deal of artistic and literary activity, including epic poetry and the Great Library. Only a few genuine fragments of his work have been preserved; those in Stobaeus are generally considered spurious. Ennius translated some poems of this kind, included in his book of satires under the name of Sola. He had a son named Apollonius.\n\nSotades was the chief representative of the writers of obscene and even pederastic satirical poems, called Kinaidoi (), composed in the Ionic dialect and in the metre named after him. The sotadic metre or sotadic verse, which has been classified by ancient and modern scholars as a form of ionic metre, is one that reads backwards and forwards the same, as “llewd did I live, and evil I did dwell.” These verses have also been called palindromic. Sotades was also the author of some of the first recorded palindromes, and many credit him with the invention of that particular genre of composition.\n\nOne of his poems attacked Ptolemy's marriage to his own sister Arsinoe, from which came the infamous line: \"You're sticking your prick in an unholy hole.\" For this, Sotades was imprisoned, but he escaped to the island of Caunus, where he was afterwards captured by Patroclus, Ptolemy's admiral, shut up in a leaden chest, and thrown into the sea. \n\nBritish Orientalist and explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821-1890) hypothesised the existence of a \"Sotadic zone\".

People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes.\n\nThe fabric that users bounce on (commonly known as the \"bounce mat\" or \"trampoline bed\") is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy.\n\nA game similar to trampolining was developed by the Inuit, who would toss blanket dancers into the air on a walrus skin one at a time (see Nalukataq) during a spring celebration of whale harvest. There is also some evidence of people in Europe having been tossed into the air by a number of people holding a blanket. Mak in the Wakefield \"Second Shepherds' Play\" and Sancho Panza in \"Don Quixote\" are both subjected to blanketing – however, these are clearly non-voluntary, non-recreational instances of quasi-judicial, mob-administered punishment. The trampoline-like life nets once used by firefighters to catch people jumping out of burning buildings were invented in 1887.\n\nThe 19th-century poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal refers to performance on trampoline. The device is thought to have been more like a springboard than the fabric-and-coiled-springs apparatus presently in use.\n\nThese may not be the true antecedents of the modern sport of trampolining, but indicate that the concept of bouncing off a fabric surface has been around for some time. In the early years of the 20th century, some acrobats used a \"bouncing bed\" on the stage to amuse audiences. The bouncing bed was, a form of small trampoline covered by bedclothes, on which acrobats performed mostly comedy routines.\n\nAccording to circus folklore, the trampoline was supposedly first developed by an artiste named du Trampolin, who saw the possibility of using the trapeze safety net as a form of propulsion and landing device and experimented with different systems of suspension, eventually reducing the net to a practical size for separate performance. While trampoline-like devices were used for shows and in the circus, the story of du Trampolin is almost certainly apocryphal. No documentary evidence has been found to support it.\n\nThe first modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold in 1936. Nissen was a gymnastics and diving competitor and Griswold was a tumbler on the gymnastics team, both at the University of Iowa, United States. They had observed trapeze artists using a tight net to add entertainment value to their performance and experimented by stretching a piece of canvas, in which they had inserted grommets along each side, to an angle iron frame by means of coiled springs. It was initially used to train tumblers but soon became popular in its own right. Nissen explained that the name came from the Spanish \"trampolín\", meaning a diving board. Nissen had heard the word on a demonstration tour in Mexico in the late 1930s and decided to use an anglicized form as the trademark for the apparatus.\n\nIn 1942, Griswold and Nissen created the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline & Tumbling Company, and began making trampolines commercially in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nThe generic term for the trademarked trampoline was a \"rebound tumbler\" and the sport began as \"rebound tumbling\". It has since lost its trademark and has become a generic trademark.\nEarly in their development Nissen anticipated trampolines being used in a number of recreational areas, including those involving more than one participant on the same trampoline. One such game was Spaceballa game of two teams of two on a single trampoline with specially constructed end \"walls\" and a middle \"wall\" through which a ball could be propelled to hit a target on the other side's end wall.\n\nDuring World War II, the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators, giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before. After the war, the development of the space flight programme again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet astronauts, giving them experience of variable body positions in flight.\n\nThe first Trampoline World Championships were organised by Ted Blake of Nissen, and held in London in 1964. The first World Champions were both American, Dan Millman and Judy Wills Cline. Cline went on to dominate and become the most highly decorated trampoline champion of all time.\n\nOne of the earliest pioneers of trampoline as a competitive sport was Jeff Hennessy, a coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Hennessy also coached the United States trampoline team, producing more world champions than any other person. Among his world champions was his daughter, Leigh Hennessy. Both Jeff and Leigh Hennessy are in the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.\n\nThe competitive gymnastic sport of trampolining has been part of the Olympic Games since 2000. On a modern competitive trampoline, a skilled athlete can bounce to a height of up to , performing multiple somersaults and twists. Trampolines also feature in the competitive sport of Slamball, a variant of basketball, and Bossaball, a variant of volleyball.\n\nThere are a number of other sports that use trampolines to help develop and hone acrobatic skills in training before they are used in the actual sporting venue. Examples can be found in diving, gymnastics, and freestyle skiing. One main advantage of trampolining as a training tool for other acrobatic sports is that it allows repetitive drill practice for acrobatic experience every two seconds or less, compared with many minutes with sports that involve hills, ramps or high platforms. In some situations it can also be safer compared to landings on the ground.\n\nThere are two generic types of trampoline, competitive and recreational.\n\nThe frame of a competitive trampoline is made of steel and can be made to fold up for transportation to competition venues. The trampoline bed is rectangular in size fitted into the frame\n\nwith around 110 steel springs (the actual number may vary by manufacturer). The bed is made of a strong fabric, although this is not itself elastic; the elasticity is provided only by the springs. The fabric can be woven from webbing, which is the most commonly used material. However, in the 2007 World Championships held in Quebec City, a Ross bed (or two-string bed), woven from individual thin strings, was used. This type of bed gives a little extra height to the rebound.\n\nRecreational trampolines for home use are less sturdily constructed than competitive ones and their springs are weaker. They may be of various shapes, though most are circular, octagonal or rectangular. The fabric is usually a waterproof canvas or woven polypropylene material.\n\nAs with competitive trampolines, recreational trampolines are usually made using coiled steel springs to provide the rebounding force, but spring-free trampolines also exist.\n\nIn 1959 and 1960 it became very popular to have outdoor commercial \"jump centres\" or \"trampoline parks\" in many places in North America where people could enjoy recreational trampolining. However, these tended to have a high accident rate, and the public's interest rapidly waned.\n\nIn the early 21st century, indoor commercial trampoline parks have made a comeback, with a number of franchises operating across the United States and Canada. ABC News has reported that in 2014 there were at least 345 trampoline parks operating in the United States. Similar parks have more recently been opened in other countries. The International Association of Trampoline Parks (IATP) estimated that park numbers had grown from 35-40 parks in 2011 to around 280 in 2014. The following year, IATP estimated that 345 parks were open by the end of 2014, and that another 115 would open by the end of 2015 in North America. IATP also estimated that at the end of 2014 there were 40 parks outside of North America, and that by the end of 2015 there would be at least 100 indoor trampoline parks open internationally. More notable companies include CircusTrix and Sky Zone.\n\nThese commercial parks are located indoors, and have wall-to wall-trampolines to prevent people falling off the trampolines on to hard surfaces. Padded or spring walls protect people from impact injuries. Despite these precautions, there has been at least one death recorded due to a head-first landing at a trampoline park. In March 2012, New York Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain seriously injured his ankle while jumping at a commercial jump centre in Tampa with his son. In 2018, a man died in a British Columbia trampoline park, which prompted calls for more safety regulations for these popular activities.\n\n Wall running is a sport where the participant uses a wall and platforms placed next to the trampoline bed to do tricks. The basic movement is a backdrop on the trampoline and then the feet touching the wall at the top of the bounce. From there, there is no limit to the acrobatic movements that are possible, similar to regular trampolining. The advantage is that twists and turns can be initiated more forcefully from a solid wall and that the vertical speed can be transferred to rotation in addition to forces from the legs or arms. Additionally, energy can be gained both from the bed at the bottom of the bounce, and from the wall at the top of the bounce.\n\nUsing a trampoline can be dangerous. Organized clubs and gyms usually have large safety end-decks with foam pads at each end, and spotters are placed alongside the trampoline to try to break the fall of any athlete who loses control and falls. In 1999, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated there were 100,000 hospital emergency room visits for trampoline injuries.\n\nDue to the much larger numbers involved and lesser safety standards, the majority of injuries occur on privately owned home trampolines or in commercial trampoline facilities rather than organized gyms. Bouncing off a trampoline can result in a fall of from the peak of a bounce to the ground or a fall into the suspension springs and frame. There has been an increase in the number of home trampolines in recent years and a corresponding increase in the number of injuries reported. Some medical organizations have suggested that the devices be banned from home use.\n\nAuthorities recommend that only one person should be allowed to jump at a time to avoid collisions and people being catapulted in an unexpected direction or higher than they expect. One of the most common sources of injury is when multiple users are bouncing on the trampoline at one time. More often than not, this situation leads to users bouncing into one another and thus becoming injured; many suffer broken bones as a result of landing badly after knocking into another user.\n\nAnother of the most common sources of serious injury is an attempt to perform somersaults without proper training. In some cases, people land on their neck or head, which can cause paralysis or even death. In an infamous incident in the 1960s, pole-vaulting champion Brian Sternberg became paralyzed from the neck down in a trampoline accident.\n\nDanger can be reduced by burying the trampoline so the bed is closer to the surrounding surface to lessen falling distance, and padding that surrounding area. Pads over the spring and frame reduce the severity of impact injuries. Keeping the springs covered also reduces the risk of a limb falling between the gaps in the springs and the rest of the body falling off the trampoline.\n\nKits are available for home trampolines that provide a retaining net around the trampoline and prevent users from bouncing over the edge. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that there is no epidemiological evidence that these improve safety. The nets do prevent jumpers falling off the trampoline onto the ground, but these falls are not the most common source of injury. Multiple users bouncing in a netted trampoline can still be injured. Safety net enclosures have a larger benefit for safeguarding solo trampolinists, so long as they avoid falling on their head or neck.\n\nHaving some training in a gym may be beneficial in alerting people to possible hazards and provide techniques to avoid bad falls.\n\nFamily-oriented commercial areas in North America, such as shopping centres, carnivals, and so on, often include closed inflatable trampolines (CITs) as a children's attraction. These have safety nets on the sides to prevent injuries.\n\nA mini-trampoline (also known as a rebounder, trampette, jogging trampoline, or exercise trampoline) is a type of trampoline less than in diameter and about off the ground, often kept indoors and used as part of a physical fitness regime. So-called rebounding provides a form of exercise with a low impact on knees and joints. Mini-trampolines do not give a rebound as high as larger recreational or competitive trampolines. Most department and big-box stores sell mini-trampolines.\n\nIn co-operation with the University of Bremen and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the machtWissen.de Corporation from Bremen, Germany developed the weightlessness demonstrator \"Gravity Jumper\" based on a trampoline. Due to the acceleration during the jump, an acceleration force takes effect in addition to the usual gravitational force. Both forces add up and the person on the trampoline seems to become heavier. As soon as the jumper leaves the trampoline, he is under a free fall condition, which means that the jumper seems weightless and does not feel the acceleration due to gravity.\nEvery person receives a three-axis acceleration sensor, fastened to them with a belt. The sensor transmits the data of the flight path to a monitor; a monitor shows the course of the acceleration, including the weightless phase. The interplay of acceleration due to the trampoline and weightlessness becomes apparent.\n"}
{"id": "35236347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35236347", "title": "Transformation processes (media systems)", "text": "Transformation processes (media systems)\n\nThe term transformation (also \"transition\" or \"system change\") in the field of mediated cross-border communication refers to\na media system's change from for instance authoritarian or communist structures to a new media system with different structures and control mechanisms.\n\nCompared to the studies of media systems, transformation research is focused on the collective and individual actors who \"demand, support, and manage change\". They can be found in governments, parties, NGOs, civil society organizations or interest groups. To the largest extent, transformation research addresses change from authoritarian to democratic media systems. Since transformation processes in media systems are always linked to the political and socioeconomic development, transformation research is not solely focused on the transformation of the media systems, but also on sectors like politics, economy, society, or culture.\n\nTransformation research is a comparative approach, since processes in different stages of the political or media system are compared. The approach is highly complex, because it combines comparison with the dimension of space and time, for instance by analyzing similar change processes of media systems in different world regions and times in history. This causes problems, because the changing systems can exhibit considerable differences between one another. Although there are differences between them, transformation processes often occur at the same time and significant similarities between the resulting patterns can be observed.\n\nThe transformation research on media systems has its origin in transformation studies of political sciences. Fragments of political science theories were applied in comparative media studies, since transformation processes of media systems are strongly connected to the transformation of political systems. Katharina Hadamik (2003) describes this connection as \"political-medial transformation-parallelism\". She stresses that the media system in a state cannot take any path of transformation. It is connected to the transformation of the political system. For instance, states which develop democratic structures and constitutional conditions in their political system also build out free or relatively free media systems. In contrast, media systems in states with weaker or even no transformation of the political system have much higher barriers of development to overcome. So, \"it is the political system that ultimately has the power to make binding decisions and thus shapes the basic structure and functioning of the media system\". This strong connection between political and media system can be emphasized by watching the process of transformation from an authoritarian to a democratic system in both politics and media.\n\nThe transformation from an authoritarian to a democratic political system has three phases: \nPhase 1: end of the old authoritarian regime\n\nPhase 2: transformation and institutionalisation of democracy\n\nPhase 3: consolidation of democracy through a new system\n\nThe process of transformation from an authoritarian to a democratic media system also has three phases, similar to the phases of transformation in political systems:\n\nPhase 1: breakthrough in the media sector\n\nPhase 2: fixation of the changes in the media sector\n\nPhase 3: development of a stable media system\n\nIn comparative media system research, scholars have identified three processes of change in media systems: homogenization, heterogenization, and hybridization.\n\nIn the field of comparative media system research, homogenization is defined as the convergence of many media systems towards one specific model, caused by changes in political and economic structures, commercialization, and changes in technology. Cultural differences between the countries are said to become less important, since a few international conglomerates dominate the global media industry. In 2004, the authors Hallin and Mancini attested a convergence of European media systems towards the prevalent in North America, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Relating to the convergence of media systems, four constitutive factors can be identified:\n\n\nAlthough a tendency of homogenization towards the can be attested, there still are important differences between the systems. First of all, the variations between the political systems of each country seem to persist in the future. Furthermore, the party and electoral systems between the countries remain different. Moreover, the legal systems of the countries are still distinct. Also, even though there is a trend towards neutral journalism, political parallelism in the national press of countries still persists and will probably remain in the immediate future. Thus, a complete converge of the media systems seems unlikely.\n\nThere are also limits and countertendencies against homogenization. There is evidence of countertendencies relating to the reduction of political polarization and ideological differences between parties. In some countries, new extremist parties on the far right of the political spectrum arose, motivated through issues of immigration, multiculturalism and integration. Moreover, so called advocacy journalism does not only persist in countries (especially in Italy, Spain and Greece), but new forms of it are also beginning to proliferate in all kinds of media systems.\n\nSome scholars argue against the theory of homogenization of media systems that due to national political cultures and institutions, a process of heterogenization rather than homogenization, has to be stated. The countertendencies of homogenization (for instance new right extremist parties, new forms of advocacy journalism, divergence processes in the styles of election coverage between the United States and Great Britain) lead to heterogenization of the media systems. However, the divergence of media systems is confronted by a much more fundamental convergence between them. Hallin & Mancini also argue that the results of their analysis do not support the thesis of heterogenization of media systems.\n\nHybrid media systems are defined as a blend of already existing practices and new practices from a new or foreign media system. Foreign models are adapted to the particular historical, geographical, social, and cultural characteristics of the domestic media system. Rather than a temporary state of transformation, hybrid media systems are considered an equilibrium between two types of practices. Thus, hybrid media systems are mostly located between authoritarian and democratic political systems. Although they may have introduced competitive elections, they may not strengthen further democratic institutions beyond the basic requirements. Therefore, the degree to which hybrid systems adopt democratic practices can vary from state to state. Hybrid systems build out distinct patterns of politic-media relations with significant differences to Western media systems, for instance the Brazilian media system, which was influenced by the American journalism model. However, the American journalism system was not adopted one-to-one, since there \"was no solid market economy, individualistic culture, or political culture that valued the freedom of press\". Another example is the media system of Poland, which detached itself from its communist ties in the 1990s and converged towards Western media systems, but still has its Polish specifics, such as the use of public-service broadcasting as a political instrument.\n\nAccording to the three phases from an authoritarian to a democratic media system, the old authoritarian system ends by the institutionalisation of democratic elements (phase 1 and 2). In the third phase, the new hybrid system consolidates democratic elements, but some elements of the authoritarian system still exist. Thus, it is difficult to state when the third phase is completed.\n\nIn Hallin & Mancini's \"Comparing media systems beyond the western world\" (2012), which gives an overview of criticism about their and furthermore extends and revises it, Katrin Voltmer states that, instead of media system homogenization towards the of Hallin & Mancini's framework, transformation processes rather move towards hybrid media systems, since media markets become more international, but have to adapt to local situations. Thus, the theory of hybridization in media systems is rather an adaption than a counterpart to the theory of convergence.\n\nA consistent transformation theory valid for all transformation processes and countries, does not yet exist, since it is difficult to cover the variety and complexity of all the processes. Some researchers are of the opinion that it is impossible to find a consistent theory of transformation processes, because of the historical, political and social particularities of each country and their different types of transformation processes. Furthermore, the debate about convergence, divergence, or hybridization of media systems is still ongoing.\n\n\n"}
