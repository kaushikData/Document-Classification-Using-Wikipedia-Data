{"id": "5394329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5394329", "title": "And Now My Love", "text": "And Now My Love\n\nAnd Now My Love (), (Released as 'A Whole Lifetime' in Australia) is a French-Italian film released in 1974 by Claude Lelouch, starring Marthe Keller, André Dussollier, Charles Denner, and Charles Gérard. The American title derives from the use of the Gilbert Bécaud song \"Et Maintenant\" at the film's climax; the song title literally translates as \"And Now,\" and the song became a worldwide hit when it was recorded with English lyrics as \"What Now My Love\".\n\n\"And Now My Love\" was nominated for the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award in 1975. The film was also screened at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition.\n\nThe story begins in France with a black-and-white, silent film-style sequence in the pre-World War I era, where a woman (Judith Magre) meets a man (Charles Denner) operating a prototypical Lumiere movie camera in a park. After charming her into taking a turn operating the crank on his camera, she is next seen bearing his child while he is enlisted in the French army, documenting soldiers in a trench. He receives a telegram announcing the birth of his son, but is killed by enemy fire quickly after. His widow and young son are given posthumous medals for his service by a general (Daniel Boulanger). The general later takes a fancy to a chorus girl (Marthe Keller), whom he quickly marries. His wife bears him a daughter, but is previously shown cheating on him with his younger aide-de-camp. The general kills her upon discovering her infidelity. (This scene is omitted, but flashed back to later on, in the U.S. release version.) On the same day as her death, the shooting of the Romanov family takes place, and a brief montage of the succeeding Russian leaders is shown.\n\nA film clip announcing the breakthrough of sound recording on film (and promoting the release of \"The Jazz Singer\" transitions to sound clips of Hitler and World War II events, and then to a train carrying Jewish concentration camp survivors, including the now grown daughter of the cuckolded general, named Rachel Stern (Marthe Keller again), and the son of the filmmaker's widow (Charles Denner again), named David Goldman. They are drawn to each other, exchange photos of their deceased parents, and are next seen conceiving a child (with the film switching to color). Rachel, weakened by her camp imprisonment, dies in childbirth, but successfully bears David a daughter, whom he names Sarah. Over a series of birthday scenes, Sarah (Marthe Keller once more) is depicted as growing into the image of her mother, and being lavishly spoiled by David, who has now become a millionaire from manufacturing shoes. On her 16th birthday, he hires French pop star Gilbert Bécaud (playing a fictional version of himself) to perform for her. Later that night, she loses her virginity to him.\n\nIn scenes crosscut with Sarah's youth, the character of Simon Duroc (André Dussollier) is introduced, shoplifting a Gilbert Bécaud record. He pulls many petty crimes, but is caught by police. His defense attorney reveals in court that Simon has been raised in an orphanage, been to reform school, and deserted the Army during France's war with Algeria, attempting to draw sympathy for him. Simon is found guilty and sent to jail. He engineers an escape via a garbage truck, but after he steals a car, he gets into a car wreck and is sent back to jail. At the same point in time, Sarah, earlier seen being cavalierly dumped by Bécaud when she tries to meet him backstage at a concert, attempts suicide, but survives in hospital.\n\nDesperate to try making her move on from her affair with Bécaud, David takes Sarah on a long, around-the-world trip, where they talk at length about relationships, religion, class issues, and other concepts. Flashbacks reveal that David previously visited many of these sites with Rachel, and had some of the same discussions. Sarah is still swept up in misplaced love and mostly ridicules her father's counsel. In jail, Simon befriends Sam (Sam Letrone), a cook with a trained rooster, and later apprentices himself to the prison photographer \"Charlie Focus\" (Charles Gérard), who teaches him how to take photographs. Sarah and Simon unconsciously develop identical traits, such as wanting three sugars in their coffee, that indicate they may be destined to be a couple.\n\nA couple of years later, Sarah is now living in Italy, ostensibly supervising the local branch of her father's shoe company. She has a best friend Carla (Carla Gravina) whom she briefly carries on a lesbian relationship with. She propositions a handsome stud (Angelo Infanti) to get her pregnant, but the attempt is unsuccessful and he ultimately becomes involved with Carla instead. Simon and Charles are released from jail, and after a brief period of making money taking surveillance photos and film of unfaithful couples, find success making a porno movie depicting deviant acts in Hitler's inner circle. At a party thrown by Sarah and Carla, this porno film is screened, but Sarah declines to watch it. Simon and Charles' office is raided (since making adult films is a criminal act at this time of history), and they are arrested and sent back to prison; one of the arresting officers is the same who previously sent Simon to jail earlier in the film, but does not recognize him.\n\nAt the tail end of the '60's, Sarah has taken to writing about herself and her dissatisfied upbringing, remarking on her father's indulgence as a means of keeping her mother's memory alive. She agrees to marry an Italian man suggested by her father (Gabriele Tinti), but divorces him after six days, coinciding with the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt. Four days after the breakup, David dies from a heart attack. Simon, having devoured film theory books and \"Cahiers du Cinema\" magazine during his porn-making incarceration, is eager to make a feature film, and starts conceiving an autobiographical story. When he and Charles are released from jail, they reunite with Sam, who is now a successful restaurateur, and frequently dine with him. The duo set up a firm to make commercials, and win an award for one of them. Chafing under the conditions of advertising, Simon embarks on adapting a book into his directorial debut, casting a black actress (Annie Kerani) he begins dating after making a commercial with her. However, she cheats on him with the leading actor in the project, and Simon's bitterness creeps into the finished film, which ends with her being choked by the actor. The film is poorly reviewed and forces the team to go back to making commercials. They rent office space in the same building where Sarah's company is headquartered, Sarah and Simon obliviously walking past each other in one moment.\n\nA heartbroken Sarah, now recognizing the wisdom of her father after his death, proposes sweeping progressive changes to his company that will favor the workers. However, a union agitator (Élie Chouraqui) doubts the company's sincerity and leads the employees on a violent strike. Sarah finds herself attracted to the agitator and briefly dates him, but otherwise maintains a long-term relationship with a kind-hearted member of her board of directors; while appreciating his calm and nurturing manner, she finds no excitement in the relationship. Simon initially attempts to pitch another feature film, this time an dystopian science fiction story about man's future. He chooses instead to make his earlier autobiographical tale, complete with reenacting events of his life previously depicted - his youthful thefts, his porn career, etc. There are two more near-meets between Simon and Sarah during this time, once at the restaurant as they both dine there unaware of each other, and later at the Deauville beach, where Sarah has gone to reassess her priorities and Simon tries to rethink the ending to his film. In the latter encounter, while they do not meet, he crosses paths with her dog, which inspires him to write a happy ending for his movie. The new film is well-received and Simon is interviewed on TV, which Sarah watches with interest.\n\nAt the climax, Sarah tells her lover she is leaving him, tired of the boring stability they have experienced. She intends to go to New York City to raise money for Israel. Her lover accompanies her to the airport. Simultaneously, Simon is also heading for New York as well, feeling he needs a change of scenery to get ideas for his next film. They arrive at the departure desk one after the other, their luggage is tagged at the same time, and their seats are next to each other. When they are offered coffee, Simon asks for three sugars, Sarah takes note of it, and they initiate conversation. In a sequence cut from the American release version (but retained on the first U.S. DVD from Image Entertainment), the dystopian future story that Simon had been contemplating is dramatized at length, as he tells it to Sarah. The film ends with their respective bags on top of each other on a conveyor belt, as if making love.\n\nAccording to film historian John Kirk, an earlier French release version of the film ended with the plane carrying Sarah and Simon crashing soon after their meeting. The idea behind this stark finish was that since the film has depicted their entire lives, and their mutual destiny to meet each other as soul mates, the natural ending should be to then depict their lives ending since that task has been completed.\n\nLelouch used the principle of Simultaneous Bilingual Film Production in making this film: for each camera setup, the actors performed twice (in English and in French), so that neither the French-language nor English-language prints are dubbed or subtitled.\n\nMany autobiographical elements come into play, especially in the arc of the Simon Duroc character. Like Duroc, Lelouch's first feature film was widely panned, and his successful follow-up \"A Man and A Woman\" featured a sequence on the Deauville beach.\n\n\nThe movie uses many songs by French singer Gilbert Bécaud, who also plays a fictional version of himself in the movie. For the American release, captions indicated the names of his songs and when he was singing them, as well as other lesser-known French pop songs and performers. This was instrumental in demonstrating that Bécaud, who was not a familiar figure to English-speaking audiences, was a crucial element to the story, in that both protagonists are obsessed with him and his music, and that his presence was constantly hovering over their lives.\n\n"}

{"id": "21729577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21729577", "title": "Barclay Manufacturing Company", "text": "Barclay Manufacturing Company\n\nThe Barclay Manufacturing Company was an American metal toy company based in New Jersey that specialised in diecast toy cars and hollowcast toy soldiers. Due to their common availability at five and dime stores, collectors often refer to Barclay's toy soldiers as \"Dimestore soldiers\".\n\nBarclay Manufacturing was formed by Leon Donze and Michael Levy in about 1922 (O'Brien 1997, 62). The name of the company came from Barclay Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. During the 1930s, the company was later based in North Bergen, New Jersey.\n\nIn its heyday Barclay produced 500,000 toys a week, making them the largest toy soldier manufacturer at that time in the United States (Young and Young 2007, 550). In 1939 Barclay acquired another toy soldier company, Tommy Toy and its art deco sculptor Olive Kooken (Fendelman and Rosson 2009) . Soldier's uniforms followed military fashion of the times, replacing closed standing collars with open ones with shirt and tie. Wrap around puttees were replaced by canvas leggings. Prior to the company's temporary closing in 1942 the foot soldiers were purchased individually for a nickel.\n\nSome of Barclay's first vehicles were slush cast white metal made in the 1930s. Some of the most interesting models were in art deco style. One intriguing selection was a \"Coast to Coast\" art deco style bus - another a two tone oil tanker with pontoon fenders - on both models, fenders were different colors from the bodies. One available set had a cartoon-like strip on the box lid that stated it was a \"Build and Paint Your Own Auto Set\" which was \"Loads of fun\". The set included a four-door sedan, a two-door, and a tanker truck. It included paint and the cars had white rubber wheels.\n\nAlso about this time, and into the 1940s, the company made a variety of military vehicles - tanks, trucks with cannon and other cars painted brown.\n\nAfter World War II, Barclay's headquarters were relocated to Union City, New Jersey. Despite the inroads of plastic toy soldiers, Barclay kept manufacturing theirs in metal. Following the war, Barclay changed the helmets on their soldiers to the M1 Helmet. In about 1951 Barclay conserved metal by eliminating bases on their soldiers, which collectors nicknamed \"podfoot\" soldiers because each foot appeared as a flattened rounded blob (Johnson 1982, 104-106). These were painted similar to figures in American comic books of the time - olive drab uniforms with green helmets with \"enemy\" soldiers in red uniforms with white helmets. With the rising cost of metal, the soldiers had risen in price to 15 cents.\n\nThough cruder than European offerings, such as Britains, Barclays soldiers had a verve and energy that was popular with American youth. Cast figures on motorcycles with generalized, but non-moving rings for wheels, exuded speed and were simple but very effective toys (Johnson 1982, 103).\n\nIn 1960, the lead soldiers were generally removed from Woolworths and other dimestores and more commonly found for sale in hobby shops. From 1964 the soldiers' uniforms were painted in green to reflect the modern US Army.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Barclay's diecast metal vehicles continued in popularity. Common sizes were vehicles just over 1 inch long, but others were 3 to 4 inches. A variety of cars were produced like a tiny VW Beetle and some sports and racing cars, often with tiny metal drivers. Some generic trucks appeared as well. One clever compact set was a car carrier with folding ramp and four cars. Another was a tall-nosed GM Motorama-style pickup carrying nine wooden 'beer' barrels. This same truck also appeared in a white 'milk and ice cream' version. \n\nBarclay cars are recognizable for their simple single cast bodies, somewhat like miniature Tootsietoys, though distinct from that company, some Barclay models had drivers separately cast in metal and painted then put in proper position in the vehicles. The vehicles were adorned with neither windows nor interiors. Notable were the vehicles' pinched flat axles that protruded rather boldly from the wheels (something that safety standards would likely not allow today). Cars were painted a variety of colors - especially bright blues, reds, and oranges.\n\nOne line produced around 1960 was the 'Bottle Series' Metal Miniatures. Barclay's tiny vehicles were placed in a small blister card covered with clear plastic in the form of a bottle. On one side of the package, a skyscraper was illustrated - on the other side, a country lane. The entire package was only slightly smaller than 4 x 2.75 inches. There was no decoration or writing on the cardboard back of the package. At the bottom of the package was boldly written 'All American', each letter in a square each alternating red and blue (and somewhat reminiscent of wooden letter blocks lined up). Perhaps this slogan emphasized that these toys were not made in England (like Matchbox or Budgie) or any other country. The bottle series were priced at 19 cents.\n\nThe 1960s would prove to be a turbulent time for the \"old line\" toy manufacturers. Before the decade was out, the A.C. Gilbert Company and Lionel, both legends in the toy world, would be gone. Marx was severely crippled.\n\nBarclay ceased trading in 1971 due to an inability to compete with plastics and the rapidly changing market (e.g. Mattel Hot Wheels), not because of issues regarding lead, which has been a popular misconception (Fendelman and Rosson 2009).\n\nThe old firm's trademark rights were re-acquired in the 1990s, and now The Barclay Company once again manufactures solid metal reproductions of Barclay and Manoil Manufacturing Co. figures.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14474795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14474795", "title": "Community Broadband Bill", "text": "Community Broadband Bill\n\nThe Community Broadband Act was a bill (proposed law) that was never enacted into legislation by the U.S. Senate,110th Congress The act was intended to promote affordable broadband access by allowing municipal governments to provide telecommunications capability and services.\n\nSupporters of the bill believed it would have encouraged widespread broadband development in the United States by overturning existing state bans on public broadband deployments and eliminating existing barriers to broadband development.\n\nAcquiring municipal broadband for some communities is problematic because the laws of certain states prohibit local municipalities from installing their own broadband networks and private sector companies are unable to provide the electric services needed for broadband. As a result, many rural and remote communities are left with without broadband services. Some municipalities may find broadband service, but it may be limited to already available commercial options, which may fall short of community need.\n\nSpecific provisions of the bill:\n\nThe onset of free or low-cost municipal broadband access to citizens in competition with commercial broadband services would have economic implications.\nThe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on October 30, 2007 estimated enacting the community broadband bill would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Because the act would preempt laws in 15 states that presently ban the provision of broadband services by public entities, including municipalities, it would, however, impose mandates on some state and local governments. In accordance with the act, public providers would be required to publish notice of their intent to offer broadband services. Public providers would also be required to provide details about the types of broadband services they intend to offer in addition to allowing private bids for those services.\nSince the preemption laws and private bidding requirements would be considered intergovernmental mandates as defined by the UMRA, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation determined that the cost the mandates could not exceed the threshold established by UMRA and adjusted yearly for inflation. In 2007 the UMRA threshold was $66 million USD.\n\nAlthough broadband access is national problem, it must be addressed on the local level. Acknowledging the importance of broadband in the increasingly competitive global economy, President Bush in June 2004 initiated a goal for universal and affordable broadband access for every American by 2007. However the United States is still far behind in reaching this goal. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development conducted a study ranking the U.S. in 12th place worldwide in the percentage of people with broadband connections. The majority of nations in the top ranks showed to have successfully combined private-public partnerships to provide broadband access for citizens and businesses alike.\n\nOn July 27, 2007, Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced the legislation, noting the importance of broadband services and how they are essential to providing important educational and economic opportunities, especially for rural areas. By providing public-private broadband service partnerships, the bill would make it easier for municipalities, cities, and towns across the nation to offer broadband access to their residents.\n\nDespite the advocacy for public-private broadband partnerships and service there are many telecommunication firms seeking to bar the enactment of a community broadband act. Citing government-backed networks would compete unfairly with private companies. Also requiring heavy taxpayer subsidization that would minimize net benefits to local residents. Douglas Boone, chief executive of Premier Communications when speaking with U.S. Telecom Association said “setting up a government-owned network is like having city hall opening a chain of grocery stores or gas stations.\" Government-backed broadband might also lead to stifled innovation inhibiting technological advancement.\n\nThere are also telecommunication companies supportive of universal community broadband placements such as Earthlink. Believing partnerships between governments and private companies can provide low-cost, high-speed citywide service that offers many advantages to residents, visitors and taxpayers. EarthLink Municipal Networks, a subsidiary created to design and implement wireless broadband services, with the country's biggest municipal ISP contracts, covering Philadelphia and Anaheim, Calif. The partnership with Earthlink is a prime example of how affordable broadband service is being provided to low-income neighborhoods that would otherwise be passed over by private companies.\n\nOn September 21, 2007 the Community Broadband Coalition formed by trade associations, public interest organizations, and private companies with an interest to enhance the availability of broadband services throughout the country submitted a congressional letter in support of the bill. The letter urged other senators to cosponsor the bipartisan ,pointing out the benefits of adopting community broadband networks.\n\n\nMajor organizations included in the Community Broadband Coalition letter in support of The Community Broadband Act:\n\nUnited States senators who cosponsored the bill in the 110th United States Congress \n\n"}

{"id": "39759443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39759443", "title": "Drakensang Online", "text": "Drakensang Online\n\nDrakensang Online is a freemium online role-playing game of the German enterprise Bigpoint. The gameplay is similar to the Diablo game franchise and is developed by Bigpoint Berlin. The title was in an open beta phase from August 2011 to July 2012. According to Bigpoint's own statement, there are currently 35 million registered accounts. However, the real number can differ because multiple registrations are allowed. A retail version was released in November 2011.\n\n\"Drakensang Online\" is very similar to the Diablo game franchise and to other comparable titles in the way that is played from an isometric perspective.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player creates a character by choosing to play as one of the four different character classes (Dragonknight, Ranger, Spellweaver and Steam Mechanicus) each of which has a different set of attributes. It is possible to create a maximum of up to four characters per account and server. The player can play solo or together with other players. There is also a guild system where players can organize themselves into alliances. Communication takes place via an internal chat system.\n\nThe Drakensang world known as \"Duria\" is a freely explorable open world that is similar to medieval Europe. Currently, Duria has eleven regions with multiple cities, dungeons and wilderness areas.\n\nFor faster progression, a player can use the in game virtual currency called Andermant to purchase weapons, upgrade items, teleport to other locations and more. There are a few ways to get Andermant. You can find it in the game by completing missions/quests, slaying monsters or opening chests. It can be bought with real money (free-to-play principle), similar to other free online and browser games, in an item shop by clicking on the in game Purchase button. And it can also be earned by participating in surveys or deals offered by the game's sponsors.\n\nThe roots of the project sprouted in 2008 when German developer studio Radon Labs released the title \"\" and then in 2010, its successor \"\". They were classical single player role-playing games that both took place in the virtual game world of \"The Dark Eye\" (DSA, \"Das Schwarze Auge\"). In May 2010, Radon Labs filed for bankruptcy. It was then acquired by Bigpoint Games and was fully integrated in the existing studio of Bigpoint Berlin. In September 2010, the development of \"Drakensang Online\" was announced. Because Bigpoint did not acquire a DSA license and only had ownership of the name rights for \"Drakensang\", they developed a completely new game world with an independent rule system which had no relationship to any of its predecessors.\n\nLike all other Radon Labs titles, the game is based on the self-developed Nebula Engine, which was meant for use in a browser. The game is written in C++ and runs within a Java applet in the browser. Since Java is no longer supported by some browsers, a downloadable client was made available in April 2015. In August 2011, \"Drakensang Online\" released an open beta version for testing which included the item shop for purchasing Andermant. With the inclusion of the virtual currency, the game was able to start its business operations.\n\nIt received a positive reception by the German magazine GameStar for its high-quality graphics in comparison with other browser-based games. Overall, \"Drakensang Online\" was described as a \"frame of action role-playing game\". A month after its release, more than 850,000 accounts were created. It has frequently been cited as one of the best new browser MMOs upon release.\n\nIn 2011, \"Drakensang Online\" was awarded the German Developer Prize as best German role-playing game. In May 2012, it won the \"best browser game\" award at the German Video Game Awards and was described as an \"outstanding German game production\".\n\nAlthough it is a browser-based game, two retail versions were released which included some items, that were otherwise available in the in-game store. The less expensive version included stronger armor as well as more combat power of the character and 10,000 Andermant, with which the player could use to buy other items via the in-game shop. The more expensive version included all the content of the other version plus a dragon that could be used as a pet, increased armor and combat power. According to the developer, the dragon gave the player a +20% bonus of experience points. Later, the contingent of included Andermant got increased from 10,000 to 12,000 Andermant.\n\n"}

The company was founded in 1967 by Beverly S. Griffin and Robert R. Griffin.\n\nThe company maintained dossiers on card counters, serial jackpot winners, and other individuals, chiefly professional gamblers using legal techniques to gain an advantage in casino games; these profiles were regularly published in the \"Griffin Book\", and distributed to subscribing casinos. Griffin Investigations was instrumental in ending the MIT Blackjack Team’s winning streak, after a Griffin investigator purchased the names, photographs, and other details identifying the group’s members and the company distributed the information to casinos. Roughly half of the major casinos in the US once subscribed to Griffin’s services.\n\nGriffin also marketed a controversial face recognition system that used computer software to compare gamblers' faces against several volumes of mug shots. Beverly Griffin, co-owner of Griffin Investigations, estimates as many as half of Southern Nevada's casinos now use biometric technology to identify the faces of card cheats or other undesirables. However, a Las Vegas casino surveillance director (writing under the pseudonym Cellini) reported in the 2004 book \"The Card Counter's Guide to Casino Surveillance\" that biometric technology was considered virtually useless by actual casino surveillance operatives because of overwhelming numbers of false reads.\n\nThe \"Las Vegas Sun\" reported on September 13, 2005, that Griffin Investigations had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in light of legal costs and damages from a successful defamation lawsuit against the company. The lawsuit had been brought by two gamblers, Michael Russo and James Grosjean, claiming they had been improperly detained, labeled as cheaters and arrested, on the basis of information supplied by Griffin. The judgement of a jury in Clark County District Court in June 2005 ordered Griffin Investigations to pay $15,000 to Michael Russo and $10,000 to James Grosjean in punitive damages; and Griffin Investigations and Caesars Palace were each ordered to pay Russo and Grosjean actual damages of $25,000 each.\n\nThe company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2005 after losing the libel suit.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the Private Investigators Licensing Board for 18 June 2008, Ms Beverly Griffin said that her ex-husband had retired and she was seeking to purchase his half of the business. She said all Chapter 11 payments were up to date and all requirements had been met, and that she had, as advised by counsel, changed the way information was supplied, using data encryption.\n\n"}

{"id": "5638764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5638764", "title": "Hobart Bosworth", "text": "Hobart Bosworth\n\nHobart Van Zandt Bosworth (August 11, 1867 – December 30, 1943) was an American film actor, director, writer, and producer.\n\nHe was born on August 11, 1867, in Marietta, Ohio. He was a descendant of Miles Standish and John and Priscilla Alden on his father's side and of New York's Van Zandt family, the first Dutch settlers to land in the New World, on his mother's side. Bosworth was always proud of his lineage.\n\nAfter his mother died, his father remarried and young Hobart took a dislike to his stepmother. Considering himself \"ill used and cruelly treated\", as he told an interviewer in 1914, he ran away to New York City. There he signed on as a cabin boy aboard the \"Sovereign of the Seas\", a clipper ship, and was soon out to sea.\n\nAfter his first voyage, a five-month trip that took him from New York to San Francisco, Hobart spent his wages on candy. (Sleeping it off on a bench in the park in back of Trinity Church, the young boy didn't know when dozing off that the organ music was being played by his own uncle. A Captain Roberts, who found stevedore work for young Hobart, told him of his uncle's presence in San Francisco.) He continued as a sailor as the sea was in his family's blood, eventually spending three years at sea.\n\nHe once told an interviewer, \"All my people were of the sea and my father was a naval officer\". He spent eleven months on an old fashioned whaler plying the Arctic. Back in San Francisco, he found work at odd jobs. When not otherwise occupied becoming a semi-professional boxer and wrestler, Bosworth tried ranching in Southern California and Mexico, where he learned to become an expert horseman. Finally, his interest in the arts led him to the stage.\n\nThinking he would like to become a landscape painter, a friend suggested that he work as a stage manager to raise the money to study art. Acting on his friend's advice, Bosworth obtained a job with McKee Rankin as a stage manager at the California Theatre in San Francisco. Earning some money, he undertook the study of painting. Eventually, he was pressed into duty as an actor in a small part with three lines. Though he botched the lines, he was given other small roles. Bosworth was eighteen years old, and on the cusp of a life in the theater.\n\nHobart signed on with Louis Morrison to be part of a road company for a season as both an actor and as Morrison's dresser, playing Shakespeare's \"Cymbeline\" and \"Measure for Measure\". During his time with the company, Hobart and another writer wrote a version of \"Faust\" that Morrison used for twenty years in repertory. By 1887, he was acting at the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco. He became proficient enough on stage to give Shakespearean canon by the time he was twenty-one years old, though he admitted that he was the worst Macbeth ever.\n\nBosworth eventually wound up in Park City, Utah, where he worked in a mine, pushing an ore wagon in order to raise money. He escaped the pits to tour with the magician Hermann the Great as the conjurer's assistant for a tour through Mexico.\n\nFor the first time in eleven years, the 21-year-old Bosworth met his father. Hobart recalled, \"He looked at me and said, \"Hum! I couldn't lick you now, son.\" They never met again.\n\nHe arrived back in New York in December 1888, and was hired by Augustine Daly to play \"Charles the Wrestler\" in \"As You Like It\". He did so well in the role, Daly kept him on. Bosworth remained with Daly's company for ten years, in which he played mostly minor parts. Seven times while he was with the company they made foreign tours, playing in Berlin, Cologne, London, Paris and other European cities. Playing exclusively small parts eroded his confidence, and Bosworth left Daly to sign on with Julia Marlowe, who cast him in leads in Shakespearean plays.\n\nJust as Bosworth began to taste stage stardom in New York, he was stricken with tuberculosis, a disease often fatal in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Bosworth was forced to give up the stage, and he was not allowed to exert himself indoors. Though he made a rapid recovery, he returned to the stage too quickly and suffered a relapse. For the rest of his working life, he balanced his acting with periods of rest so as to keep his tuberculosis in remission.\n\nBosworth re-established himself as a lead actor on the New York stage, appearing in the 1903 Broadway revival of Henrik Ibsen's \"Hedda Gabler\". He also appeared that year on the Great White Way as the lead in \"Marta of the Lowlands\". This role propelled him to Broadway stardom. However, he was forced again to give up the stage when he lost seventy pounds in ten weeks due to his illness.\n\nBosworth moved to Tempe, Arizona, to partake of the climate to improve his health. Eventually, he got the disease under control again. While not severely handicapped, he was forced to remain in a warm climate lest he suffer a relapse. The disease robbed him of his voice as well, but there was a new medium for actors: silent films.\n\nBosworth moved to San Diego, and in 1908 he was contracted to make a motion picture by the Selig Polyscope Company. Shooting was to be done in the outdoors, and he did not have to use his voice, which was in poor condition. Bosworth once said, \"I believe, after all, that it is the motion pictures that have saved my life. How could I have lived on and on, without being able to carry out any of my cherished ambitions? What would my life have meant? Here, in pictures, I am realizing my biggest hopes.\" Signing with the Selig Polyscope Co., Hobart eventually convinced the movie company to move to Los Angeles. Bosworth is widely credited with being the star of the first movie made on the West Coast.\n\nDue to his role in pioneering the film industry in California, Bosworth often was referred to as the \"Dean of Hollywood\". He wrote the scenarios for the second and third pictures he acted in, and directed the third. According to his own count, he eventually wrote 112 scenarios and produced eighty-four pictures with Selig. Bosworth was attracted to Jack London's work due to his out-of-doors filming experience and the requirements of his health, which precluded acting in studios.\n\nIn 1913, he started his own company, Hobart Bosworth Productions Company, to produce a series of Jack London melodramas. He produced and directed the company's first picture, playing Wolf Larsen in \"The Sea Wolf\". London himself appeared as a sailor. The movie was released in the U.S. by The W.W. Hodkinson Corp. and States Right Independent Exchanges.\n\nD.W. Griffith also released a Jack London picture that year, \"Two Men of the Desert\", but Hobart followed up \"The Sea Wolf\" with \"The Chechako\". \"The Chechako\" and some other Bosworth-London pictures were distributed through Paramount Pictures.\n\nBosworth directed the follow-up, \"The Valley of the Moon\", in which he also had a supporting role as an actor. He also appeared as an actor in \"John Barleycorn\", which he co-directed with J. Charles Haydon. He produced, directed, wrote, and acted in \"Martin Eden\" and \"An Odyssey of the North\", playing the lead in the latter, which was released by Paramount. He finished up the series by producing, directing, and playing the lead in the two-part \"Burning Daylight\" series, \"The Adventures of Burning Daylight\". Both were released by Paramount.\n\nSoon Bosworth joined the Oliver Photography Company. Subsequently, Bosworth Inc. and Oliver Morosco Productions released a total of thirty-one pictures, most which starred Bosworth. The company ceased operations after producing \"The Sea Lion\".\n\nThe merger with Paramount ended the period in Bosworth's creative life where he was a major force in the motion picture industry, which was undergoing changes as the industry matured and solidified. He directed one other picture before the merger, \"The White Scar\", which he also wrote and starred in for the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. After his own production company closed, Hobart wound up playing supporting roles as an actor.\n\nHe divorced his first wife, Adele Farrington, in 1919. On 22 December 1920 he married Cecile Kibre, widow of G. Harold Percival, who had been art director at Ince Studio and who had died of influenza in 1918. Cecile Kibre had a son by Percival, named George, whom Hobart Bosworth later adopted as his son.\n\nBosworth survived motion pictures' transition to sound, or \"talkies\". Aside from appearing in Warner Brothers' showcase, \"The Show of Shows\" (1929), his talking debut proper was in the film short \"A Man in Peace\", for Vitaphone, while his first sound feature was Vitaphone's Ruritanian romance \"General Crack\", starring John Barrymore. Although he appeared in small roles in A-list films, Bosworth primarily made his living as a prominently billed character actor in B-Westerns and serials churned out by Poverty Row studios. In all his roles in A and B pictures, he usually was typecast in a fatherly role, as a clergyman, judge, grandparent, etc.\n\nHobart Bosworth died of pneumonia in Glendale, California, aged 76.\n\nHe was survived by his second wife, Cecile and his son George. He was entombed in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park with a private mausoleum.\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Bosworth received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. The star is located at 6522 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n"}
{"id": "13069334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13069334", "title": "Hotel Chevalier", "text": "Hotel Chevalier\n\nHotel Chevalier is an American-French short film written and directed by Wes Anderson and released in 2007. Starring Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman as former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a prologue to Anderson's 2007 feature \"The Darjeeling Limited\". It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. Its first showing was at the Venice Film Festival première of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at Apple Stores in four U.S. cities.\n\nThe day after the film's première, it was made freely available from the iTunes Store for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. The film garnered near universal critical acclaim from reviewers, who compared it favorably to \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and praised its richness, poignancy, and careful construction.\n\nIn a hotel lobby, the concierge answers a phone call from a guest's room. A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film \"Stalag 17\" and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room – pausing to play the opening bars of the song \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\" by Peter Sarstedt on his stereo system – and runs a bath.\nThe man is again lying on the bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before opening the door to a woman (Natalie Portman). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and presents the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it \"wasn't actually that hard\". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.\nStepping back into the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly \"what the fuck is going on?\" He motions to her to join him on the bed and at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing conversation that he has been living in the hotel room for \"more than a month\", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he \"will never be [her] friend\", but holds her when she embraces him. \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\" starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.\nThe woman is perched against an armoire, the man approaches and covers her naked body with the yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick from his pocket and hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.\n\nWes Anderson first approached Schwartzman and Portman about \"Hotel Chevalier\" in 2005. Schwartzman and Anderson had previously worked on \"Rushmore\" (1998), Anderson's cult second feature, and had been living together in Schwartzman's Paris apartment in the months leading up to the shoot. Portman was approached after the director obtained her email address from Scott Rudin, executive producer of 2004's \"Closer\" in which she starred. The actors appeared for free, and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself.\n\nIt was filmed at the Hôtel Raphael in Paris, on Avenue Kléber, two blocks south-southwest of the Arc de Triomphe. The Hôtel Raphael had previously been used as a setting for the films \"Love in Paris\" (1996) and \"Place Vendôme\" (1998). It was shot by a crew of 15 in Panavision and used props from Anderson's apartment. Filming took two and a half days, and editing (done on Anderson's computer) another week. Despite his use of a wardrobe from prestigious fashion designer Marc Jacobs and a handmade suitcase from Louis Vuitton, the director described the production as \"like making a student film\".\n\nAnderson initially intended it to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as \"The Darjeeling Limited\". \"Chevalier\" takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in \"Darjeeling\". The dialogue between the characters at the end of \"Chevalier\" is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers at the close of the feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed \"Darjeeling\", was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.\n\n\"Hotel Chevalier\" was screened as part of the program at the world première of \"The Darjeeling Limited\" at the 64th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2007. The short had its own première at Apple Stores in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Santa Monica, California, on September 25. Anderson, Schwartzman and Portman appeared at the New York screening in SoHo, after which they held a questions-and-answers session with the audience. The short was made available the following day as a free download from Apple's iTunes Store. On September 28, it preceded the showing of the feature on the opening night of the 2007 New York Film Festival. A press release posted before the première described the short as \"the brief coda to a doomed romance and the prologue to \"The Darjeeling Limited\"\".\n\nThe film was withdrawn from iTunes after having been available for download for a month. Although it had been dismissed by \"USA Today\" columnist Susan Wloszczyna before its iTunes release as an \"amuse-bouche\" that was \"destined to be a mere footnote\", it was downloaded nearly 500,000 times during its run, and received wide acclaim. Following its withdrawal from iTunes, the short was distributed in theaters as the prologue to the feature-length film. Although \"The New York Times\" reported in October 2007 that distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures intended to promote \"Chevalier\" as a competitor for the Best Live Action Short Film of the Academy Awards, it was not among that year's nominations. It was included as an extra feature on the \"Darjeeling\" 2008 DVD release, and Anderson's screenplay for the short was published in the Winter 2007 issue of the literary magazine \"\".\n\n\"Hotel Chevalier\" was one of the year's most discussed short films, and attracted considerable praise from film critics, who compared it favorably to \"The Darjeeling Limited\". Gary Susman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described it as \"an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough about these two characters\", adding that \"\"Chevalier\" sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here.\" Armond White of \"New York Press\" judged the short \"moving and genuinely contemporary\", citing its \"lost-girl poignancy\". The film drew some attention for Portman's extended nude scene, and for her character's bruised body. Portman expressed disappointment at this undue focus, saying \"[i]t really depressed me that half of every review ... was about the nudity\". The episode made the actress reconsider the wisdom of this aspect of her performance, and she subsequently swore off nude appearances in film.\n\nWhile \"The Darjeeling Limited\" did receive generally positive reviews—having attained a 68% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes—many of the champions of \"Hotel Chevalier\" tended to combine praise of \"Chevalier\" with subtle shots at \"Darjeeling\". Portman's performance was praised by \"TIME\" reviewer Richard Corliss, who declared her to be \"a comic actress in fresh bloom\" in the \"beguiling vignette\", and expressed his wish that her role in \"Darjeeling\" had been greater. The feature, he felt, lacked \"the feeling and wit of the short film\". Stephanie Zacharek of \"Salon\" concurred, stating that \"the untold story of \"Hotel Chevalier\" is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the one told outright in \", and calling the short \"very close to perfect\". \"The Guardian\" columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the \"genuine ardour\" that greeted the \"perfectly measured narrative\" of \"Chevalier\". He proposed that the constraints of the short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work. A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" hailed \"Chevalier\" as \"a small gem\" in comparison to the \"overstuffed suitcase\" of the feature, and wrote that \"It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson's vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry.\"\n\n"}

Herk (or Isadore, Izzy; 1882 – 5 July 1944) was a burlesque manager who played a major role in the evolution of this entertainment before World War II. His show at the Gaiety Theatre, closed in 1941, was the last burlesque show on Broadway.\n\nHerk was born around 1880.\nHerk's first job was treasurer of the Valentine Theatre in Toledo, Ohio.\nHe moved to Chicago and became the personal assistant of the producer Herman Fehr, head of the Empire burlesque circuit, or Western Wheel.\nIn 1913 the Eastern and Western wheels were consolidated into the Columbia Amusement Company, headed by Samuel Scribner and Isidore Herk. The combined operation put on fairly clean shows, as had the Eastern Wheel.\nDuring World War I (1914–18) Hirk staged burlesque shows for the Empire circuit such as \"Pacemakers\", which featured a game of strip poker played on stage.\nHowever, Herk was primarily a manager rather than a producer.\n\nIn May 1915 the Columbia circuit transferred its No. 2 circuit, the former Western wheel, which had forty theaters and thirty-four touring companies, to a new subsidiary corporation called the American Burlesque Association, or American wheel. Gus Hill was named president of the new entity.\nHerk was put in charge of the American wheel, set up to provide an illusion of competition.\nThe American wheel played raunchier shows than its owner, with runways, hootchy-kootchy dancers and risqué comedians.\nHerk pointed out that \"We're not producing Sunday school shows.\"\nThe American circuit faced competition from stock burlesque theaters like Minsky's Burlesque National Winter Garden, whose shows went farther than Columbia would allow, and had to close in 1922.\n\nHerk wanted to move into the more respectable vaudeville.\nIn April 1922 Herk left Columbia and joined with the Shubert Organization and E. Thomas Beatty to form the Affiliated Theatres Corporation, which would book Shubert Advanced Vaudeville. Faced with fierce competition from the B.F. Keith circuit, the Shuberts closed their vaudeville operation in February 1923.\nHerk was left bankrupt. \nHe moved to the newly formed Mutual burlesque circuit, then to the American circuit, and when that closed down back to the Mutual circuit.\nAt the Mutual Herk cut costs, paid low salaries and eliminated elaborate costumes and scenery.\nPerformers for the Mutual wheel became the first to expose their breasts.\n\"Billboard\" said the Mutual \"polluted public morals\". Herk said it was not musical comedy, but was the \"jazz of American entertainment.\"\nHerk claimed that these were \"clean working class entertainments\".\n\nThe Mutual grew fast.

He came to New Orleans from the French West Indies in the 1820s. One of his influences was Old Corn Meal, a street vendor who had gained fame as a singer and dancer at the St. Charles Theatre in 1837. By the 1820s, Butler had begun touring the Mississippi Valley performing music and clown acts. His fame grew so that by the 1850s he was known as far north as Cincinnati. In 1857, Butler participated in the first banjo tournament in the United States held at New York City's Chinese Hall, but due to inebriation, he only placed second. Butler is one of the first documented black entertainers to have influenced American popular music. He influenced blackface entertainers most directly. Circus performer George Nichols took his song \"Picayune Butler Is Going Away\" from him and claimed to have learned \"Jump Jim Crow\" from Butler.

It was founded in 2008 by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) to challenge the prohibition on places of worship from endorsing political candidates. According to \"The New York Times\", ADF's campaign has become \"perhaps its most aggressive effort.\"\n\nIn 1954 then Senator Lyndon B. Johnson was running for re-election to the U.S. Senate. In order to neutralize opposition from two nonprofit groups who accused him of being a communist, Johnson introduced an amendment to the Internal Revenue Service code–the Johnson Amendment–which prohibited non-profit groups from endorsing political candidates. This legislation had far reaching effects not only on non-profits, but churches, synagogues, and other houses of worship. Before enactment of the Johnson Amendment, religious leaders were free to endorse or oppose candidates for office. Churches registered as 501(c)(3) organizations under the tax code are subject to revocation of their tax-exempt status should the IRS rule that they violated the political speech prohibition.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom opposes the Johnson Amendment. Its position is explained: \"Churches are not tax-exempt because of some bargain they make with the government. Being tax-exempt is part of freedom of religion; otherwise the government could tax churches out of existence. Now the government is telling churches you can be tax-exempt if you don't speak out on a certain topic\".\n\nIn 2017 the Free Speech Fairness Act was introduced in the United States House of Representatives. The legislation proposes to permit political speech in churches. ADF supports passage of the bill.\n\nIn 2008 ADF launched Pulpit Freedom Sunday with 35 churches—including several mega-churches–to directly challenge the Johnson Amendment. In acts of civil disobedience, pastors give sermons on \"blatantly political\" topics, which may include providing \"biblical perspectives\" on or endorsements of particular candidates, in defiance of IRS regulations and in hopes of triggering a First Amendment court challenge to the provisions. The 2008 event included Minnesota reverend Gus Booth, who encouraged his congregation to vote in the 2008 United States presidential election for Senator John McCain, and prohibited them from voting for Senator Barack Obama because of his position on abortion.\n\nBy 2014 participation in the event had grown to over 1,800 pastors. That brought total participation since 2008 to more than 3,800 pastors. At the same time the IRS indicated that it would ramp up enforcement of the prohibition against candidate endorsement at churches.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7043646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7043646", "title": "Quantum game theory", "text": "Quantum game theory\n\nQuantum game theory is an extension of classical game theory to the quantum domain. It differs from classical game theory in three primary ways:\n\nThis theory is based on the physics of information much like quantum computing.\n\nThe information transfer that occurs during a game can be viewed as a physical process.\nIn the simplest case of a classical game between two players with two strategies each, both the players can use a bit (a '0' or a '1') to convey their choice of strategy. A popular example of such a game is the prisoners' dilemma, where each of the convicts can either \"cooperate\" or \"defect\": withholding knowledge or revealing that the other committed the crime. In the quantum version of the game, the bit is replaced by the qubit, which is a quantum superposition of two or more base states. In the case of a two-strategy game this can be physically implemented by the use of an entity like the electron which has a superposed spin state, with the base states being +1/2 (plus half) and −1/2 (minus half). Each of the spin states can be used to represent each of the two strategies available to the players. When a measurement is made on the electron, it collapses to one of the base states, thus conveying the strategy used by the player.\n\nThe set of qubits which are initially provided to each of the players (to be used to convey their choice of strategy) may be entangled. For instance, an entangled pair of qubits implies that an operation performed on one of the qubits, affects the other qubit as well, thus altering the expected pay-offs of the game.\n\nThe job of a player in a game is to choose a strategy. In terms of bits this means that the player has to choose between 'flipping' the bit to its opposite state or leaving its current state untouched. When extended to the quantum domain this implies that the player can \"rotate\" the qubit to a new state, thus changing the probability amplitudes of each of the base states. Such operations on the qubits are required to be unitary transformations on the initial state of the qubit. This is different from the classical procedure which chooses the strategies with some statistical probabilities.\n\nIntroducing quantum information into multiplayer games allows a new type of \"equilibrium strategy\" which is not found in traditional games. The entanglement of players' choices can have the effect of a \"contract\" by preventing players from profiting from other player's betrayal. \n\nThe concepts of a quantum player, a zero-sum quantum game and the associated expected payoff were defined by A. Boukas within the framework of the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators on finite dimensional quantum probability spaces. Quantum versions of Von Neumann's Minimax Theorem were proved.\n\n\n\n"}

Her hoarse voice charged with melancholy and strong personality made her a Sicilian icon of the twentieth century, much like the writer Leonardo Sciascia, the poet Ignazio Buttitta and the painter Renato Guttuso, who counted all three among her admirers.\n\nRosa Balistreri was born in Licata, a town in the province of Agrigento, in western declined Sicily, in the late 1920s. Her father was an alcoholic carpenter and Rosa was forced to do menial jobs, instead of going to school. In 1951, after experiencing the Sicily of Leonardo Sciascia's \"Candido\", Rosa left her village at the age of 24 for Tuscany, settling in Florence, where she worked as a domestic servant. Uprooted from her native land, she started her artistic career at 39, through Dario Fo who made her star in one of his shows, \"Ci ragiono e canto\". Rosa recorded her first two albums the following year, in 1967, and performed at Teatro Carignano in Turin, at Teatro Manzoni in Milan and at Teatro Metastasio in Prato. In 1971, now renowned Rosa Balistreri returned after twenty years in Sicily, where she would sing until her death. Often composed in dramatic style, her songs depict Sicily, as her friend Leonardo Sciascia describes, as \"violent, tender, bitter, sweet, full of ambiguities\". The \"Soprano of the South\", as Ignazio Buttitta nicknamed her, related the misfortunes but also the beauties and mysteries of the three-pointed island. She also embodied, as her friends Amalia Rodrigues, Renato Guttuso and Leonardo Sciascia, a generation of artists joining the communist ideology.\n\nRosa Balistreri died in Palermo in 1990 at the age of 63, but her work survives and is modernized through the interpretations of Serena Rispoli, Carmen Consoli, and especially Etta Scollo who, accompanied by the Sicilian Symphony Orchestra, performs her most iconic songs, such as \"'U cunigghiu\", \"I pirati a Palermu\" or \"Cu ti lu dissi\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3659597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3659597", "title": "Shaken, not stirred", "text": "Shaken, not stirred\n\n\"Shaken, not stirred\" is a catchphrase of Ian Fleming's fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond and describes his preference for the preparation of his martini cocktails.\n\nThe phrase first appears in the novel \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1956), though Bond himself does not actually say it until \"Dr. No\" (1958), where his exact words are \"shaken and not stirred.\" In the film adaptations of Fleming's novels, the phrase is first uttered by the villain, Dr. Julius No, when he offers the drink in \"Dr. No\" (1962), and it is not uttered by Bond himself (played by Sean Connery) until \"Goldfinger\" (1964). It is used in numerous Bond films thereafter with the notable exceptions of \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967), in which the drink is wrongly offered as \"stirred, not shaken\", to Bond's response \"that's right\", and \"Casino Royale\" (2006) in which Bond, after losing millions of dollars in a game of poker, is asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred and snaps, \"Do I look like I give a damn?\"\n\nThe earliest form of the \"shaken, not stirred\" motif appears in the first Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\" (1953). After meeting his CIA contact Felix Leiter for the first time, Bond orders a drink from a barman while at the casino.\n\nThe drink will later be referred to as a \"Vesper\", after the original Bond girl, Vesper Lynd. A Vesper differs from Bond's usual cocktail of choice, the martini, in that it uses both gin and vodka, Kina Lillet instead of vermouth, and lemon peel instead of an olive. In the same scene Bond gives more details about the Vesper, telling the same barman that vodka made from grain instead of potatoes makes the drink even better. Kina Lillet is no longer available, but can be approximated by using the sweeter Lillet Blanc along with a dash of Angostura Bitters. Another Kina (or quinine) apertif which has the bite and approximate flavour is Cocchi Americano. Russian and Polish vodkas were also always preferred by Bond if they were in stock. Although there is a lot of discussion on the Vesper, it is only ordered once throughout Fleming's novels and by later books Bond is ordering regular vodka martinis, though he also drinks regular gin martinis. In total, Bond orders 19 vodka martinis and 16 gin martinis throughout Fleming's novels and short stories.\n\nThe American Film Institute honoured \"Goldfinger\" and the phrase on 21 July 2005 by ranking it #90 on a list of best movie quotes in the past 100 years of film.\n\nThe shaken Martini is mentioned twice in the first Bond film \"Dr. No\" (1962). When Bond has presumably ordered a drink from room service to his hotel room, it is mixed by a waiter, who says \"one medium dry vodka martini mixed like you said, sir, but not stirred.\" (A slice of lime was in the bottom of the glass.) Later, Dr. No presents Bond with a drink – \"A medium dry martini, lemon peel. Shaken, not stirred.\"\n\nBond did not vocally order one himself until \"Goldfinger\" (1964). In the 1967 film \"You Only Live Twice,\" Bond's contact Henderson prepares a martini for Bond and says, \"That's, um, stirred not shaken. That was right, wasn't it?\" To which Bond replies politely, \"Perfect.\"\n\nIn George Lazenby's only film as Bond, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\" Bond never actually orders himself a drink, but when he meets Marc-Ange Draco for the first time, Draco tells his assistant, Olympe, to get a dry martini for Bond. Draco then adds, \"Shaken, not stirred.\"\n\nRoger Moore's Bond never actually ordered one himself, but has one ordered for him several times, nonetheless. In the 1977 film \"The Spy Who Loved Me,\" Anya Amasova orders him one. In \"Moonraker,\" his drink is prepared by Manuela. In \"Octopussy,\" the title character (Maud Adams) herself greets Bond by mixing his drink.\n\nTimothy Dalton's Bond ordered his trademark Martini in each of his films. In \"The Living Daylights\" he and Kara arrive in Austria where he orders a martini \"Shaken, not stirred\" shortly after entering their hotel. For his second film, \"Licence to Kill\" he doesn't directly order it. Instead, he tells Pam Bouvier what drink he'd like as he plays Blackjack, only to end up disappearing shortly after, leaving Bouvier to down the entire martini in one long gulp.\n\nIn \"GoldenEye\", Bond orders the drink in a casino while talking with Xenia Onatopp, and later, Zukovsky refers to Bond as a \"charming, sophisticated secret agent. Shaken, but not stirred.\" In \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", Paris Carver orders the drink for Bond after the two meet again after years apart. While Paris' choice of drink had changed, Bond's had not. In \"The World Is Not Enough\", Bond orders the drink in Zukovsky's casino. In \"Die Another Day\", Bond is coming back on a rather turbulent British Airways flight. The air hostess (played by Roger Moore's daughter Deborah) serves him his martini, to which Bond replies, \"Luckily I asked for it shaken.\". Later in the film, when Bond travels to Gustav Graves' ice palace in Iceland, he orders another martini, sarcastically telling the bartender \"Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.\"\n\nThe Vesper was reused in the 2006 film version of \"Casino Royale\", while Bond is playing poker to defeat Le Chiffre. Daniel Craig's Bond ordered the drink, providing great detail about how it should be prepared. The other poker players order the Vesper as well, with Felix Leiter telling the bartender to \"Keep the fruit\" with his. Later, after Bond loses money to Le Chiffre, he orders another martini, but when the barman asks whether he would like it shaken or stirred, Bond snaps, \"Do I look like I give a damn?\"\n\nIn \"Quantum of Solace\", the bartender on an aeroplane gives the precise recipe for the Vesper from Fleming's novel \"Casino Royale\", which was a minor anachronism since Kina Lillet was reformulated (removing the Kina) in 1986, 22 years before the film's production. Bond is purported to have drunk six of them.\n\nIn \"Skyfall\", when talking to Bond girl Sévérine at a casino bar, the bartender is seen shaking Bond's martini before pouring it, to which Bond comments \"perfect\".\n\nIn \"Spectre\", Bond orders his signature drink in a mountaintop resort, only to be told to his disdain that he is at a health clinic and that the bar does not serve alcohol. Q instead orders Bond an unpleasant-looking green-coloured 'prolytic digestive enzyme shake', and a disgusted Bond asks the barman \"Do me a favor, will you? Throw that down the toilet. Cut out the middleman.\"\n\nScientists, specifically biochemists, and martini connoisseurs have investigated the difference between a martini shaken and a martini stirred. The Department of Biochemistry at the University of Western Ontario in Canada conducted a study to determine if the preparation of a martini has an influence on their antioxidant capacity; the study found that the shaken gin martinis were able to break down hydrogen peroxide and leave only 0.072% of the peroxide behind, versus the stirred gin martini, which left behind 0.157% of the peroxide. Thus a shaken martini has more antioxidants than a stirred one. The study was done at the time because moderate consumption of alcohol appears to reduce the risk of cataracts, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.\n\nAndrew Lycett, an Ian Fleming biographer, believed that Fleming liked his martinis shaken, not stirred, because Fleming thought that stirring a drink diminished its flavour. Lycett also noted that Fleming preferred gin and vermouth for his martini. It has also been said that Fleming was a fan of martinis shaken by Hans Schröder, a German bartender.\n\nHarry Craddock's \"Savoy Cocktail Book\" (1930) prescribes shaking for all its martini recipes. However, many bartenders insist that any cocktail that involves nothing but transparent ingredients—such as martinis, manhattans, and negronis—must be stirred in order to maintain clarity and texture. Shaking a drink is quite violent and necessarily introduces air bubbles into the mix. This results in a cloudy appearance and a somewhat different texture on the tongue when compared with a stirred drink. However, when any of the ingredients are opaque (such as citrus juices, dairy, or eggs), aesthetically pleasing clarity and texture are not as much of an issue. Furthermore, studies have shown that, while techniques and type of ice used to play a role in the final effect of chilling and diluting a drink, both shaking and stirring can result in chilling the drink with equal effectiveness; stirring takes longer. However, shaking is much faster, and bartenders do not stir long enough to reach the matching temperature and dilution. In essence, then, James Bond does not seem to care that his martini will be ugly upon presentation, or he might prefer the \"shaken\" version for its texture, or for its lower alcohol by volume.\n\nSome connoisseurs believe that shaking gin is a faux pas, supposedly because the shaking \"bruises\" the gin (a term referring to a slight bitter taste that can allegedly occur when gin is shaken). In Fleming's novel \"Casino Royale\", it is stated that Bond \"watched as the deep glass became frosted with the pale golden drink, slightly aerated by the bruising of the shaker,\" suggesting that Bond was requesting it shaken because of the vodka it contained. Prior to the 1960s, vodka was, for the most part, refined from potatoes (usually cheaper brands). This element made the vodka oily. To disperse the oil, Bond ordered his martinis shaken; thus, in the same scene where he orders the martini, he tells the barman about how vodka made from grain rather than potatoes makes his drink even better. Shaking is also said to dissolve the vermouth better, making it less oily tasting.\n\nWhile properly called a \"Bradford\", a shaken martini also appears cloudier than when stirred. This is caused by the small fragments of ice present in a shaken martini. This also brings into question the movie versions, which are never cloudy.\n\nIn \"Stirred,\" an episode of \"The West Wing\", President Josiah Bartlet disagrees with Bond in a conversation with his aide Charlie Young:\n\nA general study of Bond’s consumption of alcohol in the series of novels by Fleming was published by three scientists.\n\nBond's drinking habits mirror those of his creator, Ian Fleming. Fleming, as well as Bond throughout the novels, had a preference for bourbon whiskey. Fleming himself had had a fondness for gin, drinking as much as a bottle a day; however, he was converted to bourbon at the behest of his doctor who informed him of his failing health.\n\nOtherwise, in the films James Bond normally has a fondness for vodka that is accompanied by product placement for a brand. For instance, Smirnoff was clearly shown in 1997's \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", in which Bond sits drinking a bottle while in his hotel room in Hamburg. Other brands featured in the films have included Absolut Vodka, Stolichnaya and Finlandia. In the film \"GoldenEye\", Bond suggests cognac when offered a drink by M, who gives him bourbon instead, as it is her preference. The whiskey poured is in fact Jack Daniel's, which markets itself as a Tennessee Whiskey, which is legally a sub-category of bourbon – often distinguished from bourbon itself.\n\nIn \"Goldfinger\", Bond drinks a mint julep at Auric Goldfinger's Kentucky stud farm, and in \"Thunderball\", Largo gives Bond a Rum Collins. Bond is also seen in \"Quantum of Solace\" drinking bottled beer when meeting with Felix Leiter in a Bolivian bar. In \"Die Another Day\", Bond drinks a mojito. In \"Casino Royale\", Bond orders Mount Gay Rum with soda. In that film, he also invents the famous \"Vesper\" cocktail—a variation on a martini—originally included in the novel but not seen in the films until the reboot. In \"Skyfall\", the villain Raoul Silva says he believes 50-year-old Macallan single malt whisky to be one of Bond's favourites.\n\nAlso in \"Goldfinger\" during a briefing on the villain, their host offers a refill with, \"Have a little more of this rather disappointing brandy.\"\n\nM replies, \"Why, what is the matter with it?\"\n\nBond replies, \"I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine [as in Fine brandy] indifferently blended, Sir... with an overdose of Bon bois.\" Bon bois is a Cognac region known for its poor soils. It is a low quality Cognac, and Bond is saying that too much of this was used in the blend.\n\nIn the novel \"Moonraker\", it is noted in the card club Blades, Bond adds a single pinch of black pepper to his glass of fine Wolfschmidt vodka, much to M's consternation, to which Bond says he got into the habit in joints that served villainous home brew. It sinks all the poisons to the bottom, and Bond got to like the taste. However, he does admit that he should not have insulted the Club Wolfschmidt.\n\nIn several of the Bond films, he is known to prefer Bollinger and Dom Pérignon champagne.\nNever primarily a red wine drinker, Bond tended to favour Château Mouton Rothschild; a 1947 vintage in \"Goldfinger\", and half a bottle \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", a 1934 ordered by M in \"Moonraker\", and a '55 in \"Diamonds are Forever\"—where Bond unveiled the assassin Wint posing as a waiter because the latter didn't know that Mouton-Rothschild is a claret. In the Jeffery Deaver novel \"Carte Blanche\", Bond expresses a knowledge and appreciation of South African wine.\n\nIn the film of \"Diamonds Are Forever\", Bond savours a glass of sherry and fools M into thinking Bond has made a mistake when he pronounces a year of make (\"'51\"). When Bond is informed that sherry has no vintage, he replies (to a non-plussed M) that he was discerning the vintage of the wine on which the sherry is based – 1851.\n\nIn the film \"You Only Live Twice\", Bond opts for sake over his usual martini, indicating that he especially likes it when it's served at what he says is the correct temperature of . Tiger, his host, is impressed and tells Bond he is exceptionally cultured—for a European. In \"Licence to Kill\" when in the dive bar called Barrelhead Bar, he orders the same as his contact, Pam Bouvier, a \"Bud with a lime.\"\n\nAside from alcoholic beverages, Bond is a coffee drinker and eschews tea with a passion, believing it to have been a factor in the fall of the British Empire and referring to it as \"a cup of mud\" (in Fleming's \"Goldfinger\"). In the novel \"Live and Let Die\", he expresses his fondness for Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee – while in the film adaptation he is shown operating a La Pavoni Europiccola lever coffee machine in the kitchen of his flat. In the Fleming novel of \"From Russia With Love\" he is shown to own a Chemex Coffeemaker and prefers his coffee brewed that way, while in the film version he orders coffee \"very black\" for breakfast from his hotel's room service; in Kerim Bey's office he asks for his coffee \"medium sweet\" when offered. He also accepts a cup, refusing cream or sugar, from Franz Sanchez in \"Licence to Kill\" – whereas in \"Moonraker\" he refuses a cup of tea offered by Hugo Drax. In \"The Living Daylights\", Bond tastes a cup of café coffee he is served in the Prater Amusement Park, Vienna, making a face when it is not up to his standards.\n\n\n"}

The company has produced and marketed audio recordings, films, TV specials and music videos. It is periodically active as a record company releasing its own audio productions and acquisitions.\n\nThe record division of Springtime! was launched in 1981 as a label distributed in the UK by Island Records and in the US/Canada by Island/Warner Bros. Records.\n\nThe label is primarily focused on both newly recorded and historic comedy material. It has distributed recordings by the Portsmouth Sinfonia, alternative comedians such as Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall, Ade Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Peter Richardson and French and Saunders of \"The Comic Strip\", the historic \"Private Eye\" recordings. Springtime recorded and released Alexei Sayle's first album \"Cak!\" in 1982. 'The label's most successful humour release has been the comedy album of Amnesty International's, 1981 benefit show \"The Secret Policeman's Other Ball\" which featured John Cleese and Graham Chapman of Monty Python, Rowan Atkinson, Barry Humphries, Billy Connolly, Jasper Carrott, John Bird, John Fortune, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Griff Rhys Jones, Alexei Sayle and Neil Innes.\n\nIn addition to the release of the comedy album of Amnesty's 1981 show, the label also released the music album of that show which became a major chart success in the UK and the US. The album featured Sting, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Phil Collins, Bob Geldof and Donovan.\n\n\"The Comic Strip\" album achieved some attention owing to the strong language used by the performers, which prompted the label to place a parental advisory sticker on the front cover. It also attracted attention because of its long duration – with a total running time of over 69 minutes on a single 12\" disc – considerably longer than the customary 40 minutes per album. \n\nThe label was dormant for several years and then in the early 1990s released a series of albums distributed in the UK by Castle Communications which included reissues of previous successes such as \"The Comic Strip Album\" and the first-ever releases of extended two-volume editions of two of Amnesty's comedy galas 1976's \"A Poke in the Eye\" and 1981's \"The Secret Policeman's Other Ball\". In the USA, Springtime produced and distributed with Rhino Records a British comedy compilation titled \"Dead Parrot Society\".\n\nIn the late 1990s, Springtime albums were distributed by Music Collection International and releases included three volumes of \"Private Eye\" recordings including the first-ever release of Private Eye's notorious album \"Ho-Ho Very Satirical!\" recorded in 1971 but refused release at the time by all major record companies because of its controversial content.\n\nSpringtime produced music videos for comedy records such as Alexei Sayle's \"Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?\" (1982), the Comic Strip's \"Pop-Up Toasters\" (1981) and the Portsmouth Sinfonia's \"Classical Muddly\" (1981). In 1984/1985 the company's Martin Lewis produced four music videos featuring Julian Lennon: \"Too Late For Goodbyes\" and \"Valotte\" (both directed by Sam Peckinpah); \"Jesse\" and \"Stand By Me\".

The ensuing scandal was one of the several causes of the fall of the Republican government and the polarization of the parliament, which finally led to the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).\n\nThe name had its origin in the names of the Dutch partners, one of whom was Daniel Strauss, but sources differ on the exact name or names of the others. Some sources say that there was just another , called Jules Perel. Others state that there was a third female partner, Lowann, the wife of Strauss, but Paul Preston holds Perlowitz as the second partner. According to other sources, the name was in reference to the roulette machines (extra pearl).\n\nIn 1934, Rafael Salazar Alonso was the conservative Minister of Interior in Spain. He was one of several prominent Radical Party figures to accept bribes in order to legalize the fixed roulette. He received a gold watch and 100,000 pesetas (£35,000 at present values). Other high-ranking officials in his Ministry also accepted them.\n\nStill, Salazar Alonso considered it too little, demanded more, and eventually arrangimed a police raid into the Grand Casino Kursaal of San Sebastián on the inauguration day. To get back at him, the inventors leaked documents on the matter to President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora. A complementary version notes that since they had invested a lot of money in the venture, they tried to recover it by blackmailing Prime Minister, Alejandro Lerroux whose nephew was involved in the scheme and influence peddling.\n\nLerroux refused to get involved, and Strauss denounced the affair to President Alcalá-Zamora, who made it public. The matter was debated at the Spanish Cortes in October 1935, which exonerated Salazar Alonso 140-137, with the help of CEDA. José Antonio Primo de Rivera went on to shout, \"Long live the Straperlo!\" However, the Radical Party was doomed and Salazar Alonso's reputation was over although hd hung onto his position as mayor of Madrid.\n\nThe reaction of the parties in the opposition caused the fall of Lerroux and his Radical Republican Party government. The new elections were won by the Popular Front and supported by the Spanish Communist Party, amid great instability. It ultimately resulted in the \"coup d'état\" promulgated by General Francisco Franco's Nationalists in July 1936.\n\nAfter the scandal, especially after the Spanish Civil War, the word was incorporated as \"estraperlo\" into the Spanish language with the meaning of any scheme which is illegal or corrupt, particularly smuggling.\n\n\n"}

Established by the brothers Tan Khoen Yauw and Tan Khoen Hian on 1 September 1929, its films were mostly targeted at native ethnic groups. Starting with \"Njai Dasima\" in 1929, the company released fifteen films before ultimately being dissolved after the Japanese occupation. The Tans and the Wong brothers established Tan & Wong Bros in 1948 to continue this work.\n\nTan's Film Company was established by Tan Khoen Yauw and his brother Tan Khoen Hian on 1 September 1929. It was one of three studios established in the Dutch East Indies that year, together with Nansing Film Corporation and another Chinese-owned studio. Tan's established a large studio building on Defensielijn v.d. Bosch (now Bungur Besar Raya Street). It had several divisions, including costuming, filming, and decor.\n\nThe Tans, who had been raised in Kwitang, Batavia (modern day Jakarta) and grown up in close interaction with native ethnic groups, targeted the studio's at lower-class viewers, mostly native. This was accomplished through adapting Malay \"tonil\" (stage plays) which had been proven successful. Tan's was not the first studio with this target audience, as G. Kruger's Krugers Filmbedrijf had previously released \"Eulis Atjih\" (1927) with native audiences in mind.\n\nTan's Film released their first film, the silent \"Njai Dasima\", in November 1929. The work was an adaptation of the 1896 novel \"Tjerita Njai Dasima\" (\"Story of Njai Dasima\"), written by G. Francis, which had previously been made into a \"tonil\". It was a commercial success, to the point that the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that a cinema could make up several days losses with a single showing of the film. \"Njai Dasima\" was followed by two further adaptations of \"tonils\", the action film \"Si Ronda\" and the romance \"Melati van Agam\" (\"Jasmine of Agam\"), as well as the second part to the story, also entitled \"Njai Dasima\", and sequel \"Nancy Bikin Pembalesan\", in 1930. The two \"Njai Dasima\" continuations and \"Melati van Java\" were commercial successes.\n\nOwing to rising production costs, Tan's closed shop after the production of a talkie version of \"Njai Dasima\" in 1932. This version had Kruger as its cameraman and Bachtiar Effendi as director; another of Kruger's films, \"Huwen op Bevel\" (\"Forced to Marry\"; 1932) had been released by Tan's after Kruger ran out of funds.\n\nIn 1938 Tan Khoen Hian joined with the American-born Chinese directors Othniel and Joshua Wong to establish a reincarnation of Tan's Film, entitled Tan's Film Coy. Tan served primarily as a financial backer, while the Wong brothers handled day-to-day matters. The new Tan's Film's first production, \"Fatima\" (1938), followed closely behind the highly successful \"Terang Boelan\", released by the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat, or ANIF) in 1937, and used many of the same aspects; this included the same screenwriter, the same stars, and the same musicians. Roekiah, the female lead of \"Terang Boelan\", was given a 150 gulden monthly fee, with another 50 gulden for her husband; this was twice as much as ANIF had paid her. \"Fatima\" was very successful, earning 200,000 gulden on a 7,000 gulden investment. In 1939 Tan's Film released \"Gagak Item\" (\"Black Raven\"); the story, still based in part on that of \"Terang Boelan\", featured a Zorro-like character called the Black Raven. The following April they released \"Siti Akbari\", also influenced by \"Terang Boelan\". Both later films were successes, although not as much as \"Fatima\".\n\nBy 1940 Tan's Film was one of six film studios in the Indies; the establishment of new studios, inspired in part by the success of \"Fatima\", continued into 1941. Under this pressure, especially that from Java Industrial Film Coy., the performance of Tan's Film's releases began to suffer. Joshua Wong began working with Oriental Film, and Rd. Mochtar – the leading male actor for Tan's Film since \"Fatima\" – left over a wage dispute. The screenwriter Saeroen also left the company in 1940. Production slowed drastically, to two releases a year.\n\nAfter the commercial successes \"Roekihati\" and \"Sorga Ka Toedjoe\" (\"Seventh Heven\") were released in 1940, Tan's released \"Koeda Sembrani\" (\"The Enchanted Horse\"), which used a massive and expensive palace set. The following year Tan's released \"Poesaka Terpendam\" (\"Buried Treasure\") and produced \"Aladin dengan Lampu Wasiat\" (\"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\"), the latter of which reused the palace set. However, the Japanese occupation of the Indies beginning in early 1942 led to Tan's Film being shut down; \"Aladin dengan Lampu Wasiat\" would only be released in 1950, after the occupation and national revolution. In 1948 the Tan and Wong brothers would join together to establish Tan & Wong Bros.\n\nThe following list of films released by both incarnations of Tan's Film is derived from \n\n"}

Instead of maiming each other, Itchy and Scratchy decide to settle their beef on the miniature golf course.\" They added, however, that \"Despite the fact that it didn't make sense, the game's not too bad. You play as Scratchy and you have to drive your golf ball across a sidescrolling level and avoid being beat on by Itchy. It's certainly better than \"\", but that's not saying much.\"\n\nIn a 1995 review of \"Miniature Golf Madness\" and \"The Itchy & Scratchy Game\" (1994, Game Gear, SNES), and SNES Classic Edition Jeff Kapalka of the \"Syracuse Herald-American\" wrote that \"Miniature Golf Madness\" has \"all the pointless violence and mayhem that's in [\"The Itchy & Scratchy Game\"], but there's also the actual golf game that you have to survive. (The golf game is pretty neat, in and of itself. Throw in the aspect of sudden death - literally - and you've got an exciting, funny cart.)\" He also commented on the look of the game: \"Playing on a regular Game Boy, the graphics are, of course, not as spiffy as on the Game Gear. But then again, there's nowhere near the amount of flicker, either. Scratchy's 'deaths' are pretty spectacular, nonetheless. I was able to get through a few rounds on the Super Game Boy, and the default colors were quite nice. (No custom border on the screen, though. Sigh.) Still, I'm hoping that Acclaim eventually manages to port this game over to the Game Gear.\" Kapalka gave the game 2.5/4 stars.\n"}
{"id": "26452676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26452676", "title": "The Woman in Black (play)", "text": "The Woman in Black (play)\n\nThe Woman in Black is a 1987 stage play, adapted by Stephen Mallatratt. The play is based on the book of the same name, which was published in 1983 by English author Susan Hill. The play is currently being produced by PW Productions, led by Peter Wilson. It is notable for only having two actors perform the whole play. It was first performed at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, in 1987. The production opened in London's West End in 1989 and is still being performed there, becoming the second longest-running non-musical play in West End history, after \"The Mousetrap\".\n\nThe book follows the story of Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor, as he journeys to the small market town of Crythin Gifford to attend the funeral of a client, Mrs Alice Drablow. At the funeral, he sees a young woman with a wasted face, dressed all in black, standing in the churchyard.\n\nBemused by the villagers' reluctance to speak of the woman in black, Arthur goes to Eel Marsh House, Mrs. Drablow's former abode, an old building in the middle of a marsh, which is cut off from the mainland at high tide. Sorting through Mrs Drablow's papers, he finds a box of letters, and ultimately discovers the dreadful secret of the Woman in Black – to his own terrible cost.\n\nThe plot remains faithful to Hill's book, but adds an extra dimension of a play within a play.\n\nThe play opens in an empty Victorian theatre, where an old Arthur Kipps is reading aloud from a manuscript of his story. A young actor whom he hired to help dramatise the story, enters and criticises him for his poor delivery. After an argument, they agree to perform the story, with the Actor playing a younger Kipps, and Kipps himself playing all the other characters and narrating the play. When they run through the play, however, things begin to go terribly wrong.\n\nYoung Kipps learns of the death of the elderly and reclusive widow Mrs Drablow. He travels to Crythin Gifford to sort through her private papers. On the train, he meets a local landowner, Mr Samuel Daily, who tells him a little about Mrs Drablow. Upon their arrival at Crythin, Mr Daily drops off Arthur at the local inn where he is to stay the night.\n\nThe next morning, young Arthur meets with a local man enlisted to help him, Mr Horatio Jerome. They go to Mrs Drablow's funeral together, where Arthur first sees the Woman in Black. At first feeling sorry for the young woman, who was apparently suffering from some dreadful wasting disease, he asks Mr Jerome who she is. Mr Jerome is visibly terrified and hurries Arthur away from the church, insisting that there was no woman.\n\nAfter their return to the inn, Mr Jerome recovers somewhat, and says that a local man will arrive presently to escort Arthur to Mrs Drablow's house.\n\nThe local man, a villager named Keckwick, arrives a few moments later. To Arthur's delight, Keckwick drives Arthur in an old-fashioned pony and trap out to the house. Arthur spends the day sorting through Mrs Drablow's papers, and is amazed to find out how many there are. He also finds an old cemetery outside the house, where he again encounters the Woman in Black. Later that day, a thick fog settles on the marsh, cutting Arthur off from the mainland. He tries to return across the causeway on foot in the fog, but quickly becomes lost and is forced to retrace his steps to Eel Marsh House. Before he gets there, he hears the sound of a pony and trap on the causeway. Assuming that it is Keckwick returning, he turns back into the fog. It soon becomes apparent that the pony and trap are in trouble, and he hears it drive off the causeway onto the marsh. Arthur listens helplessly as the pony and trap get stuck in the mire and its occupants, including a young child, are drowned. Arthur returns to the house in a state of shock. Whilst he is exploring the house, he discovers a locked door. Due to his emotional state, he becomes distressed when he is unable to open it. He is surprised when Keckwick returns a few hours later.\n\nAct I ends with a monologue from old Arthur in which he explains that he is sure, although he does not know how, that the sounds he heard were from neither Keckwick nor any living thing, but from things that are dead.\n\nArthur seeks the help of Mr Jerome, either to accompany him back to Eel Marsh House or to send him someone else to help. Mr Jerome becomes profoundly terrified, and insists that nobody in the village would willingly accompany him to the house. Arthur later meets Sam Daily and tells him of his experiences. Sam is concerned and invites Arthur to his house, where he gives Arthur his dog, Spider, as a companion. (The dog, though real within the plot, is imaginary and is not portrayed by either actor.)\n\nReturning to Eel Marsh House, Arthur finds that the locked room is a child's nursery, abandoned but in perfect condition. Later that night, he hears a knocking sound in the nursery. He and Spider investigate. The nursery has been ransacked, and in one of the play's most iconic scenes, Arthur sees an empty rocking chair rocking back and forth as if somebody had just left it. Arthur fearfully returns to his bedroom.\n\nThe next day Arthur finds correspondence from almost sixty years ago, between Mrs Drablow and a mysterious woman who is apparently her sister. The woman, Jennet Humfrye, unmarried and with child, was sent away by her family. A son was born to her in Scotland, and her family immediately pressured her to give him up for adoption. Despite her strong resistance, Jennet ultimately relented and gave the child to Mrs Drablow and her husband.\n\nUnable to bear being parted from her son, Jennet returned to Crythin Gifford after a time and stayed with her sister. She was allowed to see her son provided that she never reveal her true relationship to him. The child became attached to Jennet. She planned to run away with him, but before she could manage it, a tragic event occurred.\n\nThe child, his nursemaid, and his dog went out onto the marsh one day in a pony and trap driven by Keckwick's father. A fog suddenly descended upon the marsh and they became lost. Riding blindly, they became stuck in the quicksand, and all were drowned. Jennet, driven mad by grief, contracted a terrible wasting disease and died several years later. Immediately after her death, she returned as the Woman in Black.\n\nArthur suddenly becomes subject to a series of terrifying events in Eel Marsh House, and eventually collapses on the marsh when trying to rescue Spider. He is found and taken back to Crythin by Sam Daily, who assures him that Spider is all right. He tells Arthur the story of the Woman, and explains that many of the local people he has met (Jerome, Keckwick and Daily himself) have all lost a child after seeing her.\n\nKipps returns to London and marries his fiancée, Stella. At a country fair, Stella and their infant son Joseph go for a ride on a pony and trap. Arthur sees the Woman in Black. Joseph is thrown out of the trap,and hits a tree,killing him instantly. Stella then dies 10 months later due to injuries.(This scene is depicted through recorded sound and narration.)\n\nHaving come to the end of their rehearsal, Kipps and the Actor sit down to rest. Kipps wonders if performing the play for his family will exorcise the Woman in Black.\n\nA twist is added at the end of the play; the Actor asks Kipps about the actress playing the Woman in Black. Mirroring the earlier scene with Mr Jerome, Kipps, terrified, denies that anyone else had been in the theatre, implying that the real Woman in Black had been present. The play ends with the rhythmic knocking of the rocking chair as the lights fade to black. An image of the face of the Woman in Black lingers behind the gauze for a few seconds.\n\nThe play premiered in 1987 at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough as a \"Christmas ghost story\".\n\nThe play opened in the West End at the Lyric Hammersmith in January 1989, then moved to the Strand Theatre in February 1989 and subsequently transferred to the Playhouse in April 1989 and finally the Fortune Theatre in August 1989. Direction was by Robin Herford, the Set Designer was Michael Holt and the Lighting Designer was Kevin Sleep. The original London cast (1989) was Charles Kay as Arthur Kipps and John Duttine as The Actor. In publicity literature, the actress in the title role is surreptitiously listed as 'Vision', but was originally Bristol Old Vic Theatre School-trained Nicola Sloane. The current West End cast, from May 2018 until March 2nd 2019, includes Richard Hope as Arthur Kipps and Mark Hawkins as the Actor.\n\nOn 1 August 2016 it was announced that the West End production would extend its run to September 2017.\n\nThe play is currently used as a live theatre performance in the GCSE and IGCSE Drama curricula and as a basis for comparative essays and sometimes theatre reviews. It can also be seen as helpful to GCSE/IGCSE English Literature students, as one of the set texts a student can choose to study is \"The Woman in Black\".\n\n"}

The company was originally formed as \"227 Plus One\" in the late 1980s by Ed Hart and is based in Louisville, Kentucky. Themeparks' first park was Kentucky Kingdom, which it bought in 1988 and sold to Premier Parks (now Six Flags) in 1997. Themeparks subsequently operated Magic Springs Theme Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas from 2000 to 2008 before selling it to PARC Management. Themeparks LLC repurchased Kentucky Kingdom in 2013 and has been operating the theme park since May 2014.\n\nIn 1988, businessman Ed Hart bought the then-bankrupt Kentucky Kingdom amusement park at an auction. Hart then turned the park around and reopened it for the 1990 season. During this time, Hart founded Themeparks LLC specifically for the project.\n\nIn 1997, Kentucky Kingdom was sold to Premier Parks, which in 1998 purchased Six Flags Theme Parks from Time Warner. In 1998 Kentucky Kingdom became Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom.\n\nAfter selling Kentucky Kingdom to Premier Parks in 1997, Hart began planning to build a brand new amusement park near Seattle, Washington, which was to be called \"The Great Northwest Theme Park\". The park was to be 100 acres and be located in the town of Lakewood. It was planned to open in the Spring of 2002. However, the project was scrapped for unknown reasons.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Hart was approached by Fitraco, a Belgian company, to reopen Magic Springs amusement park in Arkansas. Hart then reassembled and restarted Themeparks LLC, only one year after it dissolved after the sale of Kentucky Kingdom to Premier Parks (now Six Flags). Hart and Themeparks LLC then reopened the park in 2000 after five years being closed. During Themeparks LLC's operations at Magic Springs, attendance grew to new highs, after the additions of Crystal Falls Water Park and the Timberwood Amphitheater. Themeparks LLC sold Magic Springs and Crystal Falls to PARC Management in early 2008. Themeparks LLC then dissolved for a second time afterwards for another two years until 2010.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Hart and Themeparks LLC began developing a new theme and water park, which was to be called \"Thrillopolis\", and to be located in Nashville, Tennessee. Nashville's only amusement park, Opryland USA, had previously closed permanently several years prior in 1997 and was replaced by a shopping mall in 2000. The closest amusement park to Nashville at this time was Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Plans eventually fell apart in mid-2002 due to funding problems with the city of Nashville. \n\nIn 2002, the company made a bid for Visionland, a theme park in Alabama, but the price was too high. Themeparks LLC and Adventure Parks Group had talked about a merger, but nothing has yet developed.\n\nIn 2010, Themeparks LLC temporarily renamed itself to KK Redevelopment LLC to buy back Kentucky Kingdom from the state of Kentucky. In 2011, The Kentucky State Fair Board ended their plans with KK Redevelopment LLC to reopen Kentucky Kingdom. In 2012, KK Redvelopment LLC made a new proposal to reopen the park by May 2014.\n\nOn January 24, 2013, The Fair Board approved the proposal from KK Redevelopment LLC and Ed Hart to reopen Kentucky Kingdom. The park (along with Hurricane Bay) was set to reopen on May 24, 2014 with new thrill rides and a bigger water park. Kentucky Kingdom and Hurricane Bay is now open with Themeparks LLC as the new operators. They spent over 50 million dollars to bring back Kentucky Kingdom and during the first year of operation. Theme Park LLC added a $7 million roller coaster named \"Lightning Run\" and doubled the size of the water park. Though Themeparks LLC does operate Kentucky Kingdom, the company is commonly referred to as Kentucky Kingdom LLLP when relating to Kentucky Kingdom.\n\n"}

With the massive Italian emigration of the 19th and 20th centuries, the game was exported abroad, where it took different forms. A variation of the game is a popular form of raffle in the UK and elsewhere.\n\nIn Italy, a tombola is a traditional board game, first played in the city of Naples in the eighteenth century. It is similar to the game of bingo. It is mostly played at Christmas time, and prizes are often only symbolic.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a tombola is a form of raffle in which prizes are pre-assigned to winning tickets. Typically numbered raffle tickets are used, with prizes allocated to all those ending in a particular digit (traditionally a five or a zero). Players pay for a ticket, which they then draw at random from a hat or tombola drum, and can instantly see whether or not they have won a prize. Tombolas are popular at events such as village fêtes and coffee mornings, when it is expected that not all the players will be present at the end of the event.\n\nIn some other languages such as French, Bulgarian, Slovak or Czech, \"Tombola\" is a general word meaning raffle. \nIn the United States, fair style fundraisers may have booths with prizes that can be won in a manner similar to UK tombola. Players pay to select a folded paper from a container, and unfold it to determine if—and perhaps what—they have won. Typically, winning tickets will be identified by the ending digits of the number on the paper (for instance, –00). Prizes may be distributed by letting the player make a selection or by proactively marking prizes with the winning numbers.\n\n"}
{"id": "39105332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39105332", "title": "Traditional games of Korea", "text": "Traditional games of Korea\n\nTraditional games of Korea (; ) have been influenced by the culture, history and environment of the Korean Peninsula. Koreans have enjoyed games throughout history with family and friends, and the games create a sense of community. The most popular traditional games are Ganggang Sulrae, Jegichagi, Neolttwigi, Ssireum, Tuho, Hitting tombstone and Yutnori.\n\nKorea's traditional games originated from folk beliefs. The peninsula has been agrarian since ancient times, and Koreans have believed in gods who protect nature and their lands. Exorcisms were performed to increase crops and animal well-being, with singing and dancing popular activities. Traditional games developed during this early period. Although many folk beliefs have disappeared, the games continue to be played.\n\nThe names and rules of the games differ by region. In Gyeonggi-do Gonu is called \"Gonu, Goni, Ggoni\", but in Jeonlado it is called \"Ggon, Ggonu\". Under Japanese rule, nearly all traditional games in Korea disappeared.\n\nMost games (such as Tuho, Ssireum and kite flying) are played with the hands, using movement, and do not require equipment or a play area. The games are related to the four seasons.\n\nYutnori, a board dice game with four wooden sticks, is one of the most popular traditional games of Korea and is usually played on the first day of the New Year by two players (or teams). Each player (or team of two players) takes turns throwing yut sticks. Each stick has two sides (round and flat), which makes the stick roll. Five combinations are possible with yut sticks: \"do\", \"gae\", \"geol\", \"yut\" and \"mo\". A player achieving a \"yut\" or \"mo\" is allowed to roll again. If a board piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent, it is returned to the start and the player goes again. If a piece lands on a space occupied by one's own team, the pieces can go together (counting as one). The combinations determine how the board pieces are moved, and the team which moves all four pieces around the board first wins. The game has its roots in divination rituals.\n\n\"Ssireum\" is similar to Japanese sumo wrestling, with two opponents wrestling each other in a sandy ring. The player who throws his opponent to the ground scores a point. Annual competitions are held, which are popular. \"Ssireum\", a contest of strength and technique, is a form of wrestling unique to Korea.\n\nTraditionally practiced as combat and self-defense, \"ssireum\" was also part of rituals conducted in the ancient tribal states. Rules evolved, allowing \"ssireum\" to develop into a national sport valued for competition and entertainment.\n\nIn top-spinning, played primarily by children, a player spins a wooden top with a stick to make it spin on ice or on the ground. Popular in winter, the games have names which vary by region. The best tops (made from birch, jujube or pine) are heavy, with strong tips, and they are often spun in groups.\n\nKite frames are generally made of bamboo, with paper attached. Most kites, rectangular or stingray-shaped, are tethered with string on a reel. Kite flying is a traditional winter game for children and adults. There is a period of kite flying from New Year's Day to Daeboreum, after which the kite string is cut for it to fly away. Kite flying is less common, due to work obligations, but kites were flown as a distraction from winter cold.\n\nTuho was originally popular among royal families and the upper class. In a manner similar to horseshoes, tuho players attempt to throw arrows into the top of a narrow-necked wooden jar. The score is determined by the number of arrows in the jar. Tuho is presently played by people from all classes.\n\nAccording to Rebecca Lucas, Tuho was played on the Korean Peninsula during the Gorguryeo Kingdom (37 BCE - 668 CE) and is mentioned in the \"History of Old Tang\" (舊唐書) and the \"Book of Sui\" (隋書). The game apparently waned in popularity, since King Yejong of Goryeo (c. 1105-1122) received a tuho set from the Sung emperor in 1116 and did not know how it was played. During the Joseon dynasty, it was promoted as Confucian. The game was played by both women and men, including Prince Yangnyong (양녕대군, 讓寧大君. 1394-1462) and his sisterss and King Hyeonjong of Joseon (현종, 顯宗. 1641-1674) and his family.\n\nGonu's (a variety of Pong Hau K'i) name (\"goni\", \"ggoni\" or \"ggon\" or \"gonni\") and rules vary by region; examples are pond, line or pumpkin gonu. This game is played with a small pebble (or piece of wood) and a game board drawn on the ground or a piece of paper. Players move their pebbles one block forward, and the player who blocks their opponent's pebble wins. \n\nNeolttwigi is Korean seesaw. Unlike Western seesaws where riders sit at each end, neolttwigi participants stand and jump (launching their partner into the air on the opposite side). The game is popular among girls during traditional holidays and festivals such as Dano and Chuseok.\n\nIn jegichagi, similar to Western Hacky Sack, players kick a jegi and the player with the greatest number of kicks wins. Usually played in winter, jegichagi's name varies by region. The jegi, similar in appearance to a shuttlecock, is made from a coin and \"hanji\" (handmade Korean paper). The player kicks the jegi into the air, and continues kicking it to keep it off the ground. Switching the kicking foot is permitted. In a one-on-one game, the player with the higher number of consecutive kicks wins; in a group game, players stand in a circle and take turns kicking the jegi. A player who lets the jegi fall to the ground loses, and tosses it to the winner to kick. When the loser catches the jegi with his hands, they can rejoin the game.\n\nGonggi (Hangul:공기, pronounced gong-gee) is a popular Korean children's game that is traditionally played using 5 or more small grape-sized pebbles. Nowadays, children buy colourful plastic stones instead of finding pebbles. It can be played alone or with friends. Since only a few stones and a flat surface are needed for play, the game can be played by anyone almost anywhere. This same game also exists in Nepal and it is called 'gatti'. Also, it is similar to 'Knucklebones' in Western. There are many ways to play Gonggi, but the most typical way to play Gonggi is playing with 5 marbles or pebbles.\n\nHitting Tombstone (Hangul:비석치기) is traditional games of Korea. It is a game which uses tombstones. It is a small square pillar stone. Your target is the other’s tombstones. You have to knock down the other’s tombstones. The game was used to be played in spring and autumn. There are lots of different rules and names in different regions.\nLong time ago, people had to protect themselves from savages, so they threw stones and they use when they fight. As time passed, it turned into this game. Also, in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty, on the street were lots of tombstones standing. If It is corrupt official’s, people hit them. And the game originated from it.\nYou need to decide the order first. Then you draw two lines on the floor and stand at regular intervals. Next, the first player grabs the tombstone and throw it to the other’s tombstone. If the other’s tombstone knocks down, you go on to the next step. The next step is putting the tombstone on her(his) top of the foot. You walk carefully so that the tombstone won’t fall off. If you succeed, you will go on to the next stage and repeat that. You must put the tombstone on your higher part of the body than the game before. If you fall your tombstone or can’t knock down the other’s stone, you have to hand over the turn. When you succeed all the stages, you are the winner.\nYou have to decide the rules before starting the game. This game’s characteristic is that we can add the rules. Basically, we start the game holding the tombstone by hands. And you must throw down your tombstone to knock down the other’s tombstone. Next, you have to put your tombstone on your body part. And you need to walk carefully to carry your tombstone to the other’s tombstone. And if you succeed the stage, you will go next stage. If your tombstone falls down, you have to hand over the turn and next person start the game. \nThis game has lots of stages, and you have to use your whole body. The game will improve your sense of balance and flexibility. Also, when you play this game, you look like strange person because of your pose so when you play this game, the player will feel funny and good.\n\nJuldarigi (Hangul: 줄다리기, also chuldarigi) is a traditional Korean sport similar to tug of war. It uses two huge rice-straw ropes, connected by a central peg, which are pulled by teams representing the East and West sides of the village (the competition is often rigged in favour of the Western team). A number of religious and traditional rituals are performed before and after the actual competition.\n\nRolling hoop is one of the Korean traditional game using iron stick. In the past, people used old wagon wheel instead of iron hoop. In the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Seoul in 1988, there was a performance using rolling hoop.\n\nJwibulnori is a Korean traditional game done on the fifteenth of January of the lunar calendar. This day is called to have the largest moon in the year. Many events are done in this day and Jwibulnori is one of it. People lit fire on their can tin filled with things that burn well and spin the can over your head, holding a wire connected to the can. This makes a beautiful image.\n\nThe exact origin of this traditional game is unknown. However, it is known when people started to use can tins. It was used since the Korean War. During the war, lots of military supplies including can tins were imported. Those cans were used to play and also it naturally got combined with Jwibulnori.\n\nIn the past people used mugwort bats. However nowadays, it changed so people use can tins which have lots of holes and are filled with wood pieces and pine cones. The holes in the can helps the can burn well and longer because air goes through \nit.As time passed, not only the original Jwibulnori but also some other games were made. All these games were changed a bit to add some fun. One example is people getting into groups and competing. Farmers or young people would get into groups and run with torches, burning large areas or turning off the torch of the other side.\n\nWhile people do Jwibulnori, other people also gather some straw and some sticks to make a big pile and burn the pile of straw and sticks. Using this as a sign, people lit fire on fields. This is an event done to wish a year of plenty and also to prevent harmful insects from damaging the crops. The fire kills harmful insects. Also, it kills mice which carry infectious diseases which can harm people. The soil of burnt weeds become manure for the crops and made the soil richer and made the crops grow better. Also, spinning the can symbolizes burning evil and bad luck.\n\n"}
