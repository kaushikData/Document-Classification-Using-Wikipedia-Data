Kesler. It stars Ruth Roman and Sterling Hayden, with a cast that also included Werner Klemperer, Richard Gaines, Charles Davis, Jeanne Cooper, and Peter Hansen. \"5 Steps to Danger\" was based on the novel \"The Steel Mirror\" by Donald Hamilton.\n\nJohn Emmett, an American everyman, is on a fishing and hunting trip when his car breaks down. He is offered a ride by a stranger, Ann Nicholson, who is driving to Santa Fe and asks him to take turns behind the wheel.\n\nDuring a stopover a woman identifying herself as a nurse takes John aside in a diner and says she has been following them because Ann is an escaped mental patient of a Dr. Frederick Simmons. And although he is not sure what to believe, John begins to doubt Ann when two policemen attempt to arrest them, claiming to be investigating a murder in Los Angeles.\n\nJohn and Ann slip away. He demands the truth, whereupon Ann says she is an ex-German citizen who stumbled upon a government plot and is in possession of valuable scientific transcripts embedded on a small cosmetic mirror. In order to prevent Simmons from having Ann committed to a mental institution against her will, John asks Ann to marry him, while also declaring his love for her. They wed in a small town and then continue their journey to find the scientist who wrote the transcripts. The chase ends in a confrontation between Simmons, who is actually a Soviet spy, and his accomplices versus FBI and CIA agents, who verify Ann's story. Ann and John enjoy their honeymoon on the fishing trip John had originally planned.\n\n\n\"The New York Times\" wrote that the film was \"a rather lax and familiar melodrama about Communist espionage in this country, offers two real jolts. The climax, and this may be an unfair revelation, has a known subversive given some leeway inside a vital guided missile plant. Secondly, the place seems about as inaccessible as a drive-in restaurant. [...] The responsibility, or irresponsibility, must be shouldered by Henry S. Kesler, who handled the screenwriting, the directing and producing, and none of it very well.\"\n\n\"5 Steps to Danger\" was released in theatres on January 30, 1957. \n"}

(comic strip)\n\nB.C. is a daily American comic strip created by cartoonist Johnny Hart. Set in prehistoric times, it features a group of cavemen and anthropomorphic animals from various geologic eras.\n\n\"B.C.\" made its newspaper debut on February 17, 1958, and was among the longest-running strips still written and drawn by its original creator when Hart died at his drawing board in Nineveh, New York, on April 7, 2007. Now produced by Mason Mastroianni, \"B.C.\" is syndicated by Creators Syndicate.\n\n\"B.C.\" was initially rejected by a number of syndicates until the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate accepted it, launching the strip on February 17, 1958. Hart was assisted with \"B.C.\" by gag writers Jack Caprio and Dick Boland (who later joined Hart and cartoonist Brant Parker on \"The Wizard of Id\").\n\nWhen the Herald Tribune syndicate folded in 1966, \"B.C.\" was taken over by the Publishers Syndicate. That syndicate changed hands and names frequently — Publishers-Hall Syndicate, the Field Newspaper Syndicate, News America Syndicate, and finally North America Syndicate — eventually becoming part of King Features. At that point, in 1987, Hart changed distributors to Creators Syndicate, becoming one of Creators' first syndicated strips.\n\nAfter Hart's death in 2007, the strip began being produced by Hart's grandsons Mason Mastroianni (head writer and cartoonist) and Mick Mastroianni (writer for both \"B.C.\" and Hart's other creation, \"The Wizard of Id\"), and Hart's daughter Perri (letterer and colorist). (The Mastroianni Brothers also created an original strip, \"The Dogs of C Kennel\", in 2009.)\n\nFor a visual glossary, see Meet The Actors at John Hart Studios.\n\nHart was inspired to draw cavemen (and many other creatures) through the chance suggestion of one of his coworkers at General Electric, and took to the idea \"because they are a combination of simplicity and the origin of ideas.\" The name for the strip \"may have been suggested by my wife, Bobby,\" Johnny recalls.\n\nHart describes the title character as similar to himself, playing the \"patsy.\" The other major characters — Peter, Wiley, Clumsy Carp, Curls, and Thor — were patterned after friends and co-workers. The animal characters include dinosaurs, ants and an anteater, clams, a snake, a turtle and bird duo, and an apteryx (presented in the strip as being the sole surviving specimen, and hence self-aware of its being doomed to extinction).\n\n\nThere are also several odd inanimate characters, including a talking Daisy and his/her friend, a talking Rock.\n\nAlthough the strip seldom expands its human cast outside of the established group of characters, there are a few exceptions. It can be assumed that there are other groups or tribes of humans for Wiley's sports teams to compete against, for example, but these are never actually seen. There have been a few exceptions to this, however, with a few additional human characters seen from time to time, even if only once.\n\n\nThe characters live, for the most part, in caves, in what appears to be a barren, mountainous desert by an unidentified sea. Background detail is often limited to a simple horizon line broken up by the occasional silhouettes of a stray volcano or cloud. \"Retail stores\", \"shop counters\", and \"businesses\" are symbolized by a single boulder, labeled (for instance): \"Wheel Repair\", \"Advice Column\", \"Psychiatrist\", etc. The February 5, 2012, strip gives a nearby location of N 53° 24' 17\" W 6° 12' 3\", which is in present-day Dublin, Ireland.\n\nOriginally, the strip was set firmly in prehistoric times, with the characters clearly living in an era untouched by modernity. Typical plotlines, for example, include B.C.'s friend, Thor (inventor of the wheel and the comb), trying to discover a use for the wheel. Thor was also seen making calendars out of stone every December. Other characters attempt to harness fire or to discover an unexplored territory, like Peter trying to find the \"new world\" by crossing the ocean on a raft. Animals, like the dinosaur, think such thoughts as, \"There's one consolation to becoming extinct—I'll go down in history as the first one to go down in history.\" Grog arrived in early 1966, emerging from a miniature glacier which melted to reveal what Wiley called \"Prehistoric man!\"\n\n\"B.C.\", like Hart's \"Wizard of Id\", is a period burlesque with a deliberately broad, unliteral time frame. As time went on the strip began to mine humor from having the characters make explicit references to modern-day current events, inventions, and celebrities. Increasingly familiar visual devices, like the makeshift \"telephone\" built into a tree trunk, also started to blur the comic's supposed prehistoric setting and make it rife with intentional anachronisms. One of the comic's early out-of-context jokes, from June 22, 1967, was this one:\n\nAnother early example: Near Christmas time, the apteryx, dressed as Santa Claus, modified his usual spiel: \"Hi there, I'm an Apterclaus, a wingless toymonger with batteries not included!\" \"The Washington Post\" columnist and comics critic Gene Weingarten suggested that \"B.C.\" is actually set not in the past but in a dystopic, post-apocalyptic future.\n\n\"B.C.\" follows a gag-a-day format, featuring (mostly) unrelated jokes from day to day, plus a color Sunday page. Occasionally it will run an extended sequence on a given theme over a week or two. It also follows the convention of Sunday strips with a short, setup/payoff joke in the first two panels, followed by an extended gag. The principal cast is small and varied, with each character imbued with a developed personality. \"The art style, like that of Charles Schulz's \"Peanuts\", masks sophisticated minimalism with a casually scratchy veneer,\" according to comics historian Don Markstein.\n\nDry humor, prose, verse, slapstick, irony, shameless puns and wordplay, and comedic devices such as \"Wiley's Dictionary\" (where common words are defined humorously with a twist, see Daffynition) make for some of the mix of material in \"B.C.\" Example: \"Rock \"(verb)\": To cause something or someone to swing or sway, principally by hitting them with it!\"—from an early 1967 strip. Or: \"Cantaloupe \"(noun)\": What the father of the bride asks after seeing the wedding estimate!\"\n\nThere are running gags relating to the main cast and to a variety of secondary, continuing characters. One such periodic recurring gag has Peter communicating with an unseen pen-pal on the other side of the ocean, writing a message on a slab of rock that he floats off into the horizon. It is invariably returned the same way, with a sarcastic reply written on the reverse side. These segments use silent or \"pantomime\" panels (indicating that time has elapsed; night falls and dawn rises) between the set-up and the delayed punch line—typical of Hart's idiosyncratic use of \"timing\" in \"B.C.\"\n\nLate in the run of the strip, and following a renewal of Hart's religious faith in 1984, \"B.C.\" increasingly incorporated religious, social, and political commentary, continuing until Hart's death in 2007. References to Christianity, anachronistic given the strip's supposed setting and the implications of its title, became increasingly frequent during Hart's later years. In interviews, Hart referred to his strip as a \"ministry\" intended to mix religious themes with secular humor. Though other strips such as \"The Family Circus\" and \"Peanuts\" have included Christian themes, \"B.C.\" strips were pulled from comics pages on several occasions due to editorial perception of religious favoritism or overt proselytizing. Easter strips in 1996 and 2001, for example, prompted editorial reaction from a handful of U.S. newspapers, chiefly the \"Los Angeles Times\" and written and oral responses from Jewish and Muslim groups. The American Jewish Committee termed the Easter 2001 strip, which depicted the last words of Jesus Christ and a menorah transforming into a cross, \"religiously offensive\" and \"shameful.\" A 2003 strip depicting a character using an outhouse with a crescent symbol on the front, slamming the door shut, and declaring, \"Is it just me, or does it stink in here?\" was interpreted by some as carrying an anti-Islam message. Hart responded to the controversy, saying \"This comic was in no way intended to be a message against Islam — subliminal or otherwise... It would be contradictory to my own faith as a Christian to insult other people’s beliefs.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" consequently relegated strips which its editorial staff deemed objectionable to the religion pages, instead of the regular comics pages.\n\nThe \"B.C.\" daily strip from December 7, 2006 attracted criticism for defining \"infamy\" as \"a word seldom used after Toyota sales topped 2 million.\" The day was the 65th anniversary of the Japanese military's attack on Pearl Harbor, and the punchline of the strip refers to Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Infamy Speech\" which requested from Congress a declaration of war against Japan. The day's strip was pulled from at least one newspaper, the \"San Antonio Express-News\". The paper's managing editor said the comic was \"a regressive and insensitive statement about one of the worst days in American history.\"\n\nOn July 21, 2009, the strip presented a gag that involved the supposed suggestion of animal abuse. John Hart Studios received many angry responses from readers and issued an apology on their website.\n\n\nInfluences from \"B.C.\" are found throughout Johnny Hart's home of Broome County, New York. A PGA Tour event, the B.C. Open, took place every summer in Endicott, New York through 2005 (the final scheduled B.C. Open in 2006 was disrupted by flooding, prompting a change of venue to the Turning Stone Resort & Casino in central New York state). Each year Johnny would bring in a group of cartoonists to play in the Pro-Am. Jim Davis, Mike Peters, Mort Walker, Paul Szep, Dik Browne, John Cullen Murphy, Dean Young, Stan Drake, Brant Parker, Lynn Johnston, and entertainer Tom Smothers would put on a free show for the community, drawing and signing autographs for golf and cartooning fans.\n\nThe Broome County parks department features Gronk the dinosaur as their mascot, and Thor riding a wheel graces every Broome County Transit bus. In the past, Hart has also left his mark on the logos of the Broome Dusters and B.C. Icemen hockey teams.\n\n\nOn September 21, 2015, Go Comics began reprinting B.C. under the title \"Back to B.C.\".\n\n"}

Tour guides would meet the men upon arrival, explain everything, and transport them to the local bars and brothels.\n\nSince 1996, the New York based human rights and feminist group Equality Now has lobbied the local District Attorney to take action against the company, complaining about promotion of prostitution and possible exploitation of minors. The District Attorney declined to prosecute in 2000, stating that the alleged acts did not occur in New York and were thus beyond the reach of state law. Supported by Gloria Steinem and Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney, Equality Now then contacted State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2002.\n\nIn response to lobbying by these groups, the first legal action in the U.S. against a business of this type was initiated: Spitzer filed a civil suit against Big Apple Oriental Tours and obtained a restraining order in July 2003, in effect preventing the company from advertising.\n\nSpitzer then made two unsuccessful attempts to charge owners Norman Barabash and Douglas Allen with promoting prostitution. (New York state penal code 230.25(1) defines promotion of prostitution, in part, as running a business that involves prostitution activity by two or more prostitutes.) The Attorney General's office obtained the first indictment of Barabash and Allen in February 2004. The case was dismissed in August 2004, because the grand jury had been presented with hearsay evidence and because the judge did not find the law applicable. The dismissal was upheld on appeal based on the hearsay argument. The case was returned to the grand jury and Barabash and Allen were indicted for the same crime again in October 2005. These charges were dismissed in January, 2006. The court held that according to the evidence, \"What the tour customer did when he arrived at the location is not part of the Big Apple Oriental Tours enterprise.\"\n\n\n"}

The film takes place in a futuristic world overrun by vampires. A vampiric corporation sets out to capture and farm the remaining humans while researching a substitute for human blood. Lead vampire hematologist Edward Dalton's (Ethan Hawke) work is interrupted by human survivors led by former vampire \"Elvis\" (Willem Dafoe), who has a cure that can save the human species.\n\n\"Daybreakers\" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2010 and in North America on 8 January 2010. The film grossed over US$50 million and received mixed to positive critical reception.\n\nIn 2019, a plague has transformed most of the world's population into vampires. The human population has plummeted and the need for blood becomes desperate. Vampires deprived of blood for long durations degenerate into \"subsiders,\" psychotic bat-like creatures with no memories of who they were and whose only thought is the craving for blood. The few remaining humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists research a synthetic blood substitute.\n\nEdward Dalton is the head hematologist for the largest supplier of human blood in the US, owned by Charles Bromley. Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso are developing a blood substitute.\n\nDriving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another vehicle off the road. Checking on the occupants of the other vehicle, he learns they are humans. With the police approaching, Dalton has them hide in his vehicle. They part ways, but not before their leader, Audrey, learns Edward's name and occupation from the ID badge on his jacket.\n\nAt home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie (Michael Dorman). Frankie's gift of a bottle of pure human blood re-ignites a long-standing argument over Edward's sympathies towards humans. The argument is cut short when a subsider invades Edward's house, forcing the brothers to kill it.\n\nThe next morning, Audrey visits Edward's home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, Edward is introduced to Lionel \"Elvis\" Cormac, a human who was once a vampire. Before he can say how he reverted to human, a military team arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey. Audrey manages to knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac explains that he was cured of vampirism when he was ejected from his sun-proof vehicle by a crash. Exposed to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, but his life was saved when he landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure.\n\nThat night Edward meets more human survivors, as well as Senator Turner, a vampire who is secretly helping the colony develop a cure. A convoy of humans heading to Audrey's group is ambushed and captured. The soldiers track the position of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee. Audrey, Cormac and Edward stay behind so Edward can be cured. Edward is able to recreate the cure Elvis had explained, curing himself of vampirism. They attempt to regroup with Turner and the other humans, only to find they are all dead.\n\nOne of the captured convoy, Alison, is revealed to be Charles' human daughter. Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire. She refuses to drink human blood, and turns into a subsider. She is rounded up with others and dragged into sunlight to burn to death. Witnessing Alison's death upsets Frankie, causing him to seek out his brother. Meanwhile the military imposes martial law to control the subsider population and preserve order.\n\nEdward, Cormac and Audrey break into Christopher's home and ask him to help spread the cure. However, Christopher has finally discovered a viable blood substitute and is not interested in a cure. He summons soldiers who capture Audrey while Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human again; revealing that the risky sunlight cure is unnecessary.\n\nEdward, trying to save Audrey, turns himself in to Charles, who gloats about his new monopoly of the blood substitute. Edward taunts Charles into biting him, making him human again like Frankie.\n\nEdward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers who are on the brink of becoming subsiders. Frankie arrives and, surrounded by soldiers, draws their attention to himself to allow Edward and Audrey to escape; a feeding frenzy results, as the hungry soldiers consume first Frankie's blood and then that of the soldiers cured by it, until at last only (what at first appears to be three) six soldiers are left standing, cured and bewildered. Christopher, to cover up the cure, shoots the six and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac kills him with a crossbow.\n\nThe three survivors drive off into the sunrise. In a voice-over, Edward addresses the general population, announcing the cure, but may be too late as multiple subsiders appear before the screen turns black.\n\nIn November 2004, Lionsgate acquired the script to \"Daybreakers\", written by Peter and Michael Spierig. The brothers, who directed \"Undead\" (2003), were attached to direct \"Daybreakers\". In September 2006, the brothers received financing from Film Finance Corporation Australia, with production set to take place in Queensland. In May 2007, actor Ethan Hawke was cast into the lead role. Later in the month, actor Sam Neill joined the cast as the main antagonist. \"Daybreakers\" began filming on the Gold Coast at Warner Bros. Movie World studios and in Brisbane on 16 July 2007. The production budget was $US21 million, with the State Government contributing $US1 million to the filmmakers. Principal photography was completed on schedule in September 2007, with reshoots following to extend key sequences.\n\nWeta Workshop created the creature effects for \"Daybreakers\". The Spierig brothers wanted the vampires in the film to have a classical aesthetic to them while feeling like a more contemporary interpretation. After experimenting with complex makeup designs, they decided that a more minimalistic approach to makeup had a more powerful effect.\n\nHawke was initially hesitant to join the production as he was \"not a big fan\" of genre films. He ultimately accepted the role as Edward after deciding the story felt \"different\" from that of a typical B movie. Hawke described the film as an allegory of man's pacing with natural resources, \"We're eating our own resources so people are trying to come up with blood substitutes, trying to get us off of foreign humans.\" The actor also said that despite the serious allegory, the film was \"low art\" and \"completely unpretentious and silly\".\n\n\"Daybreakers\" premiered on 11 September 2009 at the 34th Annual Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on 6 January 2010 in the UK and Ireland, 8 January 2010 in North America, and 4 February 2010 in Australia.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gave the film a 67% rating based on reviews from 145 critics, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Though it arrives during an unfortunate glut of vampire movies, \"Daybreakers\" offers enough dark sci-fi thrills — and enough of a unique twist on the genre — to satisfy filmgoers.\" It also holds a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 31 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n\"Variety\" gave the film a mixed review stating the film had a \"cold, steely blue, black and gray 'Matrix'-y look\" going on to say \"Daybreakers\" \"emerges as a competent but routine chase thriller that lacks attention-getting dialogue, unique characters or memorable setpieces that might make it a genre keeper rather than a polished time-filler.\" \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film two and a half out of four stars and called the film a B movie and a \"nifty genre piece\". Roger Ebert also gave the film two and a half stars stating the \"intriguing premise ... ends as so many movies do these days, with fierce fights and bloodshed.\" Richard Roeper gave the film a B+ and called it \"a bloody good time.\"\n\nAs of October 2010, the box gross was US$51,416,464. In its opening weekend in the United States, \"Daybreakers\" opened at #4 behind \"Avatar\", \"Sherlock Holmes\" and \"\" with $15,146,692 in 2,523 theaters, averaging $6,003 per theater.\n\n\"Daybreakers\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on 11 May 2010 and in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2010. The UK DVD copy was rated as an 18 instead of the original 15 rating that was used for cinema release. A 3D Blu-ray version of the film was released in November 2011.\n\n\n"}

He co-founded Edwin Shirley Trucking (later abbreviated to EST) in 1974, which became one of the largest music transport companies in Europe. He went on to convert old bonded warehouses in the east end of London into the successful film and television recording studio, Three Mills Island Studios. In his later life he returned to the transport business, particularly for theatre companies and other parts of the entertainment industry.\n\nEdwin Antoine Shirley was born in Cranbrook, Kent on 16 October 1948 to Herbert Shirley and Marie Gates. He was educated at Cranbrook School, and then St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he took a BA in Modern Languages (specialising in French and German). He was involved in numerous undergraduate stage productions as an actor and director. He also acted in a number of plays with the National Youth Theatre.\n\nShirley's language skills and knowledge of theatre lighting and sound led him into jobs on tour with the Rolling Stones and other prominent bands of the 1970s. After working on numerous Rock and Roll tours, he established Edwin Shirley Trucking with Roy Lamb. The company was run from his family farm in Kent, and later expanded into premises in East London. \n\nEdwin Shirley Trucking became indelibly associated with live music tours. In an obituary on Planet Rock Radio, Bernard Doherty referred to the apocryphal notion that \"You haven't really made it until Edwin Shirley is moving your gear around\". Brian May of Queen, noted Shirley's importance to their touring operation: \"Edwin was at the head of Queen's vehicle convoy for so many years I can't begin to remember how many... He was a great pal of Gerry Stickells, our illustrious Tour Manager\nand the two of them wrote the book on how to party on tour.\"\n\nHaving built a successful trucking company, Shirley started a new company Edwin Shirley Staging which built stages for a number of large concerts including Live Aid in 1985. Shirley left both companies in the 1990s.\n\nWhile looking for rehearsal space in East London, Shirley viewed Three Mills Island, and realised the potential to develop a film studio there. After meeting with Peter Bazalgette, Shirley secured the site as the location for the first \"Big Brother\" reality TV programme, which went on to become a major domestic television series. The studio proved a success, but a dispute with the landlord led to the site being taken over by another company. As of 2013, the studio is still operating.\n\nHaving suffered from bowel cancer since 2009, Shirley had undergone effective surgery and carried on working for four years. On 14 April 2013 Shirley was hospitalised due to a massive bleed, and after two days in Homerton Hospital, Hackney, died on 16 April 2013.\n\n"}

Consequently, since the mid-1980s the elephant population has declined from 150,000 to a reported figure of just 2,000 in the Chad-Cameroon region by one source and 500 in Chad alone in 2013 according to another source because of intense poaching. American journalist Lisa Ling has visited Chad to explore the country's elephant poaching problem.\n\nIn a July 2012 attack by mounted poachers near the SOS Elephants camp in the Chari-Baguirmi Region, 28 elephants were slaughtered and most of their tusks were removed. In another attack in September 2012, about from the boundaries of the Zakouma National Park, five rangers were killed; one is still missing and presumed dead. The Sudanese military have been blamed for the attacks and the slaughtering of elephants not only in Zakouma and elsewhere in Chad, but also in other African nations, including Cameroon. As of 2012, a small team was responsible for battling to protect the remaining 450 elephants in Zakouma. One of the worst massacres took place in 14–15 March 2013 when 89 elephants, including 33 pregnant females and 15 calves, were slaughtered by poachers near the town of Gamba.\n\nStephanie Vergniault, a French lawyer, screenwriter, and conservationist who has been working in Chad since 2009, founded the SOS Elephants organization to protect the elephant population. In an interview in 2010, Vergniault stated that the population of elephants in Chad had declined by 85 percent in the previous three decades, and that if the same rate of poaching continues, \"not a single elephant\" would be alive in Chad within three years.\n\n"}

{"id": "1072636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1072636", "title": "Japanese Mahjong scoring rules", "text": "Japanese Mahjong scoring rules\n\nJapanese Mahjong scoring rules are used for Japanese Mahjong, a game for four players common in Japan. The rules were organized in the \"Taishō\" to Shōwa period as the game became popular. \n\nThe scoring system uses structural criteria as well as bonuses. Player start scores may be set to any value. Usually, it is set to 20,000 to 30,000 points. Scores are counted using sticks of 10,000 points, 5,000 points, 1,000 points and 100 points. A game often ends when all the points of a player are lost, which is a situation called \"hakoten\", \"dobon\", \"buttobi\", etc.\n\nThere are two criteria in determining the winning points: \"han\" and \"fu\", which correspond to a points table. \"Han\" is the unit for the value of \"yaku\", which are particular patterns or conditions of a hand. \"Fu\" is the value of melds, waits and \"going out\".\n\nThe payment to the winner of a hand is calculated as follows:\n\nIn the case of a draw, points are transferred according to the \"nō-ten bappu\" rule. In the event of a penalty, such as claiming a win with an illegal hand, then points are transferred via the \"chombo\" rule.\n\nThe total number of \"han\" (飜) of all the kinds of \"yaku\" (役; winning hand) in the hand is summed up. Each \"dora\" (ドラ) increases the \"han\" value of a hand. \"Dora\" are not regarded as \"yaku\", and no hand can be won without a \"yaku\" even if there are some \"dora\" tiles.\n\nIf there is more than one way to arrange the winning hand, the arrangement with the highest \"han\" is used. For example, a hand could be either \"ryanpeikou\" (二盃口) or \"chītoitsu\" (七対子), but since \"ryanpeikou\" is three \"han\" where \"chītoitsu\" is two \"han\", \"ryanpeikou\" should prevail. Some \"yaku\" have their \"han\" value reduced by one if the hand is not closed.\n\nIf a hand has five \"han\" or more, it is always counted by \"mangan\" (満貫) as a unit and it is not necessary to calculate \"fu\" (符) or basic points.\n\n\"Fu\" (符) is counted in the order below and then rounded up to the tens. There may be variations of rules for counting it.\n\n[Three \"han\" with 70 \"fu\" or more] and [four \"han\" with 40 \"fu\" or more] yield more than \"mangan\" and there is no need to calculate basic points. \n\n\nThe list for the third step:\nThe list for the fourth step:\nThe basic points of a hand is calculated as follows:\n\n\nThe actual points given are rounded up to the nearest 100. Even if the values of \"han\" and \"fu\" are the same, the points received for self-draw wins often slightly deviate from those received for discard wins because of rounding.\n\nExample 1: The player on the right of the dealer goes out by self-draw. (The dealer's wind is always East in Japanese rules.) The winner's hand is closed and has a closed triplet (\"ankō\") of Souths. The player also has two Whites as the pair (\"toitsu\") and the winning tile is a White. The \"yaku\" are \"self-pick\" (\"menzenchin-tsumo-hō\") and \"honor tiles\" (\"yakuhai\"), and they yield a total of two \"han\". The sum of \"fu\" is 20 (\"fūtei\") + 8 (a closed triplet of Souths) + 2 (a pair of Whites) + 2 (pair wait) + 2 (self-draw) = 34 \"fu\", rounded up to 40 \"fu\".\n\nThe basic points are thus 40 × 2 = 640. The dealer pays the winner 640 × 2 = 1,280, rounded up to 1,300 points. The other two non-dealers pay the winner 640, rounded up to 700 points.\n\nExample 2: The same player goes out by the same hand, except this time the winning tile was discarded by the player on the right. The resulting hand has one \"han\" of \"honor tiles\". The number of \"fu\" is 20 (\"fūtei\") + 10 (\"ron\" with a closed hand) + 8 (a closed triplet of Souths) + 2 (the pair of Whites) + 2 (pair wait) = 42 \"fu\", rounded up to 50 \"fu\".\n\nThe basic point is thus 50 × 2 = 400. The discarder pays the winner 400 × 4 = 1,600 points. The other two players pay the winner nothing.\n\nIt is possible for a hand to have one \"han\" with 102 \"fu\" (rounded up to 110 \"fu\") if the rules allow a pair to have four \"fu\" when it is made of wind tiles that are both the seat wind and the prevailing wind. Some rules consider that such a pair is still worth two \"fu\", making the hand have exactly 100 \"fu\".\n\nAn example of a hand that has one \"han\" with 110 \"fu\".\n, closed , closed , winning by a discard .\n\nThe hand has \"yakuhai\" of one \"han\" with 20 \"fu\" of \"fūtei\", 10 \"fu\" of \"menzen-kafu\", 32 \"fu\" of \"ankan\", 32 \"fu\" of \"ankan\", four \"fu\" of \"minkō\", and four \"fu\" of \"toitsu\". East is both the player's seat wind and the round's prevailing wind in this case. This is the largest amount of \"fu\" that a hand with one \"han\" can have.\n\nSince the method of calculating a winning hand's score in mahjong is quite tedious, many players refer to a scoring table to look up the final score of a hand. Expert and professional players have this table memorized and can thus tell the value of a hand at a glance. Each of the table's point values are derived from the scoring equation and procedure with each corresponding \"han\" and \"fu\" values.\n\nTo use the table, simply look up the values that correspond to the \"han\" and \"fu\" counts of the hand. The top numbers in each cell indicate the payout from a player who discards a winning tile. The numbers in brackets indicate the payout for each player in the event the winning tile is self-drawn. If the winner is the dealer, each player pays the same amount. If the winner is a non-dealer, then the other two non-dealers pay the smaller number, while the dealer pays the larger number.\n\nThe reason why there are no scores in the 1 \"han\" 20 \"fu\" cell is that such a hand is impossible. The only 20 fu hands are the no-points hand (\"pinfu\", 平和) where the winning tile is self-drawn. However, since a no-points hand must be closed, it makes winning via a self-drawn tile automatically add 1 \"han\" \"yaku\" of self pick to the hand. Therefore, a 1 \"han\" 20 fu hand cannot exist. A seven pairs hand is fixed at 25 fu. Since the hand is always closed, it adds 1 \"han\" of self pick when won by self-draw.\n\nWhen it is clear that a hand reaches basic points of more than 2,000, it is limited to full basic points of 2,000 and called \"mangan\" (満貫). A hand of five \"han\" or more is always counted as a multiple of \"mangan\". In those cases there is no need to calculate basic points.\n\nOne \"han\" cannot reach \"mangan\" because 110 \"fu\" × 2 = 880 < 2,000. (With one han, 110 \"fu\" is the maximum.)\n\nTwo \"han\" cannot reach \"mangan\" because 110 \"fu\" × 2 = 1,760 < 2,000. (With two han, 110 \"fu\" is also the maximum.)\n\nWhen a hand has 120 \"fu\" or more, it always has some \"yaku\" of three \"han\" or more.\n\nIn plenty of occasions, a hand ends with all tiles drawn and the 14 tiles in the dead wall remain. Yet, no player wins the hand. This is the exhaustive draw. In this case, points may be exchanged barring any \"tenpai\" hands vs \"nōten\" hands. After each exhaustive draw, the counter increases by one.\n\n\"Tenpai\" (聴牌) means one tile short of a winning hand. To be \"tenpai\", a hand does not need any particular \"yaku\" partly because winning by the last discard is \"yaku\" itself. When a hand is not \"tenpai\", the situation is called \"nōten\" (ノー聴: \"nō\" is English \"no\" and \"ten\" for \"tenpai\"). \n\nPlayers must show their hand to verify that it is \"tenpai\" when a hand is a draw and if they declared \"rīchi\" or if they declare \"tenpai\". If a hand with \"rīchi\" declaration is \"nōten\", a \"chombo\" penalty is imposed. In some cases, a player who didn't declare \"rīchi\" can declare \"nōten\" even when the hand is \"tenpai\" to keep their hand concealed.\n\nPlayers receive or pay points called \"nō-ten bappu\" (ノー聴罰符; \"fu\" of penalty for \"nōten\") in the following way, when a hand ends in an exhaustive draw: \n\nIn most rules when a dealer's hand is \"nōten\", the dealer changes and the game wind may change. But if it's the last hand of the last round, in some rules, a game does not end if the dealer declares \"nōten\".\n\nWhen there are counter sticks (\"honba\") on the table, winners get bonus points calculated by multiplying 300 by the number of those counters. \"Honba\" (本場) is a unit of continuous dealer wins and draws, and to be exact, \"hon\" (本) is a unit of numbers of some bars and so on, and \"ba\" (場) means a scene or a situation.\n\nThe dealer keeps count of the number of continuous dealer wins and draws by placing point sticks on the table. While point sticks are usually used for scoring, here they are used merely as counters, a visual aid. The initial count is zero. The number of counters increases by one when:\n\nIn the case of (1) or (3), the dealer remains the same. In the case of (2), when the dealer cannot declare \"tenpai\", the dealer changes, but the number of counters increases regardless of whether the dealer declares tenpai. In all other cases, namely when only a non-dealer wins, the count is reset to zero.\n\n\"Renchan\" (連荘) is a situation in which a player successively plays the dealer, and is often only caused by dealer's win or \"tenpai\"; therefore, draws are not always \"renchan\". On the other hand, the number of \"honba\" always increases when a draw or a dealer's win occurs. If the dealer changes, it is called \"rinchan\" (輪荘) instead of \"renchan\", and happens for example by their \"nōten\" in the case of a draw. \n\nIn a state of \"n\" counters (suppose \"n\" is a number), when a player wins a hand by self-draw (\"tsumo\"), the player gets a bonus of \"n\" × 100 points from each of other three players for a total of \"n\" × 300, and when a player wins by claiming a discard (\"ron\", 栄), the player gets a bonus of \"n\" × 300 from the discarder.\n\nExample: \n\nOptionally, a rule may restriction of \"ryanhan-shibari\" (二飜縛り; literally \"two-\"han\" binding\"). Here, players must produce hands of two \"han\" or more from yaku when the honba count surpasses a certain number. Usually, this count is five or more.\n\nUnder the rule of \"chombo\" (チョンボ, 錯和 or 冲和), a player is given an infraction. Point penalties vary by organizations and/or events. Typically, a player pays a penalty of the same amount as \"mangan\" to other players in most rules. A non-dealer pays 4,000 to East and 2,000 to the other two players, while a dealer pays 4,000 to each. In other times, \"chombo\" does not affect the current score of the game; and instead, the penalty is applied at the end of the game. Chombo occurs for any of the following:\n\n\nIn game infractions, such as the false \"rīchi\" and invalid \"kan\" after \"rīchi\", they are caught only after draws or winning declarations by players who declared the \"rīchi\". If other players happen to win the hand, then the infractions are not revealed and therefore made null and void. Any \"rīchi\" bets are returned to the players after the end of a \"chombo\" hand.\n\nAfter the game is finished, the points of each of the three players other than the winner is rounded off to the nearest 1,000. The winner's points are the difference between 120,000 (30,000 × 4) and the total of these three players' points. The number of points is divided by 1,000, and 30 is finally subtracted from it. The sum of these final points is always zero. In most cases there are additional points transferred based on the players' final places (\"uma\"). (For example: 1st gets +20, 2nd gets +10, 3rd gets -10 and 4th gets -20)\n\nExample: The initial points are 25,000 each. A (winner): 43,600, B: 14,500, C: 15,400, D: 26,500, and rounded off to B:15,000, C:15,000, D:27,000. The number of the winner's points is calculated as follows irrespective of initial points: 120,000 − (15,000 + 15,000 + 27,000) = 63,000 (There sometimes happens the case like this. The result of the winner differs from 64,000 that was counted rounding 43,600 off and adding 4 × 5,000 (difference between 30,000 and initial points)). The final points and place: A:+33 (1st), D:−3 (2nd), C:−15 (3rd), B:−15 (4th). The 1st place is also counted like: (30 − 15) + (30 − 15) + (30 − 27) = +33.\n\nIn the optional rule \"wareme\" (割れ目, ワレメ; fissure, split), the player in front of whom the wall was split to indicate the end of the dead wall, acquires and pays double the normal points. They are doubled after the points for counters are added. It is often especially called \"oya-ware\" (親割れ; parent's \"wareme\") when the player is the dealer.\n\n\n"}

The power was used mostly with respect to matters of politics and religion (including blasphemy). It was certainly exercised by Edmund Tylney, who was Master from 1579 to 1610. Tylney and his successor, George Buck, also exercised the power to censor plays for publication. The Master of the Revels, who normally reported to the Lord Chamberlain, continued to perform the function until, with the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, stage plays were prohibited.

The film is a loose sequel to his 1998 film \"Happiness\", with new actors playing the same characters.\n\n\"Life During Wartime\" premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival, where it won the Golden Osella award for Best Screenplay.\n\nThe plot revolves around the Jordan sisters: Trish, Joy, and Helen. Joy has married Helen's former neighbor Allen Mellencamp, who continues to struggle with his compulsion to make obscene phone calls.\n\nTrish has been raising her three children, Billy (now off at college), Timmy and Chloe. She has begun dating recently divorced Harvey Weiner, who she hopes is normal. Trish's ex-husband, Bill has been released from prison after serving a sentence for child molestation, and heads to Florida to find out how his family, particularly his eldest son, are doing. He finds brief solace in a one-night stand with Jacqueline, a self-described \"monster\" as filled with loneliness and self-hatred as he is; however, she kicks him out the next morning when she catches him taking money from her purse.\n\nTrish's middle child, Timmy, is preparing for his bar mitzvah and trying to determine what it means to become a man. Trish has for years told Timmy and Chloe that Bill had died, to avoid telling them that he is a pedophile. Timmy finds out, however, and is angry at her that she lied to him. When he asks her about the mechanics of rape, Trish urges him to scream as soon as any man touches him.\n\nMeanwhile, Joy takes a break from Allen, and heads to Florida to spend time with Trish. She begins having visions of Andy, a former co-worker who had committed suicide shortly after dating her. She briefly goes to California to visit Helen, who has become a successful screenwriter, and calls her husband to leave a message that she is coming home. The audience sees that Allen has committed suicide. She returns to Florida to attend Timmy's bar mitzvah.\n\nIn the meantime, Bill sneaks into Trish's house to find Billy's college address. He pays Billy an unexpected visit at Northern Oregon University, where they discuss their past and the time that passed while Bill was in prison; in particular, Bill asks Billy a few very blunt questions about his sex life. Bill asks for forgiveness, but Billy refuses, saying his actions are unforgivable. Bill then disappears again, reassured that Billy will not turn out to be like him.\n\nHarvey brings his adult son Mark to dinner at Trish's, where he and Trish introduce their children to each other. At Timmy's request, Harvey comes to Timmy's room to have a talk. Timmy asks Harvey whether he is gay or a pedophile. Harvey denies being either, and, suspecting Timmy has been molested, tries to comfort him, touching his shoulder and hugging him. Terrified, Timmy starts to scream as per his mother's earlier instructions. Trish believes that Harvey tried to molest Timmy, and dumps him.\n\nTimmy has his bar mitzvah, during which Joy experiences visions of Andy and then Allen, who implores her to commit suicide as he has, but Joy refuses and banishes him from her life.

It features guest vocals from American rapper Eminem, who wrote the song alongside Skylar Grey and the producer Alex da Kid. It is the sequel to the 2010 hit single \"Love the Way You Lie\", which appears on Eminem's seventh studio album \"Recovery\". It received positive reviews from critics and was performed for at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, as part of a medley with \"What's My Name?\" and \"Only Girl (In the World)\".\n\nFollowing the release and commercial success of \"Love the Way You Lie\" in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna as the lead vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: \"When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's no way you can outdo that, so why compete with it?\". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.\n\n\"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" were based on a demo written and recorded in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater \"I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I have a little bit of a launching pad to put out my own stuff.\" Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on \"Loud\", saying \"As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too.\" The demo track by Grey is on her extended play \"The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey\", which was released on January 17, 2012.\n\nThe piano and drums version, which features Eminem, appears as the final song on the standard edition of \"Loud\", while the piano version, which excludes Eminem's part in the song, appears as a bonus track on the iTunes edition of \"Loud\". \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" is a mid-tempo song, which incorporates the musical genres of hip hop and R&B. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes, the song is written in common time with a moderate tempo of 83 beats per minute and is written in the key of G minor. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F to the high note of D. Emily Mackay of \"NME\" commented about the vocals provided by Rihanna and Eminem in the song, stating that \"There’s great contrast in Part II of ‘Love The Way You Lie’. With the balance of vocals neatly flipped and extra cavernous beats ramping up the drama, it wallows ever-deeper in the tortured relationship sketched out in Part I. Eminem at points is practically screaming with rage, and sounding, frankly, mental. The contrast with Rihanna’s smoothly pitched pain (“Maybe I’m a masochist/Try to run but I don’t wanna never leave”) is delicious.\"\n\nJon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" said that “\"Loud\" works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, maintaining the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until it gets to 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It’s purely theatrical, but it’s also, for a moment, raw. Christopher Richards of \"The Washington Post\" said that \"With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever.\" James Skinner of BBC Online viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, \"Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting.\"\n\nSteve Jones of \"USA Today\" gave a mixed review of the collaboration, commenting, \"Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a tortured relationship from his Recovery album.\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" writer Thomas Conner gave a negative review of the song, stating, \"She collaborated with Eminem this summer on the controversial '\"Love the Way You Lie\"', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on \"Loud\" with \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", an extension of the melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and hugging her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people.\"\n\nBoth the original and the piano version of \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" were not made available to purchase individually in the majority of iTunes stores, and could only be bought along with the iTunes edition of the album. However, the song may be purchased separately as part of the album INdependent omen Volume II. It debuted on Canadian Hot 100 for the week of December 4, 2010, at number 19 and stayed on the chart for eight weeks. In South Korea, it peaked at number four on the International Chart. The song also debuted and peaked at number 160 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong digital sales upon the release of \"Loud\".\n\nRihanna performed a shortened version of the song as part of a medley with \"What's My Name?\" and \"Only Girl (In the World)\" at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010. Rihanna opened the performance singing an acappella version of \"Love The Way You Lie (Part II)\". She was sitting on a stylized tree hovering above a field of sable-colored blades of grass. Once she had finished the first frame of the song, she plummeted from the tree to the ground. She reemerged from the fog revealing a changed costume now consisting of a black-and-white bra top and shorts singing \"What's My Name?\". The performance featured an accompaniment of background dancers. Rihanna then ended the performance after transitioning into \"Only Girl\", which featured drummers and a background of fire for the finale.\n\nRihanna and Eminem performed the song together for the first time at the 53rd Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011 as part of a medley with \"I Need a Doctor\" performed by Eminem, Dr. Dre, Skylar Grey and Adam Levine from Maroon 5, who provided background vocals. The performance started with Rihanna singing on a B-stage in the middle of the audience, accompanied by Adam Levine on the keys. Eminem then appeared on the main stage to perform his part of the song, whilst Rihanna made her way from the B-stage to join him. The song then transitioned into \"I Need a Doctor\", where Dr. Dre emerged to join up with Skylar Grey for her debut performance. The song is also included in the encore section of Rihanna's Loud Tour, along with \"Umbrella\". Rihanna performed \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the eighth song on the set list.\n\n\nPersonnel adapted from the liner notes of \"Loud\".\n\n"}

{"id": "250649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250649", "title": "Media of China", "text": "Media of China\n\nThe Media of the People's Republic of China (alternatively Media of China, Chinese Media) consists primarily of television, newspapers, radio, and magazines. Since 2000, the Internet has also emerged as an important form of communication by media, and is placed under the supervision of the Chinese government.\n\nSince the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and until the 1980s, almost all media outlets in Mainland China were state-run. Independent media outlets only began to emerge at the onset of economic reforms, although state-run media outlets such as \"Xinhua\", CCTV, and \"People's Daily\" continue to hold significant market share. Independent media that operate within the PRC (excluding Hong Kong and Macau, which have separate media regulatory bodies) are no longer required to strictly follow journalistic guidelines set by the Chinese government. Hong Kong, though, is witnessing increasing complaints about self-censorship. However, regulatory agencies, such as the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) and the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT), continue to set strict regulations on subjects considered taboo by the government, including but not limited to the legitimacy of the Communist Party, government policies in Tibet and Xinjiang, pornography, and the banned religious topics, such as the Dalai Lama and the Falun Gong.\n\nDespite heavy government monitoring, however, the Mainland Chinese media has become an increasingly commercial market, with growing competition, diversified content, and an increase in investigative reporting. Areas such as sports, finance, and an increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face little regulation from the government. Media controls were most relaxed during the 1980s under Deng Xiaoping, until they were tightened in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests. They were relaxed again under Jiang Zemin in the late 1990s, but the growing influence of the Internet and its potential to encourage dissent led to heavier regulations again under the government of Hu Jintao. Reporters Without Borders consistently ranks China very poorly on media freedoms in their annual releases of the Press Freedom Index, labeling the Chinese government as having \"the sorry distinction of leading the world in repression of the Internet\". For 2010, China ranked 168 out of 178 nations.\n\nThe government is heavily involved in the media in the PRC, and the largest media organizations (namely CCTV, the People's Daily, and Xinhua) are agencies of the Party-State: \"The first social responsibility and professional ethic of media staff should be understanding their role clearly and being a good mouthpiece. Journalists who think of themselves as professionals, instead of as propaganda workers, are making a fundamental mistake about identity,\" Hu Zhanfan, the president of CCTV. Media taboos include topics such as the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China, the governance of Tibet, and Falun Gong. Within those restrictions there is a diversity of the media and fairly open discussion of social issues and policy options within the parameters set by the Party.\n\nThe diversity in mainland Chinese media is partly because most state media outlets no longer receive heavy subsidies from the government, and are expected to cover their expenses through commercial advertising. They can no longer merely serve as mouthpieces of the government, but also need to attract advertising through programming that people find attractive. While the government issues directives defining what can be published, it does not prevent, and in fact encourages outlets to compete for viewers and advertising.\n\nThe era of Government control over the Mainland Chinese media, however, has not come to an end. For example, the Government utilises financial incentives to manipulate journalists. Recently, though, the Government's command over the nation's media has begun to falter. Despite government restrictions, much information is gathered either at the local level or from foreign sources and passed on through personal conversations and text messaging. This paired with the withdrawal of government media subsidies has caused many newspapers (including some owned by the Communist Party) in tabloids to take bold editorial stands critical of the government, as the necessity to attract readers and avoid bankruptcy has been a more pressing fear than government repression.\n\nIn addition, the traditional means of media control have proven extremely ineffective against newer forms of communication, most notably text messaging.\n\nAlthough the government can and does use laws concerning state secrets to censor press reports about social and political conditions, these laws have not prevented the press from all discussion of Chinese social issues. As a result, even papers which are nominally owned by the Communist Party are sometimes very bold at reporting social issues. However, both commercial pressures and government restrictions have tended to cause newspapers to focus on lurid scandals often involving local officials who have relatively little political cover, and Chinese newspapers tend to lack depth in analysis of political events, as this tends to be more politically sensitive.\n\nAmong social issues first reported in the press of mainland China include the unsafe state of mines in mainland China. In addition, the SARS coverup was first revealed by a fax to CCTV which was forwarded to Western news media.\n\nIn 1978, the PRC had less than one television receiver per 100 people, and fewer than ten million Chinese had access to a television set. According to a World Bank report in 2003, there are about 35 TVs for every 100 people. Roughly a billion Chinese have access to television. Similarly, in 1965 there were 12 television and 93 radio stations in mainland China; today there are approximately 700 conventional television stations—plus about 3,000 cable television channels—and 1,000 radio stations.\n\nTelevision broadcasting is controlled by China Central Television (CCTV), which, with its 22 program channels, is the country's only national network. CCTV, which employs about 10,000 people and has an annual income of ¥1.12 billion yuan a year (2012,=$177 million U.S. dollars), falls under the dual supervision of the Propaganda Department, responsible ultimately for media content, and the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television, which oversees operations. A Vice Minister in the latter ministry serves as chairman of CCTV. The network's principal directors and other officers are appointed by the State. So are the top officials at local conventional television stations in mainland China—nearly all of which are restricted to broadcasting within their own province or municipality—that receive CCTV broadcasts.\n\nCCTV produces its own news broadcasts three times a day and is the country's most powerful and prolific television program producer. It also has a monopoly on purchases of programming from overseas. All local stations are required to carry CCTV's 7 pm main news broadcast; an internal CCTV survey indicates that nearly 500 million people countrywide regularly watch this program.\n\nEven if CCTV is the most powerful network of mainland China, it has only about 30% of audience share all over the national territory. The fact shows how the Chinese viewers are biased in favor of local TV programs, that are more likely to represent the differences of an audience that is the largest in the world, more than the national or even international programs, that can hardly attend the needs of such a wide public.\n\nSince September 1, 2006, the Chinese government has banned foreign-produced animation between the hours of 5:00 to 8:00 pm on state-run television to protect struggling Chinese animation studios affected by the popularity of such cartoons.\n\nThe number of newspapers in mainland China has increased from 42—virtually all Communist Party papers—in 1968 to 382 in 1980 and more than 2,200 today. By one official estimate, there are now more than 7,000 magazines and journals in the country. The number of copies of daily and weekly newspapers and magazines in circulation grew fourfold between the mid-1960s and the mid-to-late 1980s, reaching 310 million by 1987.\n\nThese figures, moreover, underreport actual circulation, because many publishers use their own distribution networks rather than official dissemination channels and also deliberately understate figures to circumvent taxation. In addition, some 25,000 printing houses and hundreds of individual bookstores produce and sell unofficial material—mostly romance literature and pornography but also political and intellectual journals.\n\nMuch of the information collected by the Chinese mainstream media is published in neicans (internal, limited circulation reports prepared for the high-ranking government officials), not in the public outlets.\n\nThe media and communications industry in mainland China is administered by various government agencies and regulators. The principal mechanism to force media outlets to comply with the Communist Party's requests is the vertically organized \"nomenklatura\" system of cadre appointments, and includes those in charge of the media industry.\n\n\nThe media in mainland China also are becoming more autonomous and more diverse. Since Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the subsequent emergence of Deng Xiaoping (who died in February 1997) as the country's paramount leader, an overall climate of economic and social reform in mainland China has been reflected in media content.\n\nA prime example of the liberalisation has been the party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, which had been rigidly controlled under Mao, used against his enemies, and copied verbatim by every other newspaper in the country during the Cultural Revolution. This leading daily was reformed and enlivened in the late 1970s and early-to-middle 1980s by then editor-in-chief Hu Jiwei. Hu expanded the paper's size and coverage, encouraged public criticism through letters to the editor, called for promulgation of a press law to spell out journalists' rights, and introduced a sprightlier writing style.\n\nNevertheless, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that China \"continues to be the world's leading jailer of journalists,\" with 42 imprisoned journalists at the end of 2004, and accuses private companies, both foreign and domestic, of having been complacent toward or complicit with government censorship. Also, in their \"Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007 \", Reporters Without Borders ranked China 163rd (or 7th from bottom) in terms of press freedom. Freedom House issued a report in 2006 claiming that the Internet is still closely monitored by the state, with access to websites and publications critical of the government being restricted, as well as foreign satellite television and radio broadcasts being censored.\n\nIn preparation of the 17th National Party Congress in 2007, new restrictions were placed on all sectors of the press, Internet-users, bloggers, website managers, foreign journalist, more than 30 of which have been arrested since the start of the year. In addition, a thousand discussion forums and websites have been shut down, and \"a score of dissidents\" have been imprisoned since July 2007.\n\nIn efforts to stem growing unrest in China, the propaganda chief of the State Council, Hua Qing, announced in the People's Daily that the government was drafting a new press law that would lessen government involvement in the news media. In the editorial, CPC General secretary, President Hu Jintao was said to have visited the People's Daily offices and said that large scale public incidents should be \"accurately, objectively and uniformly reported, with no tardiness, deception, incompleteness or distortion\". Recent reports by Chinese media indicate a gradual release from party control. For example, the detention of anti-government petitioners placed in mental institutions was reported in a state newspaper, later criticised in an editorial by the English-language \"China Daily\". Scholars and journalists believe that such reports are a small sign of opening up in the media.\n\nThe media's growing autonomy has been reflected in their increasingly diversified content. Since the late 1970s, despite periodic reversals, media in mainland China have frequently criticized party cadres and have published debates on such fundamental issues as the rule of law, freedom of the press, and universal human rights. They also have reported on a myriad of previously untouched social and lifestyle subjects. The only inviolable restrictions appear to be an unwritten ban on challenges to the party's right to rule and to the legitimacy and decision-making authority of top party leaders.\n\nTalk radio in mainland China allows a much freer exchange of views than other media formats. In effect, talk radio has shifted the paradigm from authorities addressing the people to people addressing the authorities. For example, until 1991 the 14 million inhabitants of Shanghai were served by only one radio station—Radio Shanghai—which primarily aired predictable, pro-government propaganda. Today, there are over 100 talk radio stations throughout the Shanghai area.\n\nMagazines and journals published in mainland China also have become much less inhibited in their coverage. These publications appear to enjoy more freedom than newspapers, which in turn have more leeway than radio (other than talk radio) and television. Magazines now print internal police reports on jailings of religious leaders and other dissidents. The State is unwilling to shut down such publications because it worries about public reaction, is anxious to avoid drawing more popular attention to the magazines, and knows that its own resources are already stretched thin.\n\nChinese journalists in Hong Kong on occasion have written politically controversial articles for mainland intellectual journals without encountering problems. Such opportunities have abounded because of the range of publications on the Chinese mainland and because party officials there are too busy with weightier matters to review such journals systematically.\n\nMainland China's rapid economic development, as well as educational advances leading to greater literacy, have been important reasons for the dramatic expansion of the media and the diversification of coverage.\n\n\nOther overarching factors that are helping to make the mainland Chinese media more and diverse include a general decline in the influence of political ideologies and systems of belief; growing Chinese popular skepticism toward authority; increased contact with the West; greater competition in the media market; ebbing government resources; improved professional training for journalists; and new communication technologies.\n\nThe waning influence of Marxist–Leninist–Maoist thought has weakened the State's ability to use the media to shape public attitudes and has made it harder for the authorities to penalize the media for publishing material that is not strictly consistent with Marxist theory. Although Marxism remains the official doctrine of the PRC, the de-emphasis of ideology has strengthened the media's hand in two fundamental ways: it has helped undercut government efforts to indoctrinate the public and micromanage the content of political and social reporting in the media, and it has opened the door for the media to pursue capitalist marketing practices that respond to customer wants and bring increasing financial independence from the State.\n\nOther practices that are emerging in mainland China, such as decision making based on verifiable data and stronger quality controls on information, also have helped dilute the impact of ideology. In a change driven by the dual need for scientists to have reliable data with which to work and for the business sector to use in making investment and commercial decisions, the State Statistical Board since the mid-1980s has gained increased power to acquire and disseminate data for media and business use, reducing or eliminating the hither to common practice in which each sector used \"its own\" data.\n\nAlthough difficult to quantify, growing skepticism toward authority in mainland China appears to be spurring public support for media criticism (often indirect and carefully couched) of the State and slowly diluting the legitimacy of the party . This rise in skepticism is reported by informed observers to be occurring all across East Asia. Such observers point to increased publicity given to cases of official corruption, malfeasance, and ineptness—along with broader declines in social values such as civility and respect—as at least partly responsible for greater media and popular doubts about elected and appointed officials as compared to the past. At the same time, public skepticism of authority can and often does include skepticism toward the media themselves. Journalists, like individuals in other sectors of the mainland Chinese society, are far less willing than in the past to submit blindly to authority. Journalists were active participants in the 1989 demonstrations that culminated in the events at Tiananmen Square. The Tiananmen episode made it all but impossible to reconcile the growing desire of mainland Chinese journalists for control over their own profession with the party's interest in not letting that happen. There have even been occasional acts of open, outright defiance of the party, though these acts remain rare.\n\nCloser and more varied contact with the West appears to be increasingly influencing educated urban opinion in mainland China on concepts such as a free press, freedom of speech, and political pluralism . This phenomenon is consistent with trends elsewhere in East Asia, where principles such as freedom of expression and legal guarantees of individual rights are playing a growing role. Many mainland Chinese journalists trained or educated in the West appear to have an outlook that is much closer to Western ideals of media freedom than to the attitudes of other Chinese, although a gap persists between mainland China and the West in professionalism and in grasping the principles of objective journalism.\n\nVirtually all foreign reporters in mainland China operate under restrictions that are considerably more severe than in most Asian countries. One result is that Western media influence on mainland Chinese media agencies as a whole is generally limited.\n\nIntense competition for the media market is among the most important factors behind the emergence of more diverse and autonomous media in China. As indicated earlier in this study, efforts by the Chinese media to respond to an increasingly demanding print and broadcast market have created an expanding spectrum of media products ranging from serious news journalism to purely entertainment stories. Monetary rewards for meeting such demands continue to grow, resulting in greater financial autonomy for the growing numbers of Chinese media firms that win sizeable market shares. As a result, these companies are able to hire and retain more and better journalists, further boosting their capacity to compete. Commercialization thus has been a major liberating force for the media in China. The regime is far less able than before to wield financial leverage over the media, which have increasingly become self-supporting through advertising revenues and circulation. According to one estimate, advertising in all media forms increased 35-fold between 1981 and 1992. Print ad revenues jumped ten times between 1990 and 1995—from 1.5 billion yuan to 15 billion yuan.\n\nTelevision revenues also are growing dramatically: they totaled about $2 billion in 1995 and are expected to rise above $6 billion by 2005. In 1995, China Central Television earned nearly $150 million in advertising revenue, covering almost 90 percent of its total costs. In the past, radio and television tended to run well behind the print press in their news coverage. More recently, television has come under market pressure to be as timely, informative, and responsive as the print media.\n\nCompetition from outside mainland China has further impelled domestic media groups to become more diverse, assertive, and skeptical of official authority. For example, in order to compete against Hong Kong radio stations that could be heard in Guangdong Province, Guangdong radio managers created Pearl River Economic Radio (PRER) in 1986. PRER, copying Hong Kong radio's approach, began to emphasize daily life, entertainment, \"celebrity\" deejays, and caller phone-in segments, while eliminating ideological, preachy formats that included little information beyond what was provided by government sources. By 1987, PRER had obtained 55 percent of the Guangdong market; previously, Hong Kong radio stations had held 90 percent of this market. Local party cadre in southern China reportedly are unhappy about PRER, mainly because some of the station's commentators, as well as its talk radio programs, highlight party failures and the misdeeds of individual party members in the region.\n\nThe top national Chinese Communist Party papers (People's Daily, Guangming Daily, and Economic Daily)—which mostly feature party speeches, announcements, propaganda, and policy viewpoints—are steadily losing circulation and much-sought advertising revenues to evening municipal papers that have far more diverse content. For example, People's Daily's circulation fell from 3.1 million copies a day in 1990 to 2.2 million in 1995; the paper's 1994 advertising revenues were down as well. Moreover, its subscriptions consist overwhelmingly of mandatory ones by party and government agencies. Similarly, the Liberation Army Daily has become almost entirely dependent on State subsidies. Its circulation has fallen from 1.7 million in 1981 to fewer than 500,000 at present.\n\nBy contrast, the circulation of the Xinmin Evening News, operated by the Shanghai Municipal Government, has risen from 1.3 million to 1.7 million over the same time period. The Guangzhou Daily, owned by the Guangzhou Municipal Government, doubled its circulation in six years to 600,000 in 1994, and its ad revenues also were up.\n\nThe media also have attracted and are retaining more competent people than before. Journalism is widely seen as a more promising career field than in the past, while government work has lost much of its allure as other opportunities open up. At the same time, the explosion of business and entrepreneurial opportunities in recent years has complicated efforts by both the media and the government to attract good people. Journalism and government both face stiff competition from the relatively high salaries and profits available in the business sector. But the rising popularity and profitability of metropolitan evening newspapers offer the prospect that higher quality, better paid jobs in journalism will expand in the years ahead.\n\nImproved training, more education, and higher professional standards are bolstering the skills and confidence of journalists across East Asia, better positioning media outlets to gain positions of influence in their societies. Although mainland Chinese journalists only recently have begun to participate in these opportunities, there is some evidence that such training is having an effect. Many of the young mainland Chinese journalists being trained at US and other universities and professional programs in the West have been characterized by their trainers as \"smart,\" \"aware,\" and devoted to the profession.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, it became necessary in most cases for reporters to have a college education, and often a university degree, to get good jobs with the top party newspapers. The highly profitable evening papers, sponsored in the main by municipal governments, usually also require a college education.\n\nResidents of the Chinese mainland now receive more than 20 outside television channels by satellite, including Chinese-language services of CNN, Star TV, and the United States Information Agency. In the southern province of Guangdong, 97 percent of the households have television sets, and all—except those in a few parts of the city of Guangzhou, where reception is poor—have access to Hong Kong television through cable networks. Some local stations even intercept the signals and insert their own commercials. Beijing is unable to effectively monitor, let alone control, the illicit cable operators who have sprung up since the early 1990s. As of 1995, about 1,000 of the 3,000 cable stations in mainland China, linked to perhaps 50 million homes, were unlicensed.\n\nThe administration of satellite receivers falls under the jurisdiction of the State Administration for Radio, Film, and Television, which stipulates that foreign satellite televisions channels may only be received at high-end hotels and the homes and workplaces of foreigners. Foreign satellite televisions channels may seek approval to broadcast, but must be \"friendly toward China.\" Foreign television news channels are, in theory, ineligible for distribution in China.\n\nHome satellite dishes are officially illegal. Black market satellite dishes are nonetheless prolific, numbering well into the tens of millions. Chinese authorities engage in regular crackdowns to confiscate and dismantle illicit dishes, expressing concerns both over the potential for copyright infringements and over their ability receive \"reactionary propaganda.\"\n\nWidening Chinese use of the Internet is also undercutting government efforts to control the flow of information. According to CNNIC's 22nd Statistical Survey Report on the Internet Development in China, more than 250 million people in mainland China now have Internet access. \n\nSince the beginning of 1996, the State has suspended all new applications from Internet service providers seeking to commence operations in the PRC; moved to put all existing Internet services under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Electronics Industry, and the State Education Commission; and attempted—without much success—to establish firewalls, limit the contents of home pages, and block access to certain Internet sites through routing filters. Although much of the Internet access in China is subjugate to the so-called \"Great Firewall of China\", which blacklists certain websites and even blocks chat sessions, it has proven relatively ineffective: there are logistical problems with a firewall over such a large network, and in most instances its effects can be negated with a simple proxy. Government officials are worried that, as the number of Chinese homes with telephone lines grows from the present level of less than 4%, the State will become totally unable to monitor Internet access at residences.\n\nOver the last decade, the ways in which the Chinese Communist Party does its business—especially the introduction of reforms aimed at decentralizing power—have spurred greater media autonomy in several ways:\n\n\nProvincial broadcasters increasingly are trying to identify subjects on which the party will allow them more autonomy. Recent demands—unmet thus far—by such broadcasters include seeking authority to carry international news, to contract out television and radio programming to NGOs, and to explore possibilities for quasi-private media ownership.\n\nAs State resources have become stretched more thinly, the media have found it far easier than before to print and broadcast material that falls within vaguely defined grey areas, though again, this uncertainty can also work to the advantage of the party. Officials are too few, too busy, and often too incompetent to be able to micromanage the media as in the past. Prior to the 1990s, it was common for party and government officials to participate in the actual drafting of newspaper editorials. Now, for the most part, these officials merely discuss editorial policies with newspaper managers.\n\nIn the past, prime-time news on Chinese Central Television was routinely examined, prior to airing, by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television. Since 1994, however, the Ministry has ceased to prescreen CCTV news programs; now the programs are examined after they have aired. The diversity and quantity of material, moreover, have compelled officials to prioritize their reviews of broadcasts; the 7:00 pm news broadcasts, for instance, receive far more attention from the authorities than does the midnight news. In another manifestation of weakening government controls, recently launched news programs such as CCTV's Focal Report and Beijing Television's Express News include moderate criticisms of the party and government and explore some controversial public topics in an effort to make programs relevant to—and more popular with—viewers.\n\nEvidently acknowledging the limits on their ability to maintain tight control over an industry that has been expanding rapidly, party leaders during the last decade have publicly addressed the need to establish priorities. In particular, they have spoken of the high priority attached to maintaining control over the \"big media\"—national party papers and central and provincial TV and radio stations.\n\nMany PRC officials appear anxious to avoid confronting the media because they are afraid they will be accused of transgressions in newspapers, in magazines, or on television or radio. As media autonomy has expanded, print and broadcast organs have tried to flex their independence, albeit cautiously, in their coverage of State activities. Such coverage often focuses on specific government officials suspected of illegal actions and corruption.\n\nAlthough the media's leverage stems mostly from officials' worries that rival insiders will use such publicity against them, it also appears to reflect growing respect within Chinese officialdom for the emerging influence of public opinion. A case in point is the Beijing Youth Daily. This paper has been punished for criticizing government actions and policies, but the authorities have stopped short of shutting it down.\n\nAlthough the trend in mainland China clearly is toward greater media autonomy and diversity and away from government control and intimidation, crosscurrents of resistance persist. Powerful domestic institutions like the Central Propaganda Department and the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television still constrain efforts by the media to become more autonomous and politically diverse.\n\nBeijing still tries to compel the media to report positively on government activities and to limit negative coverage of official policies and actions. Neither the PRC Constitution—promulgated in 1982—nor the Communist Party-directed judiciary provides the media with meaningful legal protection from the State. Although Article 35 of the Constitution guarantees the citizens the rights of free speech, press, and assembly, in reality citizens do not have such rights. The authorities in Beijing continue to give precedence to the principles enunciated in the Constitution's preamble—including upholding Marxist–Leninist–Maoist thought and the party's leadership role.\n\nThe lack of an independent judiciary further hamstrings efforts by the media to mount court challenges against restrictions on media activities. The party appoints judges, and the position of the courts is merely equal to—not above—that of the bureaucracy. Media outrage over nationally publicized criminal cases can also bring pressure on members of the judiciary to act in ways that might be contrary to their initial desires and to the best interests of the defendants.\n\nThe government uses a variety of approaches to retain some control over the media:\n\n\nThe government also exploits a longstanding hierarchical relationship among Chinese print and broadcast entities in seeking to maintain some control over the media. It appoints the leaders of the most powerful media institutions, and then uses these entities to try to dominate the rest of the media countrywide.\n\nXinhua (the New China News Agency) and \"People's Daily\", the two most important print media, have status as separate government ministries; their directors sit on the party's Central Committee. Just below, hierarchically, are the two national newspapers under the control of the Propaganda Department – the Guangming Daily and the English-language\" China Daily\". These entities have the rank of vice ministries, as does the State Council-controlled Economic Daily. The National Propaganda Department appoints publishers, chief editors, and other key officials of the above-mentioned newspapers—plus a few others—while provincial and local party leaders make similar appointments for party papers in their jurisdictions.\n\nIn many ways, Xinhua is the fuel propelling mainland China's print media. Perhaps unique in the world because of its role, size, and reach, Xinhua reports directly to the party's Propaganda Department; employs more than 10,000 people—as compared to about 1,300 for the UK's Reuters, for example; has 107 bureaus worldwide both collecting information on other countries and dispensing information about mainland China; and maintains 31 bureaus in China—one for each province plus a military bureau. In as much as most of the newspapers in mainland China cannot afford to station correspondents abroad—or even in every province in mainland China—they rely on Xinhua feeds to fill their pages. People's Daily, for example, uses Xinhua material for approximately 25 percent of its stories.(b) Xinhua is a publisher as well as a news agency—it owns more than 20 newspapers and a dozen magazines, and it prints in Chinese, English, and four other languages.\n\nLike other government entities, Xinhua is feeling the pinch of reduced State financial subsidies. Beijing has been cutting funding to the news agency by an average of seven percent per year over the past three years, and State funds currently cover only about 40 percent of Xinhua's costs. As a result, the agency is raising revenues through involvement in public relations, construction, and information service businesses.\n\nIn the past, Xinhua was able to attract the top young journalists emerging from the universities or otherwise newly entering the field, but it can no longer do so as easily because of the appeal and resources of other newspapers and periodicals and the greater glamour of television and radio jobs. For example, midlevel reporters for the Xinmin Evening News often are given an apartment, whereas at Xinhua and People's Daily this benefit is reserved for the most senior journalists.\n\nLike many other media groups, Xinhua struggled to find the \"right line\" to use in covering the Tiananmen Square events of April–June 1989. Although more cautious than People's Daily in its treatment of sensitive topics during that period—such as how to commemorate reformist Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang's April 1989 death, the then ongoing demonstrations in Beijing and elsewhere, and basic questions of press freedom and individual rights—Xinhua gave some positive coverage to demonstrators and intellectuals who were questioning top party leaders. Even so, many Xinhua reporters were angry with top editors for not going far enough and for suppressing stories about the Tiananmen Square crackdown. For several days after the violence on June 4, almost no one at Xinhua did any work, and journalists demonstrated inside the Agency's Beijing compound.\n\nThe mainland Chinese media's internal publication system, in which certain journals are published exclusively for government and party officials, provides information and analysis not generally available to the public. The State values these internal reports because they contain much of mainland China's most sensitive, controversial, and high-quality investigative journalism.\n\nXinhua and many other media agencies produce reports for the \"internal\" journals (neicans). Informed observers note that journalists generally like to write for the internal publications—typically, only the most senior or most capable print and broadcast reporters are given such opportunities—because they can write less polemical and more comprehensive stories without having to omit unwelcome details as is commonly done in the print media directed to the general public. A Chinese historian has claimed, as an example of such self-censorship, that only a minority of China's population are aware 30 million people starved to death in the early 1960s, because the Party has never allowed the subject to be openly explored in the media. At the time, one of the Top Secret information channels through which news of what was really happening reached a select readership of high-level decision-makers was the Ministry of Public Security's Public Security Work Bulletin.\n\nThe PRC internal media publication system follows a strict hierarchical pattern designed to facilitate party control. A publication called Reference Information (Cankao Ziliao)—which includes translated articles from abroad as well as news and commentary by senior Xinhua reporters—is delivered by Xinhua personnel, rather than by the national mail system, to officials at the working level and above. A three-to-ten-page report called Internal Reference (Neibu Cankao) is distributed to officials at the ministerial level and higher. The most highly classified Xinhua internal reports, known as \"redhead reference\" (Hong Tou Cankao) reports, are issued occasionally to the top dozen or so party and government officials.\n\nHe Qinglian documents in chapter four of \"Media Control in China\", There are many grades and types of internal documents [neibu wenjian 内部文件]. Many are restricted to a certain level of official – such as county level, provincial level or down to a certain level of official in a ministry. Some Chinese journalists, including Xinhua correspondents in foreign countries, write for both the mass media and the internal media. The level of classification is tied to the administrative levels of Party and government in China. The higher the administrative level of the issuing office, generally the more secret the document is. In local government the issuing grades are province [sheng 省], region (or city directly subordinate to a province) [diqu 地区or shengzhixiashi 省直辖市] and county [xian 县]; grades within government organs are ministry [bu 部], bureau [ju 局] and office [chu 处]; in the military corps ([jun 军], division [shi 师], and regiment [tuan 团]. The most authoritative documents are drafted by the Central Committee to convey instructions from CCP leaders. Documents with Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Document [Zhonggong Zhongyang Wenjian 中共中央文件] at the top in red letters are the most authoritative.\n\nThere are signs the PRC internal media publication system is breaking down as more information becomes widely available in mainland China. A Hong Kong-based political journal circulated on the Chinese mainland has questioned the need for such a system in light of mainland China's modern telecommunications and expanding contacts with the outside world. Internal publications are becoming less exclusive; some are now being sold illegally on the street and are increasingly available to anyone with money.\n\nSome of the internal publications have changed substantially in an effort to avoid becoming obsolete. For example, the publication News Front—started in 1957 as a weekly tool for the Communist Party to instruct journalists on what to write—no longer was limited to that function when it reappeared after the Cultural Revolution. It continued to change gradually and is now a monthly publication that serves as a professional rather than political guide for journalists.\n\nAs of 2012 CCTV and Xinhua had greatly expanded international coverage and operations particularly in Africa.\n\nIn 2001 the Jamestown Foundation reported that China was buying into Chinese-language media in the U.S., offering free content, and leveraging advertising dollars—all to manipulate coverage.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39530149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39530149", "title": "Music in Varanasi", "text": "Music in Varanasi\n\nMusic in Varanasi is a tradition linked to the ancient times of the Pauranic legends. Lord Shiva, who is reported to have established this city, was credited with developing music and dance forms. Legend also attributes that Renu, son of sage Vishvamitra and Mahagobind, was the precursors of music tradition in Kashi (Varanasi) when nymphs (Apsaras), Gandharvas and Kinnaras were the traditional practitioners of this art form, and saint Chaitanya and Vallabhacharya were the pioneers in spreading this music tradition in Varanasi. Notable musicians of Varanasi include the iconic sitar player Ravi Shankar, the Shehnai maestro Bismillah Khan and singer Girija Devi. Varanasi has joined the global bandwagon of UNESCO \"Cities of Music\" under the Creative Cities Network. Varanasi chosen in music category of creative cities network clearly signifies the rich musical heritage of this ancient city.\n\nArcheological finds of figurines of apsaras playing musical instruments indicate that music has long been important to Varanasi. In medieval times, the Vaishnava Bhakthi movement swept through the country. Literature attests to the fact that the Kingdom of Kashi centering on Varanasi was a major centre for music. The noted saint musicians were Surdas, Kabir, Ravidas, Meera and Tulsidas.\n\nThe music culture of devotional music permeated in Varanasi during the neo-Vaishnava movement when holy men singing devotional songs attracted people to the fold of the Bhakthi movement.\n\nDuring the monarchic rule of Govind Chandra in the 16th century, the Dhrupad style of singing received royal patronage and led to other related forms of music such as Dhamar, Hori and Chaturanga. Under Muslim rulers, the Nawab of Awadh, the Nirgun singers of Kashi not only popularized the Assarwari, \"Ghunghat ke pat Khol\" song but also popularized the singing concerts such as festivals on the boats floating on the Ganges River. Some of the popular festivals were Jhoola, Jhoomar, Kajri, Birha, Dangal and Gulab Bari, a tradition which is continued even today. One of the singing styles made popular by Muslim artists Shori Miyan, Gammu Khan and Shade Khan during this time was the Tappa form of singing.\n\nIn recent times, the tutelary head, the Maharajas of Kashi of Varanasi, particularly Maharaj Prabhu Narayan Singh, have patronized music. During the Moghal Emperor Bahadur Shah II's reign, the noted musicians were Waris Ali, Akbar Ali, Nisar Khan, Sadiq Ali and Ashiq Ali Khan. Ali Mohammad and Ali Bux, the sons of Basat Khan, who were hailed as the \"jewels\" of the Royal court of Kashi. During this time, the local music styles which developed were the Banarasi Thumri, Dadra, Chaiti, Hori, Bhairavi, Kajri, Tarana, Ghato and many more. In addition, new forms were created such as Tirwat, Sadra, Khamsa, Lavni, Chaturang, Sargam, Ragmala, Kirtan, Qauwali, Kathagayan, Bhajan and Ramayan kirtan. Two hundred years ago, Pandit Ram Sahai developed the Benares gharana of the tabla, and within this genre, the notable musicians include Kishan Maharaj, Samta Prasad, Kumar Bose, and Samar Saha. A class of musicians, \"gandharva\", train their daughters in music and dancing.\n\nThe Varanasi School of Music that has evolved is very similar to the Lucknow style (gharana) of music and has also imbued local folk traditions of \"chaiti\" and \"kajri\". This form of music spread quickly. Shankara Deva, a devotional music singer saint in his own right, was instrumental in composing Bhakthi songs. Biajis, a courtesan sect of Varanasi, are credited with maintaining and contributing to the traditions of Hindustani music and dance in Varanasi.\n\nSeveral of India's most talented musicians hailed/hail from Varanasi. Pandit Ravi Shankar, the famous sitar player and musicologist who was given Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the country was a native of Varanasi. Ustad Bismillah Khan, an iconic Shehnai maestro who was also honoured with the Bharat Ratna also came from Varanasi. Jotin Bhattacharya, an iconic Sarod maestro and the disciple of Baba Allauddin Khan also come from Varanasi. Mian Tansen (Ata Ali Khan), musician of Mughal emperor Akbar's court, may have been born in Varanasi.\n\nGirija Devi, the classical singer of thumris (semi-classical Indian music), was born in Varanasi and she was instrumental in elevating music to a status of respectability and appreciation.\nNotable musicologists from Varanasi include Prem Lata Sharma and Jayadeva Singh.\n\nThe most notable musical instruments of Varanasi are the sitar and the shehnai.\nNot only tabla (a set of two small drums which is the percussion instrument of India) but also sitar are good to buy in Varanasi. In case of sitar, the wood they are made from is important to verify and consult a local artist. Instruments made of mango tree wood is inferior in quality compared to the ones made with teak or from the a herbal tree known as \"vijyasar\".\n\nDrupad Festival, a music festival of Hindustani classical music, is held for 3 days at Tulsi Ghat in March/April every year, while Sankat Mochan Sangeet Samaroh is held in April and May. Other music festivals are held during the time of religious festivals, such as Kartik Purnima (November), Buddha Purnima (May), and Shivaratri (March). There is an International Music Centre Ashram in Varanasi where classical music by budding artists is held regularly.\n"}

{"id": "204406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=204406", "title": "Pastoral", "text": "Pastoral\n\nA pastoral lifestyle (see pastoralism) is that of shepherds herding livestock around open areas of land according to seasons and the changing availability of water and pasture. It lends its name to a genre of literature, art, and music that depicts such life in an idealized manner, typically for urban audiences. A \"pastoral\" is a work of this genre, also known as bucolic, from the Greek , from , meaning a cowherd.\n\nPastoral is a mode of literature in which the author employs various techniques to place the complex life into a simple one. Paul Alpers distinguishes pastoral as a mode rather than a genre, and he bases this distinction on the recurring attitude of power; that is to say that pastoral literature holds a humble perspective toward nature. Thus, pastoral as a mode occurs in many types of literature (poetry, drama, etc.) as well as genres (most notably the pastoral elegy).\n\nTerry Gifford, a prominent literary theorist, defines pastoral in three ways in his critical book \"Pastoral\". The first way emphasizes the historical literary perspective of the pastoral in which authors recognize and discuss life in the country and in particular the life of a shepherd. This is summed up by Leo Marx with the phrase \"No shepherd, no pastoral.\" The second type of the pastoral is literature that \"describes the country with an implicit or explicit contrast to the urban.\" The third type of pastoral depicts the country life with derogative classifications.\n\nHesiod's \"Works and Days\" presents a 'golden age' when people lived together in harmony with nature. This Golden Age shows that even before Alexandria, ancient Greeks had sentiments of an ideal pastoral life that they had already lost. This is the first example of literature that has pastoral sentiments and may have begun the pastoral tradition. Ovid's Metamorphoses is much like the \"Works and Days\" with the description of ages (golden, silver, brazen, iron and human) but with more ages to discuss and less emphasis on the gods and their punishments. In this artificially constructed world, nature acts as the main punisher. Another example of this perfect relationship between man and nature is evident in the encounter of a shepherd and a goatherd who meet in the pastures in Theocritus' poem \"Idylls 1\".\nTraditionally, pastoral refers to the lives of herdsmen in a romanticized, exaggerated, but representative way. In literature, the adjective 'pastoral' refers to rural subjects and aspects of life in the countryside among shepherds, cowherds and other farm workers that are often romanticized and depicted in a highly unrealistic manner. The pastoral life is usually characterized as being closer to the Golden age than the rest of human life. The setting is a Locus Amoenus, or a beautiful place in nature, sometimes connected with images of the Garden of Eden. An example of the use of the genre is the short poem by the 15th-century Scottish makar Robert Henryson \"Robene and Makyne\" which also contains the conflicted emotions often present in the genre. A more tranquil mood is set by Christopher Marlowe's well known lines from \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\":\n\n\"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\" exhibits the concept of Gifford's second definition of pastoral. The speaker of the poem, who is the titled shepherd, draws on the idealization of urban material pleasures to win over his love rather than resorting to the simplified pleasures of pastoral ideology. This can be seen in the listed items: \"lined slippers,\" \"purest gold,\" \"silver dishes,\" and \"ivory table\" (lines 13, 15, 16, 21, 23). The speaker takes on a voyeuristic point of view with his love, and they are not directly interacting with the other true shepherds and nature.\n\nPastoral shepherds and maidens usually have Greek names like Corydon or Philomela, reflecting the origin of the pastoral genre. Pastoral poems are set in beautiful rural landscapes, the literary term for which is \"locus amoenus\" (Latin for \"beautiful place\"), such as Arcadia, a rural region of Greece, mythological home of the god Pan, which was portrayed as a sort of Eden by the poets. The tasks of their employment with sheep and other rustic chores is held in the fantasy to be almost wholly undemanding and is left in the background, abandoning the shepherdesses and their swains in a state of almost perfect leisure. This makes them available for embodying perpetual erotic fantasies. The shepherds spend their time chasing pretty girls — or, at least in the Greek and Roman versions, pretty lads as well. The eroticism of Virgil's second eclogue, \"Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin\" (\"The shepherd Corydon burned with passion for pretty Alexis\") is entirely homosexual.\n\nPastoral literature continued after Hesiod with the poetry of the Hellenistic Greek Theocritus, several of whose \"Idylls\" are set in the countryside (probably reflecting the landscape of the island of Cos where the poet lived) and involve dialogues between herdsmen. Theocritus may have drawn on authentic folk traditions of Sicilian shepherds. He wrote in the Doric dialect but the metre he chose was the dactylic hexameter associated with the most prestigious form of Greek poetry, epic. This blend of simplicity and sophistication would play a major part in later pastoral verse. Theocritus was imitated by the Greek poets Bion and Moschus.\n\nThe Roman poet Virgil adapted pastoral into Latin with his highly influential \"Eclogues\". Virgil introduces two very important uses of pastoral, the contrast between urban and rural lifestyles and political allegory most notably in Eclogues 1 and 4 respectively. In doing so, Virgil presents a more idealized portrayal of the lives of shepherds while still employing the traditional pastoral conventions of Theocritus. He was the first to set his poems in Arcadia, an idealized location to which much later pastoral literature will refer.\n\nHorace's The Epodes, ii Country Joys has \"the dreaming man\" Alfius, who dreams of escaping his busy urban life for the peaceful country. But as \"the dreaming man\" indicates, this is just a dream for Alfius. He is too consumed in his career as a usurer to leave it behind for the country.\n\nLater Silver Latin poets who wrote pastoral poetry, modeled principally upon Virgil's Eclogues, include Calpurnius Siculus and Nemesianus and the author(s) of the Einsiedeln Eclogues.\n\nItalian poets revived the pastoral from the 14th century onwards, first in Latin (examples include works by Petrarch, Pontano and Mantuan) then in the Italian vernacular (Sannazaro, Boiardo). The fashion for pastoral spread throughout Renaissance Europe. In Spain, Garcilaso de la Vega was an important pioneer and his motifs find themselves renewed in the 20th-century Spanish-language poet Giannina Braschi. Leading French pastoral poets include Marot and Ronsard.\nThe first pastorals in English were the \"Eclogues\" (c. 1515) of Alexander Barclay, which were heavily influenced by Mantuan. A landmark in English pastoral poetry was Spenser’s \"The Shepheardes Calender\", first published in 1579. Spenser's work consists of twelve eclogues, one for each month of the year, and is written in dialect. It contains elegies, fables and a discussion of the role of poetry in contemporary England. Spenser and his friends appear under various pseudonyms (Spenser himself is \"Colin Clout\"). Spenser's example was imitated by such poets as Michael Drayton (\"Idea, The Shepherd's Garland\") and William Browne (\"Britannia's Pastorals\"). During this period of England's history, many authors explored \"anti-pastoral\" themes. Two examples of this is Sir Philip Sidney's “The Twenty-Third Psalm” and “The Nightingale” focus on the world in a very anti-pastoral view. In “The Twenty-Third Psalm,” Nature is portrayed as something we need to be protected from, and in “The Nightingale,” the woe of Philomela is compared to the speaker's own pain. Additionally, he wrote \"Arcadia\" which is filled with pastoral descriptions of the landscape. \"The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd\" (1600) by Sir Walter Raleigh also comments on the anti-pastoral as the nymph responds realistically to the idealizing shepherd of \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\" by embracing and explaining the true course of nature and its incompatibility with the love that the Shepherd yearns for with the nymph.\n\nIn the 17th century came the arrival of the Country house poem. Included in this genre is Aemilia Lanyer’s \"The Description of Cooke-ham\" in 1611, in which a woman is described in terms of her relationship to her estate and how it mourns for her when she leaves it. In 1616, Ben Jonson wrote \"To Penshurst,\" a poem in which he addresses the estate owned by the Sidney family and tells of its beauty. The basis of the poem is a harmonious and joyous elation of the memories that Jonson had at the manor. It is beautifully written with iambic pentameter, a style that Jonson so eloquently uses to describe the culture of Penshurst. It is very important to note the insertion of Pan and Bacchus as notable company of the manor. Pan, Greek god of the Pastoral world, half man and half goat, was connected with both hunting and shepherds; Bacchus was the god of wine, intoxication and ritual madness. This reference to Pan and Bacchus in a pastoral view demonstrates how prestigious Penshurst was, to be worthy in the company with gods, notions of just how romanticized the estate was.\n\n\"A Country Life\", another 17th-century work by Katherine Philips, was also a country house poem. Philips focuses on the joys of the countryside and looks upon the lifestyle that accompanies it as being \"the first and happiest life, when man enjoyed himself.\" She writes about maintaining this lifestyle by living detached from material things, and by not over-concerning herself with the world around her. Andrew Marvell's \"Upon Appleton House\" was written when Marvell was working as a tutor for Lord Fairfax's daughter Mary, in 1651. The poem is very rich with metaphors that relate to religion, politics and history. Similar to Jonson's \"To Penshurst\", Marvell's poem is describing a pastoral estate. It moves through the house itself, its history, the gardens, the meadows and other grounds, the woods, the river, his Pupil Mary, and the future. Marvell used nature as a thread to weave together a poem centered around man. We once again see nature fully providing for man. Marvell also continuously compares nature to art and seems to point out that art can never accomplish on purpose what nature can achieve accidentally or spontaneously.\n\nRobert Herrick's \"The Hock-cart, or Harvest Home\" was also written in the 17th century. In this pastoral work, he paints the reader a colorful picture of the benefits reaped from hard work. This is an atypical interpretation of the pastoral, given that there is a celebration of labor involved as opposed to central figures living in leisure and nature just taking its course independently. This poem was mentioned in Raymond Williams', \"The Country and the City\". This acknowledgment of Herrick's work is appropriate, as both Williams and Herrick accentuate the importance of labor in the pastoral lifestyle.\n\nThe pastoral elegy is a subgenre that uses pastoral elements to lament a death or loss. The most famous pastoral elegy in English is John Milton's \"Lycidas\" (1637), written on the death of Edward King, a fellow student at Cambridge University. Milton used the form both to explore his vocation as a writer and to attack what he saw as the abuses of the Church. Also included is Thomas Gray's, \"Elegy on a Country Churchyard\" (1750).\n\nThe formal English pastoral continued to flourish during the 18th century, eventually dying out at the end. One notable example of an 18th-century work is Alexander Pope's \"Pastorals\" (1709). In this work Pope imitates Edmund Spenser's \"Shepheardes Calendar\", while utilizing classical names and allusions aligning him with Virgil. In 1717, Pope's \"Discourse on Pastoral Poetry\" was published as a preface to \"Pastorals.\" In this work Pope sets standards for pastoral literature and critiques many popular poets, one of whom is Spenser, along with his contemporary opponent Ambrose Phillips. During this time period Ambrose Phillips, who is often overlooked because of Pope, modeled his poetry after the Native English form of Pastoral, employing it as a medium to express the true nature and longing of Man. He strove to write in this fashion to conform to what he thought was the original intent of Pastoral literature. As such, he centered his themes around the simplistic life of the Shepherd, and, personified the relationship that humans once had with nature. John Gay, who came a little later was criticized for his poem's artificiality by Doctor Johnson and attacked for their lack of realism by George Crabbe, who attempted to give a true picture of rural life in his poem \"The Village.\"\n\nIn 1590, Edmund Spenser also composed a very famous pastoral epic called \"The Faerie Queene\", in which he employs the pastoral mode to accentuate the charm, lushness, and splendor of the poem's (super)natural world. Spenser alludes to the pastoral continuously throughout the work and also uses it to create allegory in his poem, with the characters as well as with the environment, both of which are meant to have symbolic meaning in the real world. It is composed of six books but Spenser intended to write twelve. He wrote the poem primarily to honor Queen Elizabeth. William Cowper addressed the artificiality of the fast-paced city life in his poems \"Retirement\" (1782) and \"The Winter Nosegay\" (1782). Pastoral nevertheless survived as a mood rather than a genre, as can be seen from such works as Matthew Arnold's \"Thyrsis\" (1867), a lament on the death of his fellow poet Arthur Hugh Clough. Robert Burns can be read as a Pastoral poet for his nostalgic portrayals of rural Scotland and simple farm life in \"To A Mouse\" and \"The Cotter's Saturday Night\". Burns explicitly addresses the Pastoral form in his \"Poem on Pastoral Poetry\". In this he champions his fellow Scot Allan Ramsey as the best Pastoral poet since Theocritus.\n\nAnother subgenre is the Edenic Pastoral, which alludes to the perfect relationship between God, man, and nature in the Garden of Eden. It typically includes biblical symbols and imagery. In 1645 John Milton wrote \"L'Allegro\", which translates as the happy person. It is a celebration of Mirth personified, who is the child of love and revelry. It was originally composed to be a companion poem to, \"Il Penseroso\", which celebrates a life of melancholy and solitude. Milton's, \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\" (1629) blends Christian and pastoral imagery.\n\nMilton is perhaps best known for his epic \"Paradise Lost\", one of the few Pastoral epics ever written. A notable part of Paradise Lost is book IV where he chronicles Satan’s trespass into paradise. Milton’s iconic descriptions of the garden are shadowed by the fact that we see it from Satan’s perspective and are thus led to commiserate with him. Milton elegantly works through a presentation of Adam and Eve’s pastorally idyllic, eternally fertile living conditions and focuses upon their stewardship of the garden. He gives much focus to the fruit bearing trees and Adam and Eve's care of them, sculpting an image of pastoral harmony. However, Milton in turn continually comes back to Satan, constructing him as a character the audience can easily identify with and perhaps even like. Milton creates Satan as character meant to destabilize the audience’s understanding of themselves and the world around them. Through this mode, Milton is able to create a working dialogue between the text and his audience about the ‘truths’ they hold for themselves.\n\nItalian writers invented a new genre, the pastoral romance, which mixed pastoral poems with a fictional narrative in prose. Although there was no classical precedent for the form, it drew some inspiration from ancient Greek novels set in the countryside, such as \"Daphnis and Chloe\". The most influential Italian example of the form was Sannazzaro's \"Arcadia\" (1504). The vogue for the pastoral romance spread throughout Europe producing such notable works as Bernardim Ribeiro \"Menina e Moça\" (1554) in Portuguese, Montemayor's \"Diana\" (1559) in Spain, Sir Philip Sidney's \"Arcadia\" (1590) in England, and Honoré d'Urfé's \"Astrée\" (1607–27) in France.\n\nPastoral drama also emerged in Renaissance Italy. Again, there was little Classical precedent, with the possible exception of Greek satyr plays. Poliziano's \"Orfeo\" (1480) shows the beginnings of the new form, but it reached its zenith in the late 16th century with Tasso's \"Aminta\" (1573), Isabella Andreini's \"Mirtilla\" (1588), and Guarini's \"Il pastor fido\" (1590). John Lyly's \"Endimion\" (1579) brought the Italian-style pastoral play to England. John Fletcher's \"The Faithful Shepherdess\", Ben Jonson's \"The Sad Shepherd\" and Sidney's \"The Lady of May\" are later examples. Some of Shakespeare's plays contain pastoral elements, most notably \"As You Like It\" (whose plot was derived from Thomas Lodge's pastoral romance \"Rosalynde\") and \"The Winter's Tale\", of which Act 4 Scene 4 is a lengthy pastoral digression.\n\nThe forest in \"As You Like It\" can be seen as a place of pastoral idealization, where life is simpler and purer, and its inhabitants live more closely to each other, nature and God than their urban counterparts. However, Shakespeare plays with the bounds of pastoral idealization. Throughout the play, Shakespeare employs various characters to illustrate pastoralism. His protagonists Rosalind and Orlando metaphorically depict the importance of the coexistence of realism and idealism, or urban and rural life. While Orlando is absorbed in the ideal, Rosalind serves as a mediator, bringing Orlando back down to reality and embracing the simplicity of pastoral love. She is the only character throughout the play who embraces and appreciates both the real and idealized life and manages to make the two ideas coexist. Therefore, Shakespeare explores city and country life as being appreciated through the coexistence of the two.\n\nTheocritus's \"Idylls\" include strophic songs and musical laments, and, as in Homer, his shepherds often play the syrinx, or Pan flute, considered a quintessentially pastoral instrument. Virgil's \"Eclogues\" were performed as sung mime in the 1st century, and there is evidence of the pastoral song as a legitimate genre of classical times.\n\nThe pastoral genre was a significant influence in the development of opera. After settings of pastoral poetry in the pastourelle genre by the troubadours, Italian poets and composers became increasingly drawn to the pastoral. Musical settings of pastoral poetry became increasingly common in first polyphonic and then monodic madrigals: these later led to the cantata and the serenata, in which pastoral themes remained on a consistent basis. Partial musical settings of Giovanni Battista Guarini's \"Il pastor fido\" were highly popular: the texts of over 500 madrigals were taken from this one play alone. Tasso's \"Aminta\" was also a favourite. As opera developed, the dramatic pastoral came to the fore with such works as Jacopo Peri's \"Dafne\" and, most notably, Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\". Pastoral opera remained popular throughout the 17th-century, and not just in Italy, as is shown by the French genre of \"pastorale héroïque\", Englishman Henry Lawes's music for Milton's \"Comus\" (not to mention John Blow's \"Venus and Adonis\"), and Spanish zarzuela. At the same time, Italian and German composers developed a genre of vocal and instrumental pastorals, distinguished by certain stylistic features, associated with Christmas Eve.\n\nThe pastoral, and parodies of the pastoral, continued to play an important role in musical history throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. John Gay may have satirized the pastoral in \"The Beggar's Opera\", but also wrote an entirely sincere libretto for Handel's \"Acis and Galatea\". Rousseau's \"Le Devin du village\" draws on pastoral roots, and Metastasio's libretto \"Il re pastore\" was set over 30 times, most famously by Mozart. Rameau was an outstanding exponent of French pastoral opera. Beethoven also wrote his famous Pastoral Symphony, avoiding his usual musical dynamism in favour of relatively slow rhythms. More concerned with psychology than description, he labelled the work \"more the expression of feeling than [realistic] painting\". The pastoral also appeared as a feature of grand opera, most particularly in Meyerbeer's operas: often composers would develop a pastoral-themed \"oasis\", usually in the centre of their work. Notable examples include the shepherd's \"alte Weise\" from Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\", or the pastoral ballet occupying the middle of Tchaikovsky's \"The Queen of Spades\". The 20th-century continued to bring new pastoral interpretations, particularly in ballet, such as Ravel's \"Daphis and Chloe\", Nijinsky's use of Debussy's \"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\", and Stravinsky's \"Le sacre du printemps\" and \"Les Noces\".\n\nThe Pastorale is a form of Italian folk song still played in the regions of Southern Italy where the zampogna continues to thrive. They generally sound like a slowed down version of a tarantella, as they encompass many of the same melodic phrases. The pastorale on the zampogna can be played by a solo zampogna player, or in some regions can be accompanied by the piffero (also commonly called a ciaramella, 'pipita', or bifora), which is a primitive key-less double reed oboe type instrument.\n\nIdealised pastoral landscapes appear in Hellenistic and Roman wall paintings. Interest in the pastoral as a subject for art revived in Renaissance Italy, partly inspired by the descriptions of pictures Sannazzaro included in his \"Arcadia\". The \"Fête champêtre\" (\"Pastoral Symphony\") attributed to Giorgione is perhaps the most famous painting in this style. Later, French artists were also attracted to the pastoral, notably Claude, Poussin (e.g. Et in Arcadia ego) and Watteau (in his \"Fêtes galantes\"). Thomas Cole has a series of paintings titled \"The Course of Empire\", and the second of these paintings (shown on the right) depicts the perfect pastoral setting.\n\nIn the past four hundred years, a range of writers have worked on theorizing the nature of pastoral. These include Friedrich Schiller, George Puttenham, William Empson, Frank Kermode, Raymond Williams, Renato Poggioli, Annabel Patterson, Paul Alpers, and Ken Hiltner.\n\nGeorge Puttenham was one of the first Pastoral theorists. He did not see the form as merely a recording of a prior rustic way of life but a guise for political discourse, which other forms had previously neglected. The Pastoral, he writes, has a didactic duty to “contain and enforme morall discipline for the amendment of mans behaviour”.\n\nFriedrich Schiller linked the Pastoral to childhood and a childlike simplicity. For Schiller, we perceive in nature an “image of our infancy irrevocably past”.\n\nSir William Empson spoke of the ideal of Pastoral as being embedded in varying degrees of ambivalence, and yet, for all the apparent dichotomies, and contradicting elements found within it, he felt there was a unified harmony within it. He refers to the pastoral process as 'putting the complex into the simple.' Empson argues that \"... good proletarian art is usually Covert Pastoral\", and uses Soviet Russia's propaganda about the working class as evidence. Empson also emphasizes the importance of the double plot as a tool for writers to discuss a controversial topic without repercussions.\n\nRaymond Williams argues that the foundation of the pastoral lies in the idea that the city is a highly urban, industrialized center that has removed us from the peaceful life we once had in the countryside. However, he states that this is really a \"myth functioning as a memory\" that literature has created in its representations of the past. As a result, when society evolves and looks back to these representations, it considers its own present as the decline of the simple life of the past. He then discusses how the city's relationship with the country affected the economic and social aspects of the countryside. As the economy became a bigger part of society, many country new-comers quickly realized the potential and monetary value that lay in the untouched land. Furthermore, this new system encouraged a social stratification in the countryside. With the implementation of paper money came a hierarchy in the working system, as well as the \"inheritance of titles and making of family names\".\n\nPoggioli was concerned with how death reconciled itself with the pastoral, and thus came up with a loose categorization of death in the pastoral as 'funeral elegy', the most important tropes of which he cites as religion (embodied by Pan); friendship; allegory;and poetic and musical calling. He concedes though that such a categorization is open to much misinterpretation. As well, Poggioli focused on the idea that Pastoral was a nostalgic and childish way of seeing the world. In \"The Oaten Flue\", he claims that the shepherd was looked up to was because they were “an ideal kind of leisure class.\"\n\nFrank Kermode discusses the pastoral within the historical context of the English Renaissance. His first condition of pastoral poetry is that it is an urban product. Kermode establishes that the pastoral is derived as an opposition between two modes of living, in the country and in the city. London was becoming a modern metropolis before the eyes of its citizens. The result of this large-scale urban sprawl left the people with a sense of nostalgia for their country way of living. His next argument focuses on the artificiality of poetry, drawing upon fellow theorist, Puttenham. Kermode elaborates on this and says, \"the cultivated, in their artificial way, reflect upon and describe, for their own ends, the natural life\". Kermode wants us to understand that the recreation or reproduction of the natural is in itself artificial. Kermode elaborates on this in terms of imitation, describing it as \"one of the fundamental laws of literary history\" because it \"gives literary history a meaning in terms of itself, and provides the channels of literary tradition\". Kermode goes on to explain about the works of Virgil and Theocritus as progenitors of the pastoral. Later poets would draw on these earlier forms of pastoral, elaborating on them to fit their own social context. As the pastoral was becoming more modern, it shifted into the form of Pastourelle. This is the first time that the pastoral really deals with the subject of love.\n\nAnnabel Patterson emphasizes many important ideas in her work, Pastoral and Ideology. One of these is that the pastoral mode, especially in the later 18th century, was interpreted in vastly different ways by different groups of people. As a result, distinctive illustrations emerged from these groups which were all variations of the understanding of Virgil’s Eclogues. Patterson explains that Servius' Commentary is essential to understanding the reception of Virgil's Eclogues. The commentary discusses how poets used analogy in their writings to indirectly express the corruption within the church and government to the public. When speaking of post-Romanticism, it is imperative to take into consideration the influence and effect of Robert Frost on pastoral ideology. His poem, \"Build Soil\" is a critique of war and also a suggestion that pastoral, as a literary mode, should not place emphasis on social and political issues, but should rather, as Patterson says, \"turn in upon itself, and replace reformist instincts with personal growth and regeneration\". William Wordsworth was a highly respected poet in the 1800s and his poem, \"Prelude,\" published in 1805, was an excellent example of what a dream of a new golden age might materialize as or look like.\n\nPaul Alpers, in his 1996 book, \"What is Pastoral?\", describes the recurring plot of pastoral literature as the lives of shepherds. With William Empson's notion of placing the complex into the simple, Alpers thus critically defines pastoral as a means of allegory. Alpers also classifies pastoral as a mode of literature, as opposed to a genre, and he defines the attitude of pastoral works maintaining a humble relationship with nature. Alpers also defines pastoral convention as the act of bringing together, and authors use this to discuss loss. He says the speakers in pastoral works are simple herdsmen dramatized in pastoral encounters. However, authors like Herrick changed the herdsmen to nymphs, maidens, and flowers. Thus, achieving a mode of simplicity but also giving objects voice. This is done by personifying objects like flowers. Moreover, authors that do this in their works are giving importance to the unimportant. Alpers talks about pastoral lyrics and love poems in particular. He says \"a lyric allows its speaker to slip in and out of pastoral guise and reveal directly the sophistication which prompted him to assume it in the first place″. In other words, he claims pastorals lyrics have both pastoral and not pastoral characteristics, perhaps like in the comparisons between urban and rural, but they always give importance to and enhance on the pastoral. Alpers talks about love poems and how they can be turned into pastoral poems simply by changing words like lover to shepherd. And he mentions Shakespeare as one of the authors who did this in his works. Furthermore, Alpers says the pastoral is not only about praise for the rural and the country side. For instance, Sidney dispraises the country life in \"The Garden\". Pastoral can also include the urban, the court, and the social like in \"L’Allegro\". Alpers says that pastoral narration contradicts “normal” narrative motives and that there is a double aspect of pastoral narration: heroic poetry and worldly realities with narrative motives and conventions. And in respect to pastoral novels, Alpers says pastoral novels have different definitions and examples depending on the reader. Also, the pastoral novel differs from Theocritus and Virgil’s works. He says there are pastoral novels of the country life, of the longing for the simple, and with nature as the protagonist. And says the literary category of pastoral novels is realistic and post-realistic fiction with a rural theme or subject based on traditional pastoral.\n\nIn \"What Else Is Pastoral?\", Ken Hiltner argues that Renaissance pastoral poetry is more often a form of nature writing than critics like Paul Alpers and Annabel Patterson give it credit for. He explains that even though there is a general lack of lavish description in Renaissance Pastoral, this is because they were beginning to use gestural strategies, and artists begin to develop an environmental consciousness as nature around them becomes endangered. Another argument presented in the book is that our current environmental crisis clearly has its roots in the Renaissance. To do this we are shown examples in Renaissance pastoral poetry that show a keen awareness of the urban sprawl of London contrasted to the countryside and historical records showing that many at the time were aware of the issue of urban growth and attempted to stop it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24338740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24338740", "title": "Rainbow Minute", "text": "Rainbow Minute\n\nThe Rainbow Minute is a serial radio show created and produced by Judd Proctor and Brian Burns. An article called \"The Rainbow Minute\" from the website \"Diversity Richmond\" describes Proctor's inspiration for the show, “In February of 2005, retired public school teacher Judd Proctor was out running errands, when he happened to tune in to “This Way Out,” a gay and lesbian international news magazine.” He, alongside his partner Brian Burns, who is a former art director, began underwriting \"This Way Out\" and their first airing was on February 16, 2005 with a dedication to Harvey Milk. They then moved on to create their own radio broadcast in Virginia called \"The Rainbow Minute\". The official website, WRIR.org, for \"The Rainbow Minute\" describes the show, “\"The Rainbow Minute\" is a radio show about gay and lesbian heroes, history and culture.” The two work as a team, with Judd doing the research and mixing, while Brian edits episodes and sets the music. Their first episode of \"The Rainbow Minute\" aired on September 25, 2006. It airs on WRIR in Richmond, Virginia and enjoys frequent airings on other radio stations across the United States. \"The Rainbow Minute\" documents the contributions and relationships of Lesbian and Gay people throughout history. Segments are read by a diverse group of volunteers. Those outside the Richmond, Virginia listening area can hear The Rainbow Minute at www.wrir.org every weekday at 7:59am, 12:29pm, and 4:59pm.\n\n\"Diversity Richmond\" is a voice and support system for the LGBT community that was founded in 1999. \"Diversity Richmond\" sponsors \"The Rainbow Minute\". Like \"The Rainbow Minute\", the \"Diversity Richmond\" is an organization that works for the equality of the LGBT community and gives people the opportunity to feel comfortable when around LGBT people, become involved in working for LGBT equality, and also become educated about the hardships LGBT people face daily and how we can make a difference. They hold numerous classes and discussion groups including a women’s coming out support group. \"The Rainbow Minute\" and \"Diversity Richmond\" both hold volunteer opportunities. \"The Rainbow Minute\" allows volunteers to become a talk show hosts, all-nighter DJs, weekday board operators, for example. \"Diversity Richmond\" has volunteer opportunities like diversity bingo and diversity thrift to help raise money for their organization and to also get more people involved. Phylis Johnson, author of \"Radio Cultures: The Sound Medium in American Life\", acknowledges that because of the Stonewall Rebellion, queer radio stations emerged across the United States with the help of volunteers (98). Volunteers make this organization and other radio station and media possible through their dedication and work.\n\nPreviously, there weren’t many radio stations having to do with LGBT communities because not many people identified with being LGBT due to lack of knowledge as to what the term LGBT meant. The only terms people referred to were gay, lesbian, or straight. An article by Bonnie Morris describes the history of gay and lesbian people, \"In the United States, few attempts to make advocacy groups supporting gay and lesbian relationships until after World War II, although prewar gay life flourished in urban centers such as Greenwich Village and Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s.\" Today, more and more radio stations and other forms of media are emerging that are geared specifically towards the LGBT community. Christopher Pullen and Margaret Cooper support this in their book \"LGBT Identity and Online New Media\" by describing the opportunities that online media give LGBT people to connect with each other, \"Through online new media, LGBTs offer person expressions of self, in the construction of public identity.\" In an article called “Romeo in love: a community format in a community radio,” Tiziana Cavallo talks about the video cast Romeo in Love, which was created in 2008 by one heterosexual and one gay friend (281). Like \"The Rainbow Minute\", it is a video cast about the lives of LGBT people. This video cast demonstrates the ways in which times have changed regarding associating with LGBT individuals and how people of different communities, such as heterosexual communities, racial communities, etc., are working together to create fairness and respect for everyone of the LGBT community. \"The Rainbow Minute\" and \"Diversity Richmond\" give people a place of comfort and safety that give them inspiration and hope for equality.\n\n"}
{"id": "2769133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2769133", "title": "Regency TR-1", "text": "Regency TR-1\n\nThe Regency TR-1 was the first commercially manufactured transistor radio. First sold in 1954, it was a novelty due to small size and portability; about 150,000 units were sold despite mediocre performance. The device demonstrated the use of transistors for consumer electronics; previously transistors had only been used in military or industrial applications. Surviving specimens are sought out by collectors.\n\nTwo companies—Texas Instruments of Dallas, Texas, and Industrial Development Engineering Associates (I.D.E.A.) of Indianapolis, Indiana—worked together to produce the Regency TR-1. Previously, Texas Instruments produced instrumentation for the oil industry and locating devices for the U.S. Navy—and I.D.E.A. built home television antenna boosters. The two companies worked together on the TR-1 to grow revenues for their respective companies by pioneering this new product area.\n\nIn May 1954, Texas Instruments had designed and built a prototype transistor radio and was looking for an established radio manufacturer to develop and market a radio using their transistors. No major radio maker, including RCA, Philco, and Emerson, was interested. The President of I.D.E.A. at the time, Ed Tudor, jumped at the opportunity to manufacture the TR-1, predicting sales of the transistor radios would be \"20 million radios in three years.\" The Regency Division of I.D.E.A announced the TR-1 on October 18, 1954, and put it on sale in November 1954. It was the first practical transistor radio made in significant numbers.\n\nOne year after the TR-1 release, sales approached 100,000 units. The look and size of the TR-1 were well received, but reviews of its performance were typically adverse. The Regency TR-1 is patented by Richard C. Koch, , former Project Engineer of I.D.E.A.\n\nThe Regency TR-1 circuitry was refined from the Texas Instruments prototype, reducing the number of parts, including two expensive transistors. Though this severely reduced the audio output volume, it let I.D.E.A. sell the radio for only a small profit. The initial TR-1 retail price was $49.95 (roughly $443 in year-2016 dollars) and it sold about 150,000 units.\n\nThe TR-1 used Texas Instruments' NPN transistors, hand-picked in sets of four. A 22.5 volt battery provided power, since the only way to get adequate radio frequency performance out of early transistors was to run them close to their collector-to-emitter breakdown voltage. The current drain from this battery was only 4 mA, allowing 20 to 30 hours of operation, in comparison to only several hours for the portable receivers based on vacuum tubes. Such battery consumption rate still made the TR-1 rather expensive to run.\n\nWhile the radio was praised for novelty and small size, the sensitivity and sound quality were behind the tube-based competitors. A review in \"Consumer Reports\" mentions the high level of noise and instability on certain radio frequencies, recommending against the purchase.\n\nI.D.E.A. outsourced the TR-1 exterior design to the industrial design firm of Painter, Teague and Petertil. The design was created within six weeks by way of telephone and design sketches exchanged by mail. The design won an award from the Industrial Design Society of New York and was selected by the Museum of Modern Art for the American Art and Design Exhibition in Paris in 1955.\n\nThe TR-1 was initially offered in black, bone white, mandarin red, and cloud gray. It was later uncommonly offered in olive green and mahogany. Other later, rare colors included lavender, pearl white, turquoise, pink, and lime. It was advertised as being 3\" x 5\" x 1.25\" and weighed 12 ounces including the 22.5 volt battery. It came in a cardboard box with the color stamped on the end. An optional earphone sold for $7.50.\n\nThe red triangles on the frequency dial mark the CONELRAD frequencies of 640 and 1240 kHz.\n\nThe TR-1 was a superheterodyne receiver made with four n-p-n transistors and one diode. It contained a single transistor converter stage, followed by two intermediate-frequency amplifier stages. After detection, a single-transistor stage amplified the sound frequency. All amplifier stages used common emitter amplifiers. Stages were transformer coupled, with tuned transformers for the intermediate frequency amplifiers and a miniature audio transformer for the loudspeaker. The intermediate frequency transformers were paired with capacitors, and hand tuned to the intermediate frequency (262 kHz) using movable cores.\n\nThe receiver had automatic gain control. The DC level of the detected signal was filtered with a large capacitor and used to control the gain of the first IF stage (VT2, first after the heterodyne).\n\nThe 22.5 V battery, while now uncommon, is still used in some devices and as of 2018 remains available on the market. The minimum required voltage is lower, about 15 V. The electrolytic capacitor is connected in parallel to the battery. It improves stability but would be damaged if the battery is reversed. The power switch was coupled with the volume control.\n\nThe initial six-transistor Texas Instruments design used a two-transistor converter stage with a separate oscillator, and a more powerful two-transistor sound amplifier.\n\nRegency began manufacturing the TR-1 on October 25, 1954. The manufacture was a collective effort by manufacturers around the country. The transistors and transformers came from Texas Instruments in Dallas. Capacitors came from International Electronics, Inc. of Nashville, Erie Electronics of Erie, Pennsylvania, and Centralab of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The speakers came from Jensen in Chicago, Illinois. IF transformers came from Vokar of Dexter, Michigan. The volume control came from the Chicago Telephone Supply in Elkhart, Indiana. The tuning capacitor came from Radio Condenser Co. in Camden, New Jersey. The Richardson Company in Melrose Park, Illinois and Indianapolis supplied the circuit board material to Croname in Chicago, who manufactured the circuit boards. The actual plastic case for the TR-1 was produced by Argus Plastics in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\n"}

{"id": "429356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429356", "title": "Simultaneous substitution", "text": "Simultaneous substitution\n\nSimultaneous substitution (also known as simsubbing or signal substitution) is a practice mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) requiring broadcast distribution undertakings (BDUs) in Canada to distribute the signal of a local or regional over-the-air station in place of the signal of a foreign or non-local television station (typically one that is affiliated with a U.S. commercial television network such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), when the two stations are broadcasting identical programming simultaneously.\n\nThe CRTC first introduced the policy in 1972, and it is sometimes erroneously called \"simulcasting\", the name of a practice different from simultaneous substitution in that there is no signal replacement. According to the CRTC, the practice of simultaneous substitution is necessary \"to protect the rights of broadcasters, to enable television stations to draw enough advertising revenue and to keep advertising money in the Canadian market\". Canadian broadcast networks, which must request each and every substitution on an individual basis, have been criticized for exploiting the regulation and not investing enough money into Canadian content. \n\nThe most prominent public criticism of simsubs centered around the Super Bowl—the championship game of the U.S. National Football League—which is well-known for featuring high-profile commercials on its U.S. broadcast. In 2015, citing the ads as having become an \"integral part\" of the broadcast, the CRTC announced that it would implement a policy to prevent broadcasters from requesting simsubs for the game; it was officially implemented prior to Super Bowl LI in 2017. The CRTC faced criticism over the change in policy from the game's rightsholder, CTV owner Bell Media. The company argued that it singled out a specific program for policy in violation of the Broadcasting Act, and devalued its rights to the league. Bell has attempted to appeal the policy, while the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement contains an annex that would require the CRTC to withdraw this policy.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had a monopoly on television broadcasting in Canada (its first television station, CBFT, began operating in Montreal in 1952). In 1960, the Board of Broadcast Governors, the predecessor of the CRTC, began granting licenses for commercial stations in order to provide an alternative to the CBC. These broadcasters began operating in 1961, and through international distributors, acquired the domestic broadcast rights to many American television programs.\n\nSince about 30% of the Canadian population – those who resided close enough to the Canada–US border – had access to over-the-air broadcast signals from networks based in both Canada and the United States, they could choose to watch American programs on either a Canadian or an American network. Many of these Canadians chose to watch the American network (either CBS, ABC or NBC) rather than the Canadian networks' broadcasts. Consequently, many Canadian broadcasters began broadcasting programs purchased from American-based broadcast networks before they aired on the American networks to attract more viewers and to earn money from domestic advertising, and some Canadian businesses that advertised on the domestic stations also purchased broadcast time on the American stations that were receivable in the same areas, although federal legislation was eventually passed that limited the tax-deductibility of these purchases.\n\nSeveral of the stations in smaller border markets in the United States openly targeted the larger cities in Canada by getting as close to the border as possible. Examples include most of the stations in the Buffalo, New York television market, which targeted Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe region, and in the most extreme case, Pembina, North Dakota station KCND-TV (channel 12), which was based in a town with fewer than 1,000 residents but made its money by targeting the much larger city of Winnipeg across the border to its north.\n\nWhen cable television began to proliferate across Canada in the early-1970s, viewers far from the Canada–US border began to obtain access to American television services that were once unobtainable. In 1972, in response to pressure from Canadian broadcasters, the CRTC introduced the simultaneous substitution regulation as a method to circumvent diminution of the value of Canadian networks' exclusive broadcast rights to American programs (within three years, KCND was effectively moved to Winnipeg and relicensed as CKND-TV). Through the 1990s, as direct-broadcast satellite television services gained popularity and then were granted licenses in Canada, simultaneous substitution became a requirement on these as well.\n\nBy the late 1990s and early 2000s, the simultaneous substitution regulation had reached its full potential, with Canadian broadcast networks telecasting nearly all of their American programming at the same time as the U.S. network's broadcasts to ensure maximum eligibility to request substitution.\n\nThe high incidence of simultaneous substitution requests by privately owned Canadian television networks to draw advertising revenue has had profound effects on various spectrums, ranging from Canadian network schedules to portions of programming being lost due to mistimed substitutions.\n\nSince private Canadian broadcast networks such as CTV, Global, CTV Two and City often rely heavily on American programs, their programming schedules are often effectively dictated by the schedules of corresponding United States network broadcasters. For example, if a U.S. broadcaster moves a series to a new time slot, the Canadian broadcaster that holds domestic rights to carry first-run episodes of that program would need to move its broadcast to correspond with the new time slot if it wished to retain simultaneous substitution rights.\nMany American networks telecast their most popular programming during prime time, meaning that in order to maximize simsubbing opportunities, Canadian private broadcasters are often unable or unwilling to broadcast their own original programming during these hours. As a result, Canadian content programming is commonly scheduled as a secondary concern, to fill holes where an American program cannot be placed for substitution. This issue has also extended beyond scripted entertainment programming – all three major networks in Canada have faced criticism for at least one incident in which the network seemingly deemed a live Canadian news or cultural awards program to be less important than simsubbing an American reality television series:\n\nSince 2008, CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media) has held both the exclusive rights to the Canadian Football League and the rights to Sunday afternoon and playoff games of the American National Football League, broadcasting most NFL games on CTV, while relegating CFL games (including the Grey Cup) to cable channel TSN, making CFL games unavailable on broadcast television for the first time in Canadian history. The move was in part due to the desire to gain simsubbing rights over the NFL broadcasts, something that was not necessary for CFL games because, as of 2015, those games are only available on cable television in the United States.\n\nDue to the high number of simultaneous substitutions requested by Canadian broadcasters, portions of programs are sometimes lost. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including the cable provider erroneously timing the substitution or substituting over the incorrect distant signal, the Canadian broadcaster making a scheduling error when requesting a substitution, the American broadcaster making a last minute change to its schedule, or adverse weather conditions sometimes affecting a Canadian station's local signal. In addition, should a Canadian network interrupt its programming to provide information on a breaking news event while simsubbing an American show, the American program cannot be telecast.\n\nWith the increasingly common practice of American networks extending programs by one to two minutes into the start of the next hour in order to avoid audience loss, such errors are sometimes unavoidable if the Canadian station is not able to match the altered start time. This slight differentiation in timing between the Canadian and American stations can lead to a short period during which the Canadian viewer is watching the original American station's signal before the Canadian network starts its simsubbing, resulting in the show's jumping back to the start again. This is not a problem for American viewers who choose to watch the same network across time slots, but Canadian viewers could miss critical content.\n\nHigh-definition television signals must also be simultaneously substituted, although this only applies if a local over-the-air digital transmitter that broadcasts HD content is receivable in the market served by the local cable provider. Since many broadcasters were only required to convert their main, typically major-market transmitters during the 2011 digital television transition in Canada, this means that HD simsubbing is not currently enforceable in many rural areas.\n\nAlthough the CRTC's policy regarding simultaneous substitutions for high definition broadcasts do not require them to be applied if the quality of the Canadian feed is not equal or better than the American feed, there have been instances in which inferior Canadian feeds were substituted over higher-quality American feeds. In such cases, complaints can be filed to the CRTC, whereas the commission will confer with the applicable BDU and Canadian network about the issue.\n\nImplementation of simultaneous substitutions can also cause issues involving digital on-screen graphics applied by the originating broadcaster; if a clean feed of the program is not available (particularly for live programming), the Canadian broadcaster will often place their own bug in a different corner of the screen, or not add one at all. CTV and CTV Two occasionally used an opaque logo to cover the logo bugs of US-based networks on simsubbed broadcasts of \"The View\" on CTV and \"The Tonight Show\" on CTV Two, but have since discontinued this practice.\n\nEnforcement, or lack thereof, of the regulations, as well as legal exceptions and simple circumstance, has led to instances where some Canadian cable and satellite subscribers are able to receive the original American channels in Canada without simultaneous substitution. Cable providers with less than 2000 subscribers are not legally required to have simultaneous substitution implemented.\nMany viewers in the Greater Toronto Area can pick up American stations from Buffalo, New York, over-the-air, as well as high-definition versions of the stations from both Buffalo and Seattle, Washington, on cable television. Similarly, cable television viewers in Greater Vancouver may receive unmatched HD stations from Detroit, Michigan, and Rochester, New York. However, high-definition feeds are also subject to simsub, and such substitutions began to increase as local broadcasters performed wider deployments of digital terrestrial television.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, the CRTC announced changes to the simsub rules as a result of \"Let's Talk TV\", a series of hearings which mulled reforms for the Canadian television industry. While the CRTC did not completely eliminate the simsub rules, \"despite certain reservations,\" it did propose that its policies explicitly state that only over-the-air channels may invoke simsubs, and that broadcasters and television providers be accountable for programming lost from improperly implemented simsubs: providers will be required to provide rebates as compensation, and stations could temporarily lose their ability to simsub programming. The CRTC also proposed that, citing viewer complaints over their inability to see what they felt was a \"integral part\" of the event, and that many ads were often seen multiple times throughout the game, it would ban the use of simultaneous substitution for the Super Bowl beginning in 2017, thus allowing U.S. feeds of the event and its commercials to co-exist with Canadian simulcasts. However, Bell Media, the current Canadian rightsholder to the Super Bowl through CTV, filed an appeal, arguing that the move would devalue its exclusive broadcast rights to the game, and violates the Broadcasting Act, which forbids the CRTC from making regulations that single out specific programs. The NFL itself has backed Bell Media's complaints.\n\nThe order implementing these new rules was issued on August 19, 2016. The prohibition only applies to the game itself; the typically extended pre-game and post-game coverage is not covered by the policy, and thus may still be simsubbed by CTV. On November 2, 2016, after being denied an appeal because the CRTC had not yet issued official policy when the suit was filed, Bell was granted the right to appeal the ruling in the Federal Court of Appeal. The telecast of Super Bowl LI was available directly from Fox affiliates carried on pay television in Canada.\n\nMichael Geist of the University of Ottawa believed that this decision was a test case for eventually phasing out the simsub rules entirely, arguing that the practice was becoming increasingly irrelevant due to changing viewing habits (such as the consumption of TV content via video-on-demand services rather than linear networks), and that dropping the rules could force domestic broadcasters to make greater investments into original, Canadian content, rather than scheduling it as an afterthought around fluctuating U.S. schedules.\n\nOn May 18, 2017, the NFL testified to the United States Department of Commerce that the CRTC's August 2016 ruling was a violation of copyright protections under NAFTA. The NFL and BCE continued to fight to overturn this policy in the Federal Court of Appeal.\n\nOn December 19, 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media's case, ruling that the CRTC's policy was reasonable. Bell Media once again filed for an appeal in January 2018, this time in the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nOn May 10, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the NFL and Bell's appeal of the Federal Court of Appeal's decision. In an unprecedented step, the top court announced that it intended to use this appeal as an opportunity to revisit the law governing standard of review of administrative tribunals. The appeal was tentatively scheduled to be heard in December 2018.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, Canada agreed to the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. The trade deal, which replaces NAFTA, contains an annex that would require the CRTC to apply its simsub policies equally across the programming that it covers, and as such, withdraw its policy forbidding simsubs of the Super Bowl. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had lobbied for the condition, and praised U.S. president Donald Trump after the agreement was announced. Following the announcement of the trade deal, Bell requested that the CRTC withdraw the policy in time for Super Bowl LIII; Bell was denied due to the pending Supreme Court appeals hearing, as well as the fact that the agreement has not yet been ratified.\n\nIn terms of television providers, the practice of simsubbing is implemented in different ways, depending on the company, especially in the case of satellite providers, which operate on a national basis and not regionally as cable providers do;\n\nAlthough simultaneous substitution was conceived to substitute the signal of a foreign station, the practice has been applied as well to substitute the signal of an out-of-market Canadian station in a given market. For example, in Montreal, the signal of Ottawa station CJOH-DT (channel 13) has frequently been substituted by the signal of locally based CFCF-DT (channel 12), even though both stations are part of the CTV network.\n\nSimultaneous substitution has also been implemented on French language television stations. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, TVA's flagship Montreal station CFTM-TV (channel 10) had its signal substituting that of its Sherbrooke sister station CHLT-TV (channel 7) (which was receivable in the Montreal area through 1995).\n"}

Sound-on-film processes can either record an analog sound track or digital sound track, and may record the signal either optically or magnetically. Earlier technologies were sound-on-disc, meaning the film's soundtrack would be on a separate phonograph record.\n\nThe most prevalent current method of recording analogue sound on a film print is by stereo variable-area (SVA) recording, a technique first used in the mid-1970s as Dolby Stereo. A two-channel audio signal is recorded as a pair of lines running parallel with the film's direction of travel through the projector. The lines change area (grow broader or narrower) depending on the magnitude of the signal. The projector shines light from a small lamp, called an exciter, through a perpendicular slit onto the film. The image on the small slice of exposed track modulates the intensity of the light, which is collected by a photosensitive element: a photocell, a photodiode or CCD.\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century distributors changed to using cyan dye optical soundtracks on color stocks instead of applicated tracks, which use environmentally unfriendly chemicals to retain a silver (black-and-white) soundtrack. Because traditional incandescent exciter lamps produce copious amounts of infra-red light, and cyan tracks do not absorb infra-red light, this change has required theaters to replace the incandescent exciter lamp with a complementary colored red LED or laser. These LED or laser exciters are backwards-compatible with older tracks.\n\nEarlier processes, used on 70 mm film prints and special presentations of 35 mm film prints, recorded sound magnetically on ferric oxide tracks bonded to the film print, outside the sprocket holes. 16 mm and Super 8 formats sometimes used a similar magnetic track on the camera film, bonded to one side of the film on which the sprocket holes had not been punched (\"single perforated\") for the purpose. Film of this form is no longer manufactured, but single-perforated film without the magnetic track (allowing an optical sound track) or, in the case of 16 mm, utilising the soundtrack area for a wider picture (Super 16 format) is readily available.\n\nThree different digital soundtrack systems for 35 mm cinema release prints were introduced during the 1990s. They are: Dolby Digital, which is stored between the perforations on the sound side; SDDS, stored in two redundant strips along the outside edges (beyond the perforations); and DTS, in which sound data is stored on separate compact discs synchronized by a timecode track on the film just to the right of the analog soundtrack and left of the frame (Sound-on-disc). Because these soundtrack systems appear on different parts of the print, one movie can contain all of them, allowing broad distribution without regard for the sound system installed at individual theatres.\n\nAlmost all sound formats used with motion-picture film have been sound-on-film formats, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Bablake School, and worked briefly for Rudge-Whitworth. He took his stage name from the whisky firm Dunville & Co.\n\nHaving established himself in the northern music halls, Dunville took his act to London in 1890, performing first at the Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane. He was billed as an \"eccentric comedian and contortionist\". His appearance accounted for the \"eccentric\" part: he had a high forehead, and wore a black wig with a wide parting on the left; he wore a loose black jacket with large buttons, tight black trousers, and large boots. A disabled arm contributed to the \"contortionist\" part: the arm would jerk and swing with a life of its own as he performed an eccentric dance.\n\nDunville's first wife, Fanny Warriss, attempted, with Dunville's support, a singing career on the music hall stage under the name Millie Lindon.\n\nDunville's autobiography, \"The Autobiography of an Eccentric Comedian\", was published by Everett & Co. in 1912.\n\nRemaining successful for more than thirty years, Dunville gave his last performance at the Grand Theatre, Clapham on 20 March 1924. The following day he disappeared, and on 22 March 1924 his body was found in the River Thames at Caversham Lock near Reading. Dunville had suffered with depression for several years, and he left his (second) wife, Dora, a suicide note including the words \"I feel I cannot bear it any longer.\" He is buried near Bridport in Dorset, in a grave marked with a white cross bearing the words \"Jesus Wept\".\n\nDunville recorded five phonograph cylinders:\n\n\nMade on the earliest commercial medium for recording and reproducing sound, the recordings may have disintegrated:\n\"There is now a very real danger that T.E. Dunville's cylinders no longer exist - if any of them do turn up they should be committed to tape or microgroove as soon as possible, the fragility of wax cylinders making such a step particularly necessary. Should they have parted company with their original boxes, the only identification on the cylinders themselves may well be the Edison serial number ... would anyone knowing of the existence of any Dunville cylinders please arrange for them to be transferred electrically to a more permanent \"record\". How tragic it would be if the voice of one of the premier examples of the \"eccentric comedian\" were allowed to slip into oblivion.\"\nP. G. Wodehouse refers to Dunville in his 1909 comic novel \"The Swoop!\" (Part Two, Chapter Four).\n\nDunville created a style of movement called \"leg mania\", which influenced later comic performers including Max Wall and Billy Dainty.\n"}

It is the third and final installment in Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation based on the novel \"The Hobbit\" by J. R. R. Tolkien, following \"\" (2012) and \"\" (2013), and together they act as a prequel to Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy.\n\nIt was produced by New Line Cinema, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and WingNut Films, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. \"The Battle of the Five Armies\" was released on December 11, 2014 in New Zealand, December 12, 2014 in the United Kingdom, and on December 17, 2014 in the United States. It stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Luke Evans,\nLee Pace, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ken Stott, and James Nesbitt. The ensemble cast also features Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, and Orlando Bloom.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews but was otherwise praised for the musical score, cast performances, visual effects, direction and action sequences, and grossed over $956 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2014 (behind \"\") and the 44th-highest-grossing film of all time. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received a nomination for Best Sound Editing.\n\nBilbo and the Dwarves watch from the Lonely Mountain as the dragon Smaug sets Laketown ablaze. Bard breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the black arrow brought to him by his son Bain. Smaug's falling body crushes the fleeing Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat laden with the town's gold. Bard reluctantly becomes the new leader of the people of Laketown as they seek refuge in the ruins of Dale, while Legolas travels to investigate Mount Gundabad with Tauriel. Thorin, now struck with \"dragon sickness\" over the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the Arkenstone, which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Thorin, hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.\n\nMeanwhile, Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman arrive at Dol Guldur and free Gandalf, sending him to safety with Radagast. They battle and defeat the Nazgûl and a formless Sauron himself, banishing them to the East. Azog, marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son Bolg to Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.\n\nThranduil and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by Thrór. Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the treasures they were promised and prevent a battle. When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo. Thorin's cousin Dáin arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men begins, until Wereworms emerge from the ground, releasing Azog's army from their tunnels. With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin's army, Thranduil and Bard's forces, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, join the battle. However, a second front is opened when many Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city.\n\nInside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides towards Ravenhill with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog; Bilbo follows them, using his magic ring to move through the combat unseen. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's approaching army. Fíli is captured, and Azog kills him as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. Thorin kills Azog, but is fatally wounded in the process. The Great Eagles arrive with Radagast and Beorn to fight the newly arriving Orc army, and the Orcs are finally defeated. Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with the dying Thorin. Tauriel mourns Kili, and Thranduil acknowledges their love. Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave, and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name \"Strider\".\n\nBilbo bids farewell to the remaining members of Thorin's company and journeys home to the Shire with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He cancels the sale, but finds his home pillaged; he starts to tidy up and to settle back in. , Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.\n\nAdditionally, Peter Jackson's and Andy Serkis's daughters made cameo appearances as girls rowing away during Smaug's attack; movement coach Terry Notary and stand-in Jamie Haugh appear as Laketown refugees after the destruction; Conan Stevens, who was to play Bolg, appears as the Keeper of the Dungeons, an Orc captain holding Gandalf hostage and the sons of key second-assistant director Guy Campbell, casting director Miranda Rivers, and Weta Workshop founder Richard Taylor appear as Hobbit children during the auction scene.\n\n\"The Hobbit\" was originally envisioned as a two-part film, but Jackson confirmed plans for a third film on 30 July 2012, turning his adaptation of \"The Hobbit\" into a trilogy. According to Jackson, the third film would contain the Battle of the Five Armies and make extensive use of the appendices that Tolkien wrote to expand the story of Middle-earth (published in the back of \"The Return of the King\"). Jackson also stated that while the third film will largely make use of footage originally shot for the first and second films, it would require additional filming as well. The third film was titled \"There and Back Again\" in August 2012. In April 2014, Jackson changed the title of the film to \"The Battle of the Five Armies\" as he thought the new title better suited the situation of the film. He stated on his Facebook page, \"\"There and Back Again\" felt like the right name for the second of a two film telling of the quest to reclaim Erebor, when Bilbo's arrival there, and departure, were both contained within the second film. But with three movies, it suddenly felt misplaced—after all, Bilbo has already arrived 'there' in the \"Desolation of Smaug\".\" Shaun Gunner, the chairman of The Tolkien Society, supported the decision: \"\"The Battle of the Five Armies\" much better captures the focus of the film but also more accurately channels the essence of the story.\"\n\nAs with all the previous films, Howard Shore composed the score. Conrad Pope (who conducted the orchestra) and James Sizemore orchestrated the music for the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and for two Gamelan orchestra, while the London Voices and Tiffin' Boys choir were recorded in AIR Lyndhurst, London. The score featured a few new themes for Dain, Gundabad (featuring a \"chorus\" of didgeridoos) and the Dwarves' war preparations, but focused more on blending and clashing the themes against one another, eventually bringing the themes to a resolution.\n\nBilly Boyd, who played Peregrin Took in \"The Lord of the Rings\", wrote and recorded the song \"The Last Goodbye\" to be played over the end credits of the film.\n\nA teaser trailer for the film was released on July 28, 2014 attached to \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"Into the Storm\", and \"If I Stay\". The second theatrical trailer was released on November 6, 2014 attached to \"Interstellar\" and \"\". To promote the film's release, Wellington-based association football club, Wellington Phoenix, wore a special designed jersey to commemorate the opening of \"The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies\". The custom, film-themed jersey was worn only once, on December 13, 2014. In the film's Japanese release on December 13, Warner Bros. collaborated with mobile gaming company A-Lim to bring Bilbo, Gandalf, and Legolas into the game \"Brave Frontier\" at the end of December as Vortex Dungeon units. The campaign only ran until February 2015. Smaug made a guest appearance, animated by WETA and voiced again by Cumberbatch, on the satire show \"The Colbert Report\" on December 12, 2014 to promote the film.\n\nTwo video games were developed to coincide with the film's theatrical release. A tie-in fighting video game \"The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies – Fight for Middle Earth\" was released simultaneously with the film for Android and iOS platforms to negative reviews from critics and users. An action-adventure video game \"\" was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 & Xbox One in October 2014 and for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 21, nearly a week prior to The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies world premiere in London, on 1 December. The events of the game take place directly after Sauron fled to Mordor, escaping The White Council, which was shown at the beginning of the film. The game was planned to act as an overlap between The Hobbit film series and The Lord of the Rings film series.\n\nInitially the film was set for a July 2014 release; however, it was later pushed back to December. The world premiere of \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" was held in London at Leicester Square on 1 December 2014. The film opened in theaters on 11 December 2014 in New Zealand, on December 12 in the United Kingdom and on December 17 in the United States. Warner Bros released the film on December 18 in Greece and December 26, in Australia. The film was released in China on January 23, 2015. An extended edition of the film had a one-night-only re-release on October 13, 2015, accompanied by a special greeting from Peter Jackson.\n\n\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" was released on March 6, 2015 on Digital Release from digital retailers. The DVD and Blu-ray were released on March 24, 2015 in the United States. It topped the home video sales chart in its opening week. An Extended Edition of the film, with 20 minutes of additional footage and original music was released on Digital HD on 20 October and on DVD, Blu-ray, and Blu-ray 3D on November 17, 2015 in the United States and on November 23, 2015, in the United Kingdom. Unlike the theatrical version's PG-13 rating, the Extended Edition has been rated R by the MPAA for \"some violence\".\n\nLike its predecessors, \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" became a financial success. It grossed a total of $255.1 million in North America and $700.9 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $956 million. Worldwide, it is the second-highest-grossing film of 2014 (behind \"\"), the lowest-grossing film of \"The Hobbit\" series, and the 40th-highest-grossing film of all time. According to \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimation, the film made a profit of $103.4 million. The film failed to earn $1 billion at the box office, despite various pundits projecting it to reach that milestone. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that \"The Battle of the Five Armies\" was unlikely to gross $1 billion worldwide due to \"plunging exchange rates around the globe\" witnessed that year, and that Warner Bros. and MGM ultimately would take in nearly $90 million less than expected due to the rising dollar and plunging foreign currencies. However, despite this failure, \"Forbes\" has declared the trilogy \"an unmitigated financial grand-slam for all parties.\"\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, it is the lowest-grossing of the three films of \"The Hobbit\" trilogy, and also the lowest-grossing of the six Middle-earth adaptations, but the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2014. It opened on Tuesday, December 16, 2014 across 3,100 theaters and widened to 3,875 the following day. It earned $11.2 million from Tuesday late-night shows, which is the second-highest of 2014, matching the numbers earned by \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and both behind \"\" ($17 million) of which $2.5 million of just over 22% came from IMAX showings. This broke the record for a Middle-earth adaptation previews previously set by \"The Desolation of Smaug\" with $8.8 million. It then topped the box office on its opening day (Wednesday, December 17, 2014), earning $24.5 million (including previews), which is the third-highest Middle-earth adaptation Wednesday opening behind the Wednesday openings of \"\" ($34.5 million) and \"\" ($26.2 million). In total, the film earned $57.4 million in its traditional three-day opening and $89.1 million over its five-day course making it the second-biggest five-day opening in \"The Hobbit\" franchise, beating the $86.1 million opening of \"The Desolation of Smaug\", but still behind \"An Unexpected Journey\"'s $100.2 million five-day opening. However, on a three-day basis, the film underperformed expectations and fell short of its predecessors. The film set a December IMAX opening record with $13.4 million (previously held by \"\"). 3D accounted for 49% of the total gross while IMAX generated 15% or $13.4 million over five days, and $7.4 million over three days, and premium large-format screens comprised 8% of the total opening-weekend gross with $7.2 million from 396 theaters. The film passed the $100 million mark on its seventh day (December 23, 2014). It became the third film of 2014 to earn $100 million in just under a week following Lionsgate's \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1\" ($168.7 million in its opening week) and Disney/Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" ($134.4 million in its first week). It was in first place at the North American box office for three consecutive weekends despite facing competition from numerous new releases each weekend, but was finally overtaken by \"Taken 3\" in its fourth weekend.\n\nThe film began its international roll-out a week prior to its wide North American release. It opened Wednesday, December 10, 2014 in 11 European markets, earning $11.3 million and December 11, 2014 in 17 additional markets, earning $13.7 million, for a two-day total of $26.6 million and topped the charts in each of the territories. Through Sunday, December 14, 2015, it had an opening weekend total of $122.2 million from 37 countries in 15,395 screens, topping the box office and outperforming the previous two installments on a local currency and admissions basis. Seventy-one percent of the total gross ($86.7 million) came from 3D showings. However, the overseas opening weekend was still lower than the openings of \"An Unexpected Journey\" ($138 million) and \"The Desolation of Smaug\" ($135.4 million)—both on a dollar basis. It set a December IMAX opening record with $6.4 million across 160 IMAX screens, previously held by \"An Unexpected Journey\" with $5.03 million. The film opened to an additional 59 countries in its second weekend and earned $109 million from 19,315 screens still holding the top spot and fell gradually by 13% as a result of facing minor competitions. In its third weekend, the film added a further $89 million abroad, remaining at number one. It was in first place at the box office outside North America for four consecutive weekends and five in total.\n\nThe film achieved numerous records in international markets during its opening weekend. It set an all-time Warner Bros. opening record in Russia ($13.8 million), Argentina ($2.1 million), Sweden, and Finland. It also set a 2014 opening record in Germany ($20.5 million), France ($15.1 million), and Spain ($6.3 million). It also had the best Middle-earth saga opening in the UK ($15.2 million), and Mexico ($6.3 million). In Brazil, the film scored the second-biggest Warner Bros. opening of all time with $6.8 million (behind \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\"). In Australia, the film was released on 26 December 2014 and set an opening-day record with $5.6 million, which is the biggest of 2014, the second-biggest Boxing Day gross, and the fourth-biggest ever in Australia behind \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" ($7.092 million), \"The Avengers\" ($6.0 million), and \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\" ($5.9 million). It went on to earn $10.1 million in its opening weekend. The film set an all-time opening record for Warner Bros. in China where it earned $49.8 million in its opening weekend (a record previously held by \"Pacific Rim\"). IMAX generated $6.8 million of the total gross, which was once the second-highest IMAX three-day gross behind \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\"s $10 million. Other high openings were recorded in Korea ($10.4 million), Poland ($5.6 million), Italy ($5.6 million), Malaysia ($3 million), and Taiwan ($2.8 million). In total earnings, its largest markets are China ($121.7 million); UK, Ireland, and Malta ($61.3 million); and Australia ($27 million).\n\nMTV reported that early reviews for \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" were \"generally positive\" with critics praising the film \"for its energy, shorter running time and satisfying closure\". According to IBT, reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics \"praising director Peter Jackson's effort at transforming J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel into an epic adventure film trilogy\". According to CBS News, critics said the film \"will satisfy fans\" but \"otherwise, it may be worth waiting until it's available to rent\". Oliver Gettel of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the critical consensus was that the film is \"a flawed but fitting finale to \"The Hobbit\" trilogy\". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 59% approval rating based on 243 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads \"Though somewhat overwhelmed by its own spectacle, \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" ends Peter Jackson's second Middle-earth trilogy on a reasonably satisfying note.\" The film also holds a Metacritic score of 59 out of 100 based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as its predecessor.\n\nScott Foundas of \"Variety\" said \"The result is at once the trilogy's most engrossing episode, its most expeditious (at a comparatively lean 144 minutes) and also its darkest—both visually and in terms of the forces that stir in the hearts of men, dwarves and orcs alike.\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said \"After six films, 13 years and 1031 minutes of accumulated running time, Peter Jackson has concluded his massively remunerative genuflection at the altar of J.R.R. Tolkien with a film that may be the most purely entertaining of any in the collection.\" Andrew Pulver of \"The Guardian\" said \"This film is a fitting cap to an extended series that, if nothing else, has transformed Tolkien's place in the wider culture.\" Chris Tilly from IGN Movies said \"There's a little too much padding in the final \"Hobbit\" flick, and the best sequence is without doubt the film's first. But the central battle is indeed spectacular, and as 'The Age of Orc' approaches, it rounds out this particular story in stirring and emotional fashion.\" Russell Baillie of \"The New Zealand Herald\" said \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" is \"something less than the supposed 'defining chapter' of Jackson's time in Middle-earth as it's been billed. But action-wise, it certainly goes out with a very pleasing bang.\"\n\nConversely, Inkoo Kang of TheWrap said \"The 144-minute running time showcases Jackson's worst tendencies: eons-long battle scenes, sloppy and abrupt resolutions, portentous romances, off-rhythm comic timing, and, newly in this case, patience-testing fan service.\" Tim Robey of \"The Daily Telegraph\" described the film as \"a paragraph on steroids\" that was \"neither very terrible nor remotely unexpected. It's a series of stomping footnotes in search of a climax.\" The BBC's Nicholas Barber wrote that with \"The Hobbit\" series, Jackson had succeeded in bridging the gap between \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" and that \"The Battle of the Five Armies\" was a \"colossal technical achievement\", but he also criticized that the film as such was not compelling because of \"its repetitive battle scenes and a lack of plot\". Nicolas Rapold of \"The New York Times\" said \"Bilbo may fully learn a sense of friendship and duty, and have quite a story to tell, but somewhere along the way, Mr. Jackson loses much of the magic.\"\n\n"}

Two key components of TRT directly follow from the neurophysiological model of tinnitus. One of these principles includes directive counseling aimed at reclassification of tinnitus to a category of neutral signals, while the other includes sound therapy which is aimed at weakening tinnitus related neuronal activity.\n\nThe goal of TRT is management of tinnitus; there is no evidence that TRT can attenuate or eliminate tinnitus. The efficacy of TRT in reducing the distress of tinnitus has not been established. TRT is not a medical treatment for tinnitus or any other condition, and is not administered by a medical doctor or other medical professional.\n\nAn alternative to TRT is tinnitus masking, the use of noise, music or other environmental sounds to obscure or mask the tinnitus. Hearing aids can provide a partial masking effect for the condition. Results from a review of tinnitus retraining therapy trials indicate that it may be a more effective treatment than tinnitus masking.\n\nNot everyone who experiences tinnitus is significantly bothered by it. However, some of the problems caused by tinnitus include annoyance, anxiety, panic, and loss of sleep and/or concentration. The distress of tinnitus is strongly associated with various psychological factors; loudness, duration and other characteristics of the tinnitus are secondary.\n\nTRT may offer real although moderate improvement in tinnitus suffering for adults with moderate-to-severe tinnitus, in the absence of hyperacusis, significant hearing loss and/or depression. Not everyone is a good candidate for TRT. Factors associated with suitability for TRT and predisposing for favorable outcome are: lower loudness of tinnitus, higher pitch of tinnitus, shorter duration of tinnitus since onset, recognition of tinnitus attenuation by sound generator, lower hearing thresholds (i.e. better hearing), high Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score, and positive attitude toward therapy.\n\nDespite the fact that there haven't been any recent studies which concluded in its optimal treatment, tinnitus retraining therapy has been applied to treating hyperacusis, misophonia, and phonophobia.\n\nThere is no evidence that TRT or any other treatment can eliminate or decrease tinnitus. Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease. As such, the optimal treatment strategy should be directed toward eliminating the disease, rather than simply alleviating the symptom. More than half of people with tinnitus have a comorbid psychological injury or illness (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, stress, dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, etc.) that can exacerbate the tinnitus.\n\nIt has been proposed that tinnitus is caused by mechanisms that generate abnormal neural activity, specifically one mechanism called discordant damage (dysfunction) of outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea.\n\nThe psychological basis for TRT stems from the fact that the brain exhibits a high level of plasticity. In turn, this allows it to adjust to any sensory signals as long as they do not lead to negative effects. TRT is imputed to work by interfering with the neural activity causing the tinnitus at its source, in order to prevent it from spreading to other nervous systems such as the limbic and autonomic nervous systems.\n\nClients are classified into 5 categories. These categories are numbered 0 to 4, and based on whether or not the patient has tinnitus with hearing loss, tinnitus with no hearing loss, tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis, and tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis for an extended amount of time.\n\nThe first component of TRT, directive counseling, may change the way tinnitus is perceived. The patient is taught the basic knowledge about the auditory system and its function, the mechanism of tinnitus generation and the annoyance associated with tinnitus. The repetition of these points in the follow-up visits helps the patient to perceive the signal as a non-danger.\n\nMeasuring the efficacy of TRT is beset by confounding factors: tinnitus reporting is entirely subjective therefore not reliable; tinnitus or at least subjects' perception of it varies over time and repeated evaluations are not consistent. Researchers have noted that there is a large placebo component to tinnitus management. In many commercial TRT practices, there is a large proportion of dropouts; reported 'success' ratios may not take these subjects into account.\n\nThere are few available studies, but most show that tinnitus naturally declines over time (years) in a large proportion of subjects surveyed, without any treatment. The annoyance of tinnitus also tends to decline over time. In at least some, tinnitus spontaneously disappears.\n\nA Cochrane review found only one sufficiently rigorous study of TRT and noted that while the study suggested benefit in the treatment of tinnitus, the study quality was not good enough to draw firm conclusions. A separate Cochrane review of sound therapy (though they called it masking), an integral part of TRT, found no convincing evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in the treatment of tinnitus.\n\nA summary in The Lancet concluded that in the only decent study, TRT was more effective than masking; in another study in which TRT was used as a control methodology, TRT showed a small benefit. A study which compared cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in combination with the counselling part of TRT versus standard care (ENT, audiologist, maskers, hearing aid) found that the specialized care had a positive effect on quality of life as well as specific tinnitus metrics.\n\nTinnitus activities treatment (TAT) is a clinical adaptation of TRT that focuses on four areas: thoughts and emotions, hearing and communication, sleep, and concentration.\n\nProgressive tinnitus management (PTM) is a 5-step structured clinical protocol for management of tinnitus which may include tinnitus retraining therapy. The five steps are:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) now employs PTM to help patients self-manage their tinnitus.\n\n\nCognitive behavior therapy (CBT), the counselling part of TRT, as a generalized type of psychological and behavioral counselling, has also been used by itself in the management of tinnitus.\n\nIf tinnitus is associated with hearing loss, a tuned hearing aid that amplifies sound in the frequency range of the hearing loss (usually the high frequencies) may effectively mask tinnitus by raising the level of environmental sound, in addition to the benefit of restoring hearing.\n\nWhite noise generators or environmental music may be used to provide a background noise level that is of sufficient amplitude that it wholly or partially 'masks' the tinnitus (tinnitus masker). Composite hearing aids that combine amplification and white noise\ngeneration are also available.\n\nNumerous other non-TRT methods have been suggested for the treatment or management of tinnitus.\n\n\n"}

Federal Communications Commission (II)\", 520 U.S. 180 (1997) was the second. \"Turner I\" established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In \"Turner II\" the court decided that the must-carry provisions were constitutional. Under the \"Miami Herald v.

However, under the rule of \"Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC\" the High Court held that a federal agency could regulate broadcast stations (TV and radio) with far greater discretion. In order for federal agency regulation of broadcast media to pass constitutional muster, it need only serve an important state interest and need not narrowly tailor its regulation to the least restrictive means. \n\n\n"}

They have traditionally been a staple of college spring break celebrations at locations such as Daytona Beach and Cancún. \n\nContestants generally wear white or light-colored T-shirts without bras, bikini tops, or other garments beneath. Water (often ice water) is then sprayed or poured onto the participants' chests, causing their T-shirts to turn translucent and cling to their breasts. Contestants may take turns dancing or posing before the audience, with the outcome decided either by crowd reaction or by judges' vote.\n\nIn racier contests, participants may tear or crop their T-shirts to expose midriffs, cleavage, or the undersides of their breasts. Depending on local laws, participants may or may not be allowed to remove their T-shirts or strip completely naked during their performance.\n\nIn the United States, skiing filmmaker Dick Barrymore claims in his memoir \"Breaking Even\" to have held the first wet T-shirt contest at Sun Valley, Idaho's Boiler Room Bar in January 1971, as part of a promotion for K2 skis. The contest was promoted as a simple \"T-shirt contest\" in which airline stewardesses would dance to music wearing K2 promotional T-shirts. However, the first contestant to appear was a professional stripper who danced topless and the amateur contestants responded by drenching their T-shirts before competing. Barrymore held a second \"K2 Wet T-Shirt Contest\" in the Rusty Nail at Stowe Mountain Resort, Vermont in order to film it, despite the fact that Stowe City Council had passed a resolution banning nudity at the event. He held another promotional contest for K2 on 10 March 1971 at Aspen, Colorado's The Red Onion restaurant and bar, and the contests were featured in a pictorial in the March 1972 issue of \"Playboy\".\n\nThe first known mention of the term \"Wet T-shirt contest\" in the press occurred in 1975 in \"The Palm Beach Post\", describing the contest's appearance at New Orleans discotheques. The contest subsequently became established at spring break events in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with some bar owners being fined under public indecency laws for holding one. Jacqueline Bisset's appearance in the 1977 film \"The Deep\", where she swam underwater wearing only a T-shirt for a top, helped to bring the wet T-shirt contest to broader public awareness. On Frank Zappa's 1979 album \"Joe's Garage\" the track \"Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt\" tells of Mary from Canoga Park who takes part in a wet T-shirt contest in order to raise money to return home after being abandoned by a rock group in Miami.\n\nThe 2003 American reality film \"The Real Cancun\" included a wet T-shirt contest.\n\nThe Spanish festival of La Tomatina, a large public tomato fight where participants become soaked with juice from tomatoes, has been suggested as another possible origin of the wet T-shirt contest, although La Tomatina began in 1945.\n\nIn 1983 the King & Spalding law firm in Atlanta asked women summer interns attending that firm's annual picnic to participate in a wet T-shirt contest. The proposed contest was replaced with a swimsuit competition and the winner was promised a permanent job on graduation. Some participants said they felt humiliated but did not protest because they were candidates for jobs with the firm. \"The Wall Street Journal\" included details of the event in a front page article on sex discrimination in large law firms. The fact that a wet T-shirt contest was proposed led to the case being used to demonstrate institutional sexism in law firms.\n\nIn 1997, teenagers from Portland, Oregon, celebrating the completion of high school held a wet T-shirt contest on a Boeing 727 en route to a Mexican resort, with a flight attendant encouraging the activity. An FAA investigation followed, as pilots supposedly judged the contest on the flight deck, disregarding rules that passengers are not allowed in the cockpit. A video showed contestants emerging from the cockpit wearing wet T-shirts. The FAA disciplined the pilots for sexual misconduct.\n\nLawsuits have been filed on behalf of underaged contestants who lied about their age to participate in wet T-shirt contests.\n\nIn 2002, the parents of teenager Monica Pippin brought a federal lawsuit against Playboy Entertainment, Anheuser-Busch, Deslin Hotels, Best Buy, and other companies relating to her appearance the previous year in a Daytona Beach wet T-shirt contest, at which time she had been a 16-year-old high school student. Pippin had danced topless during the contest and had allowed men to pour jugs of water over her bare breasts. After footage of her performance began to appear in videos and on cable television, a neighbor alerted Pippin's parents, who retained a lawyer. Although Pippin admitted in court that she had lied to contest organizers about her age, her attorney claimed that, as a minor, she was unable to give informed consent to perform or be filmed topless. Pippin settled with Anheuser-Busch and Playboy in April 2006.\n\nIn a similar suit in 2007, two women sued Deslin Hotels, Girls Gone Wild, and various websites that published footage of their appearance in another 2001 Daytona Beach contest. The two girls, who were both sixteen at the time, had been filmed exposing their breasts, buttocks, and pubic areas. Like Pippin, they had lied about their age to gain admission to the contest.\n\n"}
