At the AFI Awards it won in the Best Actor (Robert McDarra) and Best Fiction (Haydn Keenan) categories.\n\nBill McDonald is a middle aged alcoholic who is sentenced to six weeks in prison for a minor offence. He volunteers for psychiatric treatment and is committed to a hospital for the criminally insane supposedly only for the duration of his prison sentence. However under section 27A of Queensland's Mental Health Act he can be held there until hospital authorities declare him eligible for release.\n\nBill clashes with a nurse, Cornish, and is detained in the hospital because of his attitude. He attempts three times to escape. Eventually he is released after a journalist publicises his case.\n\n\nEbsen Storm and producer Haydn Keenan had made a number of successful short films and wanted to move into features. The script was developed by Storm in association with interviews he conducted in 1972 with Robert Somerville, a man who had been forcibly detained in a Queensland hospital in the late 1960s. By the time the film was made, however, section 27A had been repealed. Cecil Holmes worked as script editor. Storm:\nThe main influence on the style of the film was that we knew we wouldn't be able to raise a lot of money... If we wanted to make a feature film, we'd have to make it cheap. There was a style at that time, sort of pseudo-documentary, with a lot of hand-held camera work - \"Cullodden\", \"Cathy Come Home\" and \"Poor Cow\", that English, Ken Loach, Peter Watkins realism. I was drawn to the subject in the newspapers and then went off to investigate and research it. I felt that it would suit that style... A basic theme... is that of someone trying to break out, someone feeling trapped within themselves, trapped within the system. That probably drew me to it. Then when I went to research it, I found a broader tapestry.\nRobert McDarra, who played the lead, was himself an alcoholic. Bill Hunter was cast in his first feature film role. $23,000 of the budget was raised from a syndicate of 18 businessmen, with $13,000 coming from a grant from the Australian Film Television Radio School.\n\nThe film was shot on 16mm starting 28 February 1973 at Christian Brothers psychiatric hospital near Sydney.\n\nThe film premiered at the Sydney Film Festival and achieved a limited release. It never recovered its costs, however it screened at a number of festivals and was critically acclaimed.\n\nThe film won the AFI Award for Best Film. Robert McDarra won the AFI Award for his performance.\n\n"}

It can be found in many of the performing arts, sports (sporting) events, and martial arts. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities — such as ballet and diving — may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics.\n\nAcrobatic traditions are found in many cultures, and there is evidence that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago. For example, Minoan art from c. 2000 BC contains depictions of acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls. Ancient Greeks and Romans practiced acrobatics, and the noble court displays of the European Middle Ages would often include acrobatic performances that included juggling.\n\nIn China, acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). Acrobatics were part of village harvest festivals. During the Tang Dynasty, acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice. Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern Chinese variety art.\n\nThough the term initially applied to tightrope walking, in the 19th century, a form of performance art including circus acts began to use the term as well. In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.\n\nAcrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art. Examples of this are paintings such as \"Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)\" by Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, Pablo Picasso's 1905 \"Acrobat and Young Harlequin\", and \"\" by Viktor Vasnetsov.\n\nAn aerialist is an acrobat who performs in the air, on a suspended apparatus such as a trapeze, rope, cloud swing, aerial cradle, aerial pole, aerial silk, or aerial hoop.\n"}
{"id": "661150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=661150", "title": "Andy Hardy", "text": "Andy Hardy\n\nAndrew \"Andy\" Hardy is a fictional character played by Mickey Rooney in a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer series of sixteen films from 1937 to 1946, and includes a final film released in 1958 in an unsuccessful attempt to continue the series. Hardy and others were based on characters in the play \"Skidding\" by Aurania Rouverol. Early films in the series were about the Hardy family as a whole, but later entries focused on the character of Andy Hardy. Rooney was the only member of the ensemble to appear in all 16 films. The Hardy films, which were enormously popular in their heyday, were sentimental comedies, celebrating ordinary American life.\n\nThe initial Hardy film, \"A Family Affair\" (1937), was based directly on Rouverol's play and was produced without a view to producing a series. It featured Lionel Barrymore as Judge Hardy and Spring Byington as Mrs. Hardy, Andy's parents, and Margaret Marquis as Andy's on-again-off-again sweetheart, Polly Benedict.\n\nWhen the series was launched, most of the cast was changed, with the exception of Rooney, Cecilia Parker as Andy's older sister Marian Hardy, and Sara Haden as Aunt Milly (except for two films when Betsy Ross Clarke appeared as Milly). The second and subsequent films starred Lewis Stone as Judge Hardy, Fay Holden as Mrs. Hardy, and Ann Rutherford as Polly Benedict. The Hardys' oldest child, married daughter Joan Hardy Martin, appeared only in the first film.\n\nMost of the movies were set in the Hardys' fictional hometown of Carvel, located in Idaho in the original play, but described in the films as being in the Midwest (except for the short \"Andy Hardy's Dilemma\" where Carvel is mentioned as being a suburb of Los Angeles). All of the films were sentimental comedies celebrating ordinary American life. The people in Carvel were generally pious, patriotic, generous, and tolerant. The town represented MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer's idealized vision of his adopted country. \n\nThe early movies focused on the Hardy family as a whole, but the character Andy soon became the center of the series, and his name was featured in the title of the fourth film and all films after the seventh (inclusive). They were a big factor in Rooney's rise to stardom. The first two Hardy films dealt with the danger of adultery among the younger generation, but the later ones avoided such controversial themes. \n\nThe central relationship in the movies was between Andy and his father. Judge Hardy, played by the grandfatherly looking Stone, was a man of absolute morality and integrity, with a stern demeanor, but a kind heart and droll sense of humor. A typical plot involved Andy getting into minor trouble with money or girls, usually because of youthful selfishness and a willingness to fudge the truth. This would lead to a \"man-to-man\" talk with his father, after which Andy would do the right thing. \n\nIn three films, Rooney was paired with Judy Garland, beginning with \"Love Finds Andy Hardy\", and continuing with \"Andy Hardy Meets Debutante\" (1940) and \"Life Begins for Andy Hardy\" (1941). Garland's character, Betsy Booth, is an aspiring singer and she sings in the first two of these films. However, although Garland songs were planned for the final film, they were eventually dropped. Unlike Garland-Rooney films outside of the \"Andy Hardy\" series, Rooney's Hardy character is not a musician, so Garland and Rooney do not perform together in the Hardy films.\n\nRooney played the character continuously from age 16 to 25, when he appeared in \"Love Laughs at Andy Hardy\" (1946), in which Andy returned to civilian life after fighting in World War II. Twelve years later, an attempt to revive the series with an older, wiser Andy was made in 1958 with \"Andy Hardy Comes Home\", but it turned out to be the final film in the series. Thus, the Andy Hardy series ended with a \"To Be Continued\", which indeed has yet to be continued.\n\n\nAlso, a 1940 short subject promoting the Community Chest was called \"Andy Hardy's Dilemma\" (18 minutes).\n\n\nThe Andy Hardy series served as a platform for MGM to introduce new performers, some of whom became stars themselves. As examples, \"Love Finds Andy Hardy\" (1938) featured Lana Turner in one of her first film appearances, while \"Andy Hardy's Private Secretary\" (1941) launched Kathryn Grayson's movie career, and \"Andy Hardy's Double Life\" (1942) marked the screen debut of Esther Williams. \n\nA number of public service announcements involving the Andy Hardy character and his father were shown in theaters in the 1940s. A notable example had Andy trying to persuade his father to give him $200 for a car. Instead, his father took him on a tour of several charities that needed the money more. After each visit to a charity, the car Andy wanted to buy became more and more decrepit.\n\nIn June 1947, \"Fiction House's Movie Comics\" published a comic book adaptation of the film \"Love Laughs at Andy Hardy\". \n\nAndy Hardy was also the subject of a six comic books published by Dell in 1952–1954. Only in the former does the drawing of Andy Hardy resemble Mickey Rooney.\n\nIn the 1960s, NBC considered an Andy Hardy TV series, and MGM shot a pilot episode for the network in early 1962. Jimmy Hawkins, who had teenage roles in several popular sitcoms, played Andy, and veteran character actor Philip Ober played Judge Hardy. Despite indications that the network would pick up the show for its 1962–63 season, that never happened. \n"}

It is developed by Related Designs and published by Sunflowers Interactive Entertainment Software. It revolves around building and maintaining an 18th-century colony in the \"New World\". With a budget of €10 million, it was the most expensive German game ever produced by 2006. \n\nIt is the sequel to \"Anno 1602\" and \"Anno 1503\" and was followed by \"Anno 1404\", which is known in the United States as \"Dawn of Discovery\", \"Anno 2070\", \"Anno 2205\" and Anno 1800\".\n\n\"Anno 1701\", like the other six Anno games, is a game based mainly on the economics of the settlement created by the player. The more skilled a player is at maintaining a balanced economy the more successful their settlement will be.\n\nAs with other \"Anno\" games, the player starts as an unnamed country which has to colonize and expand in the game world. While the player expands, other computer controlled rivals are expanding and strengthening. As the player progresses through the game, players have access to lodge activities and troops which allow them to invade and ultimately to defeat other players.\n\nThe game is divided into five social stages: Pioneer, Settler, Citizen, Merchant, and Aristocrat. At the start of the game, all of a player's citizens are pioneers. They pay little amounts of taxes, and require only food and a town center. As a player's empire develops, so does his population. They begin upgrading (provided they have sufficient goods), paying more taxes, but also requiring more goods, such as tobacco products, perfume, lamp oil, and much more. It is crucial for a player to develop quickly, as not much profit is attained until reaching the merchant stage.\n\nPlayers can trade with other opponents settling under the Queen's name, or with foreign cultures. All foreign cultures are on small or medium islands, and cannot leave their island.\n\nLiang Wu and his Asians are found on islands in the north of the island world. They trade the colonial good Jade, and purchase food.\n\nPoxacoatl and his Aztecs live on islands in the southern zone, are few in number and believe in the infinite power of the gods. They trade the colonial goods Talismans, and purchase cloth and horses.\n\nAmin Sahir and his Indians have a small settlement on one of the islands in the southern end of the island world. Their Indian Ivory is a desirable colonial good.\n\nTetonka and his Iroquois are situated in a dense forest on one of the islands in the northern zone of the island world. The Iroquois trade furs, and purchase tobacco products and weapons.\n\nRamirez and his Pirates take refuge in expertly concealed hideouts in the southern zone of the island world. Due to their aggressive nature they take rich rewards from raids, therefore they can offer all colonial goods.\n\n\"Anno 1701\" is almost entirely focused on trade and economics, leaving little left over for war tactics. The combat has been simplified in some respects compared to the previous \"Anno\" game (\"Anno 1503\"), which makes it less involved and less difficult for new players.\n\n\"1701\" has a wealth of enhancements that distinguish it from its two predecessors, \"Anno 1503\" and \"Anno 1602\". These developments include:\n\nNow, players are settling the island world in the queen's name. Thus, she expects subservience and respect. Late in the game, she will begin demanding for tribute, giving you the choice to pay thousands of gold coins, or being attacked by her royal fleet. Either option will eventually lead to independence. Different opponents have different relationships with the queen. Deciding to attack the queen can upset many honorable opponents, while paying tribute can upset others.\n\nThe Free Trader, a neutral merchant who sails his fleet around the world to trade, can offer players opportunities to assist him in matters. The assignments are optional, but the reward is immense, and sometimes crucial to financial success. In some assignments, players have to deliver select goods, while in others, players have to destroy ships.\n\nTraveling dignitaries can now visit your city and enhance the quality and power of a player's empire. For example, when the smith arrives, he replenishes tool supplies. The entertainers can brighten the moods of the populace, leading to increased tax revenue. Guests of honor come at random times during each social stage of the game, and can also be called to visit once the senate is unlocked.\n\nUnlike in the previous game in the series, Anno 1503, players can choose how much to tax their people, bringing back an old system that was featured in the first ANNO game. Low taxes are required for a social upgrade and please the people, while higher taxes lead to revolt and a lower population.\n\nThe new goods available include chocolate, perfume, and colonial goods (Ivory, Jade, Talismans, Furs). Also, goods can now be purchased in a \"village center\", instead of at individual stands that had to be built individually in previous Anno games.\n\n\nLodge activities are accessed at the beginning of the game, although only the spy is available for use. All the other lodge activities are researched throughout the game at either a school or a university. Some of the very powerful activities available to players include the deployment of the poisoner (who introduces the plague to an opponent's settlement) or the demagogue (who can rally workers to walk away from their jobs).\n\nPlayers are now subject to Mother Nature's wrath. Hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions all have the power to destroy settlements. Diseases are also rampant in the 1701 AD world, specifically the plague, which can wipe out hundreds, or even thousands, of people. The plague of rats can ruin tons of goods as well.\n\n\"Anno 1701\" was the most expensive German game ever made at the time of its release, with a budget of €10 million.\n\nAs \"Anno 1602\" and \"Anno 1503\" had been commercial hits, together totaling 4.5 million units sold worldwide, pre-release sales estimates for \"Anno 1701\" were high. Retailers purchased 450,000 units in Germany in preparation for the game's launch; worldwide pre-orders from stores reached roughly 1 million copies. According to \"Der Spiegel\", the game and its predecessors were aimed at mainstream casual players who \"buy a game once a year and spend weeks with it\", a goal reflected in the new title's pre-release television advertising. Publisher Sunflowers Interactive noted a high percentage of female players among the \"Anno\" series' fanbase, and they were a target demographic for \"Anno 1701\".\n\nUpon release, \"Anno 1701\" broke German sales records to become the fastest-selling computer game in the region's history, with more than 200,000 units sold in German-speaking countries during its debut two weeks. In response, Sunflowers forecast 500,000 sales by the end of 2006. It ultimately finished the year with sales of 320,000 copies in the German market alone, for revenues of €12.7 million. This placed it second for 2006, behind \"World of Warcraft\" at 345,000 units.\n\nOn March 23, 2007, Sunflowers announced an add-on called \"Anno 1701: The Sunken Dragon\". It includes new features, new missions, and a map editor. The add-on has an Asiatic look, as well as a campaign with 11 missions centered on the new player profiles.\n"}

Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low). The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand. After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the \"house way\" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand. If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses. If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins. Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% vigorish for winning wagers. Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \"copy hands\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.\n\nIn Asia Poker a straight or flush can be played only in the four-card hand and they beat three-of-a-kind or worse.

{"id": "408230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408230", "title": "Blockbuster (entertainment)", "text": "Blockbuster (entertainment)\n\nA blockbuster is a work of entertainment – especially a feature film, but also other media – that is highly popular and financially successful. The term has also come to refer to any large-budget production \"intended\" for \"blockbuster\" status, aimed at mass markets with associated merchandising, sometimes on a scale that meant the financial fortunes of a film studio or a distributor could depend on it.\n\nThe term began to appear in the American press in the early 1940s, referring to aerial bombs capable of destroying a whole block of buildings. Its first known use in reference to films was in May 1943, when advertisements in \"Variety\" and \"Motion Picture Herald\" described the RKO film, \"Bombardier\", as \"The block-buster of all action-thrill-service shows!\" Another trade advertisement in 1944 boasted that the war documentary, \"With the Marines at Tarawa\", \"hits the heart like a two ton blockbuster\". Several theories have been put forward for the origin of the term in a film context. One explanation pertains to the practice of \"block booking\" whereby a studio would sell a package of films to theaters, rather than permitting them to select which films they wanted to exhibit. However, this practice was outlawed in 1948 before the term became common parlance; while pre-1948 high-grossing big-budget spectacles may be retrospectively labelled \"blockbusters\", this is not how they were known at the time. Another explanation is that trade publications would often advertise the popularity of a film by including illustrations showing long queues often extending around the block, but in reality the term was never used in this way. The term was actually first coined by publicists who drew on readers' familiarity with the blockbuster bombs, drawing an analogy with the bomb's huge impact. The trade press subsequently appropriated the term as short-hand for a film's commercial potential. Throughout 1943 and 1944 the term was applied to films such as \"Bataan\", \"No Time for Love\" and \"Brazil\".\n\nThe term fell out of usage in the aftermath of World War II but was revived in 1948 by \"Variety\" in an article about big budget films. By the early 1950s the term had become standardised within the film industry and the trade press to denote a film that was large in spectacle, scale and cost, that would go on to achieve a high gross. In December 1950 the \"Daily Mirror\" predicted that \"Samson and Delilah\" would be \"a box office block buster\", and in November 1951 \"Variety\" described \"Quo Vadis\" as \"a b.o. blockbuster [...] right up there with \"Birth of a Nation\" and \"Gone With the Wind\" for boxoffice performance [...] a super-spectacle in all its meaning\".\n\nIn 1975, the usage of \"blockbuster\" for films coalesced around Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\". It was perceived as a new cultural phenomenon: a fast-paced, exciting entertainment, inspiring interest and conversation beyond the theatre (which would later be called \"buzz\"), and repeated viewings. The film is regarded as the first film of the \"blockbuster era\", and founded the blockbuster film genre. Two years later, \"Star Wars\" expanded on the success of \"Jaws\", setting box office records and enjoying a theatrical run that lasted more than a year. After the success of \"Jaws\" and \"Star Wars\", many Hollywood producers attempted to create similar \"event\" films with wide commercial appeal, and film companies began green-lighting increasingly large-budget films, and relying extensively on massive advertising blitzes leading up to their theatrical release. These two films were the prototypes for the \"summer blockbuster\" trend, in which major film studios and distributors planned their annual marketing strategy around a big release by July 4. The next fifteen years saw a number of high-quality blockbusters released including the likes of \"Alien\" (1979) and its sequel, \"Aliens\" (1986), the first three Indiana Jones films (1981, 1984 and 1989), \"E.T.\" (1982), \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), \"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984), the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy (1985, 1989 and 1990), \"Top Gun\" (1986), \"Die Hard\" (1988), \"Batman\" (1989) and its sequel \"Batman Returns\" (1992), and \"The Hunt for Red October\" (1990).\n\nEventually, the focus on creating blockbusters grew so intense that a backlash occurred, with critics and some film-makers decrying the prevalence of a \"blockbuster mentality\" and lamenting the death of the author-driven, \"more artistic\" small-scale films of the New Hollywood era. This view is taken, for example, by film journalist Peter Biskind, who wrote that all studios wanted was another \"Jaws\", and as production costs rose, they were less willing to take risks, and therefore based blockbusters on the \"lowest common denominators\" of the mass market. In his book \"The Long Tail\", Chris Anderson talks about blockbuster films, stating that a society that is hit-driven, and makes way and room for only those films that are expected to be a hit, is in fact a limited society.\n\n\n"}

By the start of the First World War some of the associations had joined the Fédération internationale catholique d'éducation physique et sportive, with women's organizations rapidly following suit and joining the – a French catholic sporting organisation for women. In contrast to the situation in the North, the spread of sports through the southern regions of Algeria, under the auspices of the White Fathers (Pères Blancs), predominantly involved the indigenous populations.\n\nThe first of the Catholic youth sports associations were established in Algiers in 1913, namely: St. Croix (which was already involved with working class youth), St. Joseph Hussein Dey, and l’Avenir d’El Biar. They were created through an initiative of the Salesians of Don Bosco and the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and catered predominantly to young people of European origin. They immediately became affiliated with the Fédération gymnastique et sportive des patronages de France (FGSPF), and their focus, as with the associations in France, was the provision of moral instruction and military training. They were organised into regional unions in which both religious and secular people, including women, shared responsibilities. The first such union was established in Oran in November 1913 by a Father Koëger.\n\nDevelopment of the associations continued after the First World War: the Union régionale de la province d'Alger listed six associations in 1924, then nine by 1928. France supported and monitored these developments, and following an appeal by Monsignor Auguste-Fernand Leynaud, Archbishop of Algiers, 70 Catholic youth sports associations from various French departments – such as Bouches-du-Rhône, Alsace, Seine, Rhône, Landes, and Maine et Loire – took 3000 gymnasts and 500 musicians across the Mediterranean to participate in a large competition for federation member associations. The competition was organised to mark the centenary of French Algeria and was held on 14 June 1930. Three specially arranged boats set off from Marseille: the \"Lamoricière\", the \"duc d'Aumale\", and the \"Espagne\". On board, the executive team was made up of (a French law professor and leading sports bureaucrat), (a Catholic youth sports association leader who played an important part in the development of basketball in France), and Mr. Simounet, who was the official representative of the Under Secretary of State for Physical Education. Avant-Garde Saint-Denis was the team of the competition and Robert Herold was the individual champion.\n\nThe competition was followed by a reception hosted by the Governor General, Pierre-Louis Borde. Two wreaths were also laid at a war memorial, one by the , and the other by a Catholic organisation from Alsace which had brought 11 organisations to the competition. A trip to Sidi-Ferruch followed, where Monsignor Auguste-Fernand Leynaud laid the foundation stone for the city's church; two special trains and 18 buses were laid on for the occasion.\n\nAlger added one further association in 1931, and then in 1932 the Spartans of Eckmülh, Oran, were created by Father Bailly, who had connections with the Don Bosco youth association, which was founded in January 1893 by the Salesians. The Spartans soon became the largest basketball club in Algeria, with some of the players selected for the French national team. In 1936, Father Bailly's teams won all the titles in the Oran region, with the first team becoming champions of Algeria.\n\nAfter the Second World War, and as 1948–49 champions of North Africa, the Spartans beat the French military team by 22 points. They then beat the 1949 , Villeurbanne, and were crowned champions of the French Union on 11 June 1949; Oran became the basketball capital of North Africa as a result. After Algerian Independence the Spartans continued their involvement with basketball and gymnastics.\n\nSome of the Algerian associations were ahead of their time. In 1931, the association of St. Philip of Algiers, founded in 1922 and in which sport, such as gymnastics, and military training took place, began to allow female membership, including within their administration. Members had to be of majority age, have French nationality, and be entitled to exercise their civil and political rights however.\n\nThe \"Olympique du Petit Séminaire\" (OPS) was the last Catholic youth sports association created in Algeria and was founded during the insurgency. All those in charge at the OPS belonged to the social elite, and one was a member of the Clergy. In addition to teaching gymnastics and providing military training (including training in the use of rifles), the association encouraged the practice of other sports. It also encouraged choir singing as well as organizing recreational sessions and holiday camps. The association's statutes did not permit the admission of foreigners.\n\nOn 27 January 1963, during the year following Algerian independence, the statutes of the OPS were changed: military training was brought to an end and the association was renamed \"Olympique de Saint-Eugène\" (OSE), placing less emphasis on religion; membership continued to be made up of French nationals however. The OSE finally ceased to exist in 1967. Prior to this, on 1 July 1962, during the gymnastics and music championships of the Féderation Sportive de France (FSF) in Troy, a young gymnast and lawyer representing the Algerian unions, , had returned the flag of the Algerian youth associations to the president of the FSF.\n\nFemale members of the religious establishment were responsible for the creation of Catholic women's sports associations in Algeria after the First World War; the Dragonflies of the Redoubt, of Birmandreis, were founded in 1926 for example. However, the spread of these associations mainly took place just before the Second World War: the \"Mouettes Oranaises\" were founded in Oran in 1938, then the \"Hirondelles de Notre Dame d’Afrique\", the \"Mouettes\", the \"Mimosas du champ de manœuvre\", the \"Marguerites de Mustapha\", the \"Capucines de Belcourt\", the \"Glycines de Mustapha\", the \"Coquelicots de Mustapha\", the \"Rayon Sportif féminin algérien\", the \"Bleuets d’Alger\", the \"Boutons d’Or de Kouba\", the \" Bruyères d’Hussein Dey\" and the \"Cyclamens de Bab El Oued\" were founded in Algiers the following year.\n\nAll these associations were affiliated with the , founded in 1919 by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. The regional overseas committees of the Rayon sportif féminin were created in 1937, on the initiative of . In addition to gymnastics, the sports practised included basketball, volleyball, prisonball, swimming, canoeing, and cycling. In each diocese, the chaplain provided the instructors with spiritual training – which remained the prerogative of the clergy and directors of the associations. The Rayon sportif féminin insisted on leaders and instructors being practising Catholics: \n\nLike the men's associations, the regional unions of the RSF organized large competitions. These were placed under the authority of the highest ranking colonial officials. A prayer to Joan of Arc was offered at the competitions, together with a flag raising ceremony. The regional unions also provided training sessions for diocese-level association leaders, supported and supervised through the management framework based in France. It was during a mission to Algiers in this context, during the autumn of 1942, that , Deputy Secretary-General of the FGSPF, the authoritative body for France's zone libre at the time, joined the Free French Forces.\n\nFemale Muslim participation in the associations was low, though it increased with the war of independence. Notable examples of those who did participate are: Nini Derdéche Philippeville, the all-round French cross country runner-up in 1956, and Lila Khelif from Algiers, Algerian 1956 junior 800m, shot put, and javelin champion. Catholic female youth sports associations, which for so long had been the exclusive reserve of Europeans, nevertheless largely ceased to exist with the arrival of Algerian independence.\n\nThough the north of Algeria was divided into three French Algerian departments from 1902 (Algiers, Oran, and Constantine), Southern Algeria was made up of four militarily administered areas (Ghardaïa, Ain Sefra, Touggourt, and Oasis (whose seat was in Adrar); ) until the statute of 20 September 1947 gave these areas department status as well. Up until that time, the French Foreign Legion, the and the Saharan Méharistes (a kind of French cavalry, but with camels rather than horses) had been responsible for introducing participation sport to the South: they had indigenous people build tennis courts, additional to those already in existence at the larger hotels. This only contributed to a limited extent to the spread of participation sport amongst the indigenous population however. It was mainly down to another institution, one which often had a close and complementary relationship with the military, to achieve that on a significant scale.\n\nCardinal Charles Martial Lavigerie, professor of ecclesiastical history at the Sorbonne from 1854 to 1856, then bishop of Nancy in 1863, was appointed Bishop of Algiers in 1867. His outstanding management of the cholera outbreak which occurred there earned him great popularity amongst the Muslim population. Named Primate of Africa and the apostolic delegate for Sahara and the Sudan by Pius IX in 1884, he founded the Missionary Society of the White Fathers to work with the tribes of M'zab. They cared for the sick, evangelized, and provided schooling for children. The creation of sports associations, in addition to clinics and schools, enabled daily contact with young people, and from 1884 the White Fathers were already playing a role in the spread of sport; firstly amongst the local Kabyle populations, then throughout the wider southern region.\n\nMembers of the religious establishment, in conjunction with the military, very quickly began organizing \"méhari\" races (a \"méhari\" is a type of camel.). In 1890 Monsignor Lavigerie established the annual Touggourt-Biskra long distance race: 220 km and a first prize of 1000 francs. Its continued success led, in 1934, to government regulation of gambling associated with the event: \nAs was the case in the northern cities, traditional sports developed significantly in the South – from an institutional point of view – between the two world wars. In 1928, the \"Union sportive et de préparation militaire de Laghouat\" (Sports and Military Training Union of Laghouat) attempted to unify the French, Jewish and Arabic sections of the local community. Amongst the twelve members of the board of directors there were four Muslims. Military training was stopped After 1941 and the institution became the \"Union sportive de Laghouat\" (USL), (English: Athletic Union of Laghouat).\n\nThe \"Société sportive saharienne\" (SSS), (English:Saharan Sports Association) was listed in the \"Journal officiel de l'Algérie\" (Official Gazette of Algeria) on 15 November 1938. Its president was Rev. Lethielleux, a superior within the White Fathers. The association had two basketball teams, two football teams, and 40 trainees in the 10–15 age range.\n\nBut unforeseen problems surfaced. The association \"la Vie au Grand Air\" in Geryville (now El Bayadh), which offered athletics, football, and basketball, had three Muslims amongst its 11 board members. But power-sharing proved problematic, and two further associations were formed in 1939: \" l'Union sportive geryvilloise\" (Geryville Athletic Union) led by the Agha Si Larbi Ben Din, head of the zaouïa of the Oualed Sidi Cheikh and Knight of the Legion of Honor, and the \"Étoile du sud\" under the leadership of the White Fathers. Legislation introduced by the Vichy regime, however, led to the dissolution of these associations on 1 March 1941, and the re-establishment of a single association: the \"Stade Gérivyllois\" (Gerivylle Stadium), with the superior of the White Fathers continuing as vice-president.\n\nDue to the efforts of the White Fathers and the military, the sahrawi people of the South also began participating in organised sport, even though it had been established primarily for Europeans in the northern cities. The settled population gained access to participation sports – mainly football – and the official authorities properly organised and managed the traditional physical pursuits of the nomadic Bedouin.\n\n"}

Historically, the arcade catered toward competitive fighting games. The original arcade opened in 1944 and closed in February 2011, but reopened in May 2012 under different management. Chinatown Fair has been widely regarded as New York City's \"last great arcade\".\nChinatown Fair opened in 1944, taking over the first floor of the popular Port Arthur Chinese Restaurant building located at 7-9 Mott Street in New York City; previously, the first floor had been occupied by Soy Kee & Co., exporters, as well as the Eastern Trading Company. Chinatown Fair operated as a penny arcade and small museum for many years, before becoming a video game arcade in the 1970s. Indian immigrant Sam Palmer purchased the business in 1982 after having a \"religious vision\".\n\nOne of its first attractions was a dancing chicken. The dancing chicken was later replaced with a tic-tac-toe playing chicken, which was retired in the early 2000s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the arcade hosted many retro generation games including \"Pac-Man\" and \"Space Invaders\". In 1991, after the release of \"\", Chinatown Fair switched focus to competitive fighting games. By the late 1990s \"Street Fighter\", \"Marvel vs. Capcom\", \"The King of Fighters\", \"Soulcalibur\", \"Tekken\" and other fighting games were commonly played. Top players such as Justin Wong, NYChrisG, Michael \"Yipes\" Mendoza, and Sanford Kelly frequented the establishment.\n\nAs of 2010, \"The New York Times\" wrote that Chinatown Fair was among the last video arcades in the city. Video arcades have been in decline with the rise of home video games. The newspaper reported that it became \"a center for all the outcasts in the city to bond over their shared love\" of classic arcade and fighting video games no longer popular in modern arcades, with titles including the original \"Street Fighter 2\" (1991), \"King of Fighters\" (1996), and \"Ms. Pac-Man\". Other groups congregated around \"Dance Dance Revolution\" machines and racing games. Unlike the norm at other arcades, where winning players continue until deposed, Chinatown Fair players play a maximum of three or four continuous games.\n\nIn February 2011, Chinatown Fair closed down. On May 5, 2012 over a year later it reopened under a new name \"Chinatown Fair Family Fun Center\" with new manager and part owner, Lonnie Sobel. Former competitive players criticized the new arcade for catering toward casual players, with the new ownership explaining that they were targeting a new clientele. Competitive fighting game players relocated to Next Level, a Brooklyn arcade, which opened in 2011.\n\nThe arcade is the focus of the 2015 documentary, \"The Lost Arcade\", which was released in New York City on August 12, 2016.\n"}

Continuity announcers can also be found on digital and satellite channels, but most of these channels make use of pre-recorded announcements.\n\nThe BBC mainly uses live announcers on its flagship television channels BBC One and BBC Two, and mainly uses pre-recorded announcements on its digital channels (apart from BBC News and BBC Parliament, which do not use announcers at all). Separate continuity for BBC One and BBC Two in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is provided by regional announcers who also double as transmission directors. BBC Wales announcers also direct Wales Today news bulletins during breakfast, mid-afternoon and late night.\n\nPresently, the only national radio station to use continuity announcers is BBC Radio 4, where many of the announcing staff also act as newsreaders and also introduce the station's Shipping Forecast. Until about 1990, BBC Radio 2 used continuity announcers (separate from newsreaders) for its weekend and evening output, but these have since disappeared. Similarly, BBC Radio 3 has downgraded the former role of its announcers in favour of a new style of presenter. Continuity announcers played a much heavier role on the pre-1967 BBC Home Service, BBC Light Programme and BBC Third Programme (and other services on the last-named's frequency). Announcing staff for BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Wales double as newsreaders and technical operators.\n\nContinuity announcements for BBC television channels are broadcast from Red Bee Media at the White City Media Village in West London, with regional continuity teams based in the regional broadcasting centres in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow providing links for the regional variations of BBC One and BBC Two. CBBC and CBeebies continuity now airs from studios at MediaCityUK in Salford Quays – up until September 2011, CBBC presentation was broadcast from a small studio in the East Tower of BBC Television Centre while CBeebies presentation was pre-recorded at Teddington Studios. The announcing team for BBC Radio 4 work from a suite of studios on the 7th floor of Broadcasting House in London.\n\nHistorically, BBC announcers mostly spoke with Received Pronunciation, but the range of accents heard has widened considerably in recent years, and the general tone has become more informal.\n\nAndrew Martin, an expert from the BBC archives, described continuity announcements as \"an essential part of television,\" which \"actually tell us quite a lot about the style, the kind of attitudes of television in their particular era.\"\n\nIn-vision continuity announcers, who appeared on screen between programmes, were a staple part of television broadcasts from the very earliest days of television, because \"there was a need for linking material between programmes just to kind of announce them.\" In the early days of television, it was almost like a variety bill in the theatre... [and when] an item would come on, somebody had to say what it was often listing an entire evening's up-coming programming in one link.\n\nThe early announcers became \"celebrities in their own right,\" often receiving considerable amounts of fan mail, as they were among the most recognisable on-screen individuals, appearing every day, at the start of an era when television celebrity was really invented. Early in-vision announcers included Jasmine Bligh, Elizabeth Cowell and Leslie Mitchell, formerly a newsreel announcer who famously re-opened the television service in 1946. The early continuity announcers were auditioned, as \"they had to look good but they also had to speak well\", not solely because of the class divide, but because clear speaking was crucial to their role.\n\nIt is believed that in-vision continuity was last used during the peak viewing hours on BBC TV in the early 1960s, with a link into the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 the last-known example of the corporation's use of in-vision continuity (as well as existing out-of-vision continuity) across the national network.\n\nBetween the late 1960s and circa 1980, many of the BBC's English regions provided their own continuity on weekday evenings, including in-vision presentation – particularly at closedown. Regional in-vision continuity was still used by BBC South in Southampton, BBC Midlands in Birmingham and BBC North West in Manchester by the time English regional continuity was phased out. From 1998 to 2001, the Northern Ireland regional service on BBC Choice used in-vision continuity links.\n\nThe presentation of children's programmes had in-vision continuity from its instigation until 1965. The best-known children's in-vision continuity face was that of schoolgirl Jennifer Gay, one of the Children's Hour announcers, who introduced such favourites as Muffin the Mule between 1949 and 1953.\n\nIn-vision continuity was re-introduced as part of Children's BBC/CBBC) on 9 September 1985. From then until 1994, this came from the main BBC1 continuity suite itself, referred to as \"the broom cupboard\" and introduced by various presenters including Andy Crane, Andi Peters and Phillip Schofield; Since then, it has come from larger, specialised studios. As of September 2011, presentation for both CBBC and CBeebies originates from the BBC's MediaCityUK studios in Salford Quays, following the BBC Children's department move from London.\n\nIn February 2008, BBC Three introduced in-vision continuity links, in the form of live links with presenter Jose Vanders and recorded links with BBC Three viewers. For a time, the BBC Three website offered viewers the opportunity to record links for programmes. The live in-vision links were dropped after only a few months although live out-of-vision continuity during peak time returned in September 2011.\n\nOn 19 September 2008, the Scottish Gaelic-language digital channel BBC Alba launched with in-vision continuity from the channel's sole announcer, Fiona MacKenzie. A second in-vision announcer, Moira MacDonald, was appointed in July 2009. All continuity links are pre-recorded in Stornoway and transmitted from BBC Scotland's headquarters in Glasgow.\n\nAll announcements for ITV plc-owned stations on ITV, UTV and Channel Television, and for ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4 come from the company's main transmission facilities at Technicolor in Chiswick, with separate teams of continuity announcers based at the separately-owned STV's headquarters in Pacific Quay, Glasgow.\n\nMost announcements broadcast on ITV are conducted live, while overnight announcements, regional continuity on UTV and continuity for ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4 are usually pre-recorded, along with regional continuity. All of ITV plc's announcers work on a freelance basis.\n\nSTV uses live continuity during the evening (between around 5 pm and midnight) with daytime announcements pre-recorded by the duty prime time announcer during their shift. STV-branded presentation is used throughout the station's broadcast hours with transmission manned by technical staff in Glasgow 24 hours a day.\n\nThe consolidation of ITV companies during the 1990s and 2000s led to the closure of transmission and continuity facilities at some ITV company studios:\n\nThe use of on screen continuity announcers was common on ITV when each region was run by an independent company with their own transmission and continuity facilities. During the 1980s and 1990s, many regional companies abandoned the use of in-vision continuity announcers:\n\nThe only ITV companies which have never used in-vision continuity are Carlton Television (London) and Westcountry Television, who both began broadcasting on 1 January 1993. Granada Television, for its first 20 years or so, never used in-vision continuity as its CEO, Sidney Bernstein, considered it frivolous for a station that was trying to match the BBC in image and respectability (despite the BBC employing in-vision announcers at the time of Granada's launch) and felt that having a mere functionary like a continuity announcer appear in-vision would cheapen the station. This decision was reversed in the late 1970s, soon after Sidney Bernstein retired.\n\nChannel 4 employs continuity announcers on its network of stations; 4seven, Channel 4, E4, Film4 and More4. All announcements come from Red Bee Media at White City Media Village in West London. Since 2009, Red Bee have provided playout facilities for Channel 4. On 4seven, E4 and More4, announcements during evening primetime are now commonly broadcast live, with recorded announcements at other times; most announcements on Channel 4 are live. Announcements for 4Music programming, where used, are usually pre-recorded.\n\nChannel 4 used links featuring the announcer on-screen for a brief period following its launch in 1982, mainly at closedown. The station briefly reprised the use of in-vision continuity links for a short period from 1996, used mainly in evening transmissions.\n\nS4C announcers provide live out-of-vision continuity links from the channel's headquarters in Llanishen, Cardiff.\n\nS4C used in-vision continuity throughout broadcast hours from launch in November 1982 until around 1991.\n\nIn-vision presentation continues to be used during S4C's children strands, Cyw (for young children) and Stwnsh (for older children). Stwnsh links are mostly conducted live whereas Cyw links are mostly pre-recorded. Characters and presenters from S4C's Cyw output occasionally appear as guest announcers.\n\nChildren's presentation is produced by independent production companies Boomerang (Stwnsh/Cyw in-vision links) and Cwmni Da (Cyw).\n\nChannel 5 use announcers on its network of stations; 5*, 5USA and Channel 5. All announcements come from Channel 5's transmission facility in London.\n\nChannel 5 has only used on-screen announcers as part of its children's strand, Milkshake! which comes from studios at Hawley Crescent, London.\n\nSky1 out-of-vision continuity is broadcast live in the evening with pre-recorded links broadcast during the day and overnight.\n\nSky Living out-of-vision continuity is live, as of January 2016.\n\nSky Movies out-of-vision continuity is live, since January 2016.\n\nList of continuity announcers in the United Kingdom\n"}

There are two versions of the fabliau: one by Guerin and one anonymous. In summary, the story begins when a rich earl marries his daughter off to a \"young peasant\" and deems him a knight. The knight abandons the code of chivalry and lazes around for the first ten years of the marriage. When his wife, tired of his demeaning attitude and lazy nature, speaks of the greatness of the knights in her family, the husband decides to prove himself a worthy knight. He dresses in armor and goes into the forest on horseback. Once in the forest, he hangs his shield on the lowest branch of a tree and beats it until it looks as if it endured a great battle. The knight returns to his wife, shows her his bruised armor, and gloats about his victories. After a few trips into the forest, the wife begins to wonder why the knight himself is unscathed while his armor is in shambles. The next day, she suggests he take servants with him. When he refuses, the lady dresses in a full body suit of armor and follows him into the forest. When she sees him beating his own shield, she steps into sight and threatens to kill him for his dishonor to chivalry. The knight does not recognize his wife's voice. He begs for \"pity\" and offers to do anything to avoid conflict. His wife, disguised as a mighty knight, gives him the option of jousting her, in which he will surely die, or kissing her arse. Out of cowardice, the knight chooses to kiss her arse. She hops off her horse and pulls down her pants. While the knight should have recognized her female genitalia, he remarks that she has a long arse. Before she leaves, she tells him, \"I'm Bérangier of the Long Ass, Who puts shame to the chickenhearted.\" The wife returns home and sleeps with a valiant knight. When her husband arrives from the forest, he rebukes her. However, that was his last demeaning remark to her. She tells him she met Bérangier and learned of her husband's cowardice. To protect his own name, the knight is forced to succumb to his wife's wishes. Her cleverness leads her to do as she pleased for the rest of her life, and her husband lives in shame.\n\nThe husband's initial antagonistic behavior cues the gender moral of the story: constantly demeaning a clever wife can be dangerous. In order to find out her husband, the wife disguises herself as a knight who she calls “Berangier au lonc cul” [Bernagier of the long ass]. She follows her husband into the forest, and, upon seeing his foolish actions, “the roles are reversed”. Whereas the woman previously had “[caught] the brunt of [her husband’s] bragging and insults,” seeing the “absolute farce” of his claims in the forest inspires her to become a “hard, driving force that will not only teach him a lesson but also will annihilate him in position as leader in the household”. Upon the encounter with his wife, disguised as a valiant knight, the husband automatically reveals his cowardice and, out of terror, begs for mercy. His wife gives him an ultimatum: he can “jostez” [joust] and surely die or “vos me venroiz el cul baisier” [kiss her ass]. Without realizing the gravity of his decision, he yields the power in his marriage to his wife, reversing his position of power, when he refuses to fight the knight. In addition, he displays ignorance when he does not recognize her genitals; he merely thought the knight had “au lonc cul” [a long ass]. In an exploitation of his ignorant failure to recognize her female genitals, the wife and the audience share pleasure in the fact she has duped her husband and the fact he will never know. The story “draw[s] a conventional lesson about proper gender roles in marriage,” which suggests the demeaning of a wife by a husband is not “proper.” Thus, the reversal of the gender roles in this story creates the gender moral.\n\n"}
{"id": "226021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226021", "title": "Dynamics (music)", "text": "Dynamics (music)\n\nIn music, the dynamics of a piece is the variation in loudness between notes or phrases. Dynamics are indicated by specific musical notation, often in some detail. However, dynamics markings still require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context: for instance a \"piano\" (quiet) marking in one part of a piece might have quite different objective loudness in another piece, or even a different section of the same piece. The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in timbre and sometimes tempo rubato.\nDynamics are one of the expressive elements of music. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.\n\nDynamic markings are always relative. never indicates a precise level of loudness, it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than . There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking. For instance, the middle of a musical phrase will normally be played louder than the beginning or ending, to ensure the phrase is properly shaped, even where a passage is marked throughout. Similarly, in multi-part music, some voices will naturally be played louder than others, for instance to emphasis the melody and the bass line, even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level. Some instruments are naturally louder than others - for instance, a tuba playing \"piano\" will likely be louder than a guitar playing \"fortissimo\", while a high-pitched instrument like the piccolo playing in its upper register can usually sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments.\n\nFurther, a dynamic marking does not necessarily only affect loudness of the music. A \"forte\" passage is not usually \"the same as a \"piano\" passage but louder\". Rather, a musician will often use a different approach to other aspects of expression like timbre or articulation to further illustrate the differences. Sometimes this might also extend to tempo. It's important for a performer to be able to control dynamics and tempo independently, and thus novice musicians are often instructed \"don't speed up just because it's getting louder!\". However, in some circumstances, a dynamic marking might also indicate a change of tempo.\n\nIn some music notation programs, there are default MIDI key velocity values associated with these indications, but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed. Apple's Logic Pro 9 (2009-2013) and Avid's Sibelius 5 (2007-2009) use the following values: Sibelius 5 defines the following values, though these may be adjusted in Sibelius, within the range 0-127:\n\nThe two basic dynamic indications in music are:\n\nMore subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:\n\nUse of up to three consecutive s or s is also common:\n\nThree Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume:\n\n\nSigns sometimes referred to as \"hairpins\" are also used to stand for these words (See image). If the angle lines open up (), then the indication is to get louder; if they close gradually (), the indication is to get softer. The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong, then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter:\n\n</score>\n\nHairpins are usually written below the staff (or between the two staves in a grand staff), but are sometimes found above, especially in music for singers or in music with multiple melody lines being played by a single performer. They tend to be used for dynamic changes over a relatively short space of time (at most a few bars), while ', ' and \"\" are generally used for changes over a longer period. Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate over what time the event should occur, which may be as long as multiple pages. The word \"morendo\" (\"dying\") is also sometimes used for a gradual reduction in dynamics (and tempo).\n\nFor greater changes in dynamics, ' and ' are often used, where the \"molto\" means \"much\". Similarly, for more gradual changes ' and ' are used, where \"poco\" translates as \"a little\", or alternatively with \"poco a poco\" meaning \"little by little\".\n\nSudden changes in dynamics may be notated by adding the word \"subito\" (meaning \"suddenly\") as a prefix or suffix to the new dynamic notation. \"Subito piano (\"abbreviated \"\") (\"suddenly soft\") indicates that the dynamics quickly, almost abruptly, lower the volume to approximately the range. It is often purposefully used to subvert the listeners expectation and will signify an intimacy expression. Although it uses the \"piano\" dynamic symbol, the performer has slight freedom in their interpretation, causing it to vary based on the preceding loudness or character of the piece.\nAccented notes can be notated \"sforzando\", \"sforzato\", \"forzando\" or \"forzato\" (abbreviated , , or ) (\"forcing\" or \"forced\"), or using the sign >, placed above or below the head of the note.\n\n\"Sforzando\" (or \"sforzato\", \"forzando\", \"forzato\") indicates a forceful accent and is abbreviated as , or . There is often confusion surrounding these markings and whether or not there is any difference in the degree of accent. However, all of these indicate the same expression, depending on the dynamic level, and the extent of the \"sforzando\" is determined purely by the performer.\n\nThe fortepiano notation indicates a \"forte\" followed immediately by \"piano\". By contrast, is an abbreviation for \"poco forte\", literally \"a little loud\" but (according to Brahms) meaning \"with the character of forte, but the sound of piano\", though rarely used because of possible confusion with \"pianoforte\").\n\nWhile the typical range of dynamic markings is from to , some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis. Extreme dynamic markings imply an extreme range of loudness, or, alternatively, imply an extremely subtle distinction between very small differences of loudness within a normal range. This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th-century onwards. Generally, these markings are supported by the orchestration of the work, with heavy forte markings brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once.\n\nIn Holst's \"The Planets\", occurs twice in \"Mars\" and once in \"Uranus\", often punctuated by organ. Tchaikovsky marks a bassoon solo (6 s) in his \"Pathétique\" Symphony and uses in passages of his \"1812 Overture\" and his Fifth Symphony. The baritone passage \"Era la notte\" from Verdi's opera \"Otello\" uses , though the same spot is marked in the full score. Igor Stravinsky used at the end of the finale of the 1919 \"Firebird Suite\". Sergei Rachmaninoff uses in his Prelude in C, Op. 3 No. 2. Gustav Mahler, in the third movement of his Seventh Symphony, gives the celli and basses a marking of (5 s), along with a footnote directing 'pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood'. On the other extreme, Carl Nielsen, in the second movement of his Fifth Symphony, marked a passage for woodwinds a diminuendo to (5 s). György Ligeti uses extreme dynamics in his Piano Études: Étude No. 9 (\"Vertige\") ends with a diminuendo to (8 s), while Étude No. 13 (\"L'Escalier du Diable\") contains a passage marked (6 s) that progresses to a (8 s).\n\n\"On Music\", one of the \"Moralia\" attributed to the philosopher Plutarch in the first century AD, suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does rhythm or harmony.\n\nThe Renaissance composer Giovanni Gabrieli was one of the first to indicate dynamics in music notation, but dynamics were used sparingly by composers until the late 18th century. J.S. Bach used some dynamic terms, including \"forte\", \"piano\", \"più piano\", and \"pianissimo\" (although written out as full words), and in some cases it may be that was considered to mean \"pianissimo\" in this period.\n\nThe fact that the harpsichord could play only \"terraced\" dynamics (either loud or soft, but not in between), and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores, has led to the \"somewhat misleading suggestion that baroque dynamics are 'terraced dynamics',\" writes Robert Donington. In fact, baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics: in 1752, Johann Joachim Quantz wrote that \"Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft.\" In addition to this, the harpsichord in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). This allowed composers like J.S. Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions, without the need for notation.\n\nIn the Romantic period, composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores. Where Haydn and Mozart specified six levels ( to ), Beethoven used also and (the latter less frequently), and Brahms used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted. In the slow movement of Brahms's trio for violin, horn and piano (Opus 40), he uses the expressions , \"molto piano\", and \"quasi niente\" to express different qualities of quiet. Many Romantic and later composers added ' and ', making for a total of ten levels between and .\n\nThe introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music. Dynamic range compression is used to control the dynamic range of a recording, or a single instrument. This can affect loudness variations, both at the micro- and macro scale. In many contexts, the meaning of the term \"dynamics\" is therefore not immediately clear. To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics, the term \"performed dynamics\" can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer.\n\n"}

While the ESPN Zone name is no longer used, similar, still-operating restaurants include the ESPN Club at Disney's BoardWalk Inn and the ESPN Grill at ESPN Wide World of Sports, both located within the Walt Disney World complex in Bay Lake, Florida.\n\nIn 1992, Art Levitt conceived of an ESPN/Disney project, while he was Disney Parks and Resorts vice president of resorts and special projects, to increase Disney's Pleasure Island's attractions. Levitt's concept was \"to put an ESPN experience in Disney World\". Despite discussions with ESPN, the project was not immediately given the green light. Levitt exited Disney for the CEO post at Hard Rock Cafe International. The ESPN Club sports bar, at Walt Disney World with 13,000 square feet of TV screens, was a modest attempt that came from those discussions, and drew enough attendance as a proof of concept. The restaurant opened on July 1, 1996, at the BoardWalk entertainment complex.\n\nA similar project, Sports Center USA, led by Lynda O'Dea, attempted to get started for four years in the early 1990s with its selected first location at Baltimore's Power Plant. A lack of financing ended this project that was done in conjunction with Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.\n\nWith Disney's purchase of Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, ESPN was a key part of the purchase, which Disney chair/CEO Michael Eisner then moved into additional brand extensions from biweekly sports magazine, ESPN-themed restaurants, video games to retail stores. With Levitt having the original idea in 1992, Eisner turned to him to head up Disney Regional Entertainment, the subsidiary that would start up and run the chain.\n\nThe concept was originally called ESPN Grill when announced in October 1997, with a slate of major city locations scheduled to start with Baltimore, Maryland, in mid-1998 and Chicago in spring 1999. ESPN Grill was renamed on December 29, 1997 to ESPN Zone to connote that there was more to the venue. The first ESPN Zone opened in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 11, 1998, in the Power Plant on the Inner Harbor.\n\nThe Chicago location opened on July 10, 1999 in the North Bridge development where DisneyQuest, a fellow Disney Regional chain, opened a month earlier. After the Chicago location opening, there was to be a new location every three months.\n\nIn 2009, Disney Regional Entertainment closed two ESPN Zone locations. A restaurant in Denver closed in June, and another in Atlanta closed in October of that year. The Atlanta location had opened in 2000, while the Denver location opened in 2001. In both cases, Disney Regional Entertainment cited the \"economic environment\" as the reason for the closures.\n\nIn June 2010, all but two locations were shuttered, with the remaining restaurants located in Southern California. As part of the decision by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, through their Disney Regional Entertainment division, to no longer operate the restaurants in 2010, they sold the rights to operate the location in Anaheim to Zone Enterprises of Anaheim, another Disney subsidiary, and the L.A. Live location to Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns the L.A. Live complex.\n\nEmployees at the Baltimore ESPN Zone filed a class action lawsuit against Disney and its local subsidiary after the 2010 closing, claiming that Disney had violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988. U.S. federal district judge Catherine C. Blake, in a January 2013 decision, found that Disney and its local subsidiary violated the Act by failing to notify workers of the closing and underpaying them. Disney and the employees settled the lawsuit in November 2013; Disney paid approximately 70 percent of the employees' back pay.\n\nThe Los Angeles location, housed in the ESPN West Coast headquarters building, closed in July 2013.\n\nIn October 2017, Disney announced plans to replace ESPN Zone and other Downtown Disney vendors at the Disneyland Resort with a resort hotel, in conjunction with the opening of in 2019. The restaurant closed on June 2, 2018.\n\nThe prototype ESPN Zone was a two-level, 35,000 square foot complex with a stadium-like design which could hold 550 customers. People could dine at the bar or restaurant area. 200 TV screens were hung from the walls and ceilings. There were two special rooms, a screening room and a 10,000 square foot arena for actual and virtual game play.\n\nESPN Zone incorporated sports news into daily operations. Each shift, all staff were to receive daily sports news briefings. Placemats would be generated daily as a mini-sports page of a newspaper. The chain was to change its exclusive program, games, and memorabilia regularly.\n\nAll of the ESPN Zone restaurants were equipped to be remote ESPN broadcast locations, though only two were used to house regular series. The Anaheim ESPN Zone was the home of \"Unscripted with Chris Connelly\", from 2001 to 2002. The ESPN Zone in New York City's Times Square was used as the location of the \"Monday Night Football\" halftime show for several years. The weekly series \"The Sports Reporters\" was broadcast from the Times Square location every Sunday morning from its opening until its closing, at which point the show moved to ESPN's home base in Bristol, Connecticut.\n\nSeveral of the locations also had radio studios, used by the local ESPN Radio affiliate and leased to other stations on occasion.\n\nESPN Zone hosted the Ultimate Couch Potato Competition, a competitive sitting competition. In 2009, competitions were held in New York, Chicago and Baltimore. The Baltimore winner, Jessica Mosley, unofficially broke the Guinness World Record by sitting and watching consecutive sports for an unprecedented 70 hours, and 45 seconds. She repeated as Baltimore champion in 2010. The 2009 event received attention nationally, as well as from international outlets like the popular Australian television show \"Sunrise\". Jeff Miller, the 2010 winner in Chicago broke an ESPN Zone record and also unofficially broke the Guinness World Record by watching 72 hours of non-stop sports and his third win in the competition.\n\n\n\n"}

Fort Campbell, Kentucky, is located on the border between Tennessee and Kentucky. Its post office is in Kentucky. The neighboring communities are Clarksville in Tennessee and Oak Grove and Hopkinsville in Kentucky.\n\nThe Fort Campbell Children's Theatre was established in 1970 as part of the Morale Welfare Music and Theatre program. It resided in a World War II building on Indiana Avenue for several years until the building was required for other military purposes. After that, plays were held in the Soldier Show Center, also on Indiana Avenue, as well as the Cabaret Dinner Theatre. The Cabaret Dinner Theatre was first located on Indiana Avenue, and later moved to a larger facility which had been the former recreation hall of the old hospital. The Halloween and Christmas plays were usually held in the larger facility due to their popularity and the additional events held in conjunction with these programs, such as costume contests and visits from Santa.\n\nThe cast and crew of the plays were children who lived on Fort Campbell and in the surrounding areas. Most were Army family members, although residents of the community were also welcome. Rehearsals and performances were held after school, usually beginning at 4 p.m., and performances were also held at 2 p.m. on weekends. The directors were staff members of the Music and Theatre program, as well as some guest directors.\n\nThe head of the Music & Theatre Program at Fort Campbell was Lionel Austell, the Post Entertainment Director, who established the Music & Theatre program in 1967. Robert L. Taylor, a theatre specialist who had previously worked as a director at the Nashville Children's Theatre, organized the Children's Theatre program shortly after joining the staff at Fort Campbell. Taylor also directed plays for adults, which were presented in the Soldier Show Center and in the Cabaret Dinner Theatre.\n\nThe Children's Theatre was active for nearly 16 years, until the dissolution of the Music & Theatre program in 1986. Many of the plays were original adaptations of stories and fairy tales in the public domain, and some were totally original. After the initial launch, Heide Hepler, who was music specialist with the Music & Theatre program, shared management of the Children's Theatre with Taylor. Approximately 8-10 children's plays were presented annually.\n\nBilly St. John, a theatre specialist and a published author of plays, gave technical support with set design, costuming, lighting and other advice regarding the Children's Theatre. St. John's duties were primarily in the adult productions of the Soldier Show Center and the Cabaret Dinner Theatre; although an important element of the Children's Theatre, he was not one of the regular directors.\n\nLilo Rogoish, a family member, became costume designer and seamstress for many of the Children's Theatre productions as well as the adult plays held at the other theatres. Upon dissolution of the Music and Theatre program, Rogoish became head costume designer for the theatre program at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, TN.\n\nBoth Hepler and Taylor wrote original plays, adapted plays in public domain, and produced and directed published plays for the Children's Theatre. All acting and technical roles were filled by children and teenagers in the local area, with occasional technical support from adults, often parents and soldiers who were volunteers with the theatre program. Participation as performers, technicians and audience members was open to residents of the surrounding communities as well as the military and their family members residing on- and off-post. This was part of the community relations incentive of the installation.\n\nSpecial costumes were provided from the inventory of the Soldier Show Center, designed and created by staff members and parents, and were often commissioned. Lilo Rogoish, a community member and costume designer, often created costumes for the Children's Theatre as well as Soldier Show Center and Cabaret Dinner Theatre productions. When the Music and Theatre program closed, Rogoish became head of the costume department of the theatre program at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville.\n\nTaylor and Hepler often collaborated on original musicals, including \"The Witch Who Went West\", a Halloween production, and \"The Toymaker\", a Christmas production. The script and lyrics were written by Taylor, with music composed by Hepler. Dr. Charles H. Ball, professor of music education at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, collaborated with the two on the music of \"The Witch Who Went West\" and provided a soundtrack to be used with the production.\n\nAdditional plays adapted by Taylor include Coppélia, \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\", \"Pinnochio\", \"Swan Lake\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\". Adaptations written by Hepler include \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Through the Looking Glass\", \"Hansel and Gretel\" and \"The Pied Piper\".\n\nAndre La France, a soldier stationed at Fort Campbell, served as guest director for the production of his original play, \"Princess Tina\". Megan Hepler, nine years old, played the title role. The Children's Theatre occasionally sponsored playwriting contests, with the winning entries being produced at the theatre.\n\nHalloween, Christmas,and other special occasion productions were popular at the Children's Theatre.\n\nThe annual Halloween production, usually directed by Hepler, started with a play that was followed by a costume contest, door prizes and refreshments. \"The Witch Who Went West\", a musical collaboration with book and lyrics by Taylor, music by Hepler and soundtrack by Dr. Ball, was the story of a young witch who became bored with her life and decided to go west to find new adventures.\n\nThe Christmas production was directed by Taylor. One of the plays was his original, \"The Toymaker\", also a musical collaboration, featured two of Santa's elves whose job it is to make toys for Christmas delivery by using a large Toymaker machine. \"Junk\" goes into one side and beautiful toys come out on the other. When the Toymaker breaks just before delivery time, the elves have the dilemma of trying to fix the machine so that everything will be on schedule.\n\nIn 1984, the Children's Theatre organized a tour of the Disney children's musical version of \"Alice in Wonderland\" to all the elementary schools at Fort Campbell. The soundtrack was pre-recorded by all the children who performed in the play. Parents helped to shuttle the cast members and set pieces from school to school for nearly a week. All cast members were excused from their regular attendance by participating schools in order to participate in the tour.\n\nOne year the Children's Theatre presented short skits and comedy routines on a portable stage for the annual Fort Campbell Fourth of July Celebration. The popular celebration, open to all residents of the surrounding communities, also included games, static displays, food and a band concert, followed by fireworks. The event was always held at a post parade field.\n\nThe Children's Theatre was a popular venue at Fort Campbell until the termination of the Music & Theatre Program in 1986. After that, plays, including plays for children, were sometimes presented at Dale Wayrynen Recreation Center at Fort Campbell.\n"}

{"id": "54681275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54681275", "title": "Geography of media and communication", "text": "Geography of media and communication\n\nGeography of media and communication (also known as communication geography, media geography and geographies of media) is an interdisciplinary research area bringing together human geography with media studies and communication theory. Research addressing the geography of media and communication seeks to understand how acts of communication and the systems they depend on both shape and are shaped by geographical patterns and processes.\n\nGeography of media and communication is an area of research, which considers various facets of communication. One interest is the layout and organization of communication systems at scales from cities to the planet. Closely related to this are the varying levels of access to communication systems from place to place. Attention to how places differ in regard to communication access leads to an interest in the changes that occur in places when new media diffuse into those places. A complementary interest is in how places are represented in various media—for example pictures of idyllic beaches in tourism advertisements or written descriptions of war zones in newspaper stories. Communications also allow people to interact with distant places, so a final area of investigation is how, by interacting with others through various kinds of communication systems, people inhabit various kinds of \"virtual\" spaces.\n\nOf particular interest to media/communication theorists are questions regarding the social and cultural formations associated with media, which in turn point to how media are involved in the transformation of belonging and citizenship, which relate to geographical territories. Social and cultural formations also depend on distinctions between public and private life, which have traditionally depended on spatial boundaries between public and private places. Topics of particular interest to geographers are place representations in visual media including photography, film and graffiti, in auditory media including radio and music recordings, and even in embodied communications such as dance and video games.\n\nGeographical interest in the systematic study of communication can be traced to the writings of Richard Hartshorne in the 1930s. Hartshorne considered language to be a key element forming culture regions, meaning that the dominant language is similar within a particular culture region and it changes when one leaves a culture region. A very different aspect of communication became the focus during the 1950s and 1960s as geographers began to measure and model the interactions between locations. In this case, geographers involved in the quantitative revolution explained the accelerating flow of information between locations in terms of \"time-space convergence\" and \"human extensibility.\" It was not until the 1970s that geographers began to focus on communications in terms of content, considering questions of symbolism, representation, metaphor, iconography and discourse. This interest first took form in geographical research that drew on humanism, phenomenology and hermeneutics. By the 1990s, this approach shifted towards a more critical sensibility unpacking the various meanings of landscape. Geographers researching communication over the past two decades have extended these research areas while carrying forward early insights regarding the importance of communication to the formation of regions, the rate of information flow as a measure of spatial interaction, and the association between landscape and representation. New approaches to communication have been advanced under the frameworks of non-representational theory, actor-network theory, and assemblage theory. Equally important is the effort to think through digital code and its relationship with space.\n\nAccording to one taxonomy, the geography of media and communication involves four complementary aspects: places-in-media, media-in-places, media-in-spaces and spaces-in-media. Places-in-media are representations of place circulating in all sorts of media for all sorts of reasons, for example landscape paintings signifying the owner's status, and news images of urban spaces linking crime and chaos to minority populations and the poor. Media-in-places are ways in which particular places such as the home, classroom, workplace, or city street are altered functionally and experientially by transformations in how people use media in those places. Media-in-spaces are communication infrastructures, whether historical, like telegraph cables, or contemporary like optical fiber cable when mapped and analyzed in terms of their physical layout. Spaces-in-media are the topologies that symbols, images, information and ideas move through as they spread or diffuse from person to person and from group to group.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "949463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=949463", "title": "Gun fu", "text": "Gun fu\n\nGun fu, a portmanteau of \"gun\" and \"kung fu\" (also known as gun kata, bullet ballet, and gymnastic gunplay), is a fictional style of sophisticated close-quarters Gunfight resembling a martial arts battle played out with firearms instead of traditional weapons. It can be seen in Hong Kong action cinema and in American films influenced by it.\n\nThe focus of gun fu is both style and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand (usually paired with jumping to the side at the same time), shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as melee weapons are all common. Other moves can involve shotguns, submachine guns, rocket launchers, and just about anything else that can be worked into a cinematic shot. It is often mixed with hand-to-hand combat maneuvers.\n\nGun fu has become a staple factor in modern action films due to its visually appealing nature (regardless of its actual practicality in a real-life combat situation). This is a contrast to American action movies of the 1980s which focused more on heavy weaponry and outright brute-force in firearm-based combat.\n\nDirector John Woo originated the style in the Hong Kong film \"A Better Tomorrow\" in 1986. The film launched the \"heroic bloodshed\" genre in Hong Kong, and gun fu action sequences became a regular feature in many of the subsequent heroic bloodshed films. John Woo continued to make several classic heroic bloodshed films, all featuring gun fu, and all starring leading man Chow Yun-fat.\n\nAnthony Leong wrote of the gunfights in \"A Better Tomorrow\",\nStephen Hunter, writing in \"The Washington Post\" wrote,\nOther Hong Kong directors also began using gun fu sequences in films that were not strictly heroic bloodshed films, such as Wong Jing's \"God of Gamblers\" (1989). There were several heroic bloodshed films that did not feature gun fu, but opted for more realistic combat, such as Ringo Lam's \"City on Fire\" (1987).\n\nThe popularity of John Woo's films, and the heroic bloodshed genre in general, in the U.S. helped give the gun fu style greater visibility.\n\nOne classic gun fu move consists of reloading two pistols simultaneously by releasing the empty magazines, pointing the guns to the ground, dropping two fresh magazines out of one's jacket sleeves, or strapped to one's legs, into the guns, and then carrying on shooting. In \"Equilibrium\" (2002) the law enforcement responsible for handling \"Sense Crime\" are trained in \"gun kata\" to gain an advantage in their raids on armed opponents. In the film \"Bulletproof Monk\" (2003), The Monk With No Name (portrayed by Chow Yun-fat) empties two pistols, ejects the magazines and spins to kick the empty magazines at his assailants. The style is also featured (albeit in a small way and with the assistance of gadgets) in the \"\" movies. In \"Wanted\" (2008), assassins belonging to The Fraternity possess the skill of \"bending\" bullets around obstacles; in a gunfight early in the film, one assassin knocks another bullet out of the air with his own round. In \"\" (2009), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) reloads his handguns by throwing them into the air and catching them with the magazines he's holding in his hands.\n\nIn the 2010 film \"Kick-Ass\", the character Hit Girl, played by Chloë Grace Moretz, frequently uses gun fu. In the 2012 film \"Django Unchained\", the climactic shootout in Candieland is inspired by John Woo, replicating scenes from \"The Killer\" shot-by-shot. The 2013 \"\" also featured gun fu in the climactic fight between Roadblock and Firefly. Gun fu is also featured heavily in the 2014 film \"John Wick\" and , as well as the 2015 film \"\".\nIn the 2017 CGI film \"\", Chris Redfield and Glenn Arias engaged in a gun fu fighting sequence.\n\nThe \"Half-Life\" game modification \"The Specialists\" is one of the very few examples of multiplayer gun fu. The mod features melee and gun combat, with encounters often resulting in frenzied exchanges involving both types of attack. Dual-wielding weapons, slow motion, and advanced melee are popular features of the mod which still has a loyal following years after the final version was announced. Another \"Half-Life\" mod, \"The Opera\", is named after Hong Kong blood operas, and features akimbo-wielded handguns and stylized gunplay - players are awarded cash for stylish kills performed during flips, cartwheels, and other martial-arts inspired maneuvers.\n\n\"Gun fu\" moves, closely tied with a slo-mo concept essential to their execution, appear in the video game \"Max Payne\", along with dual-wielding various weapons, including semi-automatic pistols and machine pistols such as the Uzi and the Ingram MAC-10. The game, itself heavily influenced by Hong Kong action cinema, arguably signified the advent of extensive slo-mo as an interactive device in videogames.\n\n\"\" features a character, Natan, whose special skill is labeled \"Gun Fu\" and is designed to resemble the martial art.\n\nDante, from the Devil May Cry series, employs gun fu using a variety of firearms, the wielding of dual pistols being his trademark.\n\nIn 2007, \"Stranglehold\", a game sequel to John Woo's cult film \"Hard Boiled\", was released, which featured the protagonist Police Inspector Tequila on another blood driven conquest.\n\nNoel Vermillion from the fighting game \"BlazBlue\" also uses Gun Kata with her two Nox Nyctores pistols, called Arcus Diabolus Bolverk.\n\nIn 2009, Cryptic Studios released \"Champions Online\" which features a Munitions character class with skills involving dual-wielding pistols; many of the powers combine firing with martial arts, including a power called \"Bullet Ballet\" and a high level ability called \"Lead Tempest\". The similar game \"City of Heroes\" incorporated a Dual Pistols power set in the expansion pack, \"Going Rogue\", which involves switching between ammunition types mid-combat and various trick shots.\n\n\"Wet\", a grindhouse-inspired, Tarantino-esque shooter action game, was also released in 2009. Rubi Malone, the main player character, carries an assortment of weapons, including twin pistols, dual shotguns, and submachine guns, and if the player fires these guns while acrobatically jumping through the air, sliding on the ground, or running on a wall, then the game will slow down into bullet-time. Performing successive kills while in this bullet-time state increases Rubi's health regeneration rate and the player's points score, which is used to purchase upgrades.\n\nThe titular character in the video game \"Bayonetta\" features combat resembling gun fu. In addition to hand-held pistols, the character has pistols built into the high heels of her boots. Her guns range from her signature weapon, \"Scarborough Fair\", to rocket launchers and unique \"gun-chuckiez\".\n\nThe Ranger/Desperado class in \"Dungeon Fighter Online\" has several \"gun fu\" style abilities.\n\nThe online game, \"Ragnarok Online\", has a Gunslinger class, whose main skills resemble gun fu. Gunslinger's advanced class, Rebellion, also has gun fu skills, and is also the only class capable of wielding the powerful Altair and Ares, a pair of guns.\n\nA Korean made online game, \"S4 League\", features this type of gameplay.\n\nThe 2012 video game, \"The Darkness II\", has \"Gun Kata\" as one of the abilities that can be purchased.\n\n2013 video game \"Deadpool\" also features \"Gun Kata\" as a non-upgrade-able skill.\n\nAthena from 2014's \"Borderlands - The Pre-Sequel\" has a skill called Gun Kata that boosts her gun and melee damage.\n\nVayne, a character from the MOBA Game \"League of Legends\" does the Gun Kata stances in her dance animation. In addition, the character Lucian does Gun Kata in his recall animation.\n\nIn the 2016 game \"Overwatch\", the character Reaper performs a Gun Kata-Styled attack when using his ultimate ability: Death Blossom.\n\nIn the Free to Play game Warframe, the frame known as Mesa has an ability called Peacemaker in which she goes into an aimbot mode and does Gun Kata moves as she shoots enemies.\n\nIn , the class of Senseis and Imagiantors known as gunslingers use special techniques based around gunkata.\n\nIn the video game series, Hitman, the main character Agent 47 dual wields pistols\n\n\"Gun Fu\" is also the name of a series of comic books by Howard M. Shum and Joey Mason, about a Hong Kong police officer in the 1930s who employs a combination of gun-play and martial arts. In the \"Iron Fist\" comic books, the character Orson Randall uses his Iron Fist power with his two fire-arms, which a colleague jokingly refers to as \"Gun-Fu\".\n\nIn the Buffyverse role-playing games, gun fu is the name for the firearms skill, but this is more likely meant to be humorous rather than to imply characters practice an actual firearm-based martial art.\n\nIn the \"Ninjas and Superspies\" supplement \"Mystic China\", gun fu is the Triad assassin training, and is a martial arts skill that can be available to player characters. It primarily emphasizes the use of paired 9mm pistols.\n\nIn the Japanese series \"Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger\", DekaRed is specifically mentioned as a master of gun fu technique, which in the series is called as \"Juu Kun Do\" ( is the Japanese word for 'gun'). As a result, the mecha for the series, Dekaranger Robo, is also sometimes shown using gun fu. The American adaptation of the series, \"Power Rangers S.P.D.\", also shows the Red Ranger and the Delta Squad Megazord using the same technique, though that was more because of the source material - the S.P.D. Red Ranger isn't specifically mentioned as being a master of gun fu.\n\nIn the anime \"Mazinkaizer SKL\", Ryou Magami (one of the two pilots of the titular Mazinkaiser) uses gun fu as his primary style of combat as he wields the Breast Triggers, a pair of handguns which store on Mazinkaiser's chest. Magami's fight scenes contain several visual homages to the film \"Equilibrium\", including a scene in the first episode where Mazinkaiser performs the signature pose of the Grammaton Clerics.\n\nIn \"Run and Gun\", a expansion of the fifth-edition of the pen-and-paper role-playing game \"Shadowrun\", gun fu is a combat style available.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4556995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4556995", "title": "Higurashi When They Cry", "text": "Higurashi When They Cry\n\n, known simply as When They Cry for the North American release of the anime adaptation, is a Japanese murder mystery dōjin soft sound novel series produced by 07th Expansion. The games are built on the NScripter game engine and are playable on the Windows operating system. The first game in the series, \"Onikakushi-hen\", was released on August 10, 2002, and the eighth and final game in the original PC series, \"Matsuribayashi-hen\", was released on August 13, 2006. While the first four games carried the overall title \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\", the next four games were produced under the title \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\". A bonus fan disc called \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei\" was released on December 31, 2006. In addition to the original series, new story arcs were created in manga form and in video games for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS in order to expand upon the story. The original eight PC releases were released in English by MangaGamer in 2009 and 2010. The series focuses on a group of young friends living in the rural village of Hinamizawa and the strange events that occur in 1983.\n\nTwo sets of drama CDs were produced, one by Wayuta and the other by Frontier Works. Novelizations of the game series were released by Kodansha Box between August 2007 and March 2009. A manga series adapted from the games began with eight different manga artists working separately on one to three of the multiple story arcs and were published by Square Enix and Kadokawa Shoten. The manga was licensed for release in English in North America by Yen Press under the title \"Higurashi: When They Cry\" and the first volume was released in November 2008. Following the manga's release in Japan, two anime television series were produced by Studio Deen in 2006 and 2007; a third anime adaptation was released as an original video animation (OVA) series in 2009. The first anime series was licensed by Geneon Entertainment in English, but the license expired in 2011. Sentai Filmworks has since licensed both anime seasons and the \"Rei\" OVAs. A live-action film adaptation of the series, directed by Ataru Oikawa, premiered in Japanese theaters in May 2008, with a sequel released in May 2009. A six-episode live-action television series adaptation premiered in Japan in May 2016, and a four-episode sequel premiered in November 2016.\n\n\"Higurashi\" is a murder mystery game described as a \"sound novel\" by 07th Expansion. A sound novel is similar to a visual novel in that the gameplay requires relatively little player interaction as most of the game is composed of text dialogues. The original release contained no voice acting for the characters. While a visual novel's basis would be the visual aspect as the name suggests, a sound novel's basis takes more care in producing an atmosphere via the music, sound effects, and the story itself.\n\nThe game utilizes intermissions where the player can obtain several Tips. These Tips allow the player to read various supplementary information that may or may not be useful in solving the mystery. For example, one of the Tips can be as simple as \"this is a small village; children who go to this school are combined into one classroom regardless of what grade or year they are in.\" On the other hand, they can provide valuable hints, such as being able to read the excerpts of the newspaper articles regarding the murders that occurred in Hinamizawa. At the beginning of each of the story arcs, a cryptic poem by someone known as Frederica Bernkastel is read; these reveal some of what is going to happen in the following arc.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 port \"Matsuri\" differs from the original game series in that it includes full voice acting, redrawn CGs, and integration of the question arcs starring Keiichi into a single branching storyline. \"Matsuri\" includes the first seven PC arcs (\"Matsuribayashi-hen\" is excluded) and three original final arcs—\"Taraimawashi-hen\", \"Tsukiotoshi-hen\" and \"Miotsukushi-hen\". After the original seven arcs are cleared, the first two final arcs become available. Furthermore, when these two final arcs are cleared, the epilogue, \"Miotsukushi-hen\", is unlocked. The DS ports that compose \"Kizuna\" include most of the CGs from Matsuri, as well as some new ones, a similar arc integration system to \"Matsuri\", and partial voice acting for certain emphasized scenes.\n\nIn \"Higurashi: When They Cry\", there are seven main characters who appear in almost every scenario. The main protagonist is Keiichi Maebara, a young boy who has recently moved to Hinamizawa with his family and begun to adapt to life in the countryside. Keiichi has a natural charisma which allows him to make friends easily. Since the village is a small town of about two thousand people with only a single school, there are not many children around his own age; he easily meets the others his age and becomes friends with them.\n\nOne of these good friends is a seemingly ditsy and sweet girl named Rena Ryugu. She, like Keiichi, is new in Hinamizawa, having only returned from Ibaraki a year before the story begins. She has an obsession with things she considers to be cute—generally, others do not agree—and will often scavenge for such things at the local dump and bring them back home. Before she met Keiichi, Rena became friends with a tomboy Mion Sonozaki, the leader of the group and president of their club, who keeps secrets hidden from the others. Her twin sister, Shion, lives in Okinomiya. Although their personalities are different, she and Mion have switched places in the past, and the change is nearly indistinguishable.\n\nThere are other girls in the club younger than Keiichi, Rena and Mion. One is Satoko Hojo, a clever girl who is quite skilled at setting traps when playing games with her friends. She usually has an energetic and mischievous personality, but this hides a past full of trauma. Her older brother, Satoshi becomes similar to Keiichi. Her friend, Rika Furude, is revered by the villagers as the heir of the local shrine and plays the role of a miko in the annual Watanagashi Festival. Despite her young age, she sometimes expresses a type of wisdom which would normally be beyond her years and is quite fond of sake. Rika is also the girl who becomes the central figure so that the village can avoid a tragic end. Hanyū, a goddess who appears late in the story but in fact, has been with Rika for a very long time, though only Rika can see her.\n\nOf the remaining cast, there are those such as Oishi Kuraudo, the soon to be retired police officer, who solves the mystery of the disappearances, including freelance photographer Jirō Tomitake, and clinic nurse and mercenary leader Miyo Takano. Takano has a keen interest in the village's past and culture. She works with the head doctor and baseball coach, Kyosuke Irie, who takes care of Satoko.\n\n\"Higurashi: When They Cry\" takes place during June 1983 in a fictional rural village called (based on the village of Shirakawa, Gifu, a World Heritage Site), which has a population of approximately 2,000. The main character, Keiichi Maebara, moves to Hinamizawa and befriends his new classmates Rena Ryugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hojo. Keiichi joins their after-school club activities, which consist mostly of card and board games (and punishment games for the loser – usually him). Hinamizawa appears to be a normal, peaceful, rural village to Keiichi. However, the tranquility abruptly ends after the annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration to commemorate and give thanks to the local god, \"Oyashiro\". Keiichi learns that every year for the past four years, one person has been murdered, and another has gone missing on the evening of the Watanagashi Festival. Keiichi himself soon becomes drawn into the strange events surrounding the Watanagashi Festival and Oyashiro. In each story arc, he or one of his friends becomes paranoid and a crime is committed. Usually, the crime involves the murder of one of their own friends.\n\nWhile the story arcs follow various plots, the general basis is thus: During ancient times, the village where Hinamizawa sits is founded, unknowingly near a swamp that contains a parasite that causes paranoia and eventual madness. This parasite is interpreted by the villagers at the time to be demonic possession, and laws are placed that state it is taboo to leave the village. This law is eventually enshrined as holy laws of a local deity, Oyashiro, and the punishment eventually becomes death by torture, as the village became paranoid of being wiped out if too many \"demons\" leave the village. Living in the village, and the presence of the shrine maidens, who produce a sort of pheromone, holds the disease in check.\n\nEventually, the village customs fade, and in 1983, a bioweapons researcher named Miyo Takano decides to deliberately release the disease to vindicate the work of her adoptive grandfather, who was mocked and shamed by the scientific community for his thesis about the disease, by killing the current shrine maiden, Rika. However, a spirit, Hanyu, rewinds time to save Rika's life. But rather than simply reset, the universe of the rewound time becomes slightly different, influenced by changed past events of the characters' lives and personalities, with Hanyu and Rika being the only characters aware of this. This leads to the multiple plot lines that are independent, with the only common thread being Rika's murder by Takano's henchmen, which releases the disease on the village and wipes it out.\n\nAfter several hundred loops, Keiichi becomes aware of them in a handful of flashbacks, and subconsciously remembers several of his past loops, which allows him to avoid several critical points where various characters would be murdered or driven insane, and the group of friends nearly manages to outwit Takano. In the final loop, the group asks Hanyu to join them, and the spirit manages to manifest a physical body. With her assistance, they manage to stay alive long enough to prevent Takano's plan. Hanyu travels back in time to alter Takano's past, saving her father's life and preventing her psychotic drive from forming.\n\nIn the \"Higurashi\" games, there are several story arcs, the original eight of which are referred to as either question arcs or answer arcs. The answer arcs generally recapitulate the events of the corresponding question arc, but from a different perspective, using the change of protagonist to solve various mysteries and come to a different conclusion. Each of the eight original games for the PC represented separate arcs of the overall storyline. Apart from the main question and answer relationship, the story of the arcs are not directly connected, although a multitude of parallels exist which allow the observant reader to gain extra insight into the mystery.\n\nThe games form what are referred to as the question arcs. These first four games of the series were meant to give the player a sense of the world where the story takes place and introduce the mysterious circumstances surrounding the village of Hinamizawa. Since there are no concrete answers given to the questions that the story presents in these arcs, the question arcs allow the player to form his or her own opinions about the events taking place in the village. Each question arc game contains all of the previous question arcs.\n\nThe games form what are known as the answer arcs. The last four games released in the series, were, in contrast to the question arcs, meant to answer all of the questions presented in the first half of the series. These arcs can be considered the \"solutions\" of the previous arcs. Each answer arc game contains all of the previous answer arcs.\n\nThree extra chapters were included in a fan disc named , two of which were newly created. \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei\" was released on December 31, 2006.\n\nThree original chapters were created for the PlayStation 2 version , by Alchemist.\n\nFour original chapters were created for the Nintendo DS version , by Alchemist.\n\nThese side stories are original chapters serialized in manga form which supplement the games and partially continue the story.\n\nThe \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" series is the first visual novel series produced by 07th Expansion. The game director and scenario writer for the series are Ryukishi 07, who also drew all of the character illustrations. Background images were taken from photographs taken by Ryukishi07, his younger brother Yatazakura, and Kameya Mannendō. Programming was worked on by Yatazakura, who worked on the main structure, 4U who worked on the intermission and Tips, and BT who worked on the mini games. The games were designed using the game engine NScripter. The music of \"Higurashi\" was provided by various music artists including both professionals and \"dōjin\" artists, including Dai, the composer of most of the music found in the answer arcs.\n\nRyukishi 07 wrote in 2004 how he was influenced by Key's works during the planning of \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\". Ryukishi 07 played Key's games as a reference, among other visual novels, and analyzed them to figure out the reason why they were found to be so popular. He figured that the secret was due to how the stories would start with ordinary, enjoyable days, but then a sudden occurrence would happen to lead the player to cry due to the shock value. He used a similar model for the basis of \"Higurashi\" but instead of leading the player to cry, Ryukishi 07 wanted to scare the player with the addition of horror elements. In this way, Ryukishi 07 wished to be in some way associated with Key who he described as a \"masterpiece maker.\"\n\nIn an interview in the December 2008 issue of Yen Press's \"Yen Plus\" manga anthology, Ryukishi 07 stated that \"Higurashi\" had its origins from an unpublished theater script called he had written a few years before the first \"Higurashi\" game was released. When he decided to rewrite the script and release it, he wanted to build upon \"the contrast between a fun, ordinary life, and something terrifying and out of the ordinary.\" Ryukishi 07 was greatly influenced by the worlds of Seishi Yokomizo when developing the universe of \"Higurashi\". Ryukishi 07 had decided \"early on to design the story so that the truth comes to light by looking at several overlapping stories,\" though he originally planned to release it as a single game due to initially believing he could finish the story in a single year.\n\nThe word \"higurashi\" is the name of a kind of cicada. \"Naku\" means , specifically referring to those sounds made by non-human organisms. According to the original creator, Ryukishi 07, the red Na (な) in the logo is an official part of the title.\n\nThe first game of the \"Higurashi: When They Cry\" visual novel series, titled \"Onikakushi-hen\", was released on August 10, 2002. The second game \"Watanagashi-hen\" was released on December 29, 2002. The third game \"Tatarigoroshi-hen\" was released on August 15, 2003.

Each chapter keeps the same cast of main characters and general premise but unfolds in a different manner. Each of the chapters give valuable answers, hints, and clues as to the mysteries of the previous installment while at the same time bringing forth even more mysteries.\n\nThe eight original PC games were released in English by MangaGamer under the title \"Higurashi: When They Cry\" starting with the first four games released in December 2009 and the last four released in monthly intervals starting in February 2010. MangaGamer's release of the visual novels does not include several background music tracks and other bonus features specific to the original Japanese version which include: the staff room, the music room, and a minigame.

Funimation released a complete box set of the series in August 2009. However, in August 2011, the rights to the series expired due to low sales. Sentai Filmworks has licensed both anime series.\n\nPeople in Japan, who had bought all nine of the DVDs of the first season, had the chance to receive a special anime DVD entitled \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gaiden Nekogoroshi-hen\", based on the short story that was given to those who had bought the manga. Despite being a bonus for the first season (and having the first season's opening and closing sequences), \"Nekogoroshi-hen\" featured the updated animation style as seen in the second season.\n\nA continuation of the series, based on one new story arc and the final two original answer arcs of the franchise, entitled \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\", aired in Japan between July 6 and December 17, 2007, containing twenty-four episodes. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the second anime series. The second season featured slightly different character designs than the first season and better animation. As the result of a murder case in September 2007 in Japan involving the murder of a police officer by his sixteen-year-old daughter with an axe, as well as the Japanese media relating the case to anime such as \"Higurashi\", the latest episode screenings of both \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\" and another anime at the time, \"School Days\", were canceled by a number of Japanese TV stations due to excessive violence; however, AT-X, TV Saitama and Sun TV announced that they would be airing the episodes as planned. Later, TV Saitama announced that they had ceased broadcasting of \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\" from episode thirteen onwards. Additionally, \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\" had its opening altered when it re-aired. Originally, a bloody bill hook cleaver (as used by Rena) was shown halfway through (at timestamp 0:55) the opening; it was replaced with an image of a van from the series' fictional junk yard.\n\nA three-arc, five-episode original video animation series, entitled \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei\", began to be released on\nFebruary 25, 2009, and is directed by Toshifumi Kawase. The OVA series also started a limited broadcasting in Bandai Channel prior to DVD release. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the \"Rei\" OVAs. The OVA contains three story arcs, \"Hajisarashi-hen\", \"Saikoroshi-hen\", and \"Hirukowashi-hen\", with \"Saikoroshi-hen\" concluding in three episodes, and the other two arcs concluding in one episode each. \"Hajisarashi-hen\" was originally a light novel included with the limited edition of the PlayStation 2 game \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Matsuri\", and took the place of \"Batsukoishi-hen\" from the \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei\" fandisc. Frontier Works announced another original video anime series, \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kira\", in March 2011, which marks the tenth anniversary of \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\". An anime series titled \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku: Outbreak\", adapted from Ryukishi 07's short story \"Higurashi Outbreak\", was announced in December 2012 and was later released in August 2013.\n\nA live action film adaptation of the series entitled , directed by Ataru Oikawa, premiered in Japanese theaters on May 10, 2008. The film is an adaptation of the first story arc, \"Onikakushi-hen\". Gōki Maeda plays Keiichi, Airi Matsuyama plays Rena, Rin Asuka plays Mion, Aika plays Rika, and Erena Ono plays Satoko. A sequel, also live action, was released in Japanese theaters on April 18, 2009 and is entitled . The sequel is based on the \"Tsumihoroboshi-hen\" arc.\n\nA live-action television series adaptation premiered in Japan on May 20, 2016 on cable channel BS SKY PerfecTV!. The cast includes the members of NGT48. A four-episode sequel premiered on November 25, 2016.\n\nUnlike visual novels created by established companies, 07th Expansion did not create the music found in the \"Higurashi\" games. The music for the question arcs consists of license free songs found on the Internet while the music for the answer arcs was provided by dōjin music artists that were fans of \"Higurashi\". Later, a CD album called \"Thanks/you\" was released by the dōjin music artist, Dai; many of his tracks were used in the answer arcs. Fans initially referred to this album as the official soundtrack. However, the actual official soundtrack has since been released for the series, featuring a majority of the songs featured in the answer arcs. This two-disc set is, to date, the most complete collection of songs from the games.\n\nThe first season anime's opening theme is \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" sung by Eiko Shimamiya; it went on sale in Japan on May 24, 2006. The ending theme is \"Why, or Why Not\" sung by Rekka Katakiri; it was released on June 28, 2006. There have been two original soundtracks released for the anime adaptation. The main composer for the tracks was Japanese composer Kenji Kawai and the albums were produced by Frontier Works. Volume 1 was released on July 21, 2006, and volume 2 was released on October 6, 2006, in Japan. Three character song CDs were also released, sung by voice actors from the anime adaptation, between March 28 and July 25, 2007. The second season anime's opening theme is \"Naraku no Hana\" also sung by Shimamiya. The first season's opening theme includes a hidden message : the unintelligible lyrics at the beginning (\"hanni hara hare hi\") were generated by reversing the phrase . The second season's opening theme also includes a reversed part at the end (\"ie hanann\") which was made by playing backwards the reversed bit from the first opening theme. The ending theme is \"Taishō a\" performed by anNina. The first OVA season's opening theme is \"Super scription of data\" by Shimamiya, and the ending theme is by anNina. The opening theme for the OVA \"Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kira\" is \"Happy! Lucky! Dochy!\" by Yukari Tamura, Mika Kanai, and Yui Horie—the voice actors for Rika, Satoko, and Hanyu, respectively. The ending theme, , had four separate versions: one by Mai Nakahara, Rena's voice actor and the others are sung by Yukari Tamura and Mika Kanai, Satsuki Yukino, Mion and Shion's voice actor, and Yui Horie.\n\nFor the first live-action film, a short version of the film's theme song was released on December 22, 2007, in Japan. Once again, Shimamiya sang the song, entitled . Shimamiya also performed the ending theme entitled .\n\nOver 100,000 copies of the original games were sold in Japan by 2006, a feat not attained by a dōjin game since Type-Moon released \"Tsukihime\". Many fans attribute the game's success to the suspense and horror the novel portrays. Fan-based community boards emerged where fans began discussing their own theories. The popularity of the games grew exponentially as many took interest in their well-outlined script and story, which eventually led the game to be showcased in large gaming magazines with positive reviews. With the announcement of the live-action film adaptation of \"Onikakushi-hen\" came the news that over 500,000 copies of the games have been sold. The enhanced PlayStation 2 port, \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Matsuri\", has sold over 140,000 copies to date, and has received a total review score of 31/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 9, 8, 8, and 6) from the Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\". The game was voted the tenth most interesting bishōjo game by readers of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" in an August 2007 survey.\n\nThe English-language Steam versions of the first two episodes, released in 2015, sold 57,000 copies as of December 2015. This adds up to total sales of over 557,000 copies worldwide as of October 30, 2015. It received a positive reception from English-language critics. \"Hardcore Gamer\" stated that the \"writing is incredibly eerie, and amazingly effective\" and concluded that \"few video games make it anywhere near the skillful story weaving present within the Higurashi series.\" APGNation stated the \"Excellent writing and music make for an evocative reading experience.\"\n\nIn Japan, the third volume of the manga adaptation ranked as the 19th weekly best-selling book on January 16, 2008. The first volume ranked as the 18th weekly bestseller on June 10, 2008. The fourth volume ranked as the 19th bestseller on January 14, 2009. In the United States, the first volume was ranked 253rd in the top 300 graphic novels sold in November 2008 and ranked as 25th in the top 25 Manga sold in the first quarter of 2009 release of \"ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga\".\n\nDebi Aoki of About.com stated that reading the chapters in succession as they were presented in its serialization in \"Yen Plus\" made the story \"easier to follow\" and built the suspense better. However, Justin Colussy-Estes of Comic Village disagreed feeling that this structure \"backfire[d]\". Justin Colussy-Estes of Comic Village praised the setting for hinting at something \"much darker\". He also praised the structure stating that the \"mystery develops slowly\" to immerse the reader in the characters and then later force the reader to \"confront the possibility that one or more of them may be [the] murderer\"; a decision he described as \"clever\". Critics criticized the manga for using \"cliché\" characterizations typical of the harem genre. However, Phil Guie of Popcultureshock expressed disappointment that this characterization \"is brushed aside\" for the horror as it gave the friendship between characters \"real depth\" adding to the surprise of the plot twists. Anime News Network's Casey Brienza praised the manga for being an \"effective\" horror story as it follows an ordinary situation, a harem manga plot, which \"becomes terrifying\" producing an effect that is \"trashy horror at its absolute greatest\". However, she expressed being frustrated by the end of the second volume as the central question remains \"infuriatingly unanswered\" though still felt the manga is \"wholly enjoyable and satisfying\" nonetheless. Brienza stated that although the artwork is \"average\", the illustrator \"seems to know exactly how to transition between the adorable and the abominable—and does so with dramatic, nightmarish effect.\" Aoki described the artwork as although \"pander[ing] to otaku fetishes\" containing \"generic\" and \"awkward\" character designs, providing \"overbearing cutesiness [that] makes the secrets that the girls are hiding behind their smiles just that much creepier.\"\n\nA review of \"Higurashi: When they Cry\" by \"The Escapist\" gave the anime a highly positive review. The reviewer, James Henley, praised the story, saying that each arc is interesting in its own way, but said that watching \"Kai\" was necessary to fully understand the story. He also praised the cast of characters, and how, despite having only one main male character, it never falls into harem stereotypes, and how each one has a unique back story, revealed in different arcs. He criticized the dub as poor quality, but recommended the anime, mainly subbed, if one \"can stomach the brutality.\" \"The Anime Almanac\" similarly praised the story, as a unique method of storytelling and the art of the characters, but went to add that the \"moe\" design on the girls made the scary scenes less threatening. He ultimately recommended the series. Another review, from \"T.H.E.M Anime\", was less positive, giving it 3 out of 5 stars, praising the story, but panning the sorrow of the characters and the violence, saying \"\"Higurashi\" is a hard show to watch; while it's interesting, each chapter is progressively soul-sucking and depressing, as the characters struggle desperately to avoid grisly fates, often to no avail, multiple times.\" He finished the review by saying \"...\"Higurashi\" is interesting and visceral enough to be worth viewing by the more adventurous.\"\n\n"}

These lists were determined not only from sales figures but also from the number of requests for new and upcoming books at bookstores. Shepherd urged his listeners to enter bookstores and ask for a book that did not exist. He fabricated the author (Frederick R. Ewing) of this imaginary novel, concocted a title (\"I, Libertine\"), and outlined a basic plot for his listeners to use on skeptical or confused bookstore clerks. Fans of the show eventually took it further, planting references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to it being listed on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nBookstores became interested in carrying Ewing's novel, which allegedly had been banned in Boston. When publisher Ian Ballantine, novelist Theodore Sturgeon, and Shepherd met for lunch, Ballantine hired Sturgeon to write a novel based on Shepherd's outline. Betty Ballantine completed the final chapter after Sturgeon fell exhausted asleep on the Ballantines' couch, having tried to meet the deadline in one marathon typing session. On September 13, 1956, Ballantine Books published \"I, Libertine\" simultaneously in hardcover and paperback editions with Shepherd seen looking as dissolute as possible, as Ewing, in the back cover author's photograph. The proceeds were donated to charity.\n\nA few weeks before publication, \"The Wall Street Journal\" exposed the hoax, already an open secret.\n\nRife with jokes and wordplay, the novel can still be read as an entertaining historical romance. It tells the story of a social climber who styles himself Lance Courtenay, and most of the plot is closely based on the historical personage Elizabeth Chudleigh. An afterword states \"The story of Elizabeth Chudleigh is substantially true ... .\" which could easily be taken as part of the hoax, but the deception is double, for the seemingly fantastic story of Elizabeth Chudleigh actually \"is\" true.\n\nThe front cover displays a quote: \"'Gadzooks,' quoth I, 'but here's a saucy bawd!'\". The cover painting by Frank Kelly Freas includes hidden images and inside jokes: The sign on the tavern, Fish & Staff, has a shepherd's staff and an image of a sturgeon, referencing both Sturgeon and Shepherd. A portion of the word often spoken on the air by Shepherd – \"Excelsior!\" – can be seen on the paperback cover in a triangular area at extreme left, where it is part of the decoration on the coach door. The hardcover dust jacket, with more of the illustration to the left, shows the entire word.\n\n\n"}

The game offers players the option of killing zombies or playing against other users (PvP).\n\n\"Infestation: Survivor Stories\" was able to be purchased and played online without the need for an ongoing monthly subscription with free updates. Players could, however, purchase cosmetic and convenience items such as ammo, and other items that they would otherwise have to find in the game. \"Infestation: Survivor Stories\" had dedicated public servers accessible by all players in addition to player-purchased private servers. A \"spiritual successor\" to the game, \"Romero's Aftermath\" was released by Free Reign Entertainment on September 25, 2015.\n\nThe game was panned by critics and is considered one of the worst video games of all time. The game servers were taken offline on December 15, 2016.\n\n\"Infestation: Survivor Stories\" was a zombie survival game where players endure the hardships of a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world. By collaborating with other players, and finding weapons and items, players increase their chances of survival. The game incorporated survival elements like hunger and thirst, which gradually grow over time. Supplies such as food and water could be found to battle the hunger and thirst. If the player failed to properly quench their hunger and thirst, the player's character would eventually die. It was possible to buy food and drinks if the player had none or choose not to scavenge for the items in the world. Items carried by the deceased character were lost on death - whether purchased in-game or not - but could be found and retrieved by other players, continuing the cycle of life and death in the game.\n\nSafe settlements or safe zones gave users an area where they were protected from combat and zombie attacks. There, players could access \"Global Inventory\" - an inventory shared between characters - and shop for items via the General Store.\n\nOutside the safe zones, players could engage in player versus player combat and player versus environment combat with zombies. Killing other players granted the user reputation based on the victims standing and a chance to collect their dropped items, whereas killing zombies granted the user experience points for use in the game's skill tree.\n\n\"Infestation: Survivor Stories\" was developed originally under the name \"The War Z\" by OP Productions.\n\"The War Z\" began its open alpha on October 15, 2012 and was fully released on Steam December 17, 2012. Two days after the launch, the game was removed from Steam due to false advertising; several features listed in the store description were not available in the game. After rectifying the issue, \"The War Z\" was again made available for purchase on Steam on February 26, 2013. The game has since been panned by critics and has been cited as one of the worst video games ever made. \nOn April 4, 2013, the source code of \"The War Z\" became available, most probably as leaked code from a hacked server.\nOn June 20, 2013, the game's name was officially changed to \"Infestation: Survivor Stories\" due to trademark problems.\n\nA reviewer for PC World stated that \"overall, the game looks terrific\" and had the \"typical alpha bugs\" of an alpha release, with the game holding promise. A reviewer for Joystiq praised the character personalization, saying there were more options than they expected and the gameplay would be easy for experienced gamers to understand. Another reviewer for Joystiq commented that one of the game's biggest dangers comes from other players, with the game currently not having any rules or policing regarding the PvP element and hacking.\n\nOn release, the game was universally panned by critics. Aggregate review website Metacritic assigned an overall score of 20 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 professional critics. GameSpy writer Craig Pearson stated that the game \"displays astonishing design ineptitude and some of the worst kinds of microtransactions in gaming, all in one ugly package\". Eurogamer's Rich Stanton gave it 3 out of 10, calling it \"a real disaster\" and criticized both the game's design and the developer's ethics. Stanton elaborated that the developers were \"both dishonest and incompetent.\" \"PCPowerplay\" gave the game a zero (out of ten), the only zero in the magazine's history.\n\nDespite the negativity, \"Infestation: Survivor Stories\" has sold 2.8 million copies since the game launched in November 2012.\n\nIn October 2012, executive producer Sergey Titov referred to spawn campers in \"The War Z\" as \"faggots\" in a forum post. A representative of the game's press team issued a statement saying that Titov has no prejudice against homosexuals and that it was just a poor and inappropriate choice of words.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) sent a letter to the game's publisher and developer stating that the request to trademark the name \"The War Z\" had been suspended. The cause of the suspension was the close resemblance of the game's name to the title of Paramount Pictures' upcoming film \"World War Z\". On December 24, 2012, Titov responded by saying that he doesn't think that the trademark has been suspended even though the USPTO lists it as suspended.\n\nOn December 17, 2012, Hammerpoint Interactive launched the \"foundation release\" of the game on Valve's digital distribution platform Steam. Sergey Titov stated in a press release “Now that we’ve reached the Foundation Release milestone we will continue to work, as promised, to add features and content that will satisfy our community and keep them playing.” The developer was accused of attempting to get customers to buy the game directly from their website rather than Steam's platform by claiming that they would be raising the price of the game on Steam.\n\nFollowing the game's release, many customers accused the developers of fraud because of key features that were advertised but not featured in the game. The game was initially described on Steam by the developers as containing certain features, such as multiple large game worlds varying in size, a skill point based leveling system, player versus environment combat, hundred-player servers, and private servers, none of which were a part of the game at the time. The Steam page was updated within 24 hours of release, but still mentioned features not yet in the game. Titov defended the way the information was presented by stating that the map size and player limits fell within the ranges shown, e.g., \"Size of the area, once again, come on—[the] first map is over 100 sq km. So [the] text is right.\" However, an independent analysis by PCGamesN.com estimated the actual map size at just under 10 sq km. Titov also claimed that players had misread the information about the game's features on the store's page. The game was then pulled from Steam entirely and any customer who purchased the game during the initial sale of the game was eligible to receive a full refund from Steam, an almost unheard of move by Valve.\n\nThe game has also received criticism for using a pay-to-play business model while including the micropayments frequently seen in a freemium game. On the day of the game's launch, players could respawn one hour after their character died. On the following day, Hammerpoint Interactive released an update that increased the respawn time to four hours and added the ability to instantly respawn for in-game currency that is purchased through microtransactions. Two days later, a patch was released that returned the respawn time to one hour.\n\nWhen questioned about the complaints received, Titov responded by saying that the customers complaining were a minority and \"As of right now over 93% of our customers like the game, with over 40% saying it's perfect and around 50% saying it's good, but they'd like to see more polishing and features.\"\n\nOn December 19, 2012, a Valve employee stated that they would be investigating concerns raised by users about censorship and moderation on Steam's forum. The concerns were directed towards a developer of the game who was accused of banning Steam forum users unfairly for criticizing \"The War Z\". On the same day, \"The War Z\" was temporarily removed from sale on Steam's store, with Valve issuing a statement saying \"We apologize for this and have temporary removed the sale offering of the title until we have time to work with the developer and have confidence in a new build.\" A user also proved that ban appeals were not looked over; instead, copy and paste responses were issued stating \"We have evidence that you have used multiple hacks. Your ban appeal has been denied.\" The developers have also been accused of bullying and bribing people who complain about the game. Valve allowed users to submit a ticket for a refund if they weren't satisfied with the game.\n\nOn April 2, 2013, OP Productions announced that \"The War Z\" game and forums had been taken offline as \"hackers gained access to our forum and game databases and the player data in those databases.\" Hackers gained access to user information such as email addresses, character names, IP addresses, and encrypted forums passwords. No payment information was stolen, though it was noted that simple passwords would not be hard to extract from the stolen data. OP Productions later confirmed that hackers gained access to several administrator accounts resulting in deletion of the forums database as well as the banning of \"several dozens\" of players.\n"}

{"id": "31058701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31058701", "title": "Luceafărul (poem)", "text": "Luceafărul (poem)\n\nLuceafărul (originally spelled \"Luceafĕrul\"; variously rendered as \"The Morning Star\", \"The Evening Star\", \"The Vesper\", \"The Daystar\", or \"Lucifer\") is a narrative poem by Romanian author Mihai Eminescu. It was first published in 1883, out of Vienna, by Romanian expatriates in Austria-Hungary. It is generally considered Eminescu's masterpiece, one of the greatest accomplishments in Romanian literature, and one of the last milestones in Europe's Romantic poetry. One in a family or \"constellation\" of poems, it took Eminescu ten years to conceive, its final shape being partly edited by the philosopher Titu Maiorescu. During this creative process, Eminescu distilled Romanian folklore, Romantic themes, and various staples of Indo-European myth, arriving from a versified fairy tale to a mythopoeia, a self-reflection on his condition as a genius, and an illustration of his philosophy of love.\n\nThe eponymous celestial being, also referred to as \"Hyperion\", is widely identified as Eminescu's alter ego; he combines elements of fallen angels, \"daimons\", \"incubi\", but is neither mischievous nor purposefully seductive. His daily mission on the firmament is interrupted by the lustful calls of Princess Cătălina, who asks for him to \"glide down\" and become her mate. He is persuaded by her to relinquish his immortality, which would require approval from a third protagonist, the Demiurge. The Morning Star seeks the Demiurge at the edge of the Universe, but only receives a revelation of mankind's irrelevancy. In his brief absence, the Princess is seduced by a fellow mortal. As he returns to his place in the sky, Hyperion understands that the Demiurge was right.\n\n\"Luceafărul\" enjoys fame not just as a poetic masterpiece, but also as one of the very last works completed and read publicly by Eminescu before his debilitating mental illness and hospitalization. It has endured in cultural memory as both the object of critical scrutiny and a strong favorite of the public. Its translators into various languages include figures such as Günther Deicke, Zoltán Franyó, Mite Kremnitz, Leon Levițchi, Mate Maras, Corneliu M. Popescu, David Samoylov, Immanuel Weissglas, Todur Zanet, and Vilém Závada. The poem left a distinct legacy in literary works by Mircea Eliade, Emil Loteanu, Alexandru Vlahuță, and, possibly, Ingeborg Bachmann. It has also inspired composers Nicolae Bretan and Eugen Doga, as well as various visual artists.\n\n\"Luceafărul\" opens as a typical fairy tale, with a variation of \"once upon a time\" and a brief depiction of its female character, a \"wondrous maiden\", the only child of a royal couple—her name, Cătălina, will only be mentioned once, in the poem's 46th stanza. She is shown waiting impatiently for nightfall, when she gazes upon the Morning Star:\nHyperion senses her attention and gazes back, and, although a non-physical entity, also begins to desire her company. Sliding through her window when she is asleep, he caresses Cătălina as she dreams of him. In one such a moment, she moans for him to \"glide down upon a ray\" and become her betrothed. Urged on by this command, the Morning Star hurls himself into the sea, reemerging as a \"fair youth\", or \"handsome corpse with living eyes\".\nReturning to Cătălina while she is awake, Hyperion proposes that they elope to his \"coral castles\" at the bottom of the sea; this horrifies the Princess, who expresses her refusal of a \"lifeless\" and \"alien\" prospect—although she still appears bedazzled by his \"angel\" looks. However, within days she returns to dreaming of the Morning Star and unconsciously asking for him to \"glide down\". This time, he appears to her a creature of fire, offering Cătălina a place in his celestial abode. She again expresses her refusal, and compares Hyperion's new form to that of a \"daimon\". In this restated form, her refusal reads:\nCătălina is not interested in acquiring immortality, but asks that he join the mortal realm, to be \"reborn in sin\"; Hyperion agrees, and to this end abandons his place on the firmament to seek out the Demiurge. This requires him to travel to the edge of the Universe, into a cosmic void. Once there, the Demiurge laughs off his request; he informs Hyperion that human experience is futile, and that becoming human would be a return to \"yesterday's eternal womb\". He orders Hyperion back to his celestial place, obliquely telling him that something \"in store\" on Earth will prove the point.\n\nIndeed, while Hyperion was missing, Cătălina had found herself courted, then slowly seduced, by a \"conniving\" courtly page, Cătălin. The poem's \"tragic denouement allots each of the three lovers their own sphere with frontiers impossible to trespass.\" As he resumes his place on the firmament, Hyperion catches sight of the happy couple Cătălin and Cătălina. She gazes back and calls on him, but only as a witness to, and good-luck charm for, her new love. The last two stanzas show Hyperion returning to his silent, self-absorbed, activities:\nAs noted by the editor Perpessicius, during the interwar a \"most absurd\" urban legend had spread, according to which Eminescu had written the poem on the night train taking him to Bucharest. In fact, several drafts of the poem exists, some as long as the finished piece. Perpessicius rates these as \"standalone types\" and, in 1938, opted to publish them as separate pieces in his companion to Eminescu's work, with philologist Petru Creția calling them the \"\"Luceafărul\" constellation\". Its earliest recognizable component is \"Fata-n grădina de aur\" (\"Girl in the Garden of Gold\"), written ca. 1873, when Eminescu was in Berlin. It was the \"ottava rima\" version of Romanian folklore prose-piece—retrieved by the Silesian Richard Kunisch and published in 1861 \"Das Mädchen im goldenen Garten\". The source was cryptically identified as \"the German K.\" in Eminescu's notebooks, and the bibliographic information was pieced together by Moses Gaster. \n\nEntire portions of the later poem also surface in another piece of the period. Called \"Peste codri stă cetatea\" (\"Over the Woods There Stands a City\"), it briefly depicts the Princess dreaming of her chosen one, the Morning Star. Eminescu made several discreet returns to his drafts, adding the central theme of the Hyperion as a misunderstood genius, and finally in April 1882 went public with \"Legenda Luceafĕrului\" (\"Legend of the Morning Star\"). He was in Bucharest as a guest of the \"Junimea\" society, where he read out the variant on April 17; he then worked closely with its doyen Titu Maiorescu, who helped him with critical insight. During these exchanges, the work acquired its celebrated final stanza. There followed a second reading on April 24, when, in his diaries, Maiorescu recorded the \"beautiful legend\" simply as \"Luceafărul\". \n\nMaiorescu endorsed the work and promoted it with public readings in both Bucharest and Buftea, lasting into January 1883, and attended by Eminescu, Petre P. Carp, Alexandru B. Știrbei, and Ioan Slavici. First published in \"Almanachulŭ Societății Academice Socialŭ-Literare Romănia Jună\", put out by the Romanian colony of Vienna in April 1883, it was taken up in August by the \"Junimist\" tribune, \"Convorbiri Literare\". At some point in this interval, Eminescu had fallen terminally ill, and was sent to an Oberdöbling asylum for treatment. Around November 1883, as he began work on a first edition of Eminescu's collected poems, Maiorescu decided to cut out four stanzas—those detailing negotiations between Hyperion and Demiurge—, in an effort to improve flow. This puzzled later editors: in his own volume, Garabet Ibrăileanu kept the omission, but included the missing part as an appendix, while D. R. Mazilu hesitated between the versions in his search for an \"ideal\" and \"purified\" \"Luceafărul\".\n\nRunning at 392 lines in its unabridged version, \"Luceafărul\" alternates iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. This is an old pattern in Romanian poetry, having been noted for instance in Dosoftei's preamble to \"Erofili\", and is described by critic Alex. Ștefănescu as \"lapidary, enunciative, solemn in its simplicity.\" The rhythmic sequencing has created a long-standing dilemma about the intended pronunciation of \"Hyperion\": while common Romanian phonology favors \"Hypérion\", the text suggests that Eminescu used \"Hyperión\". Artistic license also surfaces in the apparent pleonasm, with which Cătălina beckons Hyperion: \"Cobori în jos, luceafăr blând\" (\"Descend down, gentle Morning Star\"). Some Eminescu exegetes see here an intellectual stress on the separation between the realms, breached by \"divine descent into humanity\", or the repetition one associates with incantation.\n\nThe versified story is so indebted to folklore that, according to Perpessicius, it should be published alongside those works of folk poetry which Eminescu himself collected and kept. Nevertheless, the same author concedes that Eminescu ultimately \"fashioned his own ornaments\" from the folkloric level, producing an \"intensely original\" work. These \"ornaments\" include: \"the iambic rhythms of his stanzas, the images, the enchanting celestial voyage, the dialogue between Hyperion and the Demiurge, [and Cătălin], who seems to have been lifted out of a subtle comedy by Marivaux\". Likewise, critic C. Gerota sees Eminescu's poem as a \"great work of art\" emerging \"from Kunisch's prosaic fairy tale\"; \"only the form\" is folkloric. An Aarne–Thompson inventory, proposed by the scholar Dumitru Caracostea, finds that Eminescu essentially refashioned the myth of \"Animal Bride\". The fairy or \"samodiva\" became the \"daimon\"—within a narrative rearranged by Eminescu and, to some extent, by Kunisch. Caracostea rejects as too narrow the interpretations advanced by Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, according to whom \"Luceafărul\" was directly inspired by Lithuanian mythology—namely, by the story of Saulė's revenge on Aušrinė.\n\nIn various ways, \"Luceafărul\" has connections with the fallen angel motif in Christian mythology. Mythographer Victor Kernbach notes that the name was already used in folkloric sources for the demon Lucifer, or for a localized version of Samyaza. As described by the Eminescu scholar Gisèle Vanhese, \"Luceafărul\" is not just \"Eminescu's masterpiece\", but also \"the achievement of Romantic reflection regarding the Sons of Darkness.\" The latter category of folkloric beings, themselves probably derived from fallen angels, includes the \"Zburători\", which act as the Romanian equivalent of \"incubi\". Their visitation of young girls at night also echoes more distant themes from Ancient Greek mythology, such as Zeus' seduction of Semele and Io, or the story of Cupid and Psyche—the latter was one of Eminescu's favorite references. The \"Zburători\"s most elaborate depiction in Romantic poetry was an eponymous 1830s piece by Ion Heliade Rădulescu, but they also show up in the works of Constantin Stamati and Constantin Negruzzi. \n\nVariations of the theme, and more direct echoes from Lord Byron (\"Heaven and Earth\") and Victor Hugo (\"The Sylph\"), appear in various early poems by Eminescu, and in some portions of the \"constellation\". \"Zburători\" are directly mentioned in the draft poem \"Peste codri stă cetatea\"—although, in later intermediary versions, the \"incubus\" had been a \"Zmeu\", and the Demiurge had been called \"Adonai\". As seen by Vanhese, the Morning Star is a syntheses of \"incubi\" (he appears to Cătălina in her dreams) and Lucifer (with whom he shares the celestial attribute). She argues that, with Eminescu's poem, \"the myth of the Romantic demon reaches its most accomplished expression in European culture\", equaled in visual arts by Mikhail Vrubel's \"Demon Seated\". \nThis contrasts readings by Caracostea and Tudor Vianu, who see the Morning Star as primarily angelic—if he appears \"handsome as a daemon\" during his second incarnation, it is because passion has momentarily transfigured him. Constantinescu assumes a similar stance, whereby the \"daimon\" is \"pacified by the supreme awareness of his superior essence.\" While noting that Eminescu had a great interest in Lucifer as a literary trope, mythographer Ioan Petru Culianu asserts that the Morning Star is only incidentally related to the fallen angels myth, and more than anything a Romanian Hesperus.\n\nComposite in inspiration, the Morning Star as a male god is an original creation by Eminescu. The transition to this ultimate form was eased by lexical precedent: in Romanian, the Morning and Evening Stars are gendered male, and \"the biblical notion of Lucifer\" was already being confounded in folklore with either celestial body. In folk sources, the celestial identification is also incomplete: generally used for Venus, the name \"Luceafărul\" may transfer to Jupiter, \"whichever is more prominent at dusk.\" In describing his new deity, Eminescu apparently assigned him an original attribute, detailed in the 5th stanza: he is the god of seafarers, dragging their ships across the ocean. This metaphor alludes to celestial navigation. Astronomers Alastair McBeath and A. D. Gheorghe focus on another connection, seeing Hyperion as a component of \"meteor mythology\", alongside shapeshifting \"Balauri\". They also argue that Hyperion's \"rapid flight\" back to Earth alludes to the Eta Aquariids, and that the celestial void from which he takes flight is a black hole.\n\nMystery subsists as to why Eminescu opted to give his Morning Star the unrelated moniker \"Hyperion\", which references the Titans of Greek mythology. Philologist Rodica Marian argues that the Morning Star only acquires the name, and learns his true nature, upon meeting the Demiurge. Several experts are in agreement that, in choosing \"Hyperion\", Eminescu alluded to a folk etymology, which gives \"hyper\"+\"aeon\" (\"above timelessness\"). As noted by the anthologist Stephen Prickett, the name itself \"points to the immortal condition of the male protagonist\". Caracostea has a dissenting opinion, arguing that the meaning is literally \"superior being\", selected by Eminescu from a 1799 novel by Friedrich Hölderlin. By contrast, the two mortals have distinctively local, Christian and folksy, names, akin to \"Katherine\".\n\nThe personal mythology of \"Luceafărul\" is overall a poetic rendition of a personal philosophy of love. Caracostea proposes that Eminescu had special reason to dwell on the poem, which must therefore express \"a fundamental experience\". This is not the case for other ideas he borrowed from Kunisch, which merely resulted in conventional pieces such as \"Miron and The Disembodied Beauty\". The \"allegorical meaning\" is explained by Eminescu's own comment: \"[genius] is immortal, but lacks good fortune.\" The result, according to scholar Geo Vasile, is Eminescu's \"triumph in the world of ideas\": \"Here, the Albatross-poet extends his wings in all their magnificent reach.\" \n\nAs noted by Lovinescu, the entire project is \"suffused with Schopenhauerian pessimism\"; according to Gerota, Eminescu's text is Schopenhauerian, but beyond that inspired by Alfred de Vigny's \"Moses\"—although \"Luceafărul\" \"rises up to an allegorical form, with greater reach and livelier content.\" The Schopenhauerian influence is nuanced by Caracostea, who notes that the four stanzas cut out by Maiorescu were this-worldly and optimistic: the Demiurge denies Hyperion sheer mortality, but offers to make him a leader of men; the implication is that such figures are superhuman. \n\nBeyond this context, some have identified a larger meditation on the human condition. Classicist Cicerone Poghirc argued that \"Luceafărul\" is about the unbridgeable separation imposed by \"dharma\", which Eminescu had read about in the \"Katha Upanishad\". Likewise, comparatist Rosa del Conte sees the work as the \"lyrical solving of a metaphysical intuition—about the transcendence which doesn't allow man neither to live, nor to be\". In her reading, \"Luceafărul\" is on a philosophical continuum with other Eminescian poetry; the metaphor of \"time as death\" first appears in relation to Hyperion's withdrawal, and is fully developed in the posthumous \"Memento Mori: The Panorama of Vanities\". According to Marian, who criticizes traditional scholarship and relies on insights from Constantin Noica, the core theme is \"ontological dissatisfaction\". The accent, she argues, falls on a genius' inability to \"elevate\" a world that only he understands to be flawed. Constantinescu suggests an intermediary position, discussing the \"daimon\"s \"taming\", his evolution toward a Platonic love \"that surpasses everything erotic in Eminescu's poetry\".\n\nBeyond the \"celestial allegory\", Perpessicius notes, \"Luceafărul\" is also a love poem, \"one of the most natural, most authentic, most universal.\" Ștefănescu reads \"Luceafărul\" as a star-crossed fable and \"eerie love-story\", rating it above \"Romeo and Juliet\". The implications of this have created enduring polemics between exegetes, an early example being one opposing Caracostea to George Călinescu. The latter, following other Freudian literati, commented that Eminescu was essentially obsessed with the idea of love, with \"Luceafărul\" displaying his casual objectification of women. The same point is made by Culianu, who notes that Eminescu identified love itself with a damsel in distress situation and voyeurism, both of which, he argues, exist in the \"erotic scenario\" called \"Luceafărul\". Contrarily, Caracostea insisted that Eminescu's erotic passion was subsumed to a \"quest for the absolute\", manifested \"in all other aspects of [his] poetic being\".\n\nClues of Eminescu's views on love are contrasted by the element of physical desire, that of a young girl expecting her suitors—\"the surge within a human being of a longing that she can only half-comprehend.\" This \"puberal crisis\" and \"mysterious invasion of longing\" had also appeared in Heliade Rădulescu's piece. Such precedents suggest that Cătălina is a feeble, \"ingénue\", victim of her instincts. According to Geo Vasile: \"she recognizes her own biological fate and accepts being courted by her mortal neighbor [...]. The maiden who happened to catch Hyperion's affection stands for the narrow fold, the human, historical, ontological conspiracy, downright puny when confronted with the nocturnal body's destiny\". Author Ilie Constantin notes that Cătălin was a natural suitor, who \"expunges Hyperion from Cătălina's attention, so that he and she may embark on their own union\". In contrast to such readings, Vanhese sees the Princess as a playful destroyer, in the vein of \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" and \"Salome\".\n\nReviewing the placated tone implicit in the poem, Constantinescu proposes that \"Luceafărul\" \"condenses not just one experience, but a whole sum of experiences, of sentimental failures.\" According to a story transmitted by the \"Junimist\" Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești, who claimed to have heard it from Maiorescu, Eminescu poured into the poem his bitterness toward an unfaithful lover, Veronica Micle. In this version of events, Micle is Cătălina and the page Cătălin is Eminescu's one-time friend and colleague, Ion Luca Caragiale; Maiorescu is the Demiurge. \n\nPerpessicius dismisses the account as \"vorbe de clacă\" (\"balderdash\"), but notes that it was to some extent \"natural\" that rumors would emerge. Brătescu-Voinești was partly backed by another source, Eminescu aficionado Alexandru Vlahuță, who reported his friend's \"one-time fling, a curious episode, which inspired him to write the poem \"Luceafărul\" and which I cannot render here.\" According to Caracostea, this testimony can be discounted, as Vlahuță also hints that Eminescu was delusional. \n\nResearcher Șerban Cioculescu discovered that one aspect of the story was verifiable, namely that Caragiale had had a sexual escapade with Micle before February 1882. Eminescu knew and was angered about it, canceling his offer of marriage. However, Caracostea claims, the inspiration for the poem may have been Eminescu's other love interest, Cleopatra Lecca-Poenaru. On one of his notebooks, where he tries out various versions of Hyperion's travels to the cosmic edge, Eminescu interrupts himself with a diatribe, addressed to the \"lousy coquette, Cleopatra.\" Caracostea also argues that the Caragiale–Micle affair, while confirmed, cannot have been mirrored in the poem, as the most relevant passages were written long before 1882.\n\nWriting in the 1940s, Caracostea pleaded for the poem to be \"re-invoked\" and kept alive, its themes and hidden meanings explained to successive generations. A while after, Constantinescu was to note that, \"a Romantic in his work and in his life, Eminescu never had a chance to enjoy, after his death, a destiny like the Morning Star, with whom he identified, and if his glow was indeed 'deathless', it never was 'cold'.\" This popular enthusiasm for the poem has been criticized by some scholars, who noted its negative implications. According to Eugen Negrici, the \"Eminescu myth\" is a resilient element of literary culture, leading from a \"poète maudit\" trope to the \"aggressive tabooing and delirium about genius.\" As he notes, \"Luceafărul\" was an especially important as autofiction, encouraging \"analogical reasoning\" among its readers: \"the text has produced exhilaration in academia and has stirred affection for the poet, a distortion sparked by the mystique of writings which bear the mark of destiny\". Culianu also refers to the \"absurdities\" and \"bewildering speculations\" allowed by critical tradition, a \"Tower of Babel erected for worshiping \"Luceafărul\".\" \n\nDuring Eminescu's withdrawal from public life, the poem slowly garnered its cult following. In 1887 already, the pedagogue Gh. Gh. Arbore was introducing the poem as one of the most significant ever written in Romanian. As noted by Caracostea, two anti-\"Junimist\" authors, Aron Densușianu and Alexandru Grama, resisted this trend, producing conjectural \"words of scorn\"; Caracostea's own embrace of the poem showed its influence on the emergent (and otherwise anti-\"Junimist\") Symbolist movement. The first author to draw inspiration from \"Luceafărul\" was Micle. The alleged Cătălina reused the themes in poems she completed after Eminescu's illness and death. She was closely followed by Eminescu's disciple Vlahuță, whose 1894 novel, \"Dan\", \"transposes the conflict highlighted in \"Luceafărul\".\" In 1902, the Romanians in Hungary established a literary magazine of the same name, in what was a conscious nod to Eminescu's poem. Four years later, the poem had entered the Romania's national curriculum with a 7th-grade textbook by Petre V. Haneș. During this interval, \"Luceafărul\" and other Eminescian writings became the inspiration for hugely popular postcards illustrated by Leonard Salmen. A bibliophile edition with 22 artworks by Mișu Teișanu came out at the eponymous \"Luceafărul\" Society in 1921–1923. \n\nBy then, Symbolist Dimitrie Paciurea had begun work on several works directly referencing Hyperion, including sketches for an Eminescu monument, leading up to his \"Sky Chimera\"; Nicolae Bretan had adapted the poem into an eponymous opera, which he himself translated into Hungarian. Sculptor Ion Schmidt-Faur also paid homage (to the poem rather than its protagonist) in his 1929 relief of Cătălin and Cătălina, installed at the base of his Eminescu statue in Iași. During the interwar, the identification of poet and protagonist was also taken up by Lovinescu in his work as a biographical novelist: he intended to write a romanticized account, also titled \"Luceafărul\", dealing mainly with the hero's childhood in Ipotești. Mircea Eliade rendered ample homage to \"Luceafărul\", in his novel \"Miss Christina\", but especially so in his short story \"Șarpele\" (\"The Serpent\"), which relies on intertextual allusion to the point of becoming its \"hierophany\". Andronic the aviator, a central character in the latter narrative, is a modern-day Morning Star, replicating \"the fall\".\nThe Morning Star reference peaked in usage under the communist regime. With the advent of Socialist Realism, Eminescu's political works were ignored, but \"Luceafărul\" remained in the textbooks, with commentary by Perpessicius and Alexandru Rosetti. Mythical recovery was particularly strong during the final stages of national communism, when, Negrici argues, Eminescu was publicly celebrated with \"grotesque displays\". Both \"Morning Star\" and \"Demiurge\" were informal titles used in the personality cult of President Nicolae Ceaușescu. The new arms of Botoșani County, approved in 1972, featured an allegorical and canting representation of Eminescu as a five-pointed star. In 1988, the Romanian Communist Party fabricated an Eminescu Pond in Ipotești, complete with neon lighting in the shape of a Morning Star. During that period, Sabin Bălașa contributed a fresco of Hyperion for the halls of Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.\n\nAlthough interest in the poem was preserved after the 1989 Revolution, it was largely confined to the private sphere. Ștefănescu noted that, by 2015, Hyperion was perhaps more famous than his creator, like Hamlet is to William Shakespeare. He also observed that the once-popular metonymy \"Morning Star of Romanian poetry\" (for Eminescu) had faded out of use, as \"wooden tongue [...] relegated to official speeches.\" As a title, \"Luceafărul\" remained in use by trade unionists involved in the violent Mineriads of the 1990s, applied to their leader Miron Cozma. In his final book, published in 2000, philosopher Laurențiu Ulici argued that Hyperion had become recognized as one incarnation of the national psychology, in an oxymoronic blend: the other component was Caragiale's creation, the easy-going, cynical and prosaic Mitică.\n\nHyperion remained important as a cultural symbol within the Romanian diaspora, which had published its first edition. In the late 1940s, Eliade and Virgil Ierunca founded their own \"Luceafărul\" as an anti-communist journal in Paris. Another exile, Paul Celan, reportedly introduced his Austrian friend Ingeborg Bachmann to Eminescu's poem—its core themes were discovered by critics in Bachmann's novel \"Malina\" (1971). \"Luceafărul\" also had a cult readership among the Romanians of the Moldavian SSR, where, in 1974, Gheorghe Vrabie contributed a set of illustrations in aquatint and eau-forte. The Soviet republic also hosted a Luceafărul Theatre and produced a feature film of the same name, directed by Emil Loteanu. Starring Vasile Zubcu-Codreanu in the title role, it is famous as the only Eminescu biopic. In 1983, the poem also inspired Loteanu to write the script for a ballet, with music by Eugen Doga. Alexa Ispas, a Romanian expatriate in Scotland, adapted the poem into a theatrical play, performed in English at Govanhill Baths (2014).\n\n\"Luceafărul\"s first-ever translation was in January 1883, when Maiorescu's friend Mite Kremnitz rendered the draft poem into German, with a new version produced ten years later by Edgar von Herz. Several others followed in that language, including Immanuel Weissglas' (1937), Olvian Soroceanu's (1940), Zoltán Franyó's (1943), and Günther Deicke's (1964). In the 1950s and '60s, Franyó and then Sándor Kacsó translated the entity of Eminescu's poetic work into Hungarian, while Vilém Závada produced his Czech version of \"Luceafărul\". Carlo Tagliavini rendered fragments of the poem into Italian, with commentary, in 1923, while numerous translations were attempted in French, for instance that of Ion Ureche (1939). In Russian, David Samoylov has penned a version of \"Luceafărul\" that reportedly stays very close to the Romanian original. \n\nLeon Levițchi's corpus of English translations from Eminescu first appeared in 1978, one year after the death of another celebrated Eminescu translator, the teenaged Corneliu M. Popescu. In 1984, Cartea Românească put out a volume featuring Deicke and Popescu's versions, and renditions into seven other languages: French, by Mihail Bantaș; Spanish, by Omar Lara; Armenian, by H. Dj. Siruni; Russian, by Yuriy Kozhevnikov and I. Mirinski; Italian, by Mario De Micheli; Hungarian, by Jenő Kiss; and Portuguese, by Dan Caragea. New Italian renditions were also done by Marco Cugno (1989–1990) and Geo Vasile (2000). There are also several versions of the poem in Serbo-Croatian, including one by Mate Maras (1998). Another English version, the work of Josef Johann Soltesz, was printed in 2004, followed by Tomy Sigler's Hebrew (2008) and Todur Zanet's Gagauz (2013), then by Miroslava Metleaeva's new Russian and Güner Akmolla's Crimean Tatar (both 2015). The project of translating into French was again taken up in the 2010s, with Jean-Louis Courriol authoring a celebrated adaptation. Courriol has nevertheless avoided including it in French anthologies, arguing that \"Luceafărul\" was no longer relevant or understandable.\n\n"}

{"id": "20572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20572", "title": "Musical theatre", "text": "Musical theatre\n\nMusical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.\n\nAlthough music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan at the turn of the 20th century. The Princess Theatre musicals (1915–1918) and other smart shows like \"Of Thee I Sing\" (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as \"Show Boat\" (1927) and \"Oklahoma!\" (1943). Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include\n\"West Side Story\" (1957), \"The Fantasticks\" (1960), \"Hair\" (1967), \"A Chorus Line\" (1975), \"Les Misérables\" (1985), \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1986), \"Rent\" (1996), \"The Producers\" (2001), \"Wicked\" (2003) and \"Hamilton\" (2015).\n\nMusicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller venues, such as fringe theatre, Off-Broadway, Off-Off-Broadway, regional theatre, or community theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America.\n\nSince the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter. The three main components of a book musical are its \"music\", \"lyrics\" and \"book\". The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the \"libretto\" (Italian for \"little book\"). The music and lyrics together form the \"score\" of a musical and include songs, incidental music and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\" The interpretation of a musical is the responsibility of its creative team, which includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound. The creative team, designs and interpretations generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in \"Chicago\".\n\nThere is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short intermission, and the first act is frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves the conflict or complication. A book musical is usually built around four to six main theme tunes that are reprised later in the show, although it sometimes consists of a series of songs not directly musically related. Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers, although \"sung dialogue\" or recitative may be used, especially in so-called \"sung-through\" musicals such as \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", \"Les Misérables\", \"Evita\" and \"Hamilton\". Several shorter musicals on Broadway and in the West End have been presented in one act in recent decades.\n\nMoments of greatest dramatic intensity in a book musical are often performed in song. Proverbially, \"when the emotion becomes too strong for speech, you sing; when it becomes too strong for song, you dance.\" In a book musical, a song is ideally crafted to suit the character (or characters) and their situation within the story; although there have been times in the history of the musical (e.g. from the 1890s to the 1920s) when this integration between music and story has been tenuous. As \"The New York Times\" critic Ben Brantley described the ideal of song in theatre when reviewing the 2008 revival of \"Gypsy\": \"There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be.\" Typically, many fewer words are sung in a five-minute song than are spoken in a five-minute block of dialogue. Therefore, there is less time to develop drama in a musical than in a straight play of equivalent length, since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue. Within the compressed nature of a musical, the writers must develop the characters and the plot.\n\nThe material presented in a musical may be original, or it may be adapted from novels (\"Wicked\" and \"Man of La Mancha\"), plays (\"Hello, Dolly!\"), classic legends (\"Camelot\"), historical events (\"Evita\") or films (\"The Producers\" and \"Billy Elliot\"). On the other hand, many successful musical theatre works have been adapted for musical films, such as \"West Side Story\", \"My Fair Lady\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"Oliver!\" and \"Chicago\".\n\nMusical theatre is closely related to the theatrical form of opera, but the two are usually distinguished by weighing a number of factors. First, musicals generally have a greater focus on spoken dialogue. This is not a hard and fast rule; some musicals are entirely accompanied and sung through, while some operas, such as \"Die Zauberflöte\", and most operettas, have some unaccompanied dialogue. Second, musicals also usually include more dancing as an essential part of the storytelling, particularly by the principal performers as well as the chorus. Third, musicals often use various genres of popular music or at least popular singing and musical styles.\n\nFinally, musicals usually avoid certain operatic conventions. In particular, a musical is almost always performed in the language of its audience. Musicals produced on Broadway or in the West End, for instance, are invariably sung in English, even if they were originally written in another language. While an opera singer is primarily a singer and only secondarily an actor (and rarely needs to dance), a musical theatre performer is often an actor first but must also be a singer and dancer. Someone who is equally accomplished at all three is referred to as a \"triple threat\". Composers of music for musicals often consider the vocal demands of roles with musical theatre performers in mind. Today, large theatres that stage musicals generally use microphones and amplification of the actors' singing voices in a way that would generally be disapproved of in an operatic context.\n\nSome works (e.g. by George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim) have been made into both \"musical theatre\" and \"operatic\" productions. Similarly, some older operettas or light operas (such as \"The Pirates of Penzance\" by Gilbert and Sullivan) have been produced in modern adaptations that treat them as musicals. For some works, production styles are almost as important as the work's musical or dramatic content in defining into which art form the piece falls. Sondheim said, \"I really think that when something plays Broadway it's a musical, and when it plays in an opera house it's opera. That's it. It's the terrain, the countryside, the expectations of the audience that make it one thing or another.\" Although this article primarily concerns musical theatre works that are \"non-operatic\", there remains an overlap in form between lighter operatic forms and more musically complex or ambitious musicals. In practice, it is often difficult to distinguish among the various kinds of musical theatre, including \"musical play\", \"musical comedy\", \"operetta\" and \"light opera\".\n\nLike opera, the singing in musical theatre is generally accompanied by an instrumental ensemble called a pit orchestra, located in a lowered area in front of the stage. While opera typically uses a conventional symphony orchestra, musicals are generally orchestrated for ensembles ranging from 27 players down to only a few players. Rock musicals usually employ a small group of mostly rock instruments, and some musicals may call for only a piano or two instruments. The music in musicals uses a range of \"styles and influences including operetta, classical techniques, folk music, jazz [and] local or historical styles [that] are appropriate to the setting.\" Musicals may begin with an overture played by the orchestra that \"weav[es] together excerpts of the score's famous melodies.\"\n\nThere are various Eastern traditions of theatre that include music, such as Chinese opera, Taiwanese opera, Japanese Noh and Indian musical theatre, including Sanskrit drama, classical Indian dance and Yakshagana. India has, since the 20th century, produced numerous musical films, referred to as \"Bollywood\" musicals, and in Japan a series of musicals based on popular Anime and Manga comics has developed in recent decades. \n\nShorter or simplified \"junior\" versions of many musicals are available for schools and youth groups, and very short works created or adapted for performance by children are sometimes called minimusicals.\n\nThe antecedents of musical theatre in Europe can be traced back to the theatre of ancient Greece, where music and dance were included in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE. The music from the ancient forms is lost, however, and they had little influence on later development of musical theatre. In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas taught the liturgy. Groups of actors would use outdoor Pageant wagons (stages on wheels) to tell each part of the story. Poetic forms sometimes alternated with the prose dialogues, and liturgical chants gave way to new melodies.\nThe European Renaissance saw older forms evolve into two antecedents of musical theatre: commedia dell'arte, where raucous clowns improvised familiar stories, and later, opera buffa. In England, Elizabethan and Jacobean plays frequently included music, and short musical plays began to be included in an evenings' dramatic entertainments. Court masques developed during the Tudor period that involved music, dancing, singing and acting, often with expensive costumes and a complex stage design. These developed into sung plays that are recognizable as English operas, the first usually being thought of as \"The Siege of Rhodes\" (1656). In France, meanwhile, Molière turned several of his farcical comedies into musical entertainments with songs (music provided by Jean-Baptiste Lully) and dance in the late 17th century. These influenced a brief period of English opera by composers such as John Blow and Henry Purcell.\n\nFrom the 18th century, the most popular forms of musical theatre in Britain were ballad operas, like John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\", that included lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and later pantomime, which developed from commedia dell'arte, and comic opera with mostly romantic plot lines, like Michael Balfe's \"The Bohemian Girl\" (1845). Meanwhile, on the continent, singspiel, comédie en vaudeville, opéra comique, zarzuela and other forms of light musical entertainment were emerging. \"The Beggar's Opera\" was the first recorded long-running play of any kind, running for 62 successive performances in 1728. It would take almost a century afterwards before any play broke 100 performances, but the record soon reached 150 in the late 1820s. Other musical theatre forms developed in England by the 19th century, such as music hall, melodrama and burletta, which were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music.\n\nColonial America did not have a significant theatre presence until 1752, when London entrepreneur William Hallam sent a company of actors to the colonies managed by his brother Lewis. In New York in the summer of 1753, they performed ballad-operas, such as \"The Beggar's Opera\", and ballad-farces. By the 1840s, P. T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan. Other early musical theatre in America consisted of British forms, such as burletta and pantomime, but what a piece was called did not necessarily define what it was. The 1852 Broadway extravaganza \"The Magic Deer\" advertised itself as \"A Serio Comico Tragico Operatical Historical Extravaganzical Burletical Tale of Enchantment.\" Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown from around 1850, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s. Broadway's \"The Elves\" (1857) broke the 50 performance barrier. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's \"musical burletta\" \"Seven Sisters\" (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.\n\nAround 1850, the French composer Hervé was experimenting with a form of comic musical theatre he called opérette. The best known composers of operetta were Jacques Offenbach from the 1850s to the 1870s and Johann Strauss II in the 1870s and 1880s. Offenbach's fertile melodies, combined with his librettists' witty satire, formed a model for the musical theatre that followed. Adaptations of the French operettas (played in mostly bad, risqué translations), musical burlesques, music hall, pantomime and burletta dominated the London musical stage into the 1870s.\n\nIn America, mid-18th century musical theatre entertainments included crude variety revue, which eventually developed into vaudeville, minstrel shows, which soon crossed the Atlantic to Britain, and Victorian burlesque, first popularized in the US by British troupes. A hugely successful musical that premiered in New York in 1866, \"The Black Crook\", was an original musical theatre piece that conformed to many of the modern definitions of a musical, including dance and original music that helped to tell the story. The spectacular production, famous for its skimpy costumes, ran for a record-breaking 474 performances. The same year, \"The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post\" was the first show to call itself a \"musical comedy.\" Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (\"The Mulligan Guard Picnic\") and 1885. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step forward towards a more legitimate theatrical form. They starred high quality singers (Lillian Russell, Vivienne Segal and Fay Templeton) instead of the ladies of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.\n\nAs transportation improved, poverty in London and New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays ran longer, leading to better profits and improved production values, and men began to bring their families to the theatre. The first musical theatre piece to exceed 500 consecutive performances was the French operetta \"The Chimes of Normandy\" in 1878. English comic opera adopted many of the successful ideas of European operetta, none more successfully than the series of more than a dozen long-running Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas, including \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" (1878) and \"The Mikado\" (1885). These were sensations on both sides of the Atlantic and in Australia and helped to raise the standard for what was considered a successful show. These shows were designed for family audiences, a marked contrast from the risqué burlesques, bawdy music hall shows and French operettas that sometimes drew a crowd seeking less wholesome entertainment. Only a few 19th-century musical pieces exceeded the run of \"The Mikado\", such as \"Dorothy\", which opened in 1886 and set a new record with a run of 931 performances. Gilbert and Sullivan's influence on later musical theatre was profound, creating examples of how to \"integrate\" musicals so that the lyrics and dialogue advanced a coherent story. Their works were admired and copied by early authors and composers of musicals in Britain and America.\n\n\"A Trip to Chinatown\" (1891) was Broadway's long-run champion (until \"Irene\" in 1919), running for 657 performances, but New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until the 1920s. Gilbert and Sullivan were both pirated and imitated in New York by productions such as Reginald De Koven's \"Robin Hood\" (1891) and John Philip Sousa's \"El Capitan\" (1896). \"A Trip to Coontown\" (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans on Broadway (largely inspired by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by ragtime-tinged shows. Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century, composed of songs written in New York's Tin Pan Alley, including those by George M. Cohan, who worked to create an American style distinct from the Gilbert and Sullivan works. The most successful New York shows were often followed by extensive national tours.\n\nMeanwhile, musicals took over the London stage in the Gay Nineties, led by producer George Edwardes, who perceived that audiences wanted a new alternative to the Savoy-style comic operas and their intellectual, political, absurdist satire. He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the Gaiety and his other theatres. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his \"respectable\" corps of Gaiety Girls to complete the musical and visual fun. The success of the first of these, \"In Town\" (1892) and \"A Gaiety Girl\" (1893) set the style for the next three decades. The plots were generally light, romantic \"poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds\" shows, with music by Ivan Caryll, Sidney Jones and Lionel Monckton. These shows were immediately widely copied in America, and Edwardian musical comedy swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. \"The Geisha\" (1896) was one of the most successful in the 1890s, running for more than two years and achieving great international success.\n\n\"The Belle of New York\" (1898) became the first American musical to run for over a year in London. The British musical comedy \"Florodora\" (1899) was a popular success on both sides of the Atlantic, as was \"A Chinese Honeymoon\" (1901), which ran for a record-setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York. After the turn of the 20th century, Seymour Hicks joined forces with Edwardes and American producer Charles Frohman to create another decade of popular shows. Other enduring Edwardian musical comedy hits included \"The Arcadians\" (1909) and \"The Quaker Girl\" (1910).\n\nVirtually eliminated from the English-speaking stage by competition from the ubiquitous Edwardian musical comedies, operettas returned to London and Broadway in 1907 with \"The Merry Widow\", and adaptations of continental operettas became direct competitors with musicals. Franz Lehár and Oscar Straus composed new operettas that were popular in English until World War I. In America, Victor Herbert produced a string of enduring operettas including \"The Fortune Teller\" (1898), \"Babes in Toyland\" (1903), \"Mlle. Modiste\" (1905), \"The Red Mill\" (1906) and \"Naughty Marietta\" (1910).\n\nIn the 1910s, the team of P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, following in the footsteps of Gilbert and Sullivan, created the \"Princess Theatre shows\" and paved the way for Kern's later work by showing that a musical could combine light, popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs. Historian Gerald Bordman wrote:\nThe theatre-going public needed escapist entertainment during the dark times of World War I, and they flocked to the theatre. The 1919 hit musical \"Irene\" ran for 670 performances, a Broadway record that held until 1938. The British theatre public supported far longer runs like that of \"The Maid of the Mountains\" (1,352 performances) and especially \"Chu Chin Chow\". Its run of 2,238 performances was more than twice as long as any previous musical, setting a record that stood for nearly forty years. Revues like \"The Bing Boys Are Here\" in Britain, and those of Florenz Ziegfeld and his imitators in America, were also extraordinarily popular.\nThe musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall and other light entertainments, tended to emphasize big dance routines and popular songs at the expense of plot. Typical of the decade were lighthearted productions like \"Sally\", \"Lady, Be Good\", \"No, No, Nanette\", \"Oh, Kay!\" and \"Funny Face\". Despite forgettable stories, these musicals featured stars such as Marilyn Miller and Fred Astaire and produced dozens of enduring popular songs by Kern, George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter and Rodgers and Hart. Popular music was dominated by musical theatre standards, such as \"Fascinating Rhythm\", \"Tea for Two\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me\". Many shows were revues, series of sketches and songs with little or no connection between them. The best-known of these were the annual \"Ziegfeld Follies\", spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets, elaborate costumes and beautiful chorus girls. These spectacles also raised production values, and mounting a musical generally became more expensive. \"Shuffle Along\" (1921), an all-African American show was a hit on Broadway. A new generation of composers of operettas also emerged in the 1920s, such as Rudolf Friml and Sigmund Romberg, to create a series of popular Broadway hits.\n\nIn London, writer-stars such as Ivor Novello and Noël Coward became popular, but the primacy of British musical theatre from the 19th century through 1920 was gradually replaced by American innovation, especially after World War I, as Kern and other Tin Pan Alley composers began to bring new musical styles such as ragtime and jazz to the theatres, and the Shubert Brothers took control of the Broadway theatres. Musical theatre writer Andrew Lamb notes, \"The operatic and theatrical styles of nineteenth-century social structures were replaced by a musical style more aptly suited to twentieth-century society and its vernacular idiom. It was from America that the more direct style emerged, and in America that it was able to flourish in a developing society less hidebound by nineteenth-century tradition.\" In France, \"comédie musicale\" was written between in the early decades of the century for such stars as Yvonne Printemps.\n\nProgressing far beyond the comparatively frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, Broadway's \"Show Boat\" (1927), represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. This was accomplished by combining the lyricism of Kern's music with the skillful libretto of Oscar Hammerstein II. One historian wrote, \"Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now ... everything else was subservient to that play. Now ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.\"\nAs the Great Depression set in during the post-Broadway national tour of \"Show Boat\", the public turned back to mostly light, escapist song-and-dance entertainment. Audiences on both sides of the Atlantic had little money to spend on entertainment, and only a few stage shows anywhere exceeded a run of 500 performances during the decade. The revue \"The Band Wagon\" (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, while Porter's \"Anything Goes\" (1934) confirmed Ethel Merman's position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. Coward and Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as \"The Dancing Years\", while Rodgers and Hart returned from Hollywood to create a series of successful Broadway shows, including \"On Your Toes\" (1936, with Ray Bolger, the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), \"Babes in Arms\" (1937) and \"The Boys from Syracuse\" (1938). Porter added \"DuBarry Was a Lady\" (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was \"Hellzapoppin\" (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record.\n\nStill, a few creative teams began to build on \"Show Boat\"s innovations. \"Of Thee I Sing\" (1931), a political satire by the Gershwins, was the first musical awarded the Pulitzer Prize. \"As Thousands Cheer\" (1933), a revue by Irving Berlin and Moss Hart in which each song or sketch was based on a newspaper headline, marked the first Broadway show in which an African-American, Ethel Waters, starred alongside white actors. Waters' numbers included \"Supper Time\", a woman's lament for her husband who has been lynched. The Gershwins' \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935) featured an all African-American cast and blended operatic, folk and jazz idioms. \"The Cradle Will Rock\" (1937), directed by Orson Welles, was a highly political pro-union piece that, despite the controversy surrounding it, ran for 108 performances. Rodgers and Hart's \"I'd Rather Be Right\" (1937) was a political satire with George M. Cohan as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Kurt Weill's \"Knickerbocker Holiday\" depicted New York City's early history while good-naturedly satirizing Roosevelt's good intentions.\n\nThe motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. Silent films had presented only limited competition, but by the end of the 1920s, films like \"The Jazz Singer\" could be presented with synchronized sound. \"Talkie\" films at low prices effectively killed off vaudeville by the early 1930s. Despite the economic woes of the 1930s and the competition from film, the musical survived. In fact, it continued to evolve thematically beyond the gags and showgirls musicals of the \"Gay Nineties\" and \"Roaring Twenties\" and the sentimental romance of operetta, adding technical expertise and the fast-paced staging and naturalistic dialogue style led by director George Abbott.\n\nThe 1940s would begin with more hits from Porter, Irving Berlin, Rodgers and Hart, Weill and Gershwin, some with runs over 500 performances as the economy rebounded, but artistic change was in the air.\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\" (1943) completed the revolution begun by \"Show Boat\", by tightly integrating all the aspects of musical theatre, with a cohesive plot, songs that furthered the action of the story, and featured dream ballets and other dances that advanced the plot and developed the characters, rather than using dance as an excuse to parade scantily clad women across the stage. Rodgers and Hammerstein hired ballet choreographer Agnes de Mille, who used everyday motions to help the characters express their ideas. It defied musical conventions by raising its first act curtain not on a bevy of chorus girls, but rather on a woman churning butter, with an off-stage voice singing the opening lines of \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" unaccompanied. It drew rave reviews, set off a box-office frenzy and received a Pulitzer Prize. Brooks Atkinson wrote in \"The New York Times\" that the show's opening number changed the history of musical theater: \"After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable.\" It was the first \"blockbuster\" Broadway show, running a total of 2,212 performances, and was made into a hit film. It remains one of the most frequently produced of the team's projects. William A. Everett and Paul R. Laird wrote that this was a \"show, that, like \"Show Boat\", became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to \"Oklahoma!\"\"\n\n\"After \"Oklahoma!\", Rodgers and Hammerstein were the most important contributors to the musical-play form... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\". The two collaborators created an extraordinary collection of some of musical theatre's best loved and most enduring classics, including \"Carousel\" (1945), \"South Pacific\" (1949), \"The King and I\" (1951) and \"The Sound of Music\" (1959). Some of these musicals treat more serious subject matter than most earlier shows: the villain in \"Oklahoma!\" is a suspected murderer and psychopath with a fondness for lewd post cards; \"Carousel\" deals with spousal abuse, thievery, suicide and the afterlife; \"South Pacific\" explores miscegenation even more thoroughly than \"Show Boat\"; and the hero of \"The King and I\" dies onstage.\n\nThe show's creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein's contemporaries and ushered in the \"Golden Age\" of American musical theatre. Americana was displayed on Broadway during the \"Golden Age\", as the wartime cycle of shows began to arrive. An example of this is \"On the Town\" (1944), written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, composed by Leonard Bernstein and choreographed by Jerome Robbins. The story is set during wartime and concerns three sailors who are on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City, during which each falls in love. The show also gives the impression of a country with an uncertain future, as the sailors and their women also have. Irving Berlin used sharpshooter Annie Oakley's career as a basis for his \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (1946, 1,147 performances); Burton Lane, E. Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy combined political satire with Irish whimsy for their fantasy \"Finian's Rainbow\" (1947, 725 performances); and Cole Porter found inspiration in William Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" for \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (1948, 1,077 performances). The American musicals overwhelmed the old-fashioned British Coward/Novello-style shows, one of the last big successes of which was Novello's \"Perchance to Dream\" (1945, 1,021 performances). The formula for the Golden Age musicals reflected one or more of four widely held perceptions of the \"American dream\": That stability and worth derives from a love relationship sanctioned and restricted by Protestant ideals of marriage; that a married couple should make a moral home with children away from the city in a suburb or small town; that the woman's function was as homemaker and mother; and that Americans incorporate an independent and pioneering spirit or that their success is self-made.\n\nDamon Runyon's eclectic characters were at the core of Frank Loesser's and Abe Burrows' \"Guys and Dolls\", (1950, 1,200 performances); and the Gold Rush was the setting for Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1951). The relatively brief seven-month run of that show didn't discourage Lerner and Loewe from collaborating again, this time on \"My Fair Lady\" (1956), an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, which at 2,717 performances held the long-run record for many years. Popular Hollywood films were made of all of these musicals. This surpassed the run of two hits by British creators: \"The Boy Friend\" (1954), which ran for 2,078 performances in London and marked Andrews' American debut, was very briefly the third longest-running musical in West End or Broadway history (after \"Chu Chin Chow\" and \"Oklahoma!\"), until \"Salad Days\" (1954) surpassed its run and became the new long-run record holder, with 2,283 performances.\n\nAnother record was set by \"The Threepenny Opera\", which ran for 2,707 performances, becoming the longest-running off-Broadway musical until \"The Fantasticks\". The production also broke ground by showing that musicals could be profitable off-Broadway in a small-scale, small orchestra format. This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of Jerome Kern and P. G. Wodehouse's \"Leave It to Jane\" ran for more than two years. The 1959–1960 Off-Broadway season included a dozen musicals and revues including \"Little Mary Sunshine\", \"The Fantasticks\" and \"Ernest in Love\", a musical adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1895 hit \"The Importance of Being Earnest\".\n\"West Side Story\" (1957) transported \"Romeo and Juliet\" to modern day New York City and converted the feuding Montague and Capulet families into opposing ethnic gangs, the Jets and the Sharks. The book was adapted by Arthur Laurents, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by newcomer Stephen Sondheim. It was embraced by the critics, but failed to be a popular choice for the \"blue-haired matinee ladies\", who preferred the small town River City, Iowa of Meredith Willson's \"The Music Man\" to the alleys of Manhattan's Upper West Side. Apparently Tony Award voters were of a similar mind, since they favored the former over the latter. \"West Side Story\" had a respectable run of 732 performances (1,040 in the West End), while \"The Music Man\" ran nearly twice as long, with 1,375 performances. However, the film of \"West Side Story\" was extremely successful. Laurents and Sondheim teamed up again for \"\" (1959, 702 performances), with Jule Styne providing the music for a backstage story about the most driven stage mother of all-time, stripper Gypsy Rose Lee's mother Rose. The original production ran for 702 performances, and was given four subsequent revivals, with Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone later tackling the role made famous by Ethel Merman.\n\nAlthough directors and choreographers have had a major influence on musical theatre style since at least the 19th century, George Abbott and his collaborators and successors took a central role in integrating movement and dance fully into musical theatre productions in the Golden Age. Abbott introduced ballet as a story-telling device in \"On Your Toes\" in 1936, which was followed by Agnes de Mille's ballet and choreography in \"Oklahoma!\". After Abbott collaborated with Jerome Robbins in \"On the Town\" and other shows, Robbins combined the roles of director and choreographer, emphasizing the story-telling power of dance in \"West Side Story\", \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" (1962) and \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (1964). Bob Fosse choreographed for Abbott in \"The Pajama Game\" (1956) and \"Damn Yankees\" (1957), injecting playful sexuality into those hits. He was later the director-choreographer for \"Sweet Charity\" (1968), \"Pippin\" (1972) and \"Chicago\" (1975). Other notable director-choreographers have included Gower Champion, Tommy Tune, Michael Bennett, Gillian Lynne and Susan Stroman. Prominent directors have included Hal Prince, who also got his start with Abbott, and Trevor Nunn.\n\nDuring the Golden Age, automotive companies and other large corporations began to hire Broadway talent to write corporate musicals, private shows only seen by their employees or customers. The 1950s ended with Rodgers and Hammerstein's last hit, \"The Sound of Music\", which also became another hit for Mary Martin. It ran for 1,443 performances and shared the Tony Award for Best Musical. Together with its extremely successful 1965 film version, it has become one of the most popular musicals in history.\n\nIn 1960, \"The Fantasticks\" was first produced off-Broadway. This intimate allegorical show would quietly run for over 40 years at the Sullivan Street Theatre in Greenwich Village, becoming by far the longest-running musical in history. Its authors produced other innovative works in the 1960s, such as \"Celebration\" and \"I Do! I Do!\", the first two-character Broadway musical. The 1960s would see a number of blockbusters, like \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (1964; 3,242 performances), \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1964; 2,844 performances), \"Funny Girl\" (1964; 1,348 performances) and \"Man of La Mancha\" (1965; 2,328 performances), and some more risqué pieces like \"Cabaret\", before ending with the emergence of the rock musical. Two men had considerable impact on musical theatre history beginning in this decade: Stephen Sondheim and Jerry Herman.\nThe first project for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics was \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" (1962, 964 performances), with a book based on the works of Plautus by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart, starring Zero Mostel. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past. Other early Sondheim works include \"Anyone Can Whistle\" (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars Lee Remick and Angela Lansbury), and the successful \"Company\" (1970), \"Follies\" (1971) and \"A Little Night Music\" (1973). Later, Sondheim found inspiration in unlikely sources: the opening of Japan to Western trade for \"Pacific Overtures\" (1976), a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the Industrial Age of London for \"Sweeney Todd\" (1979), the paintings of Georges Seurat for \"Sunday in the Park with George\" (1984), fairy tales for \"Into the Woods\" (1987), and a collection of presidential assassins in \"Assassins\" (1990).\n\nWhile some critics have argued that some of Sondheim's musicals lack commercial appeal, others have praised their lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, as well as the interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (\"Merrily We Roll Along\") and the above-mentioned \"Anyone Can Whistle\", in which the first act ends with the cast informing the audience that they are mad.\n\nJerry Herman played a significant role in American musical theatre, beginning with his first Broadway production, \"Milk and Honey\" (1961, 563 performances), about the founding of the state of Israel, and continuing with the blockbuster hits \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1964, 2,844 performances), \"Mame\" (1966, 1,508 performances), and \"La Cage aux Folles\" (1983, 1,761 performances). Even his less successful shows like \"Dear World\" (1969) and \"Mack and Mabel\" (1974) have had memorable scores (\"Mack and Mabel\" was later reworked into a London hit). Writing both words and music, many of Herman's show tunes have become popular standards, including \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"We Need a Little Christmas\", \"I Am What I Am\", \"Mame\", \"The Best of Times\", \"Before the Parade Passes By\", \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\", \"It Only Takes a Moment\", \"Bosom Buddies\" and \"I Won't Send Roses\", recorded by such artists as Louis Armstrong, Eydie Gormé, Barbra Streisand, Petula Clark and Bernadette Peters. Herman's songbook has been the subject of two popular musical revues, \"Jerry's Girls\" (Broadway, 1985) and \"Showtune\" (off-Broadway, 2003).\nThe musical started to diverge from the relatively narrow confines of the 1950s. Rock music would be used in several Broadway musicals, beginning with \"Hair\", which featured not only rock music but also nudity and controversial opinions about the Vietnam War, race relations and other social issues.\n\nAfter \"Show Boat\" and \"Porgy and Bess\", and as the struggle in America and elsewhere for minorities' civil rights progressed, Hammerstein, Harold Arlen, Yip Harburg and others were emboldened to write more musicals and operas that aimed to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urged racial harmony. Early Golden Age works that focused on racial tolerance included \"Finian's Rainbow\" and \"South Pacific\". Towards the end of the Golden Age, several shows tackled Jewish subjects and issues, such as \"Fiddler on the Roof\", \"Milk and Honey\", \"Blitz!\" and later \"Rags\". The original concept that became \"West Side Story\" was set in the Lower East Side during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and Italian Catholic. The creative team later decided that the Polish (white) vs. Puerto Rican conflict was fresher.\n\nTolerance as an important theme in musicals has continued in recent decades. The final expression of \"West Side Story\" left a message of racial tolerance. By the end of the 1960s, musicals became racially integrated, with black and white cast members even covering each other's roles, as they did in \"Hair\". Homosexuality has also been explored in musicals, starting with \"Hair\", and even more overtly in \"La Cage aux Folles\", \"Falsettos\", \"Rent\", \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" and other shows in recent decades. \"Parade\" is a sensitive exploration of both anti-Semitism and historical American racism, and \"Ragtime\" similarly explores the experience of immigrants and minorities in America.\n\nAfter the success of \"Hair\", rock musicals flourished in the 1970s, with \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", \"Godspell\", \"The Rocky Horror Show\", \"Evita\" and \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\". Some of those began with \"concept albums\" and then moved to film or stage, such as \"Tommy\". Others had no dialogue or were otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes; these sometimes started as concept albums and were referred to as rock operas. Shows like \"Raisin\", \"Dreamgirls\", \"Purlie\" and \"The Wiz\" brought a significant African-American influence to Broadway. More varied musical genres and styles were incorporated into musicals both on and especially off-Broadway. At the same time, Stephen Sondheim found success with some of his musicals, as mentioned above.\n\nIn 1975, the dance musical \"A Chorus Line\" emerged from recorded group therapy-style sessions Michael Bennett conducted with \"gypsies\" – those who sing and dance in support of the leading players – from the Broadway community. From hundreds of hours of tapes, James Kirkwood Jr. and Nick Dante fashioned a book about an audition for a musical, incorporating many real-life stories from the sessions; some who attended the sessions eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show. With music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Edward Kleban, \"A Chorus Line\" first opened at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in lower Manhattan. What initially had been planned as a limited engagement eventually moved to the Shubert Theatre on Broadway for a run of 6,137 performances, becoming the longest-running production in Broadway history up to that time. The show swept the Tony Awards and won the Pulitzer Prize, and its hit song, \"What I Did for Love\", became a standard.\n\nBroadway audiences welcomed musicals that varied from the golden age style and substance. John Kander and Fred Ebb explored the rise of Nazism in Germany in \"Cabaret\", and murder and the media in Prohibition-era \"Chicago\", which relied on old vaudeville techniques. \"Pippin\", by Stephen Schwartz, was set in the days of Charlemagne. Federico Fellini's autobiographical film \"8½\" became Maury Yeston's \"Nine\". At the end of the decade, \"Evita\" and \"Sweeney Todd\" were precursors of the darker, big budget musicals of the 1980s that depended on dramatic stories, sweeping scores and spectacular effects. At the same time, old-fashioned values were still embraced in such hits as \"Annie\", \"42nd Street\", \"My One and Only\", and popular revivals of \"No, No, Nanette\" and \"Irene\". Although many film versions of musicals were made in the 1970s, few were critical or box office successes, with the notable exceptions of \"Fiddler on the Roof\", \"Cabaret\" and \"Grease\".\n\nThe 1980s saw the influence of European \"mega-musicals\", or \"pop operas\", on Broadway, in the West End and elsewhere. These typically featured a pop-influenced score, had large casts and sets and were identified by their notable effects – a falling chandelier (in \"The Phantom of the Opera\"), a helicopter landing on stage (in \"Miss Saigon\") – and big budgets. Many were based on novels or other works of literature. The most important writers of mega-musicals include the French team of Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, responsible for \"Les Misérables\", which became the longest-running international musical hit in history. The team, in collaboration with Richard Maltby Jr., continued to produce hits, including \"Miss Saigon\", inspired by the Puccini opera \"Madama Butterfly\".\n\nThe British composer Andrew Lloyd Webber saw similar success with \"Evita\", based on the life of Argentina's Eva Perón; \"Cats\", derived from the poems of T. S. Eliot (both of which musicals originally starred Elaine Paige); \"Starlight Express\", performed on roller skates; \"The Phantom of the Opera\", derived from the Gaston Leroux novel, \"Le Fantôme de l'Opéra\"; and \"Sunset Boulevard\" (from the classic film of the same name). These works ran (or are still running) for decades in both New York and London and had extraordinary international and touring success. The mega-musicals' huge budgets redefined expectations for financial success on Broadway and in the West End. In earlier years, it was possible for a show to be considered a hit after a run of several hundred performances, but with multimillion-dollar production costs, a show must run for years simply to turn a profit.\n\nIn the 1990s, a new generation of theatrical composers emerged, including Jason Robert Brown and Michael John LaChiusa, who began with productions Off-Broadway. The most conspicuous success of these artists was Jonathan Larson's show \"Rent\" (1996), a rock musical (based on the opera \"La bohème\") about a struggling community of artists in Manhattan. While the cost of tickets to Broadway and West End musicals was escalating beyond the budget of many theatregoers, \"Rent\" was marketed to increase the popularity of musicals among a younger audience. It featured a young cast and a heavily rock-influenced score; the musical became a hit. Its young fans, many of them students, calling themselves RENTheads], camped out at the Nederlander Theatre in hopes of winning the lottery for $20 front row tickets, and some saw the show dozens of times. Other shows on Broadway followed \"Rent\"'s lead by offering heavily discounted day-of-performance or standing-room tickets, although often the discounts are offered only to students.\n\nThe 1990s also saw the influence of large corporations on the production of musicals. The most important has been Disney Theatrical Productions, which began adapting some of Disney's animated film musicals for the stage, starting with \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1994), \"The Lion King\" (1997) and \"Aida\" (2000), the latter two with music by Elton John. \"The Lion King\" is the highest-grossing musical in Broadway history. \"The Who's Tommy\" (1993), a theatrical adaptation of the rock opera \"Tommy\", achieved a healthy run of 899 performances but was criticized for sanitizing the story and \"musical theatre-izing\" the rock music.\n\nDespite the growing number of large-scale musicals in the 1980s and 1990s, a number of lower-budget, smaller-scale musicals managed to find critical and financial success, such as \"Falsettoland\" and \"Little Shop of Horrors\", \"\" and \"Blood Brothers\". The topics of these pieces vary widely, and the music ranges from rock to pop, but they often are produced off-Broadway, or for smaller London theatres, and some of these stagings have been regarded as imaginative and innovative.\n\nIn the new century, familiarity has been embraced by producers and investors anxious to guarantee that they recoup their considerable investments. Some took (usually modest-budget) chances on new and creative material, such as \"Urinetown\" (2001), \"Avenue Q\" (2003), \"The Light in the Piazza\" (2005), \"Spring Awakening\" (2006), \"In the Heights\" (2007), \"Next to Normal\" (2009), \"American Idiot\" (2010) and \"The Book of Mormon\" (2011). \"Hamilton\" (2015), transformed \"under-dramatized American history\" into an unusual hip-hop inflected hit. In 2011, Sondheim argued that of all forms of \"contemporary pop music\", rap was \"the closest to traditional musical theatre\" and was \"one pathway to the future.\"\n\nHowever, most major-market 21st-century productions have taken a safe route, with revivals of familiar fare, such as \"Fiddler on the Roof\", \"A Chorus Line\", \"South Pacific\", \"Gypsy\", \"Hair\", \"West Side Story\" and \"Grease\", or with adaptations of other proven material, such as literature (\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\", \"Wicked\" and \"Fun Home\"), hoping that the shows would have a built-in audience as a result. This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (\"The Producers\", \"Spamalot\", \"Hairspray\", \"Legally Blonde\", \"The Color Purple\", \"Xanadu\", \"Billy Elliot\", \"Shrek\", \"Waitress\" and \"Groundhog Day\"). Some critics have argued that the reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as \"Mary Poppins\" and \"The Little Mermaid\"), equate the Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.\nToday, it is less likely that a sole producer, such as David Merrick or Cameron Mackintosh, backs a production. Corporate sponsors dominate Broadway, and often alliances are formed to stage musicals, which require an investment of $10 million or more. In 2002, the credits for \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\" listed ten producers, and among those names were entities composed of several individuals. Typically, off-Broadway and regional theatres tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals, and development of new musicals has increasingly taken place outside of New York and London or in smaller venues. For example, \"Spring Awakening\", \"Fun Home\" and \"Hamilton\" were developed Off-Broadway before being launched on Broadway.\n\nSeveral musicals returned to the spectacle format that was so successful in the 1980s, recalling extravaganzas that have been presented at times, throughout theatre history, since the ancient Romans staged mock sea battles. Examples include the musical adaptations of \"Lord of the Rings\" (2007), \"Gone with the Wind\" (2008) and \"\" (2011). These musicals involved songwriters with little theatrical experience, and the expensive productions generally lost money. Conversely, \"The Drowsy Chaperone\", \"Avenue Q\", \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\", \"Xanadu\" and \"Fun Home\", among others, have been presented in smaller-scale productions, mostly uninterrupted by an intermission, with short running times, and enjoyed financial success. In 2013, \"Time\" magazine reported that a trend Off-Broadway has been \"immersive\" theatre, citing shows such as \"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\" (2012) and \"Here Lies Love\" (2013) in which the staging takes place around and within the audience. The shows set a joint record, each receiving 11 nominations for Lucille Lortel Awards, and feature contemporary scores.\n\nIn 2013, Cyndi Lauper was the \"first female composer to win the [Tony for] Best Score without a male collaborator\" for writing the music and lyrics for \"Kinky Boots\". In 2015, for the first time, an all-female writing team, Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori, won the Tony Award for Best Original Score (and Best Book for Kron) for \"Fun Home\", although work by male songwriters continues to be produced more often.\n\nAnother trend has been to create a minimal plot to fit a collection of songs that have already been hits. Following the earlier success of \"Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story\", these have included \"Movin' Out\" (2002, based on the tunes of Billy Joel), \"Jersey Boys\" (2006, The Four Seasons), \"Rock of Ages\" (2009, featuring classic rock of the 1980s) and many others. This style is often referred to as the \"jukebox musical\". Similar but more plot-driven musicals have been built around the canon of a particular pop group including \"Mamma Mia!\" (1999, based on the songs of ABBA), \"Our House\" (2002, based on the songs of Madness) and \"We Will Rock You\" (2002, based on the songs of Queen).\n\nLive-action film musicals were nearly dead in the 1980s and early 1990s, with exceptions of \"Victor/Victoria\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\" and the 1996 film of \"Evita\". In the new century, Baz Luhrmann began a revival of the film musical with \"Moulin Rouge!\" (2001). This was followed by \"Chicago\" (2002); \"Phantom of the Opera\" (2004); \"Dreamgirls\" (2006); \"Hairspray\", \"Enchanted\" and \"\" (all in 2007); \"Mamma Mia!\" (2008); \"Nine\" (2009); \"Les Misérables\" and \"Pitch Perfect\" (both in 2012), \"Into The Woods\" (2014) and \"La La Land\" (2016), among others. Dr. Seuss's \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" (2000) and \"The Cat in the Hat\" (2003), turned children's books into live-action film musicals. After the immense success of Disney and other houses with animated film musicals beginning with \"The Little Mermaid\" in 1989 and running throughout the 1990s (including some more adult-themed films, like \"\" (1999)), fewer animated film musicals were released in the first decade of the 21st century. The genre made a comeback beginning in 2010 with \"Tangled\" (2010), \"Rio\" (2011) and \"Frozen\" (2013). In Asia, India continues to produce numerous \"Bollywood\" film musicals, and Japan produces \"Anime\" and \"Manga\" film musicals.\n\nMade for TV musical films were popular in the 1990s, such as \"Gypsy\" (1993), \"Cinderella\" (1997) and \"Annie\" (1999). Several made for TV musicals in the first decade of the 21st century were adaptations of the stage version, such as \"South Pacific\" (2001), \"The Music Man\" (2003) and \"Once Upon a Mattress\" (2005), and a televised version of the stage musical \"Legally Blonde\" in 2007. Additionally, several musicals were filmed on stage and broadcast on Public Television, for example \"Contact\" in 2002 and \"Kiss Me, Kate\" and \"Oklahoma!\" in 2003. The made-for-TV musical \"High School Musical\" (2006), and its several sequels, enjoyed particular success and were adapted for stage musicals and other media. In 2013, NBC began a series of live television broadcasts of musicals with \"The Sound of Music Live!\" Although the production received mixed reviews, it was a ratings success. Further broadcasts have included \"Peter Pan Live!\" (NBC 2014), \"The Wiz Live!\" (NBC 2015), a UK broadcast, \"The Sound of Music Live\" (ITV 2015) and \"\" (Fox 2016).\n\nSome television shows have set episodes as a musical. Examples include episodes of \"Ally McBeal\", \"\" (\"The Bitter Suite\" and \"Lyre, Lyre, Heart's On Fire\"), \"Psych\" (\"\"), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (\"Once More, with Feeling\"), \"That's So Raven\", \"Daria\", \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"The Powerpuff Girls\", \"The Flash\", \"Once Upon a Time\", \"Oz\", \"Scrubs\" (one episode was written by the creators of \"Avenue Q\"), \"\" () and \"That '70s Show\" (the 100th episode, \"That '70s Musical\"). Others have included scenes where characters suddenly begin singing and dancing in a musical-theatre style during an episode, such as in several episodes of \"The Simpsons\", \"30 Rock\", \"Hannah Montana\", \"South Park\", \"Bob's Burgers\" and \"Family Guy\". The television series \"Cop Rock\" extensively used the musical format, as do the series \"Flight of the Conchords\", \"Glee\", \"Smash\" and \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\".\n\nThere have also been musicals made for the internet, including \"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,\" about a low-rent super-villain played by Neil Patrick Harris. It was written during the WGA writer's strike. Since 2006, reality TV shows have been used to help market musical revivals by holding a talent competition to cast (usually female) leads. Examples of these are \"How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?\", \",\" \"Any Dream Will Do,\" \",\" \"I'd Do Anything\" and \"Over the Rainbow.\"\n\nThe U.S. and Britain were the most active sources of book musicals from the 19th century through much of the 20th century (although Europe produced various forms of popular light opera and operetta, for example Spanish Zarzuela, during that period and even earlier). However, the light musical stage in other countries has become more active in recent decades.\n\nMusicals from other English-speaking countries (notably Australia and Canada) often do well locally and occasionally even reach Broadway or the West End (e.g., \"The Boy from Oz\" and \"The Drowsy Chaperone\"). South Africa has an active musical theatre scene, with revues like \"African Footprint\" and \"Umoja\" and book musicals, such as \"Kat and the Kings\" and \"Sarafina!\" touring internationally. Locally, musicals like \"Vere\", \"Love and Green Onions\", \"Over the Rainbow: the all-new all-gay... extravaganza\" and \"Bangbroek Mountain\" and \"In Briefs – a queer little Musical\" have been produced successfully.\n\nSuccessful musicals from continental Europe include shows from (among other countries) Germany (\"Elixier\" and \"Ludwig II\"), Austria (\"Tanz der Vampire\", \"Elisabeth\", \"Mozart!\" and \"Rebecca\"), Czech Republic (\"Dracula\"), France (\"Notre-Dame de Paris\", \"Les Misérables\", \"Roméo et Juliette\" and \"Mozart, l'opéra rock\") and Spain (\"Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar\" and \"The Musical Sancho Panza\").\n\nJapan has recently seen the growth of an indigenous form of musical theatre, both animated and live action, mostly based on Anime and Manga, such as \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and \"Tenimyu\". The popular \"Sailor Moon\" metaseries has had twenty-nine Sailor Moon musicals, spanning thirteen years. Beginning in 1914, a series of popular revues have been performed by the all-female Takarazuka Revue, which currently fields five performing troupes. Elsewhere in Asia, the Indian Bollywood musical, mostly in the form of motion pictures, is tremendously successful.\n\nHong Kong's first modern musical, produced in both Cantonese and Mandarin, is \"Snow.Wolf.Lake\" (1997). Beginning with a 2002 tour of \"Les Misérables\", numerous Western musicals have been imported to mainland China and staged in English. Attempts at localizing Western productions in China began in 2008 when \"Fame\" was produced in Mandarin with a full Chinese cast at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing. Since then, other western productions have been staged in China in Mandarin with a Chinese cast. The first Chinese production in the style of Western musical theatre was \"The Gold Sand\" in 2005. In addition, Li Dun, a well-known Chinese producer, produced \"Butterflies\", based on a classic Chinese love tragedy, in 2007 as well as \"Love U Teresa\" in 2011.\n\nOther countries with an especially active musicals scene include the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Turkey.\n\nMusicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. Although amateur theatre has existed for centuries, even in the New World, François Cellier and Cunningham Bridgeman wrote, in 1914, that prior to the late 19th century, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the Savoy operas, professionals recognized that the amateur societies \"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\" The National Operatic and Dramatic Association was founded in the UK in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 amateur dramatic societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan works in Britain that year. Similarly, more than 100 community theatres were founded in the US in the early 20th century. This number has grown to an estimated 18,000 in the US. The Educational Theater Association in the US has nearly 5,000 member schools.\n\nThe Broadway League announced that in the 2007–08 season, 12.27 million tickets were purchased for Broadway shows for a gross sale amount of almost a billion dollars. The League further reported that during the 2006–07 season, approximately 65% of Broadway tickets were purchased by tourists, and that foreign tourists were 16% of attendees. The Society of London Theatre reported that 2007 set a record for attendance in London. Total attendees in the major commercial and grant-aided theatres in Central London were 13.6 million, and total ticket revenues were £469.7 million. Also, the international musicals scene has been particularly active in recent years. Stephen Sondheim commented in the year 2000:\nHowever, noting the success in recent decades of original material, and creative re-imaginings of film, plays and literature, theatre historian John Kenrick countered: \nIs the Musical dead? ... Absolutely not! Changing? Always! The musical has been changing ever since Offenbach did his first rewrite in the 1850s. And change is the clearest sign that the musical is still a living, growing genre. Will we ever return to the so-called 'golden age', with musicals at the center of popular culture? Probably not. Public taste has undergone fundamental changes, and the commercial arts can only flow where the paying public allows.\n\n\n\n"}

The black-and-white film starred Dhalia and Soerip as orphaned sisters trying to make a living in the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta) before moving to Kudus to work at a clove cigarette factory.\n\nShot on location at an orphanage and two factories in central Java, \"Panggilan Darah\" was a modest commercial success in the Indies and Singapore. Its soundtrack, which featured nine \"kroncong\" songs, received popular acclaim, and the film's acting received critical praise. Despite this success, Oriental was unable to recoup its expenses, and merged into Multi Film soon afterwards. \"Panggilan Darah\", which was screened as late as 1952, may now be lost.\n\nOrphaned sisters Dhalia and Soerip (themselves) leave their village in an attempt to make a living in the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta). After a long period of misery, they are accepted as housemaids at the home of Hajji Iskak (Mochtar Widjaja). Although initially elated, they find that Iskak's wife (Wolly Sutinah) is a cruel mistress who often beats them. Meanwhile, Iskak's would-be son-in-law is constantly flirting with Dhalia, much to his fiancée's dismay.\n\nThe sisters decide to run away from Iskak's home. They make their way to Kudus and find work at the Nitisemito clove cigarette factory with the help of their friend (S. Poniman). Not long after their escape, Iskak receives a guest who reveals that the two were his nieces. This revelation spurs Iskak to take out advertisements in newspapers, looking for the young women and asking them to return to Batavia.\n\nIskak's search has little success until the sisters receive news that he is looking for them, and they quickly return to Batavia. There, the sisters are greeted with open arms. Iskak's wife regrets her earlier treatment of the girls and repents, treating them splendidly and supporting Dhalia's plans to open an orphanage.\n\n\"Panggilan Darah\" was the directorial debut of Sutan Usman Karim, commonly known as Suska, a journalist and former member of the touring theatrical group Bolero under Andjar Asmara. With \"Panggilan Darah\", which he also wrote, Suska became one of several reporters who entered the film industry in the 1940s. He directed the film for the Batavia-based film company Oriental, run by the ethnic Chinese producer Tjho Seng Han. The production house had previously released three films, all directed by Njoo Cheong Seng, but after Njoo departed for Fred Young's Majestic, Oriental had required a new director.\n\nThe film was shot in black and white by the Indo cameraman J. J. W. Steffens, with editing handled by Soemardjan. Scenes were shot at an orphanage for Muslims owned by S. Z. Gunawan (who played herself in the film), as well as at the Nitisemito cigarette factory in Kudus and at a batik factory in Pekalongan owned by Tan Jauw Lin. Writing in 2009, the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggested that the film may have been partly sponsored by Nitisemito—one of the largest cigarette factories in the Indies in the 1940s—based on the factory's prominence in the plot.\n\nDhalia, Soerip, and S. Poniman, already known for their singing prowess, starred in \"Panggilan Darah\", which featured nine \"kroncong\" songs. Additional roles were taken by Wolly Sutinah and Mochtar Widjaja. The film marked Sutinah's debut for the company; the other cast members had previous screen credits with Oriental.\n\n\"Panggilan Darah\" debuted at the Orion Theatre in Batavia on 30 June 1941. It was reported as a modest success, making most of its money from lower class audiences. It was screened in Surabaya, East Java, by August, and by September it had been shown in Singapore, then part of British Malaya. A novelisation by Roestam Sutan Palindih was published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning Publishers that year.\n\nReviews of \"Panggilan Darah\" were mixed to positive. The journalist Soerono, writing in the entertainment magazine \"Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film\", was pleased with the film's depiction of the Islamic mandate to take care of orphans. An anonymous review in the Surabaya-based daily \"Soerabaijasch Handelsblad\" found the film \"something special\" and praised Soerip's spontaneity in her role. Biran wrote that lower-class audiences enjoyed the film's music, while the intelligentsia scoffed at the idea that a factory supervisor would bring a guitar to work. He found the plot illogical, asking why the sisters would not have worked in their own home village and how the destitute sisters could have made the journey from Batavia to Kudus, over away.\n\nUnable to recoup its expenses, Oriental later merged into the Dutch-owned Multi Film and ceased producing works of fiction. Suska left the company and joined The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film, for which he directed \"Ratna Moetoe Manikam\". Most of the cast remained active in cinema for the remainder of their lives. Both Dhalia and Soerip remained in the film industry for the next fifty years; they acted in their last feature films, \"Pendekar Jagad Kelana\" (\"Warrior of Jagad Kelana\") and \"Sejak Cinta Diciptakan\" (\"Since Love was Created\") respectively, in 1990. Poniman and Sutinah would remain active in the industry until 1975 and 1986. Only Widjaja is not recorded as performing in any more films.\n\n\"Panggilan Darah\" was screened as late as August 1952, but may now be lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, J. B. Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\n"}

It is the third (chronologically, the first) installment of the \"Paranormal Activity\" series and serves as a prequel, mostly set 18 years prior to the events of the first two films. It was released in theaters on October 21, 2011. \"Paranormal Activity 3\" was also Joost and Schulman's first horror film.\n\nThe film broke financial records upon release, setting a new record for a midnight opening for a horror film ($8 million) and the best opening day for a horror film in the United States ($26.2 million).\n\nIn 2005, Katie delivers a box of old videotapes to her pregnant sister Kristi and her husband Daniel, which holds footage of young Katie and Kristi with their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend Dennis. A year later, Kristi and Daniel's house is ransacked and the tapes are missing.\n\nIn 1988, a young Katie and Kristi are living with their mother Julie and her boyfriend Dennis. Dennis notices that since Kristi's imaginary friend Toby appeared, strange things have been happening around the house. Dennis and Julie attempt to make a sex tape, but are interrupted by an earthquake. The camera shows dust fall from the ceiling and land on an invisible figure in the room. While reviewing the footage, Dennis notices the strange incident. His friend Randy suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house. That night, Kristi wakes up and talks to someone off-camera. When Dennis questions her, Kristi tells him it was Toby.\n\nDennis and Julie hire a babysitter named Lisa to watch the kids, but she becomes desperate to leave due to several terrifying incidents (both captured on camera). The following night, Kristi tells Toby they're not friends anymore. Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet and finds the same symbol in a book about demonology. When Kristi becomes ill, Julie and Dennis take her to the hospital. Katie is left home with Randy, and they play Bloody Mary in the bathroom. Randy is attacked and discovers a large scratch on his torso. They try to leave the bathroom, but a black figure moves and furniture is violently flung across the room. After Julie and Dennis return, Randy warns that whatever they're dealing with is dangerous. Dennis tells Julie that the symbol he found belonged to a witches' coven that brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons, then forced them to give up their sons; they would not remember anything afterward. Julie dismisses his claim.\n\nThe demon harms Katie until Kristi agrees to do what it asks. She asks her mother to take them to her grandmother Lois's house in Moorpark, California. After Julie encounters frightening activity herself, she agrees to go to Lois's home. At 1 am, they are awoken by loud disturbances and Julie goes to investigate. When she fails to return, Dennis goes to look for her. He finds occult imagery on the walls, including the symbol from the girls' room, and discovers several women, including Lois, dressed in black. He flees back to the house, with the women in pursuit, and finds Julie's limp body levitating above the ground. Her body is thrown at Dennis, knocking him down the stairs. He hides with Kristi in a closet until the demon leaves.\n\nDennis and Kristi then walk into the kitchen. In the window, Dennis sees the women outside, circling around a bonfire. They find Katie crying near Julie's body. Dennis approaches Katie, but when he touches her, she unleashes a demonic scream that throws him to the other side of the room, injuring his leg. Lois stands before him, and Dennis's body is violently contorted, killing him. Lois then beckons to Kristi and Katie and tells them to get ready. Before they head upstairs, Kristi calls for Toby and growling sounds are heard upstairs.\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in June 2011 and ended in August. At the time during production, the film was under the name \"Sports Camp\". The film was directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (who both directed the documentary \"Catfish\"). Jason Blum, Oren Peli and Steven Schneider produced, along with Akiva Goldsman serving as executive producer. With a script written by Christopher B. Landon, the prequel was released on October 21, 2011. In some of the trailers, many of the scenes weren't shown in the final cut, which angered many of the fans.\n\nOnce again using unique social media strategy after the success of the first two films, \"Paranormal Activity 3\" created the \"Tweet Your Scream\" campaign on Twitter in preparation for the release.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 68% of 117 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6 out of 10. The website's consensus is, \"While the jolts and thrills are undeniably subject to the diminishing returns that plague most horror sequels, \"Paranormal Activity 3\" is a surprisingly spine-tingling treat.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 59 based on 25 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale. Conversely, Roger Ebert gave the film a single star out of four, stating that \"the appeal has worn threadbare\", but predicting that the film will fare well in the box office nevertheless.\n\nThe film performed even better than its predecessors, grossing $8 million from midnight showings, setting yet another record for a horror film. Its total Friday gross was an estimated $26.2 million, which was the best opening day gross for a 2011 film since \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" in July. Bringing its total to $52.6 million, it set a new record for the franchise, a horror film (\"Paranormal Activity 2\", $40.6 million). At the time of its release, it set a new opening weekend record for a film released in the month of October as well as the fall season (later surpassed by \"Gravity\" in 2013 with a weekend gross of $55.8 million).\n\n\"Paranormal Activity 3\" grossed $104,028,807 in the United States and Canada, along with $101,675,011 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $205,703,818, making it the highest-grossing film in the 'Paranormal Activity' series.\n\n\"Paranormal Activity 3\" was released on DVD/Blu-ray and video on demand/pay-per-view on January 24, 2012, and includes an unrated director's cut, \"lost tapes\" (deleted scenes), theatrical version, and digital copy. A one-disc theatrical version of the movie was released on DVD on February 14, 2012.\n\nIn January 2012, Paramount announced there would be a fourth film in the franchise. It was to be directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the directors of the third film. Filming started in late June. The film was released on October 19, 2012.

{"id": "1700432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1700432", "title": "Reginald Scot", "text": "Reginald Scot\n\nReginald Scot (or Scott) ( – 9 October 1599) was an Englishman and Member of Parliament, the author of \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", which was published in 1584. It was written against the belief in witches, to show that witchcraft did not exist. Part of its content exposes how (apparently miraculous) feats of magic were done, and the book is often deemed the first textbook on conjuring.\n\nHe was son of Richard Scot, second son of Sir John Scott (died 1533) of Scots Hall in Smeeth, near Ashford in Kent. His mother was Mary, daughter of George Whetenall, sheriff of Kent in 1527. His father died before 1544, and his mother remarried Fulk Onslow, clerk of the parliament; dying on 8 October 1582, she was buried in the church of Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Reginald or Reynold (as he signed his name in accordance with contemporary practice) was born about 1538.\n\nWhen about seventeen, Scot entered Hart Hall, Oxford, but left the university without a degree. His writings show some knowledge of law, but he is not known to have joined any inn of court. Marrying in 1568, he seems to have spent the rest of his life in his native county. His time was mainly passed as an active country gentleman, managing property which he inherited from his kinsfolk about Smeeth and Brabourne, or directing the business affairs of his first cousin, Sir Thomas Scot, who proved a generous patron, and in whose house of Scots Hall he often stayed. He was collector of subsidies for the lathe (county subdivision) of Shepway in 1586 and 1587, and he was perhaps the Reginald Scot who acted in 1588 as a captain of untrained foot-soldiers at the county muster. He was returned to the parliament of 1588–9 as member for New Romney, and he was probably a justice of the peace. He describes himself as \"esquire\" in the title-page of his \"Discoverie\", and is elsewhere designated \"armiger\".\n\nScot married at Brabourne, on 11 October 1568, Jane Cobbe of Cobbes Place, in the parish of Aldington. By her he had a daughter Elizabeth, who married Sackville Turnor of Tablehurt, Sussex. Subsequently Scot married a second wife, a widow named Alice Collyar, who had a daughter called Mary by her former husband.\n\nScot made his own will (drawing it with his own hand) on 15 September 1599. He died at Smeeth on 9 October following, and was probably buried in the church there. His small properties about Brabourne, Aldington, and Romney Marsh he left to his widow. The last words of his will run: \"Great is the trouble my poor wife hath had with me, and small is the comfort she hath received at my hands, whom if I had not matched withal I had not died worth one groat.\"\n\nIn the \"Discoverie\", Scot aligns himself with Reformed Protestantism, quoting John Calvin more than a dozen times. Calvin in turn was echoing the skepticism toward superstitions of early English reformer John Wycliffe. Scot expresses what is often called the Providential view in stating that \"it is neither a witch, nor devil, but glorious God that maketh the thunder...God maketh the blustering tempests and whirlwinds...\" This doctrine was also aligned with the tenth-century Canon Episcopi and Scot quotes from it. In the last half of the sixteenth century, an active theological debate continued from various pulpits throughout Europe – Calvinist, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic – between those who supported the skeptical Episcopi/Providential tradition and those who believed that witches could obtain real supernatural powers through an agreement or pact with the devil. The latter belief in the power of witches, and an intense phobia toward them, was associated by Scot with the book \"Malleus Maleficarum\", and upon this book Scot focuses the most criticism, and lumps others aligned with the same view of witchcraft: \"...from whom [Jean] Bodin and all the other writers... do receive their light...\"\n\nA late twentieth-century historian argues that Scot was likely influenced by, and perhaps a member of, the Family of Love. An intriguing clue to this theory is the name Abraham Fleming written backwards (Gnimelf Maharba) in Scot's lengthy bibliography in the front pages of the \"Discoverie.\"\n\nIn 1574 he published his \"Perfect Platform of a Hop-garden, and necessary instructions for the making and maintenance thereof, with Notes and Rules for Reformation of all Abuses.\" The work, which is dedicated to Serjeant William Lovelace of Bethersden, is the first practical treatise on hop culture in England; the processes are illustrated by woodcuts. Scot, according to a statement of the printer, was out of London while the work was going through the press. A second edition appeared in 1576, and a third in 1578.\n\nHis work on witchcraft was \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", \"wherein the Lewde dealing of Witches and Witchmongers is notablie detected, in sixteen books … whereunto is added a Treatise upon the Nature and Substance of Spirits and Devils\", 1584. Scot enumerates 212 authors whose works in Latin he had consulted, and twenty-three authors who wrote in English. He studied the superstitions respecting witchcraft in courts of law in country districts, where the prosecution of witches was constant, and in village life, where the belief in witchcraft flourished. He set himself to prove that the belief in witchcraft and magic was rejected alike by reason and religion, and that spiritualistic manifestations were either wilful impostures or illusions due to mental disturbance in the observers.\n\n\n\nOther Publications:\n\n"}

It was named in honor of Lloyd Shapley, who introduced it in 1953. To each cooperative game it assigns a unique distribution (among the players) of a total surplus generated by the coalition of all players. The Shapley value is characterized by a collection of desirable properties. Hart (1989) provides a survey of the subject.\n\nThe setup is as follows: a coalition of players cooperates, and obtains a certain overall gain from that cooperation. Since some players may contribute more to the coalition than others or may possess different bargaining power (for example threatening to destroy the whole surplus), what final distribution of generated surplus among the players should arise in any particular game? Or phrased differently: how important is each player to the overall cooperation, and what payoff can he or she reasonably expect? The Shapley value provides one possible answer to this question.\n\nFor cost-sharing games with concave cost functions, the optimal cost-sharing rule that optimizes the price of anarchy, followed by the price of stability, is precisely the Shapley value cost-sharing rule.\n\nFormally, a coalitional game is defined as:\nThere is a set \"N\" (of \"n\" players) and a function formula_1 that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: formula_2, with formula_3, where formula_4 denotes the empty set. The function formula_1 is called a characteristic function.\n\nThe function formula_6 has the following meaning: if \"S\" is a coalition of players, then \"formula_6\"(\"S\"), called the worth of coalition \"S\", describes the total expected sum of payoffs the members of formula_8 can obtain by cooperation.\n\nThe Shapley value is one way to distribute the total gains to the players, assuming that they all collaborate. It is a \"fair\" distribution in the sense that it is the only distribution with certain desirable properties listed below.

It continues to be played as a holiday favorite on most \"oldie\" radio stations; however, it is also often played on radio stations playing a Hit Music format as well as Adult Contemporary format stations. While these stations wouldn't normally play music from this era radio stations will make exceptions to mix certain Christmas songs with the usual playlist during the Holiday period. Due to a chart department policy instituted by \"Billboard\" magazine, the \"Snoopy's Christmas\" single never appeared in the Hot 100. It was, however, shown at No. 1 on a specialty list called \"Best Bets For Christmas\". \"Cash Box\" magazine peaked the song at No. 10. The publication. \"Record World\", peaked the song at No. 17.\n\nThe song, which references the Christmas truce of World War I, subsequently appeared on the album \"Snoopy and His Friends\".\n\nA followup to their earlier \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\", the song is about how Snoopy had to go out and fight the Red Baron on Christmas Eve. The Baron has Snoopy at his mercy after a long dogfight but, instead of shooting him down he forces Snoopy to land and offers Snoopy a holiday toast. Afterward, Snoopy and the Red Baron fly their separate ways, \"each knowing they'd meet on some other day\".\n\nThe release begins with an unknown male chorus singing the German yuletide classic \"O Tannenbaum\" (\"O Christmas Tree\"), and the middle of the song is bridged by chimes ringing out a phrase from \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\". The chimes can also can be heard during the fade-out at the end of the song. The album version of the song has a simulated radio news report of failed efforts at a Christmas truce, leading to Snoopy being sent out to hunt his sworn foe.\n\nAlthough fictitious, the song is set against the backdrop of a legitimate historical event. During World War I, in 1914, \"The Christmas Truce\" was initiated not by German and British commanders, but by the soldiers themselves. The length of the cease-fire varied by location, and was reported to have been as brief as Christmas Day or as long as the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. Trench-bound combatants exchanged small gifts across the lines, with Germans giving beer to the British, who sent tobacco and tinned meat back in return. No Man's Land was cleared of dead bodies, trenches were repaired and drained, and troops from both sides shared pictures of their families and, in some places, used No Man's Land for friendly games of football. The song even has the initiator correct as it was generally the German soldiers who called over to the British and initiated the truce and, in the song, it is the Red Baron—a German WWI hero—who extends the hand of Christmas friendship to Snoopy.\n\n\"Snoopy's Christmas\" reached the No. 1 position in the New Zealand and Australia singles charts in 1967, and remains a popular Christmas song in those countries. The song was the fastest-selling single at the time it was originally released and is estimated to be the biggest selling overseas single sold in New Zealand in the 20th century. The song frequently reenters the New Zealand singles chart, charting in December 1987, 1988, 1989, and 2013. \"Snoopy's Christmas\" was also voted \"the worst Christmas song of all time\" by readers of the \"New Zealand Herald\" in 2007.\n"}
{"id": "2032456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032456", "title": "Staging (theatre, film, television)", "text": "Staging (theatre, film, television)\n\nStaging is the process of selecting, designing, adapting to, or modifying the performance space for a play or film. This includes the use or absence of stagecraft elements as well as the structure of the stage and its components.\n\nStaging is also used to mean the result of this process, in other words the spectacle that a play presents in performance, its visual detail. This can include such things as positions of actors on stage (often referred to as blocking), their gestures and movements (also called stage business), the scenic background, the props and costumes, lighting, and sound effects. Besides costume, any physical object that appears in a play has the potential to become an important dramatic symbol. The first thing that the audience of a play sees is the stage set, the physical objects that suggest the world of the play. The stage set is usually indicated by the playwright, but the degree of detail and specificity of this rendering vary from one playwright to another and from one literary period to another. In film, staging is generally called \"set dressing\".\n\nWhile from a critical standpoint, \"staging\" can refer to the spectacle that a play presents in performance, the term is also frequently used interchangeably with the term \"blocking\", referring to how the performers are placed and moved around the stage. Many audience members may believe that performers move spontaneously on the stage, but blocking/staging is rarely spontaneous. Major points of blocking are often set down by the playwright, but blocking is usually done by the director, sometimes in collaboration with performers and designers. In the modern theater, there are purely mechanical reasons why blocking is crucial. Stage lighting is focused on specific parts of the stage at specific moments, and the performer must be sure to be on his or her \"mark\" or \"spike\" or they may not be well lit. Blocking also ensures that the stage picture gives the proper focus to the proper places, and that transitions occur smoothly. This becomes even more crucial as modern stage technology allows for ever more elaborate special effects.\n\nWhen Twentieth Century Fox introduced wide-screen CinemaScope format, the head of production Darryl Zanuck repeatedly reminded his directors to take full advantage of the screen width by staging action all the way across the frame - in his words, 'keep the people spread out'. He wanted the audience to experience the full width of the new screen shape. The 'washing line' staging demanded by Zanuck not only was a commercial imperative, it also was a practical solution for the lack of color film sensitivity as well for inability to employ deep staging.\n\n"}
{"id": "11567293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11567293", "title": "Tautogram", "text": "Tautogram\n\nA tautogram (Greek: \"tauto gramma\", \"same letter\") is a text in which all words start with the same letter. Historically, tautograms were mostly poetical forms. The difference between a tautogram and alliteration is that tautograms are a written, visual phenomenon, whereas alliterations are a phonetic one. Most cases of alliteration are also tautograms, though certainly not all since different letters can frequently take on the same sound (e.g., circle segment or Catcher Ken). Similarly, most tautograms are also alliterations, although exceptions exist when using letters with multiple pronunciations (e.g., crazy child or pneumatic plate).\n\nIn popular culture, tautogram is used in U.S. hangman game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" as the category 'Same Letter'.\n\n\nAn example of a tautogram in Armenian is a poem by Vanetsi with all words starting with \"Z\":<br>\nԶինված զինվորի՝ Զոհն էր զինվորը զինված\n<br><br>\nAnd another using the letter \"Sh\":<br>\nՇախմատամրցումը շահած <br>\nՇուշանագույն շքեղ <br>\nՇիֆոնե շրջազգեստով <br>\nՇառագույն շրթնաներկոտ շրթունքներով <br>\nՇշիկահեր շնորհալի Շենավանցի <br>\nՇքեղիրա՛ն շախմատիստուհի<br>\nՇողիկ Շաքարյանը <br>\nՇատ-շատ շնորհակալ <br>\nՇփոթվաց ու շոյված էր <br>\nՇրջապատող շատամարդ <br>\nՇնորհքով շախմատասերների <br>\nՇռայլ շնորհավորանքներից... <br>\n\nΤΥΦΛΟΣ ΤΑ Τ`ΩΤΑ ΤΟΝ ΤΕ ΝΟΥΝ ΤΑ Τ`ΑΜΜΑΤ`ΕΙ – Your ears and your mind are blind as your eyes.

Принял Петра Петровича почтеннейший папа Полины Павловны, Павел Пантелеймонович. «Пожалуйста, Пётр Петрович, присаживайтесь поудобнее», — проговорил папаша. Подошёл плешивенький племянник, представился: «Порфирий Платонович Поликарпов. Просим, просим».\n\nПоявилась прелестная Полина. Полные плечи прикрывал прозрачный персидский платок.

{"id": "595549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=595549", "title": "The Critic", "text": "The Critic\n\nThe Critic is an American prime time animated series revolving around the life of New York film critic Jay Sherman, voiced by actor Jon Lovitz. It was created by writing partners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously worked as writers and showrunners (seasons 3 and 4) on \"The Simpsons\". \"The Critic\" had 23 episodes produced, first broadcast on ABC in 1994, and finishing its original run on Fox in 1995. According to PopMatters, \"the creators [said] they intended the series as their 'love letter to New York.'\"\n\nEpisodes featured movie parodies with notable examples including a musical version of \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Howard Stern's End\" (\"Howards End\"), \"Honey, I Ate the Kids\" (\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids/The Silence of the Lambs\"), \"The Cockroach King\" (\"The Lion King\"), \"Abe Lincoln: Pet Detective\" (\"\"), \"Scent of a Jackass\" and \"Scent of a Wolfman\" (\"Scent of a Woman\"). The show often referenced popular movies such as \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" and \"The Godfather\", and routinely lampooned actor Marlon Brando and actor/director Orson Welles. They also spoofed Dudley Moore, usually as his character Arthur Bach from the 1981 film \"Arthur\".\n\nDespite the ratings improving, \"The Critic\" was cancelled after two seasons. It continued to air through reruns on Comedy Central and then on Locomotion. From February 1, 2000, to 2001, ten webisodes were later produced using Adobe Shockwave, and were broadcast on AtomFilms.com and Shockwave.com. In 2004, the DVD box set was released, which includes all 23 TV episodes (in their original production order) and the webisodes.\n\nIn the late 2000s, reruns of the show aired again on ReelzChannel in the US and on Teletoon's programming block Teletoon at Night in Canada. As of 2016, the first season can be viewed for free on Crackle.\n\nThe show follows the life of 36-year-old film critic from New York named Jay Prescott Sherman. His televised review show is called \"Coming Attractions\", which airs on the Philips Broadcasting cable network. He is often viewed in-universe as \"cold, mean-spirited, and elitist\". His signature line, upon seeing a terrible movie, is \"It stinks!\" Each episode is full of film references and parodies. Some of the secondary characters that are a part of Jay's story include his nutty adoptive father, his well-meaning son Marty, the Australian movie star Jeremy Hawke, Margo—the biological child of his adoptive parents, his snide make-up lady Doris, and his boss Duke Phillips. In the second season, Jay acquired a love interest—a Southern woman named Alice Tompkins, who later became his long-term girlfriend.\n\nThe show was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who along with James L. Brooks served as executive producers. \"The Critic\" was produced by Gracie Films in association with Columbia Pictures Television. The show's animation was done by Film Roman. It was co-produced by Patric Verrone.\n\nThe show sometimes included appearances of real life critics, such as Gene Shallit, Gene Siskel, and Roger Ebert, who provided their own voices. When choosing things to parody, Reiss and Jean made a conscious decision to find the right balance between current pop culture, and references that would stand the test of time.\n\n\"The Critic\" was \"the first major non-family sitcom animated program to appear in primetime.\" The show started out on ABC on January 26, 1994, where it aired 13 episodes. It was cancelled by the network after half a season, and was then moved onto Fox the following year where it ran for another ten episode season. Around this time, it was included in a \"shameless plug\" crossover with \"The Simpsons\" (in their episode \"A Star Is Burns\") and assumed the timeslot immediately after the show in the TV schedule, in an attempt to popularize it. But despite improvement of the ratings, Fox moved it to a different timeslot after five episodes, and also cancelled it after this run had finished airing in May 1995. According to \"The TV IV\", nine scripts were already written for the planned third season and the show was going to be moved to UPN, but an agreement was not reached. Also, Fox refused to officially cancel the show until much later. The show was not renewed on any network, and effectively became cancelled. The show returned in Flash-animated webisode form in 2000–2001, for a third season with 10 three- to five-minute installments.\n\nFour people have a design credit on the show: David Silverman, Rich Moore, David Cutler, and Everett Peck. Silverman designed the look of Jay Sherman. Moore and Cutler designed the general look of the show including some of the backgrounds and supporting cast. The character of Doris was based on Peck's drawings. Cutler helped in the hard task of standardizing all these animation styles. Moore was the supervising director, so oversaw a lot of the design process—and was also responsible for how the action would play out, and how each shot would be framed. Rich Moore explains \"the design of Jay Sherman began as a sketch done by David Silverman\" on a napkin/place-mat in a restaurant. He was designed as \"Kaufmanesque,\" and Jim Brooks liked the design, so his design remained much the same for the pilot episode. Moore had his reservations as the character had a \"flat head and tiny eyes that were hard to act with\", and was composed of shapes that were difficult to turn in a 3D space. It was decided the drawing encapsulated the humanity and reality of the critic, so was left unchanged. Over the course of the two seasons, however, the design was altered slightly. The flat head was made more round, and his eyes became bigger—in order to make Sherman more appealing and more easily animatable. The design team never intended to make the characters too cartoony as it would not have fit tonally with the type of show. The characters were designed via a general think-tank process of \"what do we like about the characters and what are we trying to say about them?\". Quick sketches were completed in front of the full creative team after a discussion about characters, which were then critically analysed. In particular, the design of the parents caused some issues. Jim Brooks described the father as a \"crazy wasp.\" The designs were eventually based on a photo of a professor and his wife. Moore explains that the animation should never \"step on the voices or the writing.\"\n\nJean and Reiss had a lot of trouble casting the voice for Margo, Jay's sister. Nancy Cartwright was eventually given the role. She used a voice very similar to her natural one. Christine Cavanaugh was cast as Marty. Duke Phillips, Jay's Ted Turner-esque boss was played by Charles Napier, using his real voice. Due to the sheer number of film and TV parodies, the team also sought character actors who could play many different roles. During the audition process, they asked them to perform their acts, which Reiss described as \"very entertaining.\" Maurice LaMarche impressed Jean by doing \"perfect\" impressions. LaMarche even beat out genuine Australians for the role of Australian actor Jeremy Hawke. He was often asked to work on his accent of a pop culture figure related to media just released or that would have been released by the time of the episode's airing. Depending on who could do the voice better, the characters were divided up between Nick Jameson and LaMarche. Each would play about 20–30 characters per show. According to LaMarche, he played twenty-seven characters in one episode. He specialized in impressions, while Jameson's specialty was accents and dialects.\n\n\"The A.V. Club\" explains \"in creating \"The Critic\", Al Jean and Mike Reiss set out to make the show as dissimilar from \"The Simpsons\" as humanly possible\". Nevertheless, there are many similarities between the two series. \"Gen X TV: The Brady Bunch to Melrose Place\" argues that \"The Critic\" became a critical success while other animated shows of the early 1990s flopped was because \"the makers of these shows failed to realize that \"The Simpsons\" didn't become a hit because of animation [but] because of its style of humor\", and says that \"The Critic\" understood this. It adds the show \"took the media-obsession/parody portions of \"The Simpsons\" and created separate show around them\". \"Planet Simpson\" describes the show as \"the closest thing \"The Simpsons\" ever had to a spin-off.\" \"The Critic\" also shares \"The Simpsons\" love for criticizing Fox and the audience, such as Jay's frequent line \"You're watching Fox, shame on you\" and \"\"The Critic\" will be right back, you TV-addicted couch monkeys\" before the show went to commercial break. \"The A.V. Club\" says \"\"The Critic\" made its protagonist the anti-Homer Simpson. Where Homer is a booze-sodden everyman, Jay Sherman is an unabashed elitist. Where Homer is a rudely physical creature, Jay leads a life of the mind. Homer is a slob. Jay is a snob.\" While \"Springfield is very aggressively and deliberately Anywhere, United States, \"The Critic\" is an extended Valentine to a certain kind of pointy-headed East Coast elitism.\" PopMatters said \"\"The Critic\"s humor is very much in the spirit of \"The Simpsons\", taken in a more brazenly surreal direction.\"\n\nMatt Groening had no part in its inception, and wanted to make this very clear, so he would not be associated with any success or failure the show would have. He claimed that in the public consciousness, this was his show—a direct spin-off to \"The Simpsons\".\n\nMany voice actors appear in both \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Critic\", and regulars on both shows have made cameos in the others. For example, Nancy Cartwright, Doris Grau, Tress MacNeille, Russi Taylor, and Jon Lovitz have all played primary/secondary characters on both shows. Maurice LaMarche, who played many characters on \"The Critic\", \"played George C. Scott getting hit in the groin with a football\" in the crossover episode. His only line was \"Ow, my groin.\" He also did Jay's belch in the episode.\n\nIn \"Dukerella\", Jay and Alice attend a costume ball dressed as Homer and Marge. Homer and Bart Simpson made a brief appearance in \"Dial M for Mother\". During an interview with Geraldo Rivera, Jay is asked about talking over the heads of his audience and does just that in his answer. An annoyed family watching changes the channel to \"The Simpsons\", where Homer—after stepping on a rake—exclaims, \"D'oh!\" and Bart replies, \"Ay caramba!\" The family's father comments, \"Now, this I understand.\" This can be seen as a suggestion that \"The Simpsons\" is relatively low-brow.\n\nIn \"A Star Is Burns\", Jay makes a guest appearance on \"The Simpsons\" presiding over a local film festival. When Jay enters the Simpson household, Bart is watching a \"Flintstones\"-\"Jetsons\" crossover show, which he criticizes; he then praises Jay and \"Coming Attractions\"/\"The Critic\", before shuddering and saying to himself \"I feel so \"dirty\".\" At the end of the episode, as he is leaving for New York, Jay offers the Simpsons to appear on \"Coming Attractions\"/\"The Critic\", but Bart declines, saying, \"Nah, we're not going to be doing that.\" Jay has yellow skin when he appears on \"The Simpsons\" but pink skin on \"The Critic\". This episode caused some conflict between \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening and executive producer James L. Brooks. Groening decided to take his name off the credits and did not appear in the DVD commentary. He publicly complained about the episode, which went to air in the end. He said \"for more than six months I tried to convince Jim Brooks and everyone connected with the show not to do such a cynical thing, which would surely be perceived by the fans as nothing more than a pathetic attempt to...advertise \"The Critic\" at the expense of the integrity of \"The Simpsons\".\" In response, Brooks said \"[Groening] is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten. And, it's not pretty when a rich man acts like this.\"\n\nJay appeared briefly on \"The Simpsons\" a few more times. In the episode \"Hurricane Neddy,\" he was in an insane asylum apparently unable to say anything more than his catchphrase (Doctor: \"Yes, Mr. Sherman. \"Everything\" stinks.\") In the episode \"The Ziff Who Came to Dinner,\" he is seen at Moe's Tavern with all the other characters on the show that Lovitz voices or has voiced.\n\nMuch like the opening sequence in \"The Simpsons\" with its chalkboard, sax solo, and couch gags, \"The Critic\" has a distinctive opening sequence featuring minor gags. Jay is always awakened by a disquieting phone call or radio news report, and eventually watches a clip that parodies a well-known movie before delivering the same negative opinion: \"It stinks!\" He watches the closing credits in a movie theater and delivers a comeback line to an usher who tells him the show is over.\n\nOne of the main elements featured on \"The Critic\" is the lampooning of the entertainment industry. \"The A.V. Club\" explains \"Mike Reiss and Al Jean-written episodes of \"The Simpsons\" are often defined by a high number of parodies, spoofs and homages. In their episodes, the Simpsons are always watching television or going to the movies. They didn't need any such excuse for film parodies on \"The Critic\" since Jay's life was inherently and organically filled with film. It proved the perfect delivery system for an endless series of clever, bite-sized spoofs.\" The book \"I'm an English Major--Now What?\" epitomises this by recounting a scene where Jay is forced to rate movies \"on a scale of good to excellent\"—thereby negating his credibility as a film critic. Sherman says \"but what if I won't like something,\" to which his boss Duke replies, \"That's what good is for.\" This shows the corruption of an industry that aims to provide unbiased thoughtful analyses of films, due to bribery and politics. Another example is in the June 22 episode \"L.A. Jay,\" where after trying to break into the movie business by writing a script, which is revealed to be rather good, a studio buys it off him for $100,000 in order to bury it, thereby keeping quality out of the industry. While episodes typically dealt with his private life, Jay's position as a film critic \"offer[ed] numerous opportunities for the show to satirize the film industry, establishing a dialogue with popular culture\" in a very similar way to what \"The Simpsons\" had already been doing for years.\n\n\"The Critic\" often made fun of celebrities, sometimes in rather mean-spirited ways. \"Drawn to Television\" cites the fat jokes directed at Marlon Brando or Orson Welles. \"The Critic\" also frequently comments on television. For example, one episode criticizes a character's project to colorize a series of classic black-and-white films for broadcast on a cable channel. The process involves making the films \"more attractive to a contemporary audience\" by \"inserting computer-generated happy endings.\" The article \"Ten Frighteningly Prophetic Parodies from ‘The Critic'\" explores the show's spoofs that \"have come true (or close to true), proving that there really isn't anything that's too stupid for Hollywood to make\"—an almost meta-satirical statement in that things that the writer thought were too ridiculous to be true at the time, ended up coming to fruition.\n\nGrabBagCinema said, \"What was great about this show, was that it always knew how to make you laugh and poke fun at celebrities, and their movies. It was so well written because it really understood movies, celebrities, Hollywood and humour. If you weren't a movie buff, you probably couldn't appreciate it or enjoy it. But if you were, you understood the references and saw the effort the writers and animators put in, to recapture the movies you grew up loving and remembering... but they did it with clever humour that wouldn't offend you. But the best element of this show was that Jay Sherman would review films honestly. And even though he loved classic cinema and original story telling, he would still be honest and say he didn't like it. It's just a shame real life critics and reviewers cannot do the same.\"\n\n\"The Critic\" originally received mixed to positive reviews when it first aired. In 1994, The \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave a typical review of the show with, \"Jay Sherman, the eponymous culture vulture of \"The Critic\", would undoubtedly say his new animated comedy on ABC 'stinks.' Fortunately for him [The Critic] smells pretty good to me.\" The show has since developed a cult following, with much of it coming through the show's weekend reruns on Comedy Central up until about 2005.\n\nThe DVD set also got many positive reviews, such as one from Animated Views (which gave it an overall rating of 10/10), and on TV.com where the series has a user rating of 8.5 based on 625 votes. Mike Reiss's favourite episode is the Siskel and Ebert one.\n\nIn September 2006, IGN ranked \"The Critic\" 9th in their list of the \"Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time\". In January 2009, they ranked the show 26th in their other list of the \"Top 100 Best Animated TV Series\". In the latter article, IGN said: \"Of all the projects completed by ex-Saturday Night Live players, \"The Critic\" is the most fully realized, hilarious and heartwarming. It took its cues from Woody Allen movies like \"Annie Hall\" and \"Manhattan\", and offered up a style of random abstract humor that wouldn't really be seen again until \"Family Guy.\"\" In December 2011, \"Complex\" ranked the show 6th in their list of \"The 25 Most Underrated Animated TV Shows Of All Time\".\n\n\"People\" magazine gave it a B, saying \"This animated series is slyly amusing when sticking it to showbiz, taking sarcastic swipes at everyone from Steven Seagal to Gene Shalit. At its best, it's still several strides behind the savage, protean wit of \"The Simpsons\", and the humor sputters when the focus is personal.\" Of the third season, IGN said \"I was thrilled to find out that Gracie Films has started producing new episodes of the cancelled ABC/Fox/Comedy Central show \"The Critic\"—and for web cartoons that don't depend on the violence/swear cop-out for the humor, the shows are actually really well produced.\"\n\nEarly on in its run, \"Siskel and Ebert\" did a review of the show. It was the only television series they ever reviewed. Some of the criticisms they provided, if left unattended to, may have been factors to the show's cancellation. They said the show doesn't have as many memorable characters as \"The Simpsons\", and encouraged the writers to work on that. They said the second episode was a let down because \"it didn't seem to be about the world of a movie critic,\" and was instead about \"a single dad and his geeky son.\" They said the jokes involving Jay's dad get tiresome, and that the station boss isn't as sharp a parody as he could be. Gene Siskel said, \"if \"The Critic\" is gonna succeed—and I hope it does—it desperately needs to refocus itself on the movies and the way critics interact with them.\" He added that the show needs a second critic, and jokingly said he and Roger Ebert should (and would love to) save the show by writing scripts for them. Ebert said the show should have 2 to 3 movie/genre parodies per episode. He added he would like to see Jay watch television to allow the show to satirize that medium as well. This would focus the show on the media, and not let it become another show about a man and his problems. Siskel said the writers should keep Jay as a smart critic. Regardless of his personality, if his critiques are witty and intelligent, by extension the show's satire becomes much sharper.\n\nAOL TV published an article in 2009 entitled \"Gone Too Soon: The Critic\", in which they analyzed the cancellation of the show. It said \"The creators and Lovitz seem to [care about the show], as there are always talks cropping up of a revival of \"The Critic\", either as an animated project, or possibly a live-action one. There are fan sites out there, but as time passes with no new material, many of these are becoming floating time capsules\". Plus, a lot of effort was put into the release of the DVD (for which there was a lot of demand), meaning there is still a fan base as well as a passionate cast and crew.\n\n\"Drawn to Television\" says that like Jay's show-within-a-show Coming Attractions, \"audiences never quite warmed up to Sherman and his surrounding cast of characters\" in \"The Critic\", perhaps due to the lack of warmth between character interactions in both shows. The book \"The Magic Behind the Voices\" put its cancellation down to \"so-so ratings and network politics.\" \"Planet Simpson\" says it \"failed to click with Simpsons fans.\" In 1994, Austin American-Statesman said \"\"The Critic\" never had a prayer on ABC, where the comedy overload consists of domestic sitcoms\". The show is generally considered one of the great TV shows cancelled too early into its run. The \"Columbia Spectator\" said the show was \"one of television's great lost causes.\" Voice actor Maurice LaMarche considered \"The Critic\" one of his \"personal favorites,\" saying \"I would almost give anything to bring back \"The Critic\", along with \"Pinky and the Brain\"; those are the two most satisfying jobs I've ever had.\" Ogeeku said \"This show did not last as long as it should have and that is truly a shame. \"The Critic\" was in its time, one of the greatest animated shows ever made and one of the funniest shows period on television.\" Reiss thinks the show holds up very well.\n\nPopMatters said \"The animated Jay Sherman...is perfect for Lovitz. He may never find anything in live action that serves him quite so well. I don't mean that as a dig at his comic abilities (or his looks); it's just that Sherman is an ideal outlet for the actor's ham.\" It said the cartoon format allows for \"his two biggest strengths as a performer: sarcasm and ironic overacting.\" It added \"A marriage of voice-acting, writing, and animation that rivals some of the best Pixar work, Sherman is nonetheless hampered occasionally by the writers' over-sampling from the Homer Simpson playbook, mainly gags concerning Jay's girth and accompanying appetites. More effectively.\" PopMatters said \"when it originally aired...the series was (for better or worse) slightly ahead of its time, outlandish in a way that \"The Simpsons\" would not adopt until later. Rewatching it now, \"The Critic\" seems most similar stylistically to the more recent series \"Family Guy\", with its frequent cutaway gags...and blurring of fantasy and reality. \"The Simpsons\" introduced these qualities in moderation; \"The Critic\" and \"Family Guy\" are addicted to them, sometimes to a crippling degree.\" It explained that \"The reference-heavy, media-saturated, sketch-like structure works better for \"The Critic\" than \"Family Guy\", though, because the former is less in love with itself and its desire to shock or offend. Indeed, it's more strange than twisted, Unlike \"Family Guy\", it has a frame of reference beyond television, beyond even its self-created film niche.\" It adds that \"The satire isn't always as biting as it could be; many of the movie parodies eschew real critique in favor of non sequiturs or homage. Too often the writers rely on audience familiarity with popular movies. It's amusing to be sure, but rarely as deadpan hilarious as \"The Simpsons\" parade of fabricated Troy McClure B-movies.\"\n\nResponding to the successful DVD sales of \"Family Guy\" and \"The Simpsons\", Sony Pictures Home Entertainment decided to release \"The Critic\" on DVD on January 27, 2004, including the two regular seasons and the webisodes. The show achieved good sales, jumping onto the DVD list at 14 on Amazon, and quickly going through five issuings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27480647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27480647", "title": "Turkeys voting for Christmas", "text": "Turkeys voting for Christmas\n\nTurkeys voting for Christmas is an English idiom used as a metaphor or simile (in the construct \"like turkeys voting for Christmas\") in reference to an apparently suicidal (\"death-wish\") choice, especially a political vote against one's self-interest. In modern times, in the United Kingdom, turkeys are commonly eaten as part of the English Christmas dinner. Since 1573 they have been available in the UK at Christmas.\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations\" writes that a commentator in the \"Independent Magazine\" traced the origin of the phrase to British Liberal Party politician David Penhaligon, who is quoted as saying: \"Us voting for the Pact is like a turkey voting for Christmas\" in reference to the 1977 Lib-Lab Pact which he opposed.\n\nThe phrase was soon borrowed by other politicians and public figures. In 1979 Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan was faced with a vote of no confidence called by Scottish nationalists, who were upset with Labour's treatment of a recent Scottish devolution referendum. In the resulting vote the Scottish nationalists sided with the Conservative opposition against the Labour government, despite the fact that the Conservatives opposed devolution. During his speech, Callaghan stated that \"If they win, there will be a general election. I am told that the current joke going around the House is that it is the first time in recorded history that turkeys have been known to vote for an early Christmas.\" The Scottish National Party ultimately lost most of its representation in the resulting election.\n\nin 2000 British MP Teresa Gorman, who opposed the Maastricht Treaty, stated; \"If the House of Commons voted for Maastricht it would be like 651 turkeys voting for Christmas.\"\n\nA prominent anecdotal example was displayed in the UK in 2016, whereby areas which were net beneficiaries of EU subsidies voted by a majority to leave the EU and then campaigned to preserve their EU funding afterwards: for example, Cornwall.\n\nIn the United States, the phrases \"turkeys voting for Thanksgiving\" (that being the holiday when turkey is more commonly served) and \"chickens voting for Colonel Sanders\" are often used. In Canada, the story of Mouseland has mice voting for cats.\n\nA similar German idiom is \"Only the most stupid calves would vote for their butchers\" (\"Nur die dümmsten Kälber wählen ihre Metzger selber\"). Bertold Brecht alluded to it in his \"Kälbermarsch\" (\"March of the calves\", 1933), a parody of the Nazi anthem \"Horst Wessel Song\", which was included in his play \"Schweik in the Second World War\" (1943). A similar photomontage of John Heartfield shows Hitler as a butcher with a chicken and the caption \"Don't panic! He's a vegetarian.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4839663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4839663", "title": "VJing", "text": "VJing\n\nVJing (pronounced: \"VEE-JAY-ing\") is a broad designation for realtime visual performance. Characteristics of VJing are the creation or manipulation of imagery in realtime through technological mediation and for an audience, in synchronization to music. VJing often takes place at events such as concerts, nightclubs, music festivals and sometimes in combination with other performative arts. This results in a live multimedia performance that can include music, actors and dancers. The term VJing became popular in its association with MTV's Video Jockey but its origins date back to the New York club scene of the 70s. In both situations VJing is the manipulation or selection of visuals, the same way DJing is a selection and manipulation of audio.\n\nOne of the key elements in the practice of VJing is the realtime mix of content from a \"library of media\", on storage media such as VHS tapes or DVDs, video and still image files on computer hard drives, live camera input, or from computer generated visuals. In addition to the selection of media, VJing mostly implies realtime processing of the visual material. The term is also used to describe the performative use of generative software, although the word \"becomes dubious (...) since no video is being mixed\".\n\nHistorically, VJing gets its references from art forms that deal with the synesthetic experience of vision and sound. These historical references are shared with other live audiovisual art forms, such as Live Cinema, to include the camera obscura, the panorama and diorama, the magic lantern, color organ, and liquid light shows.\n\nThe color organ is a mechanism to make colors correspond to sound through mechanical and electromechanic means. Bainbridge Bishop, who contributed to the development of the color organ, was \"dominated with the idea of painting music\". In a book from 1893 that documents his work, Bishop states: \"I procured an organ, and experimented by building an attachment to the keys, which would play with different colored lights to correspond with the music of the instrument.\"\n\nBetween 1919 and 1927, Mary Hallock-Greenewalt, a piano soloist, created a new technological art form called \"Nourathar\", which means \"essence of light\" in Arabic. Her light music consisted of environmental color fields that produced a scale of light intensities and color. \"In place of a keyboard, the Sarabet had a console with graduated sliders and other controls, more like a modern mixing board. Lights could be adjusted directly via the sliders, through the use of a pedal, and with toggle switches that worked like individual keys.\"\nIn clubs and private events in the 1960s \"people used liquid-slides, disco balls and light projections on smoke to give the audience new sensations. Some of these experiments were linked to the music, but most of the time they functioned as decorations.\" These came to be known as \"liquid light shows\".\nFrom 1965 to 1966 in San Francisco, the visual shows by artist collectives such as The Joshua Light Show and the Brotherhood of Light accompanied The Grateful Dead concerts, which were inspired by the Beat generation—in particular the Merry Pranksters—and fueled by the \"expansion of consciousness\" from the Acid Tests.\n\nThe Exploding Plastic Inevitable, between 1966 and 1967, organized by Andy Warhol contributed to the fusion of music and visuals in a party context. \"The Exploding Party project examined the history of the party as an experimental artistic format, focusing in particular on music visualization - also in live contexts\" \n\nDuring the late 1970s video and music performance became more tightly integrated. At concerts, a few bands started to have regular film/video along with their music. Experimental film maker Tony Potts was considered an unofficial member of The Monochrome Set for his work on lighting design and film making for projections for live shows. Test Department initially worked with \"Bert\" Turnball as their resident visual artist, creating slideshows and film for live performances. The organization, Ministry of Power included collaborations with performance groups, traditional choirs and various political activists.\nIndustrial bands would perform in art contexts, as well as in concert halls, and often with video projections. Groups like Cabaret Voltaire started to use low cost video editing equipment to create their own time-based collages for their sound works. In their words, \"before [the use of video], you had to do collages on paper, but now you present them in rhythm—living time—in video.\" The film collages made by and for groups such as the Test Dept, Throbbing Gristle and San Francisco's Tuxedomoon became part of their live shows.\n\nAn example of mixing film with live performance is that of Public Image Ltd. at the Ritz Riot in 1981. This club, located on the East 9th St in New York, had a state of the art video projection system. It was used to show a combination of prerecorded and live video on the club's screen. PiL played behind this screen with lights rear projecting their shadows on to the screen. Expecting a more traditional rock show, the audience reacted by pelting the projection screen with beer bottles and eventually pulling down the screen.\n\nAn artist retreat in Owego New York called Experimental Television Center, founded in 1971, made contributions to the development of many artists by gathering the experimental hardware created by video art pioneers: Nam June Paik, Steve Rutt and Bill Etra, and made the equipment available to artists in an inviting setting for free experimentation. Many of the outcomes debuted at the nightclub Hurrah which quickly became a new alternative for video artists who could not get their avant garde productions aired on regular broadcast outlets. Similarly, music video development was happening in other major cities around the world, providing an alternative to mainstream television.\n\nThe Dan Sandin Image Processor, or \"IP,\" is an analog video processor with video signals sent through processing modules that route to an output color encoder. The IP's most unique attribute is its non-commercial philosophy, emphasizing a public access to processing methods and the machines that assist in generating the images. The IP was Sandin's electronic expression for a culture that would \"learn to use High-Tech machines for personal, aesthetic, religious, intuitive, comprehensive, and exploratory growth.\" This educational goal was supplemented with a \"distribution religion\" that enabled video artists, and not-for-profit groups, to \"roll-your-own\" video synthesizer for only the cost of parts and the sweat and labor it took to build it. It was the \"Heathkit\" of video art tools, with a full building plan spelled out, including electronic schematics and mechanical assembly information. Tips on soldering, procuring electronic parts and Printed Circuit boards, were also included in the documentation, increasing the chances of successfully building a working version of the video synthesizer.\n\nIn May 1980, multi media artist / filmmaker Merrill Aldighieri was invited to screen a film at the nightclub Hurrah. At this time, music video clips did not exist in large quantity and the video installation was used to present an occasional film. To bring the role of visuals to an equal level with the DJ's music, Merrill made a large body of ambient visuals that could be combined in real time to interpret the music. Working alongside the DJ, this collection of raw visuals was mixed in real time to create a non-stop visual interpretation of the music. Merrill became the world's first full-time VJ. MTV founders came to this club and Merrill introduced them to the term and the role of \"VJ\",inspiring them to have VJ hosts on their channel the following year. Merrill collaborated with many musicians at the club, notably with electronic musician Richard Bone to make the first ambient music video album titled \"Emerging Video\". Thanks to a grant from the Experimental Television Center, her blend of video and 16 mm film bore the influential mark of the unique Rutt Etra and Paik synthesizers. This film was offered on VHS through \"High Times Magazine\" and was featured in the club programming. Her next foray into the home video audience was in collaboration with the newly formed arm of Sony, Sony HOME VIDEO, where she introduced the concept of \"breaking music on video\" with her series DANSPAK. With a few exceptions like the Jim Carrol Band with Lou Reed and Man Parrish, this series featured unknown bands, many of them unsigned.\n\nThe rise of electronic music (especially in house and techno genres) and DJ club culture provided more opportunities for artists to create live visuals at events. The popularity of MTV lead to greater and better production of music videos for both broadcast and VHS, and many clubs began to show music videos as part of entertainment and atmosphere.\n\nJoe Shannahan (owner of Metro in 1989-1990) was paying artists for video content on VHS. Part of the evening they would play MTV music videos and part of the evening they would run mixes from local artists Shanahan had commissioned.\n\nMedusa's (an all-ages bar in Chicago) incorporated visuals as part of their nightly art performances throughout the early to mid 80s (1983–85). Also in Chicago during the mid-80s was Smart Bar, where Metro held \"Video Metro\" every Saturday night.\n\nIn the 1980s the development of relatively cheap transistor and integrated circuit technology allowed the development of digital video effects hardware at a price within reach of individual VJs and nightclub owners.\n\nOne of the first commercially distributed video synthesizers available in 1981 was the CEL Electronics Chromascope sold for use in the developing nightclub scene. The Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI), first produced in 1983, was revolutionary in this area, allowing complex digital effects to be applied in real time to video sources. The CVI became popular amongst television and music video producers and features in a number of music videos from the period. The Commodore Amiga introduced in 1985 made a breakthrough in accessibility for home computers and developed the first computer animation programs for 2D and 3D animation that could produce broadcast results on a desktop computer.\n\nA number of recorded works begin to be published in the 1990s to further distribute the work of VJs, such as the Xmix compilations (beginning in 1993), Future Sound of London's \"Lifeforms\"(VHS, 1994), Emergency Broadcast Network's \"Telecommunication Breakdown\" (VHS, 1995), Coldcut and Hexstatic's \"Timber\" (VHS, 1997 and then later on CDRom including a copy of VJamm VJ software), the \"Mego Videos\" compilation of works from 1996-1998 (VHS/PAL, 1999) and Addictive TV's 1998 television series \"Transambient\" for the UK's Channel 4 (and DVD release).\n\nIn the United States, the emergence of the rave scene is perhaps to be credited for the shift of the VJ scene from nightclubs into underground parties. From around 1991 until 1994, Mark Zero would do film loops at Chicago raves and house parties. One of the earliest large-scale Chicago raves was \"Massive New Years Eve Revolution\" in 1993, produced by Milwaukee's Drop Bass Network. It was a notable event as it featured the Optique Vid Tek (OVT) VJs on the bill. This event was followed by Psychosis, held on 3 April 1993, and headlined by Psychic TV, with visuals by OVT Visuals. In San Francisco Dimension 7 were a VJ collective working the early West Coast rave scene beginning in 1993. Between 1996 and 1998, Dimension 7 took projectors and lasers to the Burningman festival, creating immersive video installations on the Black Rock desert.\n\nIn the UK groups such as The Light Surgeons and Eikon were transforming clubs and rave events by combining the old techniques of liquid lightshows with layers of slide, film and video projections. In Bristol, Children of Technology emerged, pioneering interactive immersive environments stemming from co-founder Mike Godfrey's architectural thesis whilst at university during the 1980s. Children of Technology integrated their homegrown CGI animation and video texture library with output from the interactive Virtual Light Machine (VLM), the brainchild of Jeff Minter and Dave Japp, with output onto over 500 sq m of layered screens using high power video and laser projection within a dedicated lightshow. Their \"Ambient Theatre Lightshow\" first emerged at Glastonbury 93 and they also provided VJ visuals for the Shamen, who had just released their no 1. hit \"Ebeneezer Good\" at the festival. Invited musicians jammed in the Ambient Theatre Lightshow, using the VLM, within a prototype immersive environment. Children of Technology took interactive video concepts into a wide range of projects including show production for \"Obsession\" raves between 1993 and 1995, theatre, clubs, advertising, major stage shows and TV events. This included pioneering projects with 3D video / sound recording and performance, and major architectural projects in the late 1990s, where many media technology ideas were now taking hold. Another collective, \"Hex\" were working across a wide range of media - from computer games to art exhibitions - the group pioneered many new media hybrids, including live audiovisual jamming, computer-generated audio performances, and interactive collaborative instruments. This was the start of a trend which continues today with many VJs working beyond the club and dance party scene in areas such as installation art.\n\nThe Japanese book \"VJ2000\" (Daizaburo Harada, 1999) marked one of the earliest publications dedicated to discussing the practices of VJs.\n\nThe combination of the emerging rave scene, along with slightly more affordable video technology for home-entertainment systems, brought consumer products to become more widely used in artistic production. However, costs for these new types of video equipment were still high enough to be prohibitive for many artists.\n\nThere are three main factors that lead to the proliferation of the VJ scene in the 2000s:\n\n\nAs a result of these, the VJ scene saw an explosion of new artists and styles. These conditions also facilitated a sudden emergence of a less visible (but nonetheless strong) movement of artists who were creating algorithmic, generative visuals.\n\nThis decade saw video technology shift from being strictly for professional film and television studios to being accessible for the prosumer market (e.g. the wedding industry, church presentations, low-budget films, and community television productions). These mixers were quickly adopted by VJs as the core component of their performance setups. This is similar to the release of the Technics 1200 turntables, which were marketed towards homeowners desiring a more advanced home entertainment system, but were then appropriated by musicians and music enthusiasts for experimentation. Initially, video mixers were used to mix pre-prepared video material from VHSplayers and live camera sources, and later to add the new computer software outputs into their mix. The 90s saw the development of a number of digital video mixers such as Panasonic's WJ-MX50, WJ-MX12, and the Videonics MX-1.\n\nEarly desktop editing systems such as the NewTek Video Toaster for the Amiga computer were quickly put to use by VJs seeking to create visuals for the emerging rave scene, whilst software developers began to develop systems specifically designed for live visuals such as O'Wonder's \"Bitbopper\".\n\nThe first known software for VJs was Vujak - created in 1992 and written for the Mac by artist Brian Kane for use by the video art group he was part of - Emergency Broadcast Network, though it was not used in live performances. EBN used the EBN VideoSampler v2.3, developed by Mark Marinello and Greg Deocampo. \nIn the UK, Bristol's Children of Technology developed a dedicated immersive video lightshow using the Virtual Light Machine (VLM) called AVLS or Audio-Visual-Live-System during 1992 and 1993. The VLM was a custom built PC by video engineer Dave Japp using super-rare transputer chips and modified motherboards, programmed by Jeff Minter (Llamasoft & Virtual Light Co.). The VLM developed after Jeff's earlier Llamasoft Light Synthesiser programme. With VLM, DI's from live musicians or DJ's activated Jeff's algorithmic real-time video patterns, and this was real-time mixed using pansonic video mixers with CGI animation/VHS custom texture library and live camera video feedback. Children of Technology developed their own \"Video Light\" system, using hi-power and low-power video projection to generate real-time 3D beam effects, simultaneous with enormous surface and mapped projection. The VLM was used by the Shamen, The Orb, Primal Scream, Obsession, Peter Gabriel, Prince and many others between 1993 and 1996. A software version of the VLM was integrated into Atari's Jaguar console, in response to growing VJ interest. In the mid-90s, Audio reactive pure synthesis (as opposed to clip-based) software such as Cthugha and Bomb were influential. By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing software available, including generative visuals programs such as MooNSTER, Aestesis, and Advanced Visualization Studio, as well as video clip players such as FLxER, and VJamm.\n\nProgramming environments such as Max/MSP, Macromedia Director and later Quartz Composer started to become used by themselves and also to create VJing programs like VDMX or pixmix. These new software products and the dramatic increases in computer processing power over the decade meant that VJs were now regularly taking computers to gigs.\n\nThe new century has brought new dynamics to the practice of visual performance. To be a VJ previously had largely meant a process of self-invention in isolation from others: the term was not widely known. Then through the rise of internet adoption, having access to other practitioners very became the norm, and virtual communities quickly formed. The sense of collective then translated from the virtual world onto physical spaces. This becomes apparent through the numerous festivals that emerge all over Europe with strong focus on VJing.\n\nThe VideA festival in Barcelona ran from 2000 - 2005., AVIT, clear in its inception as the online community of VJCentral.com self-organising a physical presence, had its first festival in Leeds (2002), followed by Chicago (2003), Brighton (2003), San Francisco (2004), and Birmingham (2005), 320x240 in Croatia (2003), Contact Europe in Berlin (2003). Also the Cimatics festival in Brussels should be credited as a pioneering event, with a first festival edition in 2002 completely dedicated to VJing. In 2003, the Finnish media arts festival PixelAche was dedicated to the topic of VJing, while in 2003, Berlin's Chaos Computer Club started a collaboration with AVIT organisers that featured VJ Camps and Congress strands. LPM - Live Performers Meeting was born in Rome in 2004 with the aim to answer to the need for creating a space-temporal referential field where to meet, know each other and share VJing related experiences. LPM has become an international meeting dedicated to artists, professionals and passionates of VJing, visual and live video performance. Also around this time (in 2005 and 2007) UK artists Addictive TV teamed up with the British Film Institute to produce Optronica, a crossover event showcasing audiovisual performances at the London IMAX cinema and BFI Southbank.\n\nTwo festivals entirely dedicated to VJing, Mapping Festival in Geneva and Vision'R in Paris, held their first edition in 2005. As these festivals emerged that prominently featured VJs as headline acts (or the entire focus of the festival), the rave festival scene also began to regularly include VJs in their main stage lineups with varying degrees of prominence.\n\nThe MUTEK festival (2000–present) in Montréal regularly featured VJs alongside experimental sound art performances, and later the Elektra Festival (2008–present) also emerged in Montréal and featured many VJ performances. In Perth, Australia, the Byte Me! festival (2007) showed the work of many VJs from the Pacific Rim area alongside new media theorists and design practitioners.\n\nWith lesser funding, the US scene has been host to more workshops and salons than festivals. Between 2000-2006, Grant Davis (VJ Culture) and Jon Schwark of Dimension 7 produced \"Video Salon\", a regular monthly gathering significant in helping establish and educate a strong VJ community in San Francisco, and attended by VJs across California and the United States. In addition, they produced an annual \"Video RIOT!\" (2003–2005) as a political statement following the R.A.V.E. Act (Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act) of 2003; a display of dissatisfaction by the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004; and in defiance of a San Francisco city ordinance limiting public gatherings in 2005.\n\nSeveral VJ battles and competitions began to emerge during this time period, such as Video Salon's \"SIGGRAPH VJ Battle\" in San Diego (2003), Videocake's \"AV Deathmatch\" series in Toronto (2006) and the \"VJ Contests\" at the Mapping Festival in Geneva (2009). These worked much like a traditional DJ battle where VJs would be given a set amount of time to show off their best mixes and were judged according to several criteria by a panel of judges.\n\nDatabases of visual content and promotional documentation became available on DVD formats and online through personal websites and through large databases, such as the \"Prelinger Archives\" on Archive.org. Many VJs began releasing digital video loop sets on various websites under Public Domain or Creative Commons licensing for other VJs to use in their mixes, such as Tom Bassford's \"Design of Signage\" collection (2006), Analog Recycling's \"79 VJ Loops\" (2006), VJzoo's \"Vintage Fairlight Clips\" (2007) and Mo Selle's \"57 V.2\" (2007).\n\nPromotional and content based DVDs began to emerge, such as the works from the UK's ITV1 television series Mixmasters (2000–2005) produced by Addictive TV, Lightrhythm Visuals (2003), Visomat Inc. (2002), and Pixdisc, all of which focused on the visual creators, VJ styles and techniques. These were then later followed by NOTV, Atmospherix, and other labels. Mia Makela curated a DVD collection for Mediateca of Caixa Forum called \"LIVE CINEMA\" in 2007, focusing on the emerging sister practice of \"live cinema\". Individual VJs and collectives also published DVDs and CD-ROMs of their work, including Eclectic Method's bootleg video mix (2002) and Eclectic Method's \"We're Not VJs\" (2005), as well as eyewash's \"DVD2\" (2004) and their \"DVD3\" (2008).\n\nBooks reflecting on the history, technical aspects, and theoretical issues began to appear, such as \"The VJ Book: Inspirations and Practical Advice for Live Visuals Performance\" (Paul Spinrad, 2005), \"VJ: Audio-Visual Art and VJ Culture\" (Michael Faulkner and D-Fuse, 2006), \"vE-jA: Art + Technology of Live Audio-Video\" (Xárene Eskandar [ed], 2006), and \"VJ: Live Cinema Unraveled\" (Tim Jaeger, 2006). The subject of VJ-DJ collaboration also started to become a subject of interest for those studying in the field of academic human–computer interaction (HCI).\n\nThe availability and affordability of new consumer-level technology allowed many more people to get involved into VJing. The dramatic increase in computer processing power that became available facilitated more compact, yet often more complex setups, sometimes allowing VJs to bypass using a video mixer, using powerful computers running VJ software to control their mixing instead. However, many VJs continue to use video mixers with multiple sources, which allows flexibility for a wide range of input devices and a level of security against computer crashes or slowdowns in video playback due to overloading the CPU of computers due to the demanding nature of realtime video processing.\n\nToday's VJs have a wide choice of off the shelf hardware products, covering every aspect of visuals performance, including video sample playback (Korg Kaptivator), real-time video effects (Korg Entrancer) and 3D visual generation.\n\nThe widespread use of DVDs gave initiative for scratchable DVD players.\n\nMany new models of MIDI controllers became available during the 2000s, which allow VJs to use controllers based on physical knobs, dials, and sliders, rather than interact primarily with the mouse/keyboard computer interface.\n\nThere are also many VJs working with experimental approaches to working with live video. Open source graphical programming environments (such as Pure Data) are often used to create custom software interfaces for performances, or to connect experimental devices to their computer for processing live data (for example, the IBVA EEG-reading brainwave unit, the Arduino microprocessor, or circuit bending children's toys).\n\nThe second half of this decade also saw a dramatic increase in display configurations being deployed, including widescreen canvases, multiple projections and video mapped onto the architectural form. This shift has been underlined by the transition from broadcast based technology - fixed until this decade firmly in the 4x3 aspect ratio specifications NTSC and PAL - to computer industry technology, where the varied needs of office presentation, immersive gaming and corporate video presentation have led to diversity and abundance in methods of output. Compared to the ~640x480i fixed format of NTSC/PAL, a contemporary laptop using DVI can output a great variety of resolutions up to ~2500px wide, and in conjunction with the Matrox TripleHead2Go can feed three different displays with an image coordinated across them all.\n\nA significant aspect of VJing is the use of technology, be it the re-appropriation of existing technologies meant for other fields, or the creation of new and specific ones for the purpose of live performance. The advent of video is a defining moment for the formation of the VJ (video jockey).\n\nOften using a video mixer, VJs blend and superimpose various video sources into a live motion composition. In recent years, electronic musical instrument makers have begun to make specialty equipment for VJing.\n\nVJing developed initially by performers using video hardware such as videocameras, video decks and monitors to transmit improvised performances with live input from cameras and even broadcast TV mixed with pre-recorded elements. This tradition lives on with many VJs using a wide range of hardware and software available commercially or custom made for and by the VJs.\n\nVJ hardware can be split into categories -\n\nThere are many types of software a VJ may use in their work, traditional NLE production tools such as Adobe Premiere, After Effects, and Apple's Final Cut Pro are used to create content for VJ shows. Specialist performance software is used by VJs to play back and manipulate video in realtime.\n\nVJ performance software is highly diverse, and include software which allows a computer to replace the role of an analog video mixer and output video across extended canvasses composed of multiple screens or projectors. Small companies producing dedicated VJ software such as Modul8 and Magic give VJs a sophisticated interface for realtime processing of multiple layers of video clips combined with live camera inputs, giving VJs a complete off the shelf solution so they can simply load in the content and perform. Some popular titles which emerged during the 2000s include Resolume, NuVJ.\n\nSome VJs prefer to develop software themselves specifically to suit their own performance style. Graphical programming environments such as Max/MSP/Jitter, Isadora, and Pure Data have developed to facilitate rapid development of such custom software without needing years of coding experience.\n\nThere are many types of configurations of hardware and software that a VJ may use to perform.\n\nSeveral research projects have been dedicated to the documentation and study of VJing from the reflective and theoretical point of view. In the Netherlands Media Art Institute, Montevideo / Time Based Arts, Annet Dekker organized a research on the subject called \"VJ Cultuur – a state of flux\". Dekker wrote widely on the history of VJing and its contextualization within the club culture. In the same year, 2005, \"VJ Theory\" began publishing texts written by practitioners and academics, and organizing collective discussions online and offline around subjects related to VJing and audiovisual performative practices.\nBetween 2005 and 2006 several books were published with interviews, showcasing works and related artists, providing an overview of the current practice.\n\nRound tables, talks, presentations and discussions are part of festivals and conferences related to new media art, such as ISEA and Ars Electronica for example, as well as specifically related to VJing, as is the case of the Mapping Festival. Exchange of ideas through dialogue contributed to the shift of the discussion from issues related to the practicalities of production to more complex ideas and to the process and the concept. Subjects related to VJing are, but not exclusively: identity and persona (individual and collective), the moment as art, audience participation, authorship, networks, collaboration and narrative.\nThrough collaborative projects, visual live performance shift to a field of interdisciplinary practices.\n\nPeriodical publications, online and printed, launched special issues on VJing. This is the case of AMinima printed magazine, with a special issue on Live Cinema (which features works by VJs), and Vague Terrain (an online new media journal), with the issue The Rise of the VJ.\n\n\n"}
