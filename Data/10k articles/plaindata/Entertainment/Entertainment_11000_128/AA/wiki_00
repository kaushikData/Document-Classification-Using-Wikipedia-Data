Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) have been responsible for the selection process of their participants, since their debut in 2014. Xhoi Bejko was the first representative for Albania at the Turkvision Song Contest 2014 with the song \"Hava ve Ates\", which failed to qualify from the semifinals, finishing in nineteenth place and achieving one-hundred and fifty-four points. Albania continued to participate in the contest, and sent Xhoi Bejko and Visar Rexhepi as their representatives in the Turkvision Song Contest 2015, with the song \"Adi Hasret\", which finished in eighth place, receiving the same total of points as in their previous participation.\n\nTurkvision is an annual song contest which was created by TÜRKSOY in cooperation with the Turkish music channel TMB TV. Based on the similar format of the Eurovision Song Contest, Turkvision focuses primarily on participating Turkic countries and regions. The participating countries and regions have to take part in the Semi Final. A juror from each nation awards between 1 and 10 points for every entry, except their own. An amount of 12 to 15 nations qualify for the Grand Final where the jury determines the winner. TÜRKSOY has stated that televoting is going to be introduced in the future. Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest in which the winning country proceeds to host the following year's event, hosting of the Turkvision Song Contest takes place in the country or region that is also hosting the Turkish Capital of Culture.\n\nOn 25 September 2014 it was confirmed that Albania would make their official debut at the 2014 Song Contest to be held in Kazan, Tatarstan. For a short period of time it appeared that Albania had withdrawn from the contest, the official website Turkvizyon.tv removed all mention of Albania from their website. On 12 November 2014 it was confirmed by Xhoi that she was still participating and that she would be singing \"Zjarr Dhe Ajer\", the song was later partially translated into Turkish for the contest. She finished in nineteenth place, achieving a score of 154 points, and therefore failed to qualify for the grand final.\n\nAs the official website published the preliminary participants list for 2015, Albania was not among them, on 7 November 2015 it was confirmed that Albania would participate in the contest for a second year, it was announced that Xhoi Bejko and Visar Rexhepi would represent Albania in Istanbul.

{"id": "6551560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6551560", "title": "Barricade (Transformers)", "text": "Barricade (Transformers)\n\nBarricade is the name of four fictional characters in the various Transformers series in the Transformers franchise.\n\nBarricade first featured in 1990 as part of a Decepticon race track patrol team, his vehicle mode being a Formula One racing car.\n\nBarricade learned how to take care of himself while running with Cybertron's most vicious racing gangs, and he brings that same brutal edge to his position as leader of the Race Track Patrol. His troops know that the slightest mistake will result in a merciless dressing down in front of the others, and they strive to meet his exacting standards. His hard-nosed, abusive leadership style does not do much for morale, but he figures it's for their own good.\n\nBarricade is the commander of the team and pushes the other members. His only fictional appearance is in the Dreamwave comics Micromaster series.\n\nOriginally named \"Runner\", Barricade was created as part of a cross-factional experiment in which new Micromasters were allowed to function as neutrals, and to choose their own affiliations. Barricade quickly saw the potential rewards of joining the Decepticons, and earned the new moniker \"Barricade\" in recognition of his blockade-running taction.\n\nBarricade was among the Micromasters who appeared in \": Hardhead\" who attacked Nightbeat and Hardhead on the planet Gorlam Prime.\n\nA second Barricade was made in the Transformers Energon series as the leader of the team that formed the body of Bruticus Maximus (Bruticus in Japan), his vehicle being a missile truck.\n\nThe animated series does not refer to any of the components by name - in it, only the central body is intelligent, and the limbs are drones. The five robots transform only from vehicle mode into combined mode, never into their individual robot forms (apart from one out-of-continuity episode).\n\nBruticus Maximus was one of four combining Transformers sealed away in stasis beneath the surface of Cybertron to guard a hidden reservoir of Super Energon. Megatron, guided by Unicron, set out to search for it, and destroyed one of the immobile robots in his rage (strangely enough, a second Superion Maximus), only for the reservoir to then reveal itself. As the guardians awakened, Megatron immersed himself in the Super Energon to upgrade himself into Galvatron, and Bruticus Maximus and Constructicon Maximus immediately swore fealty to Galvatron as the one who had awoken them. However, their \"brother,\" Superion Maximus, refused, recognising Galvatron's evil and siding with the Autobots.\n\nBruticus Maximus added plenty of firepower to the Decepticons' side, and he and Constructicon Maximus had several clashes with the \"traitorous\" Superion Maximus, until the time for their final battle came, set against the backdrop of the struggle to stop the Unicron-possessed Galvatron out in space. Constructicon Maximus was deactivated by Superion Maximus, who then had his limbs destroyed by Bruticus Maximus, but transferred Constructicon Maximus's limbs to himself and used them to defeat Bruticus, along with a little help from the ghost of the \"brother\" Megatron had destroyed.\n\nAlthough the \"Transformers: Energon\" comic book series by Dreamwave Productions was canceled before Barricade could appear in them, the Energon \"More Than Meets The Eye\" guide book was under development at the time. Pencil art by Guido Guidi was released later showing the art that would have been used with Barricade's profile.\n\nIn the 2007 live-action movie, Barricade is a Decepticon scout who transforms into a Saleen S281E police car, making him similar in appearance to the \"Generation 1\" Autobot Prowl, who was actually in the first draft of the movie treatment before the writers thought that a Decepticon police car would be a better idea. He appears to be the rival of Bumblebee, standing at nearly the same height. He is a hunter/scout of the Decepticons, choosing his vehicle mode to easily hide among the humans as a symbol of authority. His persona appears to be that of the cliché \"bad cop\", as he fiercely interrogates Sam Witwicky once he locates him. He mainly elongates his arms to reveal spinning spikes known as the blade wheels in his hands and uses them as close-combat striking weapons. He also has a long chain with a wheel on the end that reveals a set of cybertanium blades which form a large blade wheel. In Dark of the Moon, he wields what looks to be a 50 mm chain gun. When in vehicle mode, he can simulate the appearance of a human driver, the same holographic model (referred to as \"Mustache Man\" on-set and in the credits) that \"pilots\" Blackout and Starscream.\n\nIn leaked versions of the script, this character was originally codenamed Brawl - he even appeared with his name on some of the concept art. The name was later changed to Barricade when the official list of Transformers appearing in the movie was released; the name Brawl would go to another Decepticon. His rear quarter reads \"\"To punish and enslave...\" a parody of the classic police slogan \"To Protect and Serve\"\". The front quarter police logos have the Decepticon symbol on them and the writing \"Pacis Quod Alcedonia\", Latin for \"Still, Halcyon Days of Peace\", and \"Incorporated since June 1865\".\n\nThe official guide to the \"Transformers\" video game says he's 16 feet tall. The \"Transformers U.K.\" magazine states he is 16 feet 3 inches tall, weighs 2.2 tons and has a maximum speed of 500 mph. An early interview with Michael Bay states that he is 18 feet tall. The deluxe toy suggests he is 19 feet tall at the shoulders.\n\nThe 2005 Saleen Mustang that turned into Barricade movie car was sold in 2009 at for $30,000 USD ($36,000 USD after premium) in Los Angeles Center Studios auction.\n\nBarricade's new vehicle mode used in was based on 2016 Ford Mustang. Barricade features a new form with an arm-mounted rotary-gun and a pair of knuckledusters with \"Punish\" and \"Enslave\" written on them, as a throwback to his original vehicle mode.\n\nBarricade is one of the major antagonists and a central Decepticon in the first film. He is the very first Transformer to speak English. He first appears picking up Frenzy after he collected information from Air Force One, and began hunting down Sam Witwicky to interrogate him about his great-great-grandfather's glasses (that have the location to the Allspark). After locating him, he threatened Sam, only for him to escape with his crush, Mikaela Banes in Bumblebee's Camaro vehicle-mode, and Barricade chased them. After the chase, Bumblebee transformed into his robot mode, and on arriving, Barricade attacked the Autobot. He then released Frenzy, to go after Sam and Mikaela while he battled Bumblebee. However, Barricade was not able to beat Bumblebee, winding up badly wounded. Eventually, he recovered from his wounds (as shown by the brief scene showing him as the first Decepticon responding to Starscream's call), and appeared later on during the highway chase scene, where Sam recognized him as \"the same cop\". Barricade disappeared in the middle of the highway chase scene. In the comic book and novelization, he is killed shortly after Optimus Prime's motorway battle with Bonecrusher while attacking Prime from behind.\n\nAlthough Barricade does not appear in the 2009 sequel film \"Revenge of the Fallen\", he did have toys in the film's toy line and appeared in the associated prequel novel and comic series.\n\nBarricade returned in \"\" in an extended cameo, when the Decepticons occupy Chicago. His disappearance and absence from the previous film is still unexplained. Barricade and several other Decepticons led by Shockwave and Soundwave captured the Autobots. When the Decepticons decided to execute the Autobots at the insistence of Dylan Gould, Barricade shoved Que (Wheeljack) forward, and a Decepticon Protoform mortally wounded the Autobot before Barricade finished him off. Before Soundwave could kill Bumblebee, Wheelie and Brains caused Decepticon fighters to crash down from a Decepticon battle-cruiser, causing a distraction and allowed Bumblebee and the other three captive Autobots to break free. Later, Barricade was seen working alongside Shockwave as his second-in-command. He is seen slapping around a few Decepticon Protoforms, apparently blaming them for Soundwave's death. Que was then avenged, when Barricade was then blinded by sniper shots to his eyes. He stumbled around in pain for a moment before being crippled by a Boomstick placed on his leg. Barricade collapsed to the ground, dropping his gun as he did. He then tried to crawl to safety but gets wounded as the humans shot him in the head and took out his fellow Decepticons.\n\nBarricade returned in \"\", having survived and being kept under surveillance for years since the battle of Chicago. Barricade is first seen spying on a war torn area of Chicago, discovering Cade Yeager who gained the talisman, in turn meaning Quintessa and Cybertron were approaching to the Earth. Barricade reported this back to Megatron, who demanded they find the talisman, and Barricade suggested they make a deal with the TRF. Barricade, along with the other Decepticons hunted down the Autobots, but Barricade was incapacitated by Grimlock and forced to retreat. Barricade later appeared in London, pursuing Bumblebee, Yeager and Viviane until Bumblebee blasted him, and collided with a truck. Barricade later joined with Megatron and Nitro Zeus at Stonehenge when they began helping Quintessa draining power from Earth/Unicron. Barricade fought back against the British military, but was not seen again presumed he is finally killed.\n\nBarricade returns in spin-off \"Bumblebee: The Movie\".\n\nBarricade first appears in the prequel novel \"\", serving as pilot of the \"Nemesis\". Here he is a vocal critic of Starscream's command, but is willing to tolerate his leadership if it means finding Megatron. He opposes Blackout's decision to attack the Autobots against Starscream's orders, but refuses to intervene when Blackout challenges Starscream, claiming that the outcome is obvious.\n\nThe \"Transformers\" novelization provides a scene that did not make the final cut of the film, where Barricade dies. From the novelization: \"There followed a flurry of furious action that ended only when Optimus flipped the machine clinging to him against a steel-and-cement freeway pillar. The impact cracked and bent the column. It did worse to Barricade, who lay twisted and unmoving.\"\n\nIn the children's book \"Transformers Prime Time\" by Michael Teitelbaum it is stated that Barricade is defeated by Optimus Prime.\n\nBarricade appears among the Decepticons loyal to Starscream in the book \"\" by Alan Dean Foster. He appears in Rome as part of a trap set by Starscream to kill Optimus Prime. Optimus questioned him as to why he was serving Starscream and he said because Megatron was dead. Thanks to assistance from the human N.E.S.T. members, Barricade was distracted long enough for Optimus to free himself from the trap and buried Barricade. In the next morning, the subway workers found a tunnel dug where Barricade had freed himself and escaped.\n\nBarricade appeared in the \"Transformers: Defiance\" comic series by IDW Publishing. In issue #3 Megatron learns that Optimus has broken into his room he sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but when the group is traveling to Megatron's location they are ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, Frenzy, Starscream, Skywarp and Thundercracker who have orders to kill them. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion.\n\nBarricade also appears in IDW Publishing's , where he, Starscream and Blackout smash up the Mars Beagle probe. In issue #4 he travels to Earth, gaining his police car alternate mode and destroying the original car, leaving no witnesses alive. The three Decepticons, detecting emissions similar to that of the Allspark, then stumble into Sector 7's trap for Bumblebee, wiping out their military backup. Sector Seven labels Barricade as NBE-3. While the Decepticons discover nothing from Blackout's scan of Sector 7's computers, Barricade proposes that they tail Bumblebee to see if he can lead them to the Allspark. With the plan approved, Barricade pretends to lose Bumblebee in chase, while the other two Decepticons tail him from the air.\n\nBarricade's death was depicted in the comic adaptation of the 2007 film. This was later retconned into Barricade being injured, but he recovers.\n\nHe also appears in the official movie sequel comic called \"\". In that story it is revealed that Barricade was forced into a bridge column by Ironhide during the battle on the highway, but had survived, heavily damaged. Starscream orders him to continue spying on the Autobots once he is repaired enough to function.\n\nIn \"\" a month after the battle at Mission City Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to a naval yard, but they are spied on by Barricade, who transmits the information to Starscream.\n\nBarricade appears in \"Transformers: Tales of the Fallen\" #1 where he kidnaps Sam in order to flush out Bumblebee and learn where the Allspark fragment is. Bumblebee saves Sam and fights Barricade, but Barricade escapes.\n\nIn \"Transformers: Rising Storm\" #2, Barricade is seen as part of Club Starscream, under Starscream's command.\n\nNote: Information in \"italics\" occur in the alternate storyline where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark.\n\nBarricade appears in issue #7 of the Transformers Titan Magazine in a story called \"Starscream's Militia\". Set shortly after the battle of Mission City, Barricade is seemingly brought to life by Starscream using the sparks of Allspark mutations. He is immediately killed again by the Autobots. It is unknown how this fits in with the official re-written continuity where Barricade never died.\n\n\"Barricade attacks Cincinnati in issue #23 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called \"Revolution Part 1.\"\"\n\nBarricade appears as a playable character in the Decepticon campaign, playable on the second and fourth levels. He first had to destroy all Autobot drones then rescue Frenzy from Sector 7 agents to learn information about the Allspark. After learning that a human named Sam Witwicky had a pair of spectacles with a Decepticon code printed on it telling them with the Allspark and Megatron's location. Then he encountered Bumblebee who was protecting Sam and the spectacles so they fought and Barricade killed Bumblebee and took the glasses. He later appeared in Mission City where Megatron told him to find Sam. When he finds Sam, he was being protected by Jazz, so Jazz and Barricade fought and Barricade killed Jazz. He appeared one last time in a cut scene at the end where Megatron is the ruler of Earth and ordered Barricade and the other Decepticons to exterminate the remainder of the human race.\n\nBarricade also appears twice in the Autobot campaign as a boss (being fought against in both battles by Bumblebee). He first attacked Sam to retrieve the glasses, only for Bumblebee to fight and wound him. He appeared again on the last mission of the fourth level, this time seeking the Allspark, but this time Bumblebee killed him. He would swing his arm unstoppably (like Longarm) and could only be stopped by throwing an object at him.\n\nIn the \"\" DS game, Barricade often works closely with Create-A-Bot and Blackout. He is played as or assisted in many missions, but he was eventually killed, along with Blackout, by the traitorous Starscream. In the Autobots version he was a boss twice (first with Bumblebee, second with Optimus having to protect Bumblebee) but dies by the Optimus-Bumblebee duo.\n\nBarricade is also playable in the \"\" DS game.\n\nBarricade is among the characters who appear in the \"TRANSFORMERS CVBERVERSE Battle Builder Game\".\n\nAll toys of this character are officially licensed from Saleen, Incorporated. In addition, all toys from \"Revenge of the Fallen\" onwards are licensed from the Ford Motor Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarricade appears in the novel \"Transformers: Exodus\".\n\nWhen Orion Pax comes to the Kaon Gladiator arena at Megatron's invitation, Barricade and Lugnut are standing guard of the Pit. Barricade is suspicious of Orion, and goes to check with Megatron, however even after he confirms Orion was invited, Barricade keeps an eye on the librarian.\n\nBarricade is a playable Decepticon character in the 2010 video game \"\". In the Decepticon campaign, he is one of 's henchmen. In PS3, Xbox 360 and PC versions Barricade is playable for the first chapter of the Decepticon campaign. He, along with Megatron and Brawl, infiltrate Starscream's orbital station in order to retrieve the power of the Dark Energon.\n\nThough not actually appearing in the sequel game, \"\", Barricade is mentioned in the loading sections, where it is revealed that he earned his name by driving through Autobot blockades.\n\nBarricade appears in the 2013 online game \"Transformers Universe\".\n\nBarricade also appears in the game \"\" as a playable character and can be only claimed in events and bundles.\n"}

As soon as a block is destroyed, it immediately go on the oponnent board, making his game even more difficult. \nTo make harder attacks, players can do combos, which are successions of blocks destruction (a dog eats a bone, which makes a rabbit eat a carrot, etc.). Best players can do X6 or X7 combos, which are called \"Epic combos\".\n\nThe main specificity of the game is its \"no pay-to-win\" and total equity system. Players receive the same blocks, in the same order, so that both opponents have the same chance to win.\n\n\"Bazoo\" is divided in three modes: classic ladders (local and world leaderboards), leagues (9 leagues with a promotion and relegation system) and tournaments, where players can create their own private tournament and reward the winners.\n\nThe character each player owns is a monkey, which can be customized through paid skins. Even if the monkey doesn't affect the game, it represents the identity of each player, who can use thousand of possible combinations to get his/her unique avatar.\n\nThe game was soft-launched worldwide for Android platforms on October, 2016.

In the episode, Bender changes into a female robot and adopts the name Coilette.\n\nWhile attending the Earth 3004 Olympic Games with the crew to see Hermes compete in the limbo event, Bender feels he should compete as well. However, feeling emasculated by the large male Olympic bending robots, he decides to pose as a fembot in order to compete. Competing as Coilette, he easily beats the female competitors, winning five gold medals. However, the medalists are called in for gender testing prior to the awards ceremony. Desperate, Bender has Professor Farnsworth give him a sex change, turning him into an authentic fembot.\n\nCoilette is invited to go on a late night talk show. Also appearing on the show is robot actor Calculon, who falls for Coilette instantly. The two start dating, which Coilette confides to the crew she is doing for the fame and valuable gifts Calculon sends her. Calculon proposes to Coilette. She accepts, scheming to get half his money with a divorce settlement.\n\nHowever, moved by Calculon's deep professions of love, Coilette finds that though she doesn't want to be his wife, she also does not want to hurt him with a divorce, and even openly weeps while telling the crew this. Professor Farnsworth concludes that Coilette's new emotionalism is due to her new female hormones taking over. Leela offers to help Coilette out under the condition that she reverse her sex change. She reasons that though there is no way for Coilette to get out of her predicament without hurting Calculon, a soap opera parting will hurt him least. At the wedding, Coilette, Leela, Zoidberg and Fry stage an elaborate scene that fakes Coilette's death. As promised, Bender returns to his male persona, and claims to have not been changed at all by the experience. However, under his breath he bids Calculon a emotional goodbye.\n\nThe opening scene at the Olympics was changed following the September 11 attacks. Several brief shots of various country representatives, including countries related to the terrorist attacks, were removed because the writing team did not want viewers to think that the episode was referencing the attacks. Similar minor changes were made to some other episodes in season four.\n\nThis episode was considered somewhat easier to animate than others because there were fewer spaceship scenes.\n\n\n"}

Both games include all of their respective downloadable content—such as campaigns and additional playable characters. \"Claptastic Voyage\"—a campaign for \"The Pre-Sequel\" that was released on the same day as \"The Handsome Collection\", is not included on-disc, but is a free download.\n\n\"Borderlands: The Handsome Collection\" received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites Metacritic gave the PlayStation 4 version 82/100 based on 49 reviews.\n\nIGN gave the compilation an 8.4 out of 10, praising the performance of its \"Borderlands 2\" port for being \"rock solid\". Some issues were noted, including that the inventory menu in four-player mode was not scaled to fit the smaller amount of screen space, \"The Pre-Sequel\" had inconsistent frame rates, and users are unable to switch between the two games without rebooting it entirely, concluding that \"Minor quibbles aside, \"The Handsome Collection\" is a great package for any console-bound \"Borderlands\" fan.\" \"GamesRadar\" was also positive, praising the extent of content available, but criticized minor framerate issues and that no significant new features were added.\n"}

Linda said that the tango crowd from Canberra wanted to dance with more people, and Karen from Sydney said the same about the Sydney scene. They both thought, \"why not bring the two crowds together?\" Figuring that a place geographically right in the middle would be ideal, Linda found Bundanoon as the perfect place.

BASH was first held in 2006.

{"id": "36405030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36405030", "title": "Cannon Fodder 3", "text": "Cannon Fodder 3\n\nCannon Fodder 3 is an action-strategy PC game developed and published – originally in Russia – by Game Factory Interactive (GFI), along with developer Burut CT. The game is the second sequel to \"Cannon Fodder\", a commercially and critically successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. Jon Hare and his company Sensible Software, the developers of \"Cannon Fodder\" and its prior sequel, were uninvolved with \"Cannon Fodder 3\". GFI instead licensed the intellectual property from now-owner Codemasters.\n\nThe game is a combination of action and strategy involving a small number of soldiers battling enemy terrorists. The protagonists are heavily outnumbered and easily killed. The player must rely on strategy and heavy secondary weapons to overcome enemies, their vehicles and installations.\n\n\"Cannon Fodder 3\" was released in Russia in December 2011 and – via download service GamersGate – Europe and North America on 9 February 2012, receiving mixed reviews. Reviewers found the game to be enjoyable but limited and repetitive. The graphics and humour received both positive and negative criticism. Critics derided the poor English translations as well as technical problems.\n\n\"Cannon Fodder 3\" has a basic premise involving American soldiers battling disparate terrorists who have united with the aim of world domination. Like the earlier games in the series, it features a mix of \"old school\" action and strategy gameplay viewed from an isometric perspective. The player directs a small squad of soldiers, primarily with the mouse though the keyboard is used to deploy additional weaponry. The control system \"is very similar to ‘twin-stick’ shooters like Geometry Wars, except here you control just one of the four soldiers while the others fall in line, shooting when the lead does.\" Each squad begins with four soldiers. They are fragile (though, possessing health bars, are somewhat tougher than the protagonists of the originals), but increase in status and power should they survive; the player is provided with a replacement squad should all his platoon die. The player can also split the squad into smaller units should strategy so require. The game has an online cooperative mode for up to four players, though Strategy Informer noted this mode is unpopular. As well as facing large numbers of equally frail enemy infantry, the player must combat vehicles, buildings and turrets which cannot be destroyed with the standard machine guns. For this reason, the player must rely on explosive secondary weapons such as grenades and rockets, which are essential to destroy enemy structures and more powerful units. He can also make use of vehicles – such as tanks and helicopters – as well as various power-ups. The game features an extensively destructible environment and several settings, including the moon.\n\n\"Cannon Fodder 3\" is the third installment in the \"Cannon Fodder\" series, the first two games of which – \"Cannon Fodder\" and \"Cannon Fodder 2\" – were successful across multiple formats in the 1990s. Those games were created by Sensible Software led by Jon Hare; Hare later worked on abortive sequels for both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, as well as planning a version for smartphones. However, the publisher Codemasters had acquired Sensible Software and its intellectual property. In 2008 Codemasters licensed Russian company Game Factory Interactive (GFI) – which had previously been involved in games such as \"The Precursors\", \"\" and \"\" – to develop \"Cannon Fodder 3\". While English-language media reported on the development in January 2011, GFI was initially permitted only to release the game in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, with the possibility of a wider European or North American release unclear. GFI, described as an \"unknown\", or \"little-known\" company, published the game in Russia in December 2011, with both GFI and Burut CT variously reported as developers. Eurogamer then reported that Codemasters had clarified the agreement between itself and GFI: Codemasters had reserved the option to publish the game in the UK, but ultimately declined. This allowed GFI to distribute the game out with Russia and dispelled the belief that GFI was not authorised to make such a release. The game was released via GamersGate, in Europe and North America, on 9 February 2012.\n\nGFI's Oleg Lychaniy stated the developers attempted to retain the most appealing elements of the original \"Cannon Fodder\" while attracting new players. GFI also attempted to retain \"Cannon Fodder's\" \"antimilitarist message\" and was most proud of the new destructible environment. The developers broadened the variety of weapons and vehicles and changed the level structure by adding sub-missions.\n\nRichard Cobbet, writing in \"PC Gamer UK\" said: \"just maybe, this is going too far\", in reference to images of soldiers' gory corpses cleared from the interface by windscreen wipers. The reviewer expressed bemusement at \"Terrorists with robots and plasma guns\" antagonists, but reflected – in reference to \"Cannon Fodder 2\" – \"Still, could be worse. They could be time-travelling aliens again.\" He said the \"biggest issue\" is that a \"gung-ho\" approach to play is infeasible and that the \"precise and tactical\" approach faithful to earlier games in the series \"turns out to be a very different experience from before. Far less satisfying\". This is due to the \"key problem\" of the ease with which enemy weapons such as rocket launcher-armed turrets can destroy the player's soldiers. The player is thus forced \"to play with aching, paranoid care, picking away at base defences from as far away as possible, and rubbing up against the save points like a lovely cat finally reunited with its owner. This is not fun.\" He also complained about the arbitrary death inflicted by exploding barrels \"raining down over the entire screen.\" Cobbet summarised that the departure from the original game meant that \"Cannon Fodder 3\" did not evoke nostalgia and was a \"poor substitute\" for other action or strategy games. On the other hand, he found the game \"admittedly nowhere near as frustrating\" as the original. He reflected that it \"does have a solid crack at updating the action for a new age, and it's far from as bad as expected\" given its obscure development.\nLiam Martin of Digital Spy noted that the variety of locations and weather effects added to the distinctiveness of individual levels. He praised the \"simple but effective\", \"cartoonish\" and colorful visual style, the improved detail from the game's predecessors along with the \"light-hearted tone\" and \"spectacular and bloody\" gore effects. He praised the destructible environments but thought the characters too small. He felt use of strategy to be \"limited\" but the action \"enormous amounts of explosive fun\" and enjoyed the gratification of destroying enemies and buildings with rifles and tanks. The writer found the game a \"little repetitive\" with a \"tendency to grate\", which he blamed on somewhat tedious level design, a lack of variety in objectives, a poor camera and long loading times. The lack of a tutorial or mini-map proved sometimes confusing. He noted the \"welcome\" but limited on-line cooperative mode. Martin felt the game was \"best played in short bursts\" and summarised: \"Provided you're not expecting a game with much depth or that's oozing innovation, Cannon Fodder 3 proves that virtual war can still be a lot of fun.\"\n\nNathan Cocks of \"PC PowerPlay\" complained the need for secondary weapons proves frustrating: \"It is not uncommon to run out of the weapons needed for the job, forcing the player to engage in a tedious game of hide and seek as they scour the map in the hopes of finding another cache.\" He wrote: \"In fact, tedium is a frequent bedfellow in Cannon Fodder 3\", due to the lack of variety in the gameplay and mission objectives. He felt the player's vehicles to be of limited effectiveness as is the ability to split the squad. Cocks complained of the game's \"bargain basement production\" ruining the tone of the game due to low quality translations and voice acting, as well as numerous bugs causing problems with running the game, crashes, spawning and using vehicles. The reviewer acknowledged the \"wonderfully cartoony\" graphics, found the gory windscreen wipers \"amusing\" and wrote \"It’s all over-the-top explosive goodness and contributes a great deal to what little appeal is present.\" Cocks summarised: \"Cannon Fodder 3 is the ultimate coat-tail rider [...] perhaps there is some nostalgic pleasure to be taken in this but for the most part, we suggest leaving well enough alone.\"\n\nStrategy Informer felt the game had updated and improved upon the original, noting better controls, more forgiving health bars and save points, and more engaging mission goals. The reviewer criticised the poor translations and perceived borderline ethnic stereotypes in the enemy characters. Overall the reviewer was impressed by the game, saying \"in the end CF3 far exceeded my expectations\". \"Metro\" had some praise for the graphics but complained of a lack of any fun and poor camera, controls and level design. The reviewer called the translated dialogue worse than that of \"Zero Wing\". Greece's \"PC Master\" praised the game as enjoyable and while somewhat repetitive, a successful update of the \"Cannon Fodder\" series. Czech website Games.cz criticised the game as a failure, with poor graphics, music, sound effects and immature, unimpressive humour, saying the game would only be worth buying at a lower price.\n"}
{"id": "2973296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2973296", "title": "Chick tract", "text": "Chick tract\n\nChick tracts are short evangelical gospel tracts, originally created and published by American publisher and religious cartoonist Jack Chick. Since his death, his company (Chick Publications) has continued to print new tracts using other authors working for the company.\n\nAlthough many of Chick's tracts express views that are generally accepted within Christian theology, several tracts have expressed controversial viewpoints. Most notably, Chick tracts were known for expressing strongly anti-Catholic views, as well as his criticisms of other religions including Islam and Mormonism.\n\nChick Publications produces and markets the Chick tracts, along with other comic books, books, and posters. Chick Publications has its headquarters in Rancho Cucamonga and has an Ontario, California mailing address.\n\nThe company estimates it has printed over 800 million tracts during its first 50 years of business. On its website they note that \"Our ministry is primarily publishing the gospel tracts of Jack T. Chick, but we do occasionally publish a manuscript in book form.\" They state that if the content \"educates Christians in one of the areas for which we have a tract, we would love to see it\" and cite several examples; the online store lists nearly a dozen book categories.\n\nAs of January 2015, Chick Publications had produced over 250 different titles, about 100 of which are still in print, and are available in over 100 languages.\n\nThe tracts themselves are approximately three inches high by five inches wide in dimension, and approximately twenty pages in length. The material is written in comic book format, with the front panel featuring the title of the tract and the inside back panel devoted to a standard sinner's prayer. The back cover of the tract contains a blank space for churches to stamp their name and address; Chick Publications is willing to print custom back covers, but at least 10,000 tracts must be ordered.\n\nThe storyline commonly features at least one Christian person and one or more \"non-Christians\". Depending on the storyline the \"non-Christian\" may be 1) a stereotypical \"wicked person\" (such as a criminal; an example being the eponymous character of the tract \"Bad Bob!\"), 2) a member of a \"false religion\" (as Chick defines such; an example being the Mormon missionaries from \"The Visitors\"), and/or 3) a \"moral person\" depending on \"good works\" to gain eventual entrance to Heaven (as opposed to salvation through Jesus Christ; an example is the marshal in \"Gun Slinger\"). In these storylines, the Christian attempts to convert the non-Christian to Christianity (and may also feature a contrast where another character, often the \"moral person\", does not), with the convert receiving entry into heaven, while the person rejecting the message is condemned to hell. The endings may feature a recycled scene in which Jesus Christ (portrayed as a giant, glowing, faceless figure sitting on a throne) condemns or welcomes a character, an angel taking the believer to Heaven, and/or the non-believer meeting demons upon his/her arrival to Hell.\n\nChick tracts end with a suggested prayer for the reader to pray to accept Jesus Christ. In most of these tracts it is a standard sinner's prayer for salvation. In the tracts dealing with \"false religions\", the prayer includes a clause to reject these religions. Included with the prayer are directions for converting to Christianity, which is also repeated on the inside back panel along with steps to take should the reader convert to Christianity.\n\n\"Strips, Toons, and Bluesies\", written by Douglas Bevan Dowd and Todd Hignite, stated that \"it's safe to assume Chick saw at least some\" Tijuana bibles since the books and, according to Dowd and Hignite, Chick tracts were \"strikingly similar\" to Tijuana bibles; like Tijuana bibles the tracts mostly targeted youth of lower socioeconomic classes and \"were loaded with stereotypes\". The book stated that Chick tracts contained \"way-out, wild\" portrayals of recreational drug usage and portrayed \"the sexual revolution\". In addition the comics included supernatural elements, occult rituals, torture, and cannibalism.\n\nCatholicism is a frequent target of Chick tracts and other writings. No fewer than twenty of the tracts are devoted to Catholicism, including \"Are Roman Catholics Christians?\" (arguing that they are not), \"The Death Cookie\" (a polemic against the Catholic Eucharist), and \"Why is Mary Crying?\" (arguing that Mary does not support the veneration Catholicism gives her).\n\nElsewhere, Chick, defended the controversial Alberto Rivera in at least one book and in an entire series of six full-length comics. Chick also asserted that the Catholic Church, in a grand conspiracy, created Islam, Communism, Nazism, and Freemasonry. In \"The New Anti-Catholicism\", religious historian Philip Jenkins describes Chick tracts as promulgating \"bizarre allegations of Catholic conspiracy and sexual hypocrisy\" to perpetuate \"anti-papal and anti-Catholic mythologies\". Michael Ian Borer, a sociology professor of Furman University at the time, described Chick's strong anti-Catholic themes in a 2007 American Sociological Association presentation and in a peer reviewed article the next year in \"Religion and American Culture\".\n\n\"Catholic Answers\" published a response to the claims of Chick Publications against Roman Catholics and a criticism of Chick Tracts in general called \"The Nightmare World of Jack T. Chick\", detailing the inaccuracies, factual errors, and how a \"typical tactic in Chick tracts is to portray Catholics as being unpleasant or revolting in various ways\".\n\nChick tracts are unequivocal and explicit in their opposition to homosexuality, and repeatedly employ two anti-homosexual themes:\n\nAccording to Cynthia Burack, Chick's earliest anti-homosexuality tract, \"The Gay Blade\" (originally written in 1972, revised in 1984 and now out-of-print except by special order), borrowed several of its frames from a 1971 \"Life\" magazine photo-essay on the Gay Liberation movement, but with the images altered to make the gay men look more dissolute or stereotypically feminized.\n\nChick published several anti-evolution tracts, but \"Big Daddy?\" remains \"the most widely distributed anti-evolution booklet in history\".\n\nCritics point out that the \"Big Daddy?\" tract mainly uses Kent Hovind as a reference, despite the fact that Hovind has no degrees from accredited institutions in the relevant fields, that the thesis referred to is considered to be of very poor quality, and that his claims are at odds with the published statements of experts in the field.\n\n\"Big Daddy?\" is presented in the 2007 book \"Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters\" as a \"typical of the genre\" example of just how \"misleading and dishonest\" creationist presentations are. The examples of the \"deceptive and misleading\" distortions, misrepresentation, and fabrications presented in that work regarding \"Big Daddy?\" are \"Nebraska Man\" (the misinterpretation of which was corrected after only a year and its existence was debated from the beginning), \"New Guinea Man\" (which is actually \"Homo sapiens\"), and the implication \"Cro-Magnon\" man was viewed as different from \"Homo sapiens\".\n\nThe concept of malign influences led to the theme of spiritual warfare being frequently portrayed in the tracts. Chick considered all forms of witchcraft to be demonic, regardless of whether it was \"white witchcraft\" (i.e. purportedly using such gifts for good) or \"black witchcraft\" (i.e. purportedly using such gifts for evil). \"Gladys\" is an example of one of Chick's tracts on this issue.\nConsistent with his views on demonic influence, Chick also considered Halloween to be \"the devil's holiday\" and opposed Christians celebrating it, with one notable exception – Chick did not oppose Christians engaging in the traditional Halloween custom of passing out candy to neighborhood children, considering it to be an opportunity to present the Gospel message via his tracts.\n\nBased on Chick's views on Satanism and Satanic influence, \"Catholic Answers\" states that \"Chick portrays a world full of paranoia and conspiracy where nothing is what it seems and nearly everything is a Satanic plot to lead people to hell.\"\n\nThe tracts' claims about conspiracies are based in large part on the testimony of people who claim to have been members of these groups before converting to Evangelical Christianity, most prominently Alberto Rivera and William Schnoebelen. Many of Chick's critics consider these sources to be frauds or fantasists. One such case was \"The Prophet\" where the fantastic tale related by Rivera of how the papacy helped start Islam turned out to have no basis in reality.\n\n\nSome cartoonists have published parodies that mimic Chick tracts' familiar layout and narrative conventions. Examples include:\n\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has designated Chick Publications as an active hate group.\nThe group was listed due to its strong anti-Catholic, anti-Muslim, and anti-homosexual rhetoric. Chick's views on homosexuality have angered gay activists since his first tract on the subject in 1972 (\"The Gay Blade\" tract warned of a gay agenda to push for same sex marriage and urged homosexuals to repent so they could make it into heaven).\n\nChick's critics (such as talk.origins, Hindu American Foundation, and Catholic Answers) have accused him of misrepresentation.\n\nThe Hindu American Foundation put out an electronic PDF paper called \"Hyperlink to Hinduphobia: Online Hatred, Extremism and Bigotry Against Hindus\" which contains a section on Chick's site; the paper ends with the statement \"Chick Publications promotes hatred not just against Hindus, but also towards Muslims, Catholics, and others as is evidenced by the following titles of their tracts: 'Last Rites – When this Catholic dies, he learns that his church couldn't save him'; 'The Little Bride – Protect children against being recruited as Muslims. Li'l Susy explains that only Jesus can save them'; and 'Allah Had No Son – The Allah of Islam is not the God of creation (in both these anti-Islamic tracts Allah is revealed to be a pagan moon god).\n\nThe content of \"That Crazy Guy!\" was changed after the rise of the AIDS crisis (the tract was originally about herpes). Also, the ending to \"The Poor Little Witch\" (in which a little girl is murdered by Satanists after forsaking occultism and converting to fundamentalist Christianity) was changed because the urban myth which states that \"every year in the U.S. at least 40,000 people ... are murdered in witchcraft ceremonies\" (about twice the entire reported homicide rate for the U.S.) turned out to be false and was removed from the tract. Chick Publications depicts Paganism and Neo-Paganism as forms of Satanism, a position Neo-Pagans and other observers strongly dispute.\n\nThe Chick Publications website is blocked in Singapore. In December 2008, a Singaporean couple was charged with sedition for distributing the Chick tracts \"The Little Bride\" and \"Who Is Allah?\", said to \"promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between Christians and Muslims in Singapore\".\n\nIn October 2011, the Northview Baptist Church in Hillsboro, Ohio gave out copies of the Chick tract \"Mean Momma\" along with candy at Halloween. The church received complaints from parishioners, and its pastor apologized for issuing the tracts, saying that, \"Our church does not endorse this type of extreme methodology that was represented in this particular tract, and we can assure you that we will not let this happen again ... our church is a loving church that loves souls and wants to do all we can in our community to help as well as spread and share the Gospel message of Christ.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Chick tract \"Unforgiven\" was distributed by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract tells the story of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. \"It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,\" he said. \"It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, 'If you weren't my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar. In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he will \"die in [his] sins\" and be unforgiven by God if he does not. But the young man is not swayed by her pleas. \"I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!\" he screams. \"Get out of my house, you infidel!\" Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41907", "title": "Dick Tracy", "text": "Dick Tracy\n\nDick Tracy is an American comic strip featuring Dick Tracy (originally Plainclothes Tracy), a tough and intelligent police detective created by Chester Gould. The strip made its debut on October 14, 1931, in the \"Detroit Mirror\". It was distributed by the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. Gould wrote and drew the strip until 1972. Since that time, various artists and writers have continued the strip, which still runs in newspapers today. Dick Tracy has also been the hero in a number of films, notably one in which Warren Beatty played the crime fighter in 1990.\n\nTracy uses forensic science, advanced gadgetry, and wits in an early example of the police procedural mystery story—although stories often end in gunfights just the same. Stories typically follow a criminal committing a crime and Tracy's relentless pursuit of said criminal. The strip's most popular villain was Flattop Jones, a freelance hitman hired by black marketeers to murder Tracy. When Flattop was killed, fans went into public mourning. The Flattop story was reprinted in \"Limited Collectors' Edition\" in 1975. The villains' small crimes led to bigger, out-of-control situations, reflecting film noir. Similarly, innocent witnesses were frequently killed, and Tracy's paramour Tess Trueheart was often endangered by the villains. As the story progressed, Tracy adopted an orphan under the name Dick Tracy Jr., or \"Junior\" for short, who appeared in investigations until becoming a police forensic artist in his father's precinct. He also cultivated a professional partner, ex-steelworker Pat Patton, who gradually became a detective of skill and courage enough to satisfy Tracy's requirements.\n\nTracy characters were often caricatures of celebrities. There was Breathless Mahoney, modeled after Veronica Lake. Likewise, B.O. Plenty was inspired by George \"Gabby\" Hayes (with perhaps a nod to Al St. John also), Vitamin Flintheart by John Barrymore, and Spike Dyke by Spike Jones. Others include villains like Rughead (Robert Montgomery), Oodles (Jackie Gleason) and Mumbles (Bing Crosby). Gould even parodied himself as the out-of-shape Pearshape.\n\nOn January 13, 1946, the 2-Way Wrist Radio became one of the strip's most immediately recognizable icons, worn as a wristwatch by Tracy and members of the police force. This radio wristwatch inspired Martin Cooper's invention of the smartphone, and may have inspired later smartwatches. The 2-Way Wrist Radio was upgraded to a 2-Way Wrist TV in 1964. This development also led to the introduction of an important supporting character, Diet Smith, an eccentric industrialist who financed the development of this equipment. In a conspicuous coincidence, the idea of a radio built into a wrist watch played an important role in the story line of \"Superman – The Talking Cat\" broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System on January 9 through 28, 1946 (episodes 878 through 891).\n\nIn late 1948, a botched security detail led to the death of the semi-regular character Brilliant, the blind inventor of the 2-Way Wrist Radio (among other devices) whereupon Chief Brandon, Dick Tracy's superior on the police force and a presence in the strip since 1931, resigned in shame and Pat Patton was promoted to police chief in Brandon's place, previously having been Tracy's buffoonish partner. A new character was introduced named Sam Catchem to take Patton's place as Tracy's sidekick.\n\nGould introduced topical story lines about television, juvenile delinquency, graft, organized crime, and other developments in American life during the 1950s; and elements of soap opera depicted Dick, Tess, and Junior (along with the Tracys' baby daughter Bonnie Braids) at home as a family. Depictions of family life alternated with the story's crime drama, as in the kidnapping of Bonnie Braids by fugitive Crewy Lou, or Junior's girlfriend Model being accidentally killed by her brother.\n\nGould incurred some controversy when he had Tracy live in an unaccountably ostentatious manner on a police officer's salary, and responded with a story wherein Tracy was accused of corruption and had to explain the origin of his possessions in detail. In his book-length examination of the strip, \"Dick Tracy – The Official Biography\", Jay Maeder suggested that Gould's critics were unsatisfied by his explanation. Nevertheless, the controversy eventually faded, and the cartoonist reduced exposure to Tracy's home life.\n\nTracy's cases generally incriminated independent operators rather than organized crime—with a few exceptions, such as Big Boy, a fictionalized version of Al Capone and the strip's first villain. Tracy opposed a series of big-time mobsters in the 1950s, such as the King, George \"Mr. Crime\" Alpha, Odds Zonn, and Willie \"The Fifth\" Millyun, after events like the Kefauver Hearings. As Tess faded into the background, Tracy assumed as assistant the rookie policewoman Lizz Worthington.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1964, the \"Dick Tracy\" Sunday page was accompanied by a topper humor strip called \"The Gravies\" and drawn by Gould and his assistants.\n\nAs technology progressed, the methods that Tracy and the police used to track and capture criminals took the form of increasingly fanciful atomic-powered gadgets developed by Diet Smith Industries. This eventually led to the 1960s advent of the Space Coupe, a spacecraft with a magnetic propulsion system. This marked the beginning of the strip's \"Space Period,\" which saw Tracy and friends having adventures on the Moon and meeting Moon Maid, the daughter of the leader of a race of humanoid people living in \"Moon Valley\" in 1964. After an eventual sharing of technological information, Moon technology became standard issue on Tracy's police force, including air cars, flying cylindrical vehicles. The villains became even more exaggerated in power, resulting in an escalating series of stories that no longer resembled the urban crime drama roots of the strip. During this period, Tracy met famed cartoonist Chet Jade, creator of the comic strip \"Sawdust\", in which the only characters are talking dots.\n\nOne of the new characters, Mr. Intro, was only manifested as a disembodied voice. His goal was world domination in the vein of a James Bond villain. Tracy eventually used an atomic laser beam to annihilate Intro and his island base.\n\nJunior married Moon Maid in October 1964. Their daughter Honey Moon Tracy had antennae and magnetic hands. In the spring of 1969, Tracy was offered the post of Chief of Police in Moon Valley. However, he ended up back on Earth when the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 showed that the moon was barren of all life. Many of the accoutrements of the space period stories remained for many years afterward, such as the Space Coupe and much of the high-tech gadgetry. Moon Maid receded from the storyline.\n\nThe stories of this period took an increasingly condemnatory tone pertaining to contemporary court decisions concerning the rights of the accused, which often involved Tracy being frustrated by legal technicalities. For example, having caught a gang of diamond thieves red-handed, Tracy was forced to let them walk because he could not \"prove\" beyond a reasonable doubt that the diamonds were stolen. As he saw the thieves get off without penalty, Tracy was heard to grumble, \"Yes, under today's interpretation of the laws, it seems it's the police who are handcuffed!\"\n\nIn the 1970s, Gould modernized Tracy by giving him a longer hair style and mustache, and added a hippie sidekick, Groovy Grove. Groovy's first appearance in print, as it happened, occurred during the same week as the Kent State shootings. Groovy remained with the strip, off and on until his death in 1984.\n\nShortly before his retirement, Gould drew a strip in which Sam, Lizz, and Groovy held Tracy down to shave off his mustache.\n\nAt this time, the standard publication size and space of newspaper comics was sharply reduced; for example, the \"Dick Tracy\" Sunday strip, which had traditionally been a full-page episode containing 12 panels, was cut in size to a half-page format that offered, at most, eight panels—these new restrictions created challenges for all comic artists.\n\nThe Plenty family was a group of goofy redneck yokels headed by the former villain Bob Oscar (\"B.O.\"), along with Gertrude (\"Gravel Gertie\") Plenty. Gravel Gertie was introduced as the unwitting dupe (accessory) of the villain the Brow, who was on the run from Dick Tracy. The family provided a humorous counterpoint to Tracy's adventures. The Plenty sub-story was decades long, and saw Sparkle Plenty grow from an infant to a young married lady, eventually becoming a beautiful fashion model. Sparkle Plenty's May 30, 1947 birth became a significant mainstream media event, with spinoff merchandising and magazine coverage.\n\nThe Plenty family appeared with Tracy in a story that occurred in a bank, where \"B.O.\" found a way to prevent thieves from snatching an envelope of money from a counter.\n\nIn the April 24, 2011 strip, B.O. and Gertie had a second child, Attitude, a boy who is as ugly as Sparkle is beautiful. His face has yet to be shown.\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, the Sunday strip included a frame devoted to a page from the \"Crimestoppers' Textbook\", a series of handy illustrated hints for the amateur crime-fighter. This was named after a short-lived youth group seen in the strip during the late 1940s, led by Junior Tracy, called \"Dick Tracy's Crimestoppers.\" This feature ended when Gould retired from the strip in 1977, but Max Allan Collins reinstated it, and it is still part of the comic strip. After Gould's retirement, Collins initially replaced the Textbook with \"Dick Tracy's Rogues Gallery,\" a salute to memorable \"Tracy\" villains of the past.\n\nChester Gould retired from comics in 1977; his last \"Dick Tracy\" strip appeared in print on Sunday, December 25 (Christmas Day) of that same year. The following Monday, \"Dick Tracy\" was taken over by Max Allan Collins and longtime Gould's assistant Rick Fletcher. Gould's name remained in the byline for a few years after his retirement as a story consultant.\n\nIn one of Collins' first stories as the strip's writer, the gangster known as \"Big Boy\" learned that he was dying and had less than a year to live. Big Boy was still seeking revenge on the plainclothesman who sent him up the river, and he wanted to live just long enough to see Tracy's death. He put out an open contract on Tracy's head worth one million dollars, knowing that every small-time hood in the City would take a crack at the famous cop for that amount of money. One of the would-be collectors rigged Tracy's car to explode, but inadvertently killed Moon Maid instead of Tracy in the explosion. A funeral strip for Moon Maid explicitly stated that this officially severed all ties between Earth and the Moon in the strip, thus eliminating the last remnants of the Space Period. Honeymoon received a new hairstyle that covered her antennae, and she was ultimately phased out of the strip. Junior later married Sparkle Plenty (the daughter of B.O. and Gravel Gertie Plenty), and had a daughter named Sparkle Plenty Jr. In the 1990s, Tracy's son Joseph Flintheart Tracy took on a role similar to Junior's in the earlier strips.\n\nIn addition, Collins removed other Gould creations of the 1960s and 1970s (including Groovy Grove, who was gravely wounded in the line of duty and later died in the hospital; Lizz married him before his death). On a more philosophical level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the justice system than Gould; Tracy came to accept its limitations and requirements as a normal part of the process which he could manage. Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the 2-Way Wrist Computer in 1987.\n\nNew semi-regular characters introduced by Collins and Fletcher included: Dr. Will Carver, a plastic surgeon with underworld ties who often worked on known felons; Wendy Wichel, a smarmy newspaper reporter/editorialist with a strong anti-Tracy bias in her articles; and Lee Ebony, an African-American female detective. Vitamin Flintheart reappeared occasionally as a comic-relief figure, the aged ham actor created by Gould in 1944 who had not been seen in the strip for almost three decades. The Plenty family (B.O., Gravel Gertie, and Sparkle) were also brought back as semi-regulars; Junior and Sparkle were married following the death of Moon Maid, and soon gave birth to their own daughter Sparkle Plenty, Jr.\n\nOriginal villains seen during this period included Angeltop (the revenge-seeking, psychopathic daughter of the slain Flattop), Torcher (whose scheme was arson-for-profit), and Splitscreen (a video pirate). Collins brought back at least one \"classic\" Gould villain or revenge-seeking family member per year. The revived Gould villains were often provided with full names, and marriages, children, and other family connections were developed, bringing more humanity to many of the originally grotesque brutes. \"Flattop\", particularly, had a number of relatives, all with his characteristic head structure and facial attributes, who turned up one by one to avenge their ancestor on Tracy.\n\nRick Fletcher died in 1983 and was succeeded by editorial cartoonist Dick Locher, who had assisted Gould on the strip in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Locher was assisted by his son John, who died in 1986.\n\nMax Allan Collins was fired from the strip in 1992, following a financial reorganization of their comic strip holdings, and \"Tribune\" staff writer and columnist Mike Kilian took over the writing. Kilian was paid less than half of what Collins was making per strip , but continued until his death on October 27, 2005. Locher was both author and artist for over three years, beginning on January 9, 2006. On March 16, 2009, Jim Brozman began collaborating with Locher, taking over the drawing duties while Locher continued to write the strip.\n\nIn 2005, Tracy was a guest at Blondie and Dagwood's 75th anniversary party in the comic strip \"Blondie\". Later, Dick Tracy appeared in the comic strip \"Gasoline Alley\".\n\nOn January 19, 2011, Tribune Media Services announced that Locher was retiring from the strip and handing the reins to artist Joe Staton and writer Mike Curtis. The new creative team has previously worked together on \"Scooby-Doo\", \"Richie Rich\", and\" Casper the Friendly Ghost\". Their first Dick Tracy strip was published March 14, 2011. Staton and Curtis are assisted by Shelley Pleger, who inks and letters Staton's drawings, along with Shane Fisher, who provides the coloring on the Sunday strips. Chicago-area police sergeant Jim Doherty provided \"Crimestopper\" captions for the Sunday strips and acted as the feature's technical advisor. Doherty also introduced a new feature, \"Tracy's Hall of Fame\" (which replaces the \"Crimestopper\" panel approximately once each month), in which a real-life police officer is profiled and honored. Doherty was replaced in 2016 by police lieutenant Walter Reimer, who introduced the \"First Responders Roll of Honor\", which honors real-life police officers, firefighters and paramedics who died on duty.\n\nStaton and Curtis reintroduced many of the characters of the forties through the sixties, including a second Mr. Crime and a reformed Mole, while introducing more deformed and grotesque villains such as Abner Kadaver, Panda, and The Jumbler. They have also brought back all the gadgets and plot elements of the 1960s space era, starting in early 2013, although the reintroduced Moon Maid is not the same as the original; rather, she is a human genetically modified to resemble the original Moon Maid and thus, is christened Mysta Chimera and placed under Diet Smith's care. They have also done crossovers, with cameos from \"Popeye\", \"Brenda Starr, Reporter\", \"Funky Winkerbean\", Fearless Fosdick, The Spirit, The Green Hornet, For Better or For Worse, and a long sequence involving \"Little Orphan Annie\".\n\nChester Gould won the Reuben Award for the strip in 1959 and 1977.\n\nThe Mystery Writers of America honored Gould and his work with a Special Edgar Award in 1980. This was the first time MWA ever honored a comic strip.\n\nIn 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative postage stamps and postcards.\n\nOn May 2, 2011, the Tennessee Senate passed Resolution 30, congratulating Mike Curtis and Joe Staton on their professional accomplishments, including \"Dick Tracy\".\n\nOn September 7, 2013, at the Baltimore Comics Convention, \"Dick Tracy\" was awarded the Harvey in the \"Best Syndicated Strip or Panel\" category. \"Tracy\" was simultaneously the oldest continually running strip, and the first adventure strip ever to win the Harvey Award in this category. On September 6, 2014, \"Tracy\" was awarded a second Harvey Award in the newspaper strip category, becoming one of only three strips to win in this category in consecutive years. On September 26, 2015, \"Tracy\" won a third Harvey in the same category, becoming one of only three strips to win in three consecutive years.\n\nOn November 6, 2016 at their panel at Akron Comicon, Mike Curtis and Joe Staton were each presented with an Akron Comicon Excellence Award. The inscription on the plaques reads: 2016 AKRON COMICON EXCELLENCE AWARD PRESENTED TO MIKE CURTIS AND JOE STATON FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ONE OF THE LONGEST RUNNING NEWSPAPER STRIPS IN THE HISTORY OF NEWSPAPER COMICS!\n\n\"Dick Tracy\" had a long run on radio, from 1934 weekdays on NBC's New England stations to the ABC network in 1948. Bob Burlen was the first radio Tracy in 1934, and others heard in the role during the 1930s and 1940s were Barry Thomson, Ned Wever and Matt Crowley. The early shows all had 15-minute episodes.\n\nOn CBS, with Sterling Products as sponsor, the serial aired four times a week from February 4, 1935 to July 11, 1935, moving to Mutual from September 30, 1935 to March 24, 1937 with Bill McClintock doing the sound effects. NBC's weekday afternoon run from January 3, 1938 to April 28, 1939 had sound effects by Keene Crockett and was sponsored by Quaker Oats, which brought \"Dick Tracy\" into primetime (Saturdays at 7 pm and, briefly, Mondays at 8 pm) with 30-minute episodes from April 29, 1939 to September 30, 1939. The series returned to 15-minute episodes on the ABC Blue Network from March 15, 1943 to July 16, 1948, sponsored by Tootsie Roll, which used the music theme of \"Toot Toot, Tootsie\" for its 30-minute Saturday ABC series from October 6, 1945 to June 1, 1946. Sound effects on ABC were supplied by Walt McDonough and Al Finelli.\n\nOn February 15, 1945, \"Command Performance\" broadcast the musical comedy \"Dick Tracy in B-Flat\" with Bing Crosby as Tracy, Bob Hope as Flattop, Dinah Shore as Tess Trueheart, among the cast. Dick Tracy's wedding is repeatedly interrupted as Tracy chases after one villain after another. In the strip, his marriage wasn't until 1950 and his honeymoon was disrupted by his going after Wormy.\n\nJim Ameche portrayed Tracy in a two-record set recorded by Mercury Records in 1947. The record sleeves were illustrated with Sunday strips reprinted in black-and-white for children to color.\n\nTracy made his first comic book appearance in 1936 as one of the features included in the first issue of Dell's \"Popular Comics\". These were reprints from the newspaper strip, reconfigured to fit the pages of a comic book, as was the case with most Tracy comic book appearances. Tracy remained a regular feature in \"Popular Comics\" through the publication's 21st issue.\n\nThe first comic book to feature Tracy exclusively was the \"Dick Tracy Feature Book\", published in May 1937 by David McKay Publications. McKay's Feature Books were magazines that rotated several popular characters from comics strips through 1938. Three more of McKay's Feature Books starred Tracy in the following months.\n\nIn 1939, Dell started a comic magazine series called \"Black and White Comics,\" essentially identical to McKay's \"Feature Books.\" Six of the 15 issues featured Tracy. In 1941, Dell's \"Black and White\" series was replaced by the \"Large Feature Books,\" the third issue of which featured Tracy. As with the McKay series, the Dell \"Black and White\" and \"Large Feature\" series were abridged reprints of the strip.\n\nIn 1938, \"Tracy\" became one of several regular newspaper strips featured in Dell's regular monthly \"Super Comics\", remaining a regular part of that publication until 1948. In 1939, \"Tracy\" was the sole feature in the very first issue of Dell's \"Four-Color Comics\", which put out more than 1,300 issues starring hundreds of characters between 1939 and 1962. Tracy was featured in seven more \"Four-Color\" issues throughout the 1940s.\n\nTracy was frequently featured in comic books used as promotional items by various companies. In 1947, for example, Sig Feuchtwanger produced a comic book that was a giveaway prize in boxes of Quaker Puffed Wheat cereal, sponsor of the popular \"Dick Tracy\" radio series.\n\nIn January 1948, Dell began the first regular \"Dick Tracy\" comic book series, \"Dick Tracy Monthly\". This series ultimately ran for 145 issues, the first 24 of which were published by Dell, after which it was picked up by Harvey Comics. Continuing the same numbering, Harvey published the series until 1961. As with most previous Tracy comic book incarnations, these were, with the exception of the last few Dell issues which featured original material, slightly abridged and reconfigured reprints of the newspaper strips.\n\n\"Dick Tracy\" was revived in 1986 by Blackthorne Publishing and ran for 99 issues. Disney produced a series of three issues as a tie-in for their 1990 film. This miniseries, \"True Hearts and Tommy Guns\", was drawn by Kyle Baker and edited by Len Wein. The third issue was a direct adaptation of the film.\n\nIn 2018, IDW Publishing announced a new \"Dick Tracy\" comic book by Mike Allred (co-writer/cover artist/inker), Lee Allred (co-writer), Rich Tommaso (penciller) and Laura Allred (colorist). \n\nOver the years, many reprints of \"Dick Tracy\" newspaper strips have been published. Beginning in 2006, IDW Publishing started reprinting the complete strip in hardcover volumes, eventually being done under their The Library of American Comics imprint. \n\nOther collections include:\n\nOther editions:\n\nDick Tracy made his film debut in \"Dick Tracy\" (1937), a 15-chapter movie serial by Republic Pictures starring Ralph Byrd. The Spider Gang was on the loose, tired of Dick Tracy's cunning skills. Through the 15-chapter serial, 15 different cases were solved, all plots by the Spider Gang. Dick Tracy was also in search of his missing brother, Gordon Tracy (Carleton Young). The Dick Tracy character proved very popular, and a second serial, \"Dick Tracy Returns\", appeared in 1938 (reissued in 1948). \"Dick Tracy's G-Men\" was released in 1939 (reissued in 1955). The last was \"Dick Tracy vs. Crime Inc.\" in 1941 (reissued as \"Dick Tracy vs. the Phantom Empire\" in 1952).\n\nThe sequels were produced under an interpretation of the contract for the first \"Dick Tracy\" serial, which gave license for \"a series or serial\". As a result, Chester Gould received no further money for the sequel serials.\n\nIn these serials, Dick Tracy is portrayed as an FBI agent, or \"G-Man\", based in California rather than as a detective in the police force of a Midwestern city resembling Chicago, and, aside from himself and Junior, no characters from the strip appear in any of the four films.\n\nHowever, comic relief sidekick \"Mike McGurk\" bears some resemblance to Tracy's partner from the strip, Pat Patton; Tracy's secretary, Gwen Andrews (played by several actresses in the course of the series, including Jennifer Jones under a variation of her real name, Phyllis Isley), provides the same kind of feminine interest as Tess Trueheart; and FBI Director Clive Anderson (Francis X. Bushman and others) is the same kind of avuncular superior as Chief Brandon.\n\nThe first serial, \"Dick Tracy\", is now in the public domain.\n\nSix years after the release of the final Republic serial, Dick Tracy headlined four feature films, produced by RKO Radio Pictures. \"Dick Tracy\" (a.k.a. \"Dick Tracy, Detective\") (1945) was followed by \"Dick Tracy vs. Cueball\" in 1946, both with Morgan Conway as Tracy. Ralph Byrd returned for the last two features, both released in 1947: \"Dick Tracy's Dilemma\" and \"Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome\". \"Gruesome\" is probably the best known of the four, with the villain portrayed by Boris Karloff. All four movies had many of the visual features associated with film noir: dramatic, shadowy photographic compositions, with many exterior scenes filmed at night (at the RKO Encino movie ranch). Lyle Latell co-starred in all four films as Pat Patton. Anne Jeffreys played Tess Trueheart in the first two, succeeded by Kay Christopher and finally Anne Gwynne; Ian Keith joined the cast as the actor Vitamin Flintheart for two films; Joseph Crehan played Chief Brandon. RKO stocked the films with familiar faces, creating a veritable rogues' gallery of characters: Mike Mazurki as Splitface, Dick Wessel as Cueball, Esther Howard as Filthy Flora, Jack Lambert as hook-handed villain The Claw; baldheaded, pop-eyed Milton Parsons, mild-mannered Byron Foulger, dangerous Trevor Bardette and pockmarked, gently sinister Skelton Knaggs.\n\nIn 1990, Warren Beatty directed and starred as the title character in a live action all-star-cast film along with Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, and Madonna.\n\n\nThe strip has had limited exposure on television with one early live-action series, two animated series, one unsold pilot that was never picked up, and a proposed TV series currently held up in litigation.\n\nRalph Byrd, who had played the square-jawed sleuth in all four Republic movie serials, and in two of the RKO feature-length films, reprised his role in a short-lived live-action \"Dick Tracy\" series that ran on ABC from 1950 to 1951. Additional episodes intended for first-run syndication continued to be produced into 1952. Produced by P. K. Palmer, who also wrote many of the scripts, the series often featured Gould-created villains such as Flattop, Shaky, the Mole, Breathless Mahoney, Heels Beals, and Influence, all of whom appeared on film for the first time on this series. Other cast members included Joe Devlin as Sam Catchem, Angela Greene as Tess Tracy (née Trueheart), Martin Dean as Junior, and Pierre Watkin as Chief Patton. Criticized for its violence, the series remained popular. It ended, not in response to criticism, but because of Byrd's unexpected, premature death in 1952. The series was filmed on a low budget, with many long hours and a rushed shooting schedule. Many episodes of this series have been released on various public domain TV detective DVD sets.\n\nThe first cartoon series was produced from 1960 to 1961 by UPA. Tracy employed a series of cartoon-like subordinate flatfoots to fight crime each week, contacting them on his two-way wrist radio. Everett Sloane voiced Tracy and supporting characters and villains were voiced by Jerry Hausner, Mel Blanc, Benny Rubin, Johnny Coons, Paul Frees and others. These subordinates included \"Go-Go\" Gomez, Joe Jitsu, Hemlock Holmes and the Retouchables, and Officer Heap O'Calorie. 130 five-minute cartoons were designed and packaged for syndication, usually intended for local children's shows.\n\nUPA was also the production company behind the Mr. Magoo cartoons, so it was possible for them to arrange a meeting between Tracy and Magoo in a 1965 episode of the season-long TV series \"The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo\". In the episode \"Dick Tracy and the Mob\", Tracy persuades Magoo (a well-known actor in the context of the \"Famous Adventures\" series) to impersonate an international hit man named Squinty Eyes, who he resembles, and infiltrate a gang of criminals made up of Flattop, Pruneface, Itchy, Mumbles and others. Unlike the earlier animated Tracy shorts, this longer episode was played relatively straight, with Tracy getting much more screen time. Pitting Tracy against a coalition of several of his foes was adopted more than two decades later in the 1990 film.\n\nA second cartoon series was produced in 1971 and was a feature in \"Archie's TV Funnies\", produced by Filmation. It adhered more closely to the comic strip, although it was hampered by cruder animation than the UPA shorts, typical of the studio's production standards.\n\nWilliam Dozier produced a pilot for a live-action Dick Tracy series in 1967 starring Ray MacDonnell in the title role. (Dozier was the producer responsible for the 1966 \"Batman\" television series.) The pilot was \"The Plot To Kill NATO\", featuring \"Special Guest Villain\" Victor Buono as 'Mr. Memory'. The quality was slightly above-average, but the series was not purchased by either ABC or NBC, as ratings for the \"Batman\" series were dropping and a similar series featuring \"The Green Hornet\" had recently flopped. To the networks, the \"Hero Camp\" or \"Batmania\" craze was dying, and they chose not to take a risk on another series.\n\nThe pilot is notable for a phantom credit. Eve Plumb, who would later find fame as Jan Brady on \"The Brady Bunch\", is credited for a character named Bonnie Braids, who does not appear in the pilot.\n\nIn the 1960s, Aurora produced a plastic model kit of Dick Tracy sliding down a fire escape ladder into an alley, in hot pursuit with gun drawn. A Dick Tracy Space Coupe model came next. Both have been reissued by Polar Lights. Also in the market were Mattel's Dick Tracy range of toy guns.\n\nIn 1990, Playmates Toys released a line of action figures called \"Dick Tracy: Coppers and Gangsters\" to coincide with the Dick Tracy movie. The figures were 5\" tall, stylized with exaggerated comicy looks and came with lots of accessories. Two figures in the line had limited availability; Steve the Tramp (called \"The Tramp\" on the package front) was pulled from the assortment after complaints of portrayal of a homeless person as a criminal. The figure of \"The Blank\" was added to the assortment well after the film's release to keep the secret of the identity of the character. As a result, only limited quantities of these two figures made it to store shelves.\n\nThe Dick Tracy video game was developed by Titus Software in 1990. It was ported to many platforms including Amiga, Commodore and MS-DOS. \"Dick Tracy\" is a side scrolling action shooting game. The player controls Dick Tracy through five stages.\n\nThere were also games made for the Nintendo Entertainment System (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Sega Genesis (1990), and Game Boy (1991).\n\nIn 2009, Shocker Toys released a monochromatic Dick Tracy action figure as an exclusive product for the San Diego Comic-Con. The figure appears in a suit with two-way wrist radio. There was also a variant figure released of Dick Tracy in his signature trench coat and fedora with a tommy gun accessory.\n\nMedia outlets reported a legal battle being waged over rights to the Dick Tracy character. Warren Beatty announced plans to make a sequel to his 1990 movie. At the same time, television producers announced plans for a new \"Dick Tracy\" TV series. Both sides claimed that they were the legal owners of the rights to Dick Tracy. In May 2005, Beatty sued the Tribune Company, claiming he has owned the rights to the Dick Tracy character since 1985. Pressure from Beatty led to the cancellation of a proposed collaboration between artist Mike Oeming and writer Brian Bendis on a new serialized Dick Tracy comic.\n\nThe lawsuit was resolved in Beatty's favor, with a US District judge ruling that Beatty did everything contractually required of him to keep the rights to the character.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "10399667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10399667", "title": "Filter (aquarium)", "text": "Filter (aquarium)\n\nAquarium filters are critical components of both freshwater and marine aquaria. Aquarium filters remove physical and soluble chemical waste products from aquaria, simplifying maintenance. Furthermore, aquarium filters are necessary to support life as aquaria are relatively small, closed volumes of water compared to the natural environment of most fish.\n\nAnimals, typically fish, kept in fish tanks produce waste from excrement and respiration. Another source of waste is uneaten food or plants and fish which have died. These waste products collect in the tanks and contaminate the water. As the degree of contamination rises, the risk to the health of the aquaria increases and removal of the contamination becomes critical. Filtration is a common method used for maintenance of healthy aquaria.\n\nProper management of the nitrogen cycle is a vital element of a successful aquarium. Excretia and other decomposing organic matter produce ammonia which is highly toxic to fish. Bacterial processes oxidize this ammonia into the slightly less toxic nitrites, and these are in turn oxidized to form the much less toxic nitrates. In the natural environment these nitrates are subsequently taken up by plants as fertilizer and this does indeed happen to some extent in an aquarium planted with real plants.\n\nAn aquarium is, however, an imperfect microcosm of the natural world. Aquariums are usually much more densely stocked with fish than the natural environment. This increases the amount of ammonia produced in the relatively small volume of the aquarium. The bacteria responsible for breaking down the ammonia colonize the surface of any objects inside the aquarium. In most cases, a biological filter is nothing more than a chemically inert porous sponge, which provides a greatly enlarged surface area on which these bacteria can develop. These bacterial colonies take several weeks to form, during which time the aquarium is vulnerable to a condition commonly known as \"new tank syndrome\" if stocked with fish too quickly. Some systems incorporate bacteria capable of converting nitrates into nitrogen gas.\n\nAccumulation of toxic ammonia from decomposing wastes is the largest cause of fish mortality in new, poorly maintained, or overloaded aquariums. In the artificial environment of the aquarium, the nitrogen cycle effectively ends with the production of nitrates. In order that the nitrate level does not build up to a harmful level regular partial water changes are required to remove the nitrates and introduce new, uncontaminated water.\n\nThe process of mechanical filtration removes particulate material from the water column. This particulate matter may include uneaten food, feces or plant or algal debris. Mechanical filtration is typically achieved by passing water through materials which act as a sieve, physically trapping the particulate matter. Removal of solid waste can be as simple as physical hand netting of debris, and/or involve highly complex equipment. All removal of solid wastes involve filtering water through some form of mesh in a process known as mechanical filtration. The solid wastes are first collected, and then must be physically removed from the aquarium system. Mechanical filtration is ultimately ineffective if the solid wastes are not removed from the filter, and are allowed to decay and dissolve in the water.\n\nDissolved wastes are more difficult to remove from the water. Several techniques, collectively known as chemical filtration, are used for the removal of dissolved wastes, the most popular being the use of activated carbon and foam fractionation. To a certain extent, healthy plants extract dissolved chemical wastes from water when they grow, so plants can serve a role in the containment of dissolved wastes.\n\nA final and less common situation requiring filtration involves the desire to sterilize water-borne pathogens. This sterilization is accomplished by passing aquarium water through filtration devices which expose the water to high intensity ultraviolet light and/or exposing the water to dissolved ozone gas.\n\nNumerous materials are suitable as aquarium filtration media. These include synthetic wools, known in the aquarium hobby as filter wool, made of polyethylene terephthalate or nylon. Synthetic sponges or foams, various ceramic and sintered glass and silicon products along with igneous gravels are also used as mechanical filter materials. Materials with a greater surface area provide both mechanical and biological filtration. Some filter materials, such as plastic \"bioballs\", are best used for biological filtration.\n\nWith the notable exception of diatom filters, aquarium filters are rarely purely mechanical in action, as bacteria will colonise most filter materials effecting some degree of biological filtration. Activated carbon and zeolites are also frequently added to aquarium filters. These highly porous materials act as adsorbates binding various chemicals to their large external surfaces and also as sites of bacterial colonisation.\n\nThe simplest type of aquarium filter consists only of filter wool and activated carbon. The filter wool traps large debris and particles, and the activated carbon adsorbs smaller impurities. These should be changed regularly at suitable intervals. This is particularly important in the case of activated carbon filters, which may re-release their adsorbed contents in large (and therefore harmful) doses if they are allowed to saturate. Activated carbon adsorbs toxins on the extended porous surface of the carbon. It cannot be reactivated by boiling in water. The adsorption of activated carbon can be restored by thermal regeneration at temperatures of 500–900 °C (932–1,652 °F), electrochemical regeneration, ultrasound, or other industrial processes. For the aquarist, replacing the activated carbon with fresh material is simple and inexpensive.\n\nNumerous types of aquarium filters are commercially available, including:\n\nPower or HOB (hang on back) filters, typically powered by an impeller, remove water from the aquarium, which is then pushed (or pulled) through a series of different filter media and returned to the aquarium. These are the most common filter. They are usually more effective and easier to maintain than internal filters.\n\nAdvantages of this type of filter are that they allow for a selection of different types of filter media depending on the tank needs, and that they are easy to clean without disturbing the inhabitants of the tank because they sit on the outside of the fish tank. Disadvantages of power filters include their smaller capacity for filter media compared to canister filters, and noise resulting from vibrations.\n\nCompared to filters that hang on the back of the aquarium, canister-style external filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).\n\nBenefits of this type of filter are that they can provide a high volume of filter material without reducing the internal space in the aquarium, and that they can be disconnected from the tank for cleaning/maintenance and replaced without disturbing the aquarium interior or occupants. Also, as a filter with external plumbing, it supports in-line installation of other aquarium equipment, such as water heaters and carbon dioxide diffusers. Such equipment can be removed from the tank and installed in-line into the return pipe of the filter. Disadvantages of canister filters include the increased cost and complexity relative to internal filters and difficulties in cleaning the tubes which transfer water to and from the aquarium. There is also the risk of a leak, which naturally is an issue for any filter placed outside of the aquarium.\n\nCanister filters were initially designed to filter drinking water, under low pressure. Canister filters for aquariums use high water pressure, from a properly powered pump, to force water through the dense filter media. A pump can draw water from an under-gravel filter, and run it into a canister for double filtration.\n\nDiatom filters are used only for sporadic cleaning of tanks, they are not continuously operated on aquariums. These filters utilise diatomaceous earth to create an extremely fine filter down to 1 µm which removes particulate matter from the water column.\n\nTrickle filters, also known as wet/dry filters are another water filtration systems for marine and freshwater aquariums. This filter comes in two configurations, one which is placed on top of the aquarium (more rarely seen) and one which is placed below the aquarium (more common).\n\nIf the wet/dry filter is placed on top of the aquarium, water is pumped over a number of perforated trays containing filter wool or some other filter material. The water trickles through the trays, keeping the filter wool wet but not completely submerged, allowing aerobic bacteria to grow and aiding biological filtration. The water returns to the aquarium like rain.\n\nAlternatively, the wet/dry filter may be placed below the tank. In this design, water is fed by gravity to the filter below the aquarium. Prefiltered water is delivered to a perforated plate (drip plate). Prefiltering may take place in the aquarium via a foam block or sleeve in the overflow, or weir siphon, or it may be prefiltered by filter wool resting on the perforated plate. The waste laden water from the aquarium spreads over the drip plate, and rains down through a medium. This may be a filter wool/plastic grid rolled into a circular shape (DLS or \"Double Layer Spiral\") or any number of plastic media commonly known as Bio Balls. As the water cascades over the media, CO is given off, oxygen is picked up, and bacteria convert the waste from the tank into less harmful materials. From here the water enters the sump. The sump may contain a number of compartments, each with its own filtration material. Often, heaters and thermostats are placed in the sump.\n\nAlgae may be grown purposely, which removes chemicals from the water which need to be removed in order to have healthy fish, invertebrates and corals. This is a natural (\"green\") filtering method, which lets an aquarium operate the way oceans and lakes operate.\n\nAlgae and disease-causing organisms can also be removed by treating the water with ultraviolet irradiation, but the drawback of UV is that it will kill beneficial bacteria as well. Therefore, UV treatment is typically used only when needed, and not all the time.\n\nBaffle filters are similar to wet and dry, trickle filters in that they are generally situated below the aquarium. This type of filter consists of a series of baffles that the water must pass through in order to reach the pump which is returning water to the aquarium. These baffles then act much like a series of canister filters and can be filled with different filter media for different purposes.\n\nThe fluidized bed filter (FBF) is a biological reactor only. The principle is to direct water through a sand (or similar media) bed from below so that the sand becomes fluidized – behaves like a fluid. This mechanism is seen in liquefaction, quick sand, and industrial processes including municipal sewage treatment. The combined surface of all sand particles in the filter is very large, and so there is a large surface for aerobic denitrification bacteria. Therefore, the size of the filter can be modest.\n\nThe filter itself can be internal or external. In its simplest DIY internal version an FBF is very easy to build, with a container, sand, pump, and some plumbing. There are many variables: shape and size of the container, quantity of sand or equivalent, particle sizes, the pump's power, and plumbing.\n\nInternal filters are, by definition, filters within the confines of the aquarium. These include the sponge filter, variations on the corner filter (pictured top right and left), foam cartridge filter and the undergravel filter. An internal filter may have an electric pump and thus be an internal power filter, often attached to the inside of aquaria via suction cups.\n\nSponge filters and corner filters (sometimes called box filters) work by essentially the same mechanism as an internal filter. Both generally work by airlift, using bubbles from an air pump rising in a tube to create flow. In a sponge filter, the inlet may only be covered by a simple open-cell block of foam. A corner filter is slightly more complex. These filters are often placed in the corner on the bottom of the aquarium. Water enters slits in the box, passes through a layer of medium, then exits through the airlift tube to return to the aquarium. These filters tend to only be suitable for small and lightly stocked aquaria. The sponge filter is especially useful for rearing fry where the sponge prevents the small fish from entering the filter.\n\nOne of the oldest types of filters, the undergravel filters consist of a porous plate which is placed beneath the gravel on the base of the aquarium and one, or more, uplift tubes. Historically, undergravel filters have been driven via air displacement. Air stones are placed at the base of uplift tubes which force water out of the uplift tube creating negative pressure beneath the undergravel filter plate (also called the plenum). Water then percolates down through the gravel which itself is the filtration material. Greater flow rate of water through the gravel can be achieved via the use of water pump rather than air displacement.\n\nBeneficial bacteria colonize the gravel bed and provide biological filtration, using the substrate of the aquarium itself as a biological filter.\n\nUndergravel filters can be detrimental to the health of aquatic plants. Fine substrates such as sand or peat may clog an undergravel filter. Undergravel filters are not effective if the substrate bed is uneven. In an uneven gravel bed, water will flow only through the thin portions of the bed, leaving the more heavily covered areas to become anoxic.\n"}

The term \"heroic bloodshed\" was coined by editor Rick Baker in the magazine \"Eastern Heroes\" in the late 1980s, specifically referring to the styles of directors John Woo and Ringo Lam. Baker defined the genre as \"a Hong Kong action film that features a lot of gun play and gangsters rather than kung fu. Lots of blood. Lots of action.\" Woo's breakthrough film \"A Better Tomorrow\" (1986) largely set the template for the genre. Woo has also been a major influence in its continued popularity and evolution in his following works, namely \"A Better Tomorrow 2\" (1987), \"The Killer\" (1989) and \"Hard Boiled\" (1992).\n\nThe heroic bloodshed genre had a considerable impact on world cinema, including Hollywood, in the 1990s. Woo introduced his brand of heroic bloodshed to Hollywood in the 1990s. Lam's \"City on Fire\" (1987) inspired Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992); Tarantino was an admirer of the heroic bloodshed genre. \"The Killer\" also heavily influenced Luc Besson’s \"\" (1994).\n\nProtagonists in these films are often good-willed criminals, typically Triad members, hit men, or thieves with a strict code of ethics, which in some cases leads to the betrayal of their employers and the saving of many intended victims. The police officer with a conscience, who cannot be corrupted in any way, is also common, and is usually modeled after the hardboiled detective. Loyalty, family and brotherhood are the most typical themes of the genre. Heroic bloodshed films generally have a strong emotional angle, not only between, but during action sequences.\n\nPistols and submachine guns are frequently utilized by the heroes due to the light weight they provide, enabling their wielders to move more quickly. They are frequently dual wielded. The heroes are extremely agile and implement rolls, dives, slides, and falls while they duel, making for a graceful, ballet-like performance in the midst of gunfire.\n\nHeroic bloodshed films often end on a downbeat or tragic note with the main heroes either dead, arrested by the police, or severely incapacitated.\n\n\n"}

On June 21, 2005, it was chosen as #37 on the American Film Institute list, AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes. Schwarzenegger uses the same line, or some variant of it, in many of his later films.\n\nSchwarzenegger first used the line in \"The Terminator.\" In the scene, his character, the Terminator, a cyborg assassin, is refused entry to the police station where his target is housed. He surveys the counter, then tells the police sergeant: \"I'll be back.\" Moments later, he drives a car into the station, destroying the counter, and massacres the staff.\n\nIn an October 1, 2012, interview on \"Good Morning America\", Schwarzenegger revealed that he had had difficulty pronouncing the word \"I'll\" and asked director James Cameron if it could be changed to \"I will be back\". Cameron refused but told him that the shot would be taken more than once and the best would be used in the final cut of the film so Schwarzenegger could vary the line.\n\nVariations of the line have been used by Schwarzenegger in a number of other films in which he appears.\n\n\nIn addition to being the Terminator's catchphrase, Schwarzenegger has used it as his personal catchphrase in many of his other films.\n\n\nSchwarzenegger has since used the phrase during public speeches as part of his career as the governor of the U.S. state of California.\n\nThe same phrase was used in the 1982 National Lampoon's comedy \"Class Reunion\", and was also spoken with a thick eastern European accent. The vampire character Egon Von Stoker, played by Jim Staahl, attempts to pick up a woman at the bar in the main hall, and upon rejection, responds with \"I'll be back\" in a tone and accent similar to Schwarzenegger, although somewhat less aggressive. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "44310262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44310262", "title": "Indignation (word)", "text": "Indignation (word)\n\nThe word indignation is used to describe strong displeasure at something considered unjust, offensive, insulting or unrighteous.\n\nThe term was coined in France during the 12th Century. It comes from the Latin word \"indignationem\", meaning displeasure. In nominative form, \"indignationem\" is \"indignatio\". \"Indignation\" is a noun of action from the past participle stem of \"indignari\", meaning unworthy, to be angry at, or to be displeased with.\n\nAccording to Cicero’s \"De Inventione\", Book I, “indignation is a kind of speech by which the effect produced is, that great hatred is excited against a man, or dislike of some proceeding is originated.” The goal is for the speaker to create anger projected towards the opponent or the accused such that the speaker is seen more positively than the opponent. One of the features of \"indignatio\" is that it cannot function without a target of displeasure. To successfully employ the technique, the speaker must have a target, an audience with which the speaker identifies, and a desired reaction. If a speaker achieves a reaction from the audience in which they are displeased with his opponent, then the speaker has successfully employed \"indignation\".\n\nAristotle wrote in his Book II, Chapter 9, “indignation is the emotion most directly opposed to pity.” Aristotle also writes “Indignation is pain caused by the sight of undeserved good fortune.” The terms indignation and indignatio are closely related in part by their common negative emotionality and anger. A speaker may successfully employ indignatio and the audience will feel indignation towards the opponent.\n"}

He appeared as a participant on many game shows that featured celebrities, including \"Funny You Should Ask\", \"Match Game\", \"Celebrity Bowling\", \"Celebrity Sweepstakes\", and \"Break the Bank\" (1976).\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s, Murray had acting roles in episodes of many TV comedy and drama series, including \"Dr. Kildare\", \"The Lucy Show\", \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\", \"The Name of the Game\", \"Love, American Style\", \"Mannix\", \"\", \"Fantasy Island\", \"The Fall Guy\", and \"Hardcastle and McCormick\". He appeared playing himself on a 1962 episode of the police comedy \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" and also played himself on a 1964 episode of the courtroom drama \"The Defenders.\" In 1977, he appeared in the final episode of the NBC situation comedy \"The Practice\". His last TV acting role was as \"Uncle Raymond\" on a 1989 episode of \"My Two Dads\".\n\nMurray also occasionally acted in films, including \"Of Love and Desire\" (1963), \"Who Killed Teddy Bear?\" (1965), \"The Busy Body\" (1967), \"Tarzan and the Great River\" (1967), \"Thunder Alley\" (1967), \"A Man Called Dagger\" (1968), \"Which Way to the Front?\" (1970), \"The Day of the Wolves\" (1971), \"Roll, Freddy, Roll!\" (1974 TV movie), \"The Dream Merchants\" (1980 TV miniseries), and Mel Brooks' \"History of the World, Part I\" (1981).\n\nFor his career achievements, Murray received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was also dedicated to him.\n\nMurray married Pearl Cohen in 1939, and had a child with her, but later divorced. In October 1949, he married Kathleen (Toni) Mann, had three children with her, and remained married to her until his death. Murray's production company, Jantone, took its name from their first names.\n\nMurray was an ardent golfer and had many fellow comedian partners. Among them were Jack Carter, Jerry Lewis, Joey Bishop and others, from whom he created comedy routines often related at various golf charity events. He chaired the Comedians' Golf Classic for several years, held both in New York and California.\n\nMurray retired from show business at the age of 83, as he felt his asthma was affecting his timing. He died at the age of 89 in Beverly Hills, California, on July 2, 2006. He was buried at the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n\n"}

The standard awards list nominees in each category from which a winner is selected. Twenty-eight Grammys were awarded in the first award ceremony, but the number of awards has grown and fluctuated over time as new categories are added and some older ones removed; at one time, over one hundred awards were given.\n\nThere are special awards which are awarded without nominations, typically for achievements of longer than the past year, which the standard awards apply to:\n\nThe General Field (also known as the 'Big Four') are four standard awards for musical works which do not restrict nominees by genre or some other criterion:\n\nAs of the 2018 ceremony, there are 84 categories, including the General Field but not including special awards.\n\n2012\n\nOn April 6, 2011 the Recording Academy announced a major overhaul of many Grammy Award categories. In 2012, the number of categories fell from 109 to 78. Some categories were discontinued, others were merged or renamed.\n\n2013\n\nOn June 8, 2012, the Academy announced a few changes , including the addition of three new categories: Best Classical Compendium, Best Latin Jazz Album and Best Urban Contemporary Album. This meant the number of categories in 2013 rose to 81.\n\nAccording to the Academy, the Best Classical Compendium is \"for an album collection containing (...) newly recorded material of performances (vocal or instrumental) by various soloist(s) and/or ensemble(s) involving a mixture of classical subgenres.\" Albums entered in this category cannot be entered in other classical album categories, but individual tracks can.\n\nThe intent for the newly formed Best Latin Jazz Album is \"to recognize recordings that represent the blending of jazz with Latin, Iberian-American, Brazilian, and Argentinean tango music.\"\n\nThe new Best Urban Contemporary Album category is for albums with contemporary songs derivative of R&B. It is for artists who blend contemporary styles with R&B music, such as urban (euro)pop, urban rock and/or urban alternative.\n\nOther changes for the 2013 Grammy Award season were:\n\n2014\n\nChanges were made in 2014. One was the introduction of a new category, Best American Roots Song, which encompasses all subgenres in the American roots music field such as Americana, bluegrass, blues, folk and regional roots music. The award will be presented to the songwriter(s).\nThe Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category, introduced in 2012, was split and recognises metal performances only. It was renamed Best Metal Performance (returning to the situation prior to 2012). Hard rock performances are screened in the Best Rock Performance category, thus losing its own genre award.\nThe two Music Video categories were renamed. The Best Short Form Music Video became the Best Music Video category, while Best Long Form Music Video is now Best Music Film. The rules and description of these two categories did not change. Also new for 2014 was the Music Educator Award. It recognizes \"current educators (kindergarten through college, public and private schools) who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education and who demonstrate a commitment to the broader cause of maintaining music education in the schools.\"\n\n2015\n\nThe Recording Academy introduced further changes beginning on the 2015 ceremony: particularly allowing samples or interpolations of previously written songs in all songwriting categories, most notably the Song of the Year category.\nAdditional changes include:\n\nThe introduction of the changed will push the total number of categories to 83.\n\n2017\n\nIn June 2016, the Grammy organization announced changes to the voting and awarding process.\n\nRecordings released solely through streaming services became eligible to enter the award process. These recordings must be available through streaming platforms. Applicable streaming services are paid subscription, full catalog, on-demand streaming/limited download platforms that have existed as such within the United States for at least one full year as of the submission deadline. All recordings entered must have an assigned International Standard Recording Code (ISRC).\n\nBest New Artist rules were amended to remove the album barrier given trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted; many new artists first release singles, tracks, or EPs rather than full albums. To become eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:\n\nThe Best Blues Album category was split back into two distinct categories, as they were prior to 2012:\n\nThe Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category (in the Rap field) was renamed as Best Rap/Sung Performance to allow solo performances, a result of \"the current state and future trajectory of rap by expanding the category beyond collaborations between rappers and vocalists to include recordings by a solo artist who blurs the lines between rapping and singing.\"\n\nAdditional amendments were made to the number and type of music creators recognized in the categories of Best Choral Performance and Best Jazz Vocal Album.\n"}

{"id": "50400981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50400981", "title": "Musolaphone", "text": "Musolaphone\n\nThe Musolaphone (also marketed as the Multa Musola), developed by the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago, Illinois, was an audio distribution system, which transmitted news and entertainment, over telephone lines, to subscribing homes and business. The company's recently developed \"Automatic Enunciator\" loudspeakers were employed at the receiving end.\n\nA test commercial installation was established in southside Chicago in 1913, but the project was short-lived and did not prove to be financially successful. This was the last significant attempt to set up a \"telephone newspaper\" to transmit entertainment over telephone lines in the United States, prior to the development of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.\n\nIn 1910, the Automatic Electric Company, an established firm best known for making automatic telephone switchboards, announced its development of a new loudspeaker, called the \"Automatic Enunciator\", which was envisioned to have multiple potential uses. In part, Joseph Harris, president of the company, predicted: \"An automatic enunciator, by which a man talking in New York can be heard in every part of a large room in Chicago... may make it possible for a public speaker to address a million or more people at one time... Running descriptions of baseball games, or prize fights can be sent over long distances for the entertainment of sporting fans of all varieties.\"\n\nIn 1910 the Automatic Enunciator Company was formed in Chicago to market the invention. Initially, Automatic Enunciators were employed in public address systems, for making announcements in establishments such as department stores, factories, and railroad stations. In 1913, multiple units were installed throughout the Comiskey Park baseball field in Chicago, both for announcements and to provide musical interludes.\n\nThe next step was to expand the system to distribute programming to multiple sites, initially under the name \"Multa Musola\". Company publicity included the following description: \"The object of the Multa Musola service is to distribute music by telephone wires from an instrument at the central office, so it can be easily heard in any part of a room without having to listen carefully.\"\n\nThe summer of 1912 saw a series of Multa Musola demonstrations in Portland, Oregon, and in the spring of the next year, advertisements for the Oregon Enunciator Company appeared, promoting both home and business service. This would have competed with another telephone-based news and entertainment service, the Oregon Telephone Herald Company's \"telephone newspaper\", but there is no evidence that the Multa Musola system ever began operation. Moreover, later that year, Oregon's Corporation Commissioner, R. A. Watson, acting under the state's \"Blue Sky\" law, prohibited both the Oregon Enunciator Company and the Oregon Telephone Herald Company from doing business in the state, due to concern about their financial viability.\n\nHowever, an experimental commercial Musolaphone service was established in south-side Chicago in 1913, working in conjunction with the Illinois Telephone & Telegraph Co. Two features that were superior to the Telephone Herald \"telephone newspaper\" systems was that listening was done over loudspeakers instead of headphones, and the system did not need dedicated, separate telephone lines, because \"as soon as connection is made in the telephone exchange to the subscriber's line upon which the service is being given, the other equipment is automatically disconnected. When the subscriber desires to use the telephone, disconnection from the Musolaphone service, as it is called, is obtained by the operation of a push button installed at the telephone instrument\". John J. Comer, former General Manager of a similarly designed Tel-musici installation at Wilmington, Delaware, was described as the inventor.\n\nAn early 1914 report reviewed the Chicago Musolaphone's daily schedule:\n\"From eight to twelve in the morning, announcement of special bargain sales at the leading stores is made, and the principal news items are read from the morning papers including the United States weather report, stock market quotations, announcements of special events happening during the day, etc. At twelve o'clock the announcement of standard Western Union time is made. From twelve to one-thirty is given up to a musical program, especially adapted to cafes, restaurants, dining rooms, etc., and following this is a running description of ball games of the home team and scores by innings of other teams in both leagues during the baseball season. In winter lectures by prominent people will be obtainable besides language lessons in French, German, Italian, etc., and a period will be set aside for the reading of children's stories. A half hour's music for dancing will be offered each evening.\"\n\nSubscribers were charged $3 a week for the service. (For comparison, at this time issues of the \"Chicago Tribune\" newspaper cost one cent on weekdays and five cents on Sundays.) Eventually interactive communication was established, as one report stated: \"There is in Chicago a teacher of languages whose pupils have grown so in number recently that personal attention to each pupil has come to be out of the question. An arrangement was made with the Automatic Company's studio for connections and service and now the lessons are all transmitted by telephones, service can be cut in any time for the purpose of asking questions or more information on certain points and in all ways the telephone service proves as flexible as the ordinary arrangement in a studyroom.\"\n\nA challenge was submitted to the Chicago Counsel about the legality of the Musolaphone's operation on Sundays, and the fact that the telephone company was partnering with a service that charged extra beyond the normal telephone rental fees, but a ruling did not sustain either of these objections. An additional complaint was made to the City of Chicago by \"a prominent news bureau... which protested that the music interfered with the news service\". Again the city ruled in favor of the Musolaphone operation, while further noting that \"The company, however, discontinued the music service.\"\n\nIn early 1914, it was announced that the Federal Telephone Company of Buffalo, New York was planning to establish its own Musolaphone service, but it appears that no other systems were ever established. However, Automatic Enunciator loudspeakers continued to be marketed, with the emphasis returning to their use in public address systems. The Automatic Enunciator Company was dissolved in 1926.\n"}

The song has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. The current version was composed by Ramón Carnicer, with words by Eusebio Lillo, and has six parts plus the chorus.\n\nThe first Chilean National Anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on the 19th of July, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.\n\nThe composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their \"National Song\" debuted on 20 August 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.\n\nIn the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was requested that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country.\n\nThe doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.\n\nThis first hymn was sung until 1828, when it was replaced with what is sung today.\n\nThe second Chilean National Anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ramón Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.\n\nThe Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in Santiago, in the Arteaga theater, 23 December 1828.\n\nYears later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by Andrés Bello, retained the original chorus (\"Dulce patria, recibe los votos...\"). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1909.\n\nDuring the military government (1973–1990) of Augusto Pinochet, the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabiners). After the end of Pinochet's regime, in 1990, it was only sung in military events. Supporters from the former military regime also sing the anthem with the Verse III in private ceremonies and rallies.\n\nIn the celebrations marking the return of democracy in March 1990 at Santiago's Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos, the anthem was played in its present melody, raised to F Major (the Royal Musical Official Version of the anthem) which is the original melody of the second anthem by Carnicer, but using the 1847 lyrics as text, save for the original chorus of the 1819 anthem. This was the version that from 1991 to 2013 was played during sign-on and sign-off broadcasts of Chilean television stations. Now the anthem is played in C Major during sign-on and sign-off.\n\nJoe Walsh, famed musician who was part of the United States rock band the Eagles, sang the National Anthem of Chile at a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball game in 2003.\n\nBelow are the lyrics of the most played version; it corresponds to Verse V of the full version and the chorus:\nFull National Anthem According to Chilean Constitution (Only Verse V and the chorus are played officially as the National Anthem [decree 260])\n\nThe following lyrics were used during the military regime in the country. Both the 5th and 3rd verses were used.\n\n"}
{"id": "25784961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25784961", "title": "Nordvision", "text": "Nordvision\n\nNordvision is a cooperative venture, established in 1959, between seven Nordic public service broadcasters: Denmark's DR, Norway's NRK, Iceland's RÚV, Sweden's SVT, SR and UR, and Finland's YLE. Greenland's KNR and the Faroe Islands' Kringvarp Føroya are associate members.\n\nNordvision's main task is the co-production and exchange of television programmes. It has its secretariat in Copenhagen, at DR Byen.\n\nThe founding of Nordvision was primarily based on cultural rather than economic incentives. The Nordic countries are important potential markets for one another's productions. One of the original thoughts was to take advantage of the similarity of the Scandinavian languages, even if in practice, while the languages are closely related, they are too far apart to be fully understood without subtitles when television series are broadcast to the audiences in neighbouring countries. Nevertheless, other cultural similarities and the tradition of Nordic collaboration have favoured production and distribution of television programmes across Nordic countries.\n\nTelevision was introduced in Western Europe in the early 1950s but came late to most Nordic countries. Denmark started regular broadcasts in 1954, Sweden in 1956, Finland in 1957, while Norway did not begin until 1960. Sweden, Finland and Norway have a large territory but a relatively small population, and one reason for the late introduction of television was related to the feasibility a transmitter system that would provide the majority of the population with access. Moreover, the government policy for example in Sweden concentrated efforts and financial resources on the construction of a network of stations rather than on increasing programming hours. Thus, a regional programme exchange was also seen as a solution to programme supply, particularly in categories with high productions costs, such as entertainment and drama. In this context, television was seen as having a potential to make a major contribution towards developing and fostering Nordic cooperation. Whilst the more extensive European exchange system Eurovision already existed since 1955, the programming it provided was focused on sports, news and cultural events, due to the technological constraints posed by live transmissions and language differences as it would not have been possible to provide subtitles. Mainly because of the late start of television in Norway, Nordvision began later than its wider European counterpart. Denmark and Sweden had begun cooperating in TV production as early as the summer of 1958, but the official start of the Nordic exchange did not take place until October 1959.\n\nIn contrast to Eurovision, the Nordvision exchange programmes also included light entertainment and popular music series, helping to make popular culture from the Nordic countries familiar across national borders.\n\nMembers:\n\nAssociate members:\n\nNordvision hosts six programme groups where the co-production and programme collaboration take place on a practical level: Children, culture, drama, knowledge, factual and investigative journalism.\n\nSome of the most well-known Nordvision co-productions include:\n\nThe Nordvision Fund, established in 1988, is an important financing source for major drama productions. The Fund gets its revenues from cable distribution of TV programmes from the partners in the Nordic countries. The Fund's money is earmarked for Nordic co-productions and joint projects, and aims at strengthening the Nordic cultural cooperation and to stimulate the use of Nordic authors and performing artists.\n\nThe Nordic cooperation also contains a number of expert groups who meet regularly to exchange experience and knowledge. This collaboration encompasses several aspects, such as corporate strategy, program development, scheduling and copyright.\n\n\n"}

Vultan and his people dwell in Sky City, a metropolis that floats in the sky. Prince Vultan starts his career as a half-villain (he resents Ming's domination but does not oppose it out of fear of reprisal) with a lecherous side (he lusts after Earth woman Dale Arden). However, after Zarkov saves his city he reforms into one of Flash Gordon's greatest allies. His character fits the stereotype of the barrel-chested chieftain with more than a hint of the pirate captain or the viking reaver in it, endowed with a booming voice and a great appetite for life, food and women. In the original comic, he has several wives, one of whom tries to kill Dale, as she is jealous of her. He claims to have become King of Sky City after winning one of the Tournaments of Mongo. When Ming tries to take Flash, Vultan calls for a Tournament of Mongo. It is revealed that with Emperor Ming and King Jugrid of the Lion Men he is one of the three most powerful rulers on Mongo. When Flash is given the unconquered Kingdom of Caves by Ming,Vultan sends a party of Hawkmen under Captain Khan to help Flash conquer his Kingdom. The Hawkmen later come into conflict with Queen Azura and her Blue Magic Men. The image of the Hawkmen descending to attack Azura's army (from the June 16, 1935 storyline) is one of the most reproduced scenes from the \"Flash Gordon\" strip.\n\nVultan and the other Hawkmen provoked some controversy at the time of publication. Some Christian leaders regarded the characters as blasphemous because they resembled angels.\n\nIn the 1936 film serial, he was portrayed by Jack Lipson (1901-1947).\n\nAllan Melvin provided Vultan's voice in the 1979 Filmation animated series. He is referred to here as King Vultan, not Prince. His Sky City is a marvel of Mongo technology, as the massive construct is suspended miles above ground by beams of polarized anti-gravity light. Unlike Prince Barin's kingdom of Arboria, Vultan's Hawkmen do not make use of airships in battle. Instead, they fly under their own power or ride giant warbirds armed with harness-mounted energy cannons.\n\nHe was portrayed by Brian Blessed in the cult 1980 film \"Flash Gordon\". For the film's soundtrack by the rock group Queen, Freddie Mercury composed a song called \"Vultan's Theme\". At the end, he is appointed the General of the Armies when Prince Barin is revealed as the rightful ruler of Mongo.\n\nIn the 1996 \"Flash Gordon\" animated series, Vultan is a somewhat conservative leader, and reluctant to act against Ming for fear of reprisals against his people. His role as Flash's ally is taken by his teenage son, Prince Talon.\n\nIn the 2007 television series, Vultan appears as the leaders of a group of nomadic mercenaries called Dactyls (a variation of the Hawkmen). In the episode, \"Ascension\", Vultan travels to Earth, using Princess Aura's rift key. He kidnaps a teenage boy who he claims is his son. He is played by Ty Olsson.\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the animated sitcom \"Family Guy\" called \"Road to Germany\", Brian, Stewie and Mort enlist the help of Vultan's Hawkman Army in a dogfight over Europe against the Luftwaffe. Blessed returns to voice Vultan briefly during the episode.\n"}

The festival has been attended by celebrities such as Robert De Niro, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Emile Hirsch, Orlando Bloom, Daniel Craig, Danny Glover, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Oliver Stone, John Cleese, Steve Buscemi, Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons, Bono Vox, Nick Cave, Coolio, Stephen Frears, Mickey Rourke, Michael Moore, Gérard Depardieu, Darren Aronofsky, Sophie Okonedo, Gillian Anderson, Kevin Spacey, Eric Cantona, Benicio del Toro and many others.\n\nBy 2001, the European Film Association made the Sarajevo Film Festival one of the eleven festivals that could nominate a film for the award of \"Europe's Best Short Film\". The 2001 winner of the Sarajevo Film Festival, Danis Tanović's \"No Man's Land\", went on to win an Oscar in the United States. In 2004, the Best Movie Award was named \"The Heart of Sarajevo\".\n\nBeginning with the 13th Sarajevo Film Festival in 2007 and in cooperation with the Berlin International Film Festival and Berlinale Talent Campus, the Sarajevo Talent Campus has been added to the festival. In 2014, Sarajevo Talent Campus gets a new name and at the 20th Sarajevo Film Festival it is named \"Talents Sarajevo\". Talents Sarajevo is an educational and creative platform for up and coming young film professionals, and has eventually come to be revered as the most prestigious film training event in the region.\n\nThe festival also features CineLink, a year-long project development program resulting in an annual co-production market during the festival dates. The CineLink Market each year presents about 10 finest regional projects for feature-length fiction films, also offering festival guests a special opportunity to meet with the assembled regional industry, with emphasis on young filmmakers, producers and directors presenting their latest projects, productions and works in progress, with highlights of the regional production presented to international distributors, TV-buyers and festival programmers, making CineLink the most important international market place for new features from Southeast Europe.\n\nThe first edition of CineLink, which was part of the 9th Sarajevo Film Festival, was held in 2003. Of the 91 entries from across the region, a three-member jury, Philippe Bober, Behrooz Hashemian and Čedomir Kolar, producers whose films have won awards at all the major international film festivals such as Cannes, Venice, Rotterdam and Berlin, chose six winning, and the winners were: \"Bare Skin\" (\"The Abandoned\") - Zlatko Topčić, \"Bosnian Pot\" - Vedran Fajković, \"Slowly\" - Nikola Mišić, \"Total Privat\" - Nedžad Begović, \"Roses for Tosca\" - Branko Đurić, Simona Stražisar and \"Last Day\" - Namik Kabil.\n\n\n\nTalents Sarajevo is a program launched in 2007, under the name Sarajevo Talent Campus, in co-operation with the Berlin International Film Festival and the Berlinale Talent Campus. Talents Sarajevo is an educational and networking platform for emerging film talents from South-Eastern European region (Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Slovenia, Serbia and Turkey). Each year, more than two hundred applications are received, and only eighty are carefully chosen to attend a six-day training led by some of the most prominent film professionals in the world. In addition to meeting other filmmakers and film professionals, young filmmakers are introduced to the work of established film professionals, informed about current trends and issues in the industry, and introduced to the international filmmaking community.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55626725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55626725", "title": "Taiwan Film Institute", "text": "Taiwan Film Institute\n\nThe Taiwan Film Institute (TFI; ) is a foundation in Zhongzheng District, Taipei, Taiwan which aims at preserving Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese films.\n\nPlans for a national film archive were first proposed in 1967 by the Cultural Bureau of the Ministry of Education. Two years later, drafting of the Film Archive Establishment Act began. However, the Cultural Bureau was shut down in 1973, and the film archive project was placed on hold. Oversight of Taiwanese cinema was delegated to the Government Information Office (GIO). The Motion Picture Development Foundation, which had been established in 1975 with help from the GIO and the Taipei Film Business Association, announced in 1978 that a film library would be funded via the GIO. The Film Library of the Motion Picture Development Foundation opened on 19 January 1979. The film library later became responsible for hosting the Golden Horse Awards ceremony. It was renamed the National Film Archive in 1989, shortly before its founding director Hsu Li-kong left his post. Hsu's successor Ray Jing ended the archive's involvement with the Golden Horse Awards. Additionally, the name change brought with it a new mission. Jing began compiling old Taiwanese Hokkien films and other artifacts of the Taiwanese film industry, choosing to set aside the cultural education of the public. In 1991, the National Film Archive split from the Motion Picture Development Foundation, and was placed under the purview of the National Film Archive Foundation shortly thereafter. The foundation itself answered to the Department of Motion Picture Affairs, a division of the Government Information Office. The National Film Archive sought membership in the International Federation of Film Archives in 1992. Membership was granted in 1995, after the archive became the Chinese Taipei Film Archive. On 28 July 2014, the Ministry of Culture replaced it with the Taiwan Film Institute. The TFI was launched in a ceremony attended by culture minister Lung Ying-tai and New Taipei Mayor Eric Chu. On 26 December 2016, the institute launched an online box office, an attempt to increase the transparency of the Taiwanese film industry. In July 2017, it launched its film restoration laboratory.\n\n\nThe film institute also holds film preservation with other institute outside Taiwan. It regularly holds movie screenings and exhibitions on films, as well as film compilation. It also invites renowned move experts to teach at the institute. The institute has also been promoting movies to elementary and secondary schools in Taiwan.\n\nThe organization is accessible within walking distance south of Shandao Temple Station of Taipei Metro.\n\n"}

{"id": "8245873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8245873", "title": "The Sims 3", "text": "The Sims 3\n\nThe Sims 3 is the third major title in the life simulation video game developed by The Sims Studio (Maxis) and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to \"The Sims 2\". It was announced that it was in development for PlayStation 3 and Wii in November 2006, and later announced for OS X and Microsoft Windows. It was first released on June 2, 2009 simultaneously for OS X and Microsoft Windows – both versions on the same disc. Smartphone versions were also released on June 2, 2009. Console versions were released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS in October 2010 and a month later for the Wii. The Windows Phone version was made available on the Windows Phone Store on October 15, 2010. A Nintendo 3DS version, released on March 27, 2011, was one of its launch titles.\n\n\"The Sims 3\" was a commercial success, selling 1.4 million copies in its first week. Critics issued mostly positive reviews, with a 86/100 score from aggregator Metacritic. The game has sold over ten million copies worldwide since its 2009 release, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all time. The last of eleven expansion packs, \"\", was released in October 2013. A sequel, \"The Sims 4\", was released in September 2014 for PC and in November 2017 for consoles.\n\n\"The Sims 3\" is built upon the same concept as its predecessors. Players control their own Sims' activities and relationships in a manner similar to real life. The game play is open-ended and does not have a defined goal. Challenges occur randomly based on aspects of each Sim's lifestyle, such as relationships, skills and job. Career opportunities such as working overtime or completing special tasks can yield a pay raise, cash bonus, or relationship boost. Skill opportunities are requests by neighbors or community members for Sims to solve problems using their acquired skills for cash or relationship rewards. If the opportunity is connected to a Sim's school, the reward may be increased school performance.\n\nThe new reward system Wishes replaces the Wants And Fears system in its predecessor \"The Sims 2\". Fulfilling a Sim's wish contributes to the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score, allowing players to purchase lifetime rewards for the cost of those Lifetime Happiness points.\n\nThe game includes an optional feature called \"Story Progression\" which allows all Sims in the neighborhood to autonomously continue free will without the player ever controlling those Sims. Sims live for a set duration of time that is adjustable by the player and advance through several life stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder). Sims can die of old age or they can die prematurely from causes such as fire, starvation, drowning, electrocution. Further causes of death were added in the games expansion packs.\n\n\"The Sims 3\" introduces many more character customization options than its predecessor \"The Sims 2\".\n\nThe player has a larger selection of body types for Sims as muscle and body weight sliders have been introduced. However, toddlers do not have the option to have their weight customized. The expansion pack also added sliders for breast size and muscle definition that are also included in the base game. Expanded skin tone options have also been added. Each skin tone can be further customized with a light to dark slider. The player is able to pick their Sim's shoes, a feature previously limited to console versions of The Sims and The Sims 2.\n\nThere are a total of 22 hairstyles for female Sims and 17 hairstyles for male Sims with more available through either expansion packs, stuff packs, The Sims 3 Store or third-party custom content. Hats and accessories may be applied and may also have their colors and textures altered. Each Sim's hair color can be chosen from one of eight basic colors, or the hair color can be customized using a color wheel to choose the base hair color, roots, highlights or tips.\n\nThe Sims 3 offers many more character customization options than its predecessors. With the addition of \"Advanced Mode\", players can focus on single features on a characters body to modify, allowing for detailed customization. Players also have the option of giving freckles, beauty marks, and tattoos to their Sims.\nThere are several skill-dependent abilities, such as more social interactions available from high charisma, special songs for guitar players, and appliance upgrades (self-cleaning, more TV channels, etc.) for high handiness. Sims can begin building skills as early as their toddler days. While skills do not show up in the meter right away, using skill building objects is rewarded once the toddler grows into a child. The basic skills include Logic, Cooking, Painting, Gardening, Writing, Guitar, Athletic, Handiness, Charisma and Fishing. New skills were later added in expansion packs. When Sims reach level 10 of a skill, they will get a certificate in the mail.\n\nEach skill has a tab in the skill journal detailing the level of the skill, statistics, what the challenges are, and sometimes other special information. Various challenges are also available in the skill journal. When a challenge is completed, Sims can earn rewards. All of these rewards earn some kind of benefit, such as quicker completion, better results, etc. With the \"\" expansion pack, the skill journal also shows hidden skills that a Sim has learned.\n\nMany of the careers from \"The Sims 2\", and \"The Sims,\" such as the Law Enforcement and Athletic tracks, are in \"The Sims 3\". The careers in the core game are Business, Culinary, Criminal, Journalism, Law Enforcement, Medical, Military, Music, Political, Science, and Professional Sports. Professions in the \"Ambitions\" expansion pack include Firefighter, Ghost Hunter, Investigator, Architectural Designer, and Stylist. The part-time jobs available include such positions as a Bookstore Clerk, Grocery Store Clerk, Spa Receptionist, Spa Specialist and a Mausoleum Gravedigger. Part-time jobs have a lower pay than full-time jobs and do not give career opportunities. Part-time jobs are also available for teen Sims after they attend school. The \"\" expansion pack also introduced professions, careers that allow the player direct control over their Sims' work and how they spend their days, and the ability for Sims to register at City Hall as self-employed in a skill career.\n\nSims can look for these jobs in the newspaper, the computer, or apply at the \"rabbit hole\" building where they would like to work. Sims are also able to make a living at home through their skills such as selling their own paintings, writing novels, playing guitar for tips, or growing fruit and vegetables. Jobs such as nectar making is also a profession with the Sims 3 World Adventures. Sims can also buy out businesses and receive a percentage of the profits they earn.\n\nAdvancing in a career still depends on mood and skills, but with the addition that relationships with colleagues/boss and even certain goals that have to be fulfilled. Players now have more control as to their Sims work, with the option to \"Work Hard\", \"Take It Easy\", \"Suck Up To Boss\", etc. Depending upon which of these the Sim is directed affects the performance bar. If the performance bar is maxed out, this will help to increase a Sims chances of being promoted.\n\nA new feature \"The Sims 3\" offers is branching careers, which allows Sims to choose a certain path in their career (such as a Sim in the Music career can eventually choose to specialize in Symphonic music or Rock). These branches are generally offered around level 6 of a career, depending on which career the Sim is working.\n\nNeighborhoods are now being officially referred to as 'worlds', or, when moving, towns, possibly due to Electronic Arts' use of the Create a World tool and the neighborhoods scale. Worlds are now 'seamless', open to exploration between lots and are affected by a new game mechanic called story progression. The primary world in the game is Sunset Valley, while an additional world called Riverview can be obtained for free. All expansion packs to date (except and ) have included a world, and additional worlds can be bought at The Sims 3 Store for sim points.\n\nThe Create a World tool allows players to make their own neighborhoods with custom terrains similar to Sim City 4. A game patch, released in conjunction with the release of \"Ambitions\", also allows players to manipulate pre-made neighborhoods to a limited degree, such as adding or removing lots and scenery. As of \"Late Night\", worlds are divided into \"\"Sims 3 Towns\" and \"Late Night Towns\". There seem to be important differences between the two, like the Sims they can spawn, etc. , Bridgeport is the only pre-made world to be cataloged as a city. The rest, including the exotic destinations from \"World Adventures\", are considered suburbs.\n\nOn March 19, 2008, EA revealed open world, a new feature, for \"The Sims 3\". Players can explore the world outside their Sims' homes without having to face strenuous loading times. Every house lot is now synchronized with the main neighborhood time. In previous \"Sims\" games, the time of day was separate and different for each house lot. Players can interact with every building and amenity in a city. Although players are unable to see inside of certain commercial buildings often called rabbitholes (grocery, bookstore, theater, police station, school, etc.), they are able to enter and retain limited control over their Sims' actions while in these locations. The player has complete control in some other commercial buildings – such as the gym, library and the beach house. All occupied residential buildings can be entered in the same manner as a Sims' home, provided that the buildings are not empty or it is not too late at night.\n\nThe build and buy modes have received their own makeover. The square tile outlines that appeared on the ground in previous \"Sims\" games' build and buy modes are now a quarter of their original size to give the player more liberty to place objects where they want. Alternatively, it is possible to place objects freely without square tiles, an option that was missing in previous Sims games. Players can re-color and re-pattern the furniture and other items to specific shades and patterns with the new Create-a-Style and make houses with five levels (basements of up to four floors deep).\n\nBuild mode is one of three modes in \"The Sims 3\". It is used mainly for construction and architectural work. Some items that would be considered to be in build mode, such as counters and lights, are actually in the buy mode section. Build mode can be used to do many things including adding walls, paint/cover walls, add doors and windows, lay down flooring, create foundations and raised decks, create basements by using either foundations or the Basement tool, add columns and supports, create pools, raise and lower land, create ponds, build gardens and landscape a lot, add fireplaces, add additional floors/stories to a building, add stairs, and add a roof. Some expansion packs released after \"The Sims 3\" add extra build mode features such as ceiling construction and designing the terrain, Players cannot build or place objects outside the limits of the lot. Walls and foundations cannot be placed within one tile of the outer limit of the lot. Fences can be placed all the way up to the edge of the lot and all structures built by the players are limited to five above-ground stories as well as four basement levels. Buildings can be modified to appear to be taller than five stories, either using shells (introduced in Late Night) or by use of the constrainfloorelevation false cheat, which disables the requirement for above-ground floors to be uniform in height and level. There will, however, still be only a maximum of five usable above-ground floors. The height of a section of wall is equal to the length of 3-floor squares. This is most noticeable while placing a 45° roof. It is possible that the length of a game tile is 1 meter, and that the height of a section of wall would then be 3 meters.\nIn some situations, Build mode, as well as Buy mode, may become disabled, such as during a fire, burglary, or other major event. This is done to prevent modifications to the lot that may impact or prevent a game event from occurring. After the event has ended, Build and Buy modes will be re-activated. This feature has been an annoyance to many players and is disabled in many mods. Depreciation of objects is visible in \"The Sims 3\". All objects depreciate 10% as soon as the player exits build mode. This adds realism to the game and gives the player limited tries at building before the costs of building use up too much of the funds intended for furnishing and living expenses. When in build mode, players can return items for full value by using the undo tool.\n\nIn Buy mode, the player may purchase items from the catalog, sell objects that are on the current lot, and arrange objects on the current lot. Construction-related elements such as doors, windows, fences, and stairs are not associated with buy mode, but are in build mode. Buy mode largely focuses on furniture and appliances. The descriptions of many of the objects available for purchase in the game (namely the least expensive ones) involve humor, sarcasm, insults towards the player, and wit, and serves as comic relief in the game. For example, one of the cheapest cars available in The Sims 3, the \"Big Lemon\", notes that although the car's doors are jammed and its ignition is faulty, it is still worth buying. Another example is the outdoor entertainment item \"Foot-and-Hand Ball\" used to train the athletic skill, which references and pokes fun at American football, which, despite its name, rarely involves contact with the ball via the feet. A feature that was introduced in The Sims 2 and stays present currently is the eyedropper tool. When the eyedropper tool is pointed at a wall covering, floor covering, or most objects, will show the name of what it's pointed at. Clicking on a wall or floor covering will switch to the appropriate area of build mode and select that covering so it can be applied. Clicking on an object will make an exact duplicate of it, and will focus the catalog on that object. The family inventory is a space where objects that are too large to be held in a Sim's personal inventory are kept. Certain opportunities may make an object available in the Family Inventory. When a Sim family moves, if \"pack furniture\" is selected, all objects in the household will be placed in the Family inventory, to be moved and rearranged in the new house.\n\nIntroduced in patch 42, blueprint mode (a subset of the build mode), allows players to choose from pre-made rooms. A player can place down blueprints anywhere furniture can go, and after \"realizing\" them, have the blueprints automatically laid out.\n\nOn October 29, 2009, Electronic Arts announced \"Create a World\" (CAW), which is a game world editor that allows players to create their own custom cities from scratch for use within the game. Players can customize lots, choose terrain patterns and add roads, vegetation and neighborhood accents (such as water towers and lighthouses). CAW also allows players to import designs from PNG files for use in their worlds. Users can upload their worlds to \"The Sims 3 Exchange\" for download by other players. The editor tool is offered to players as a separate download (156MB), and was released on December 16, 2009 as a beta version. EA will offer technical support and updates. Players are able to share their neighborhoods as with other content. The Create A World tool is currently only available for Windows-based PCs.\n\nElectronic Arts first announced \"The Sims 3\" on March 19, 2008. The game was developed at The Sims Studio located in Redwood Shores, California. On January 15, 2009, EA invited \"some of the best\" custom content creators to their campus at Redwood Shores where they were hosting a Creator's Camp. Creators have been invited to spend the week exploring and creating content like Sims, houses and customized content. The Creators' work was used to pre-populate The Sims 3 Exchange. In the seventh expansion pack for \"The Sims 2\", \"\", an event occurs in which a Sim-version of Rod Humble, the head of The Sims franchise, gives the player's Sim family an unopened gift box. When opened, the family gets a computer with \"The Sims 3\" on it. \"The Sims 3\" game cannot be bought in the catalog. Sims can then play \"The Sims 3\" on their computers or console systems. Like all the other games that Sims can play in \"The Sims 2\", \"The Sims 3\" is a looping gameplay video shown on the player's Sim's computer screens when played by a Sim. On July 15, 2008 the first video preview of \"The Sims 3\" appeared on the official website as did seven new screenshots and five Create-A-Sim screens. Four screenshots that appeared on the website and were then taken down soon after, leaked onto the Internet by a member of the community.\n\nCopies of the video game \"Spore\" also came packaged with fliers advertising the game, with information stating whole-neighborhood accessibility and endless possibilities on character creation. On October 31, 2008, two teaser trailers were released by Electronic Arts featuring a comical view on the 2008 presidential election in the United States. Candidates John McCain and Barack Obama were included along with respective running mates Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. In the eighth expansion pack of \"The Sims 2\", \"\", new objects were added including logo posters and framed screenshots. The game was shipped with a code and an Internet address, where the player could download clothing with \"The Sims 3\" logo on it. Another developer walk through was released on November 6, 2008, featuring in-depth previews of the neighborhood and Create-A-Sim.\n\nOn May 8, 2009, EA announced that \"The Sims 3\" had gone gold meaning that the game had finished beta testing stage and was off for manufacturing ahead of its June 2009 release. On May 15, 2009 EA released some online interactive teaser experiences on \"The Sims 3\" Website, including 'SimFriend', which allows users to choose a virtual Sim Friend who would email them throughout the day. 'SimSocial', which allows users to create their own Sim online, and have an adventure with them. 'SimSidekick', which allows users to surf the web with a sim. Two weeks before the game was scheduled to be released, an unauthorized copy of the digital distribution version of the game leaked onto the Internet. EA later commented the leak was a \"buggy, pre-final\" version. EA claims that more than half of the game is missing and is susceptible to crashes or worse. Reportedly, the title has seen higher copyright infringement rates than that of the most torrented game of 2008, \"Spore\".\n\nThe development team was faced with bringing the game to life and pleasing the community of players who were familiar with the original Sims games and wanted something fresh. In order to get the community involved and bring life into a programmed world they relied on user feedback and inspiration from the real world to harness into a digital space. In order to create the animations in the game, so they look believable but goofy, they shot real life references of people doing tasks in outrageous ways until satisfied with the outcome. \n\nThis use of real world influence can be seen in the where they have three worlds (each world represents China, Egypt, and Paris) and the branded expansion and stuff packs which feature Katy Perry in Sims form and an array of different items themed to candy and food.\n\nThe Sims team also brought in music artists to perform some of their songs in the language of Sims, Simlish. The music taste of Sims is just as diverse in game as it is in real life and the developers sought people from all musical backgrounds to record songs for in game. This not only brings in another real world aspect to the game but it is also an exclusive honor given to those chosen by the development team; these artists have ranged from Katy Perry, Lady Antebellum, Flaming Lips, Damien Marley, Depeche Mode, Nelly Furtado, and even Flo Rida. The recordings for the Simlish versions of the songs can also be found on the official Sims team YouTube channel, The Sims. \n\nThe stories that the developers intertwine in the Sims 3, that the players then interact with, is what also makes the Sims feel more like a simulation of life. The developers understand that \"one of the coolest things about the Sims 3 is that my story is part of a bigger story, the neighborhood is growing and changing around me and my characters and the story I'm telling is affected by that...\" and from all of this cross story mixing comes a new player experience. These stories create immersion in the game for the players and those who play the game can start sharing some of their funny experiences in the game with people in the real world; thus bringing in players who have never even considered playing video games before. \n\nEach character in the game that was specifically created by the developers have their own life story, wishes, dreams, and personalities. The developers spend a lot of time trying to get the world to feel seamless and the characters to feel real but they do not forget about the Sims and homes they populate the game with before release. One of the most well known and even infamous families in The Sims 3 would be The Goths, who have been written into the games lore since the beginning of The Sims in 2000. The players have fallen in love with the mystery and lore of the Goth family and many people have taken it into their own hands to speculate on what really happened to the family. \n\nThe developers want the players to be able to take the game and make their own individual worlds, characters and stories.\n\nIn April 2009, Electronic Arts began to post billboards in many areas in advertisement for the game. Many of the billboards covered skyscrapers in densely populated areas, most notably Times Square in New York City. The costs of these billboards was estimated to be $10 million a month. This marketing campaign proved successful, as \"The Sims 3\" sold 1.4 million copies in its first week, breaking the record for all EA games.\n\nOn March 23, 2009, the look and feel of \"The Sims 3\" was threaded throughout the storyline of an episode of The CW series \"One Tree Hill\". On screen, the episode opens in an idealized Sims version of \"One Tree Hill\" and then transitions into the real Tree Hill. As this episode plays out, Sims versions of popular \"One Tree Hill\" characters are introduced and then morph into the real-life characters, including Dan (Paul Johansson), Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Peyton (Hilarie Burton).\n\n\"The Sims 3\" versions of the characters are available for download via CW's official website. On April 19, 2009, Target exclusively released a promotional disc of \"The Sims 3\" that features a Ladytron band poster, \"The Sims 3\" theme song music download, and a $5 off coupon. The main menu includes screensaver downloads, videos, Create-A-Sim, Create-A-House, and much more. There is no actual gameplay involved, but it describes what playing feels like.\n\nOn July 14, 2010, Ford Motor began a promotion at \"The Sims 3 Store\" by allowing players to download their newest car at the time, the Ford Fiesta Mark VII. The car also came with a collection of street signs. On October 27, 2010, the download was updated to include the Fiesta Hatchback. The 2012 Ford Focus was made available to download on June 8, 2011. The car included one male Ford T-shirt, one female Ford T-shirt, a stereo, and a set of neon lights, all for use in-game. The Focus pack was available to download on Mac, PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.\n\nMusic for \"The Sims 3\" was composed by Steve Jablonsky. Scores were recorded with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox. Music for the game's stereo and guitar objects was produced by others, including Darrell Brown, Rebeca Mauleon, and Peppino D'Agostino. Additional music was produced by APM Music. Two soundtracks have been released for \"The Sims 3\" base game, \"The Sims 3 Soundtrack\" and \"The Sims 3 – Stereo Jams\". The soundtrack includes theme music and the \"Stereo Jams\" album includes music from stereos in game. All songs on \"Stereo Jams\" are in Simlish.\n\nSome of EA's other PC titles from the same time period, such as \"Spore\" and \"Dead Space\", used a SecuROM copy restriction scheme that requires online and offline authentication and limits the number of times a user can install the game to five. While it was speculated that \"The Sims 3\" would use the same system, on March 26, 2009, executive producer Rod Humble revealed that \"The Sims 3\" uses traditional disk-based copy protection as \"Sims 2\" did and does not require online authentication to install. A product key is also required. However, SecuROM based restriction is still present within the digital version of the title, limiting users to a total of 5 authorizations for 5 different machines via online activation, each of which can be de-authorized online at any time. A legitimate serial key is required to download custom objects and Sims from the official website. This includes custom designs created by other Sims 3 players as well as additional content from EA.\n\nOn February 3, 2009, it was announced that the release date of \"The Sims 3\" would be delayed from February 20, 2009 to June 2, 2009 in the US, and June 5, 2009 in the UK. John Riccitiello, CEO of Electronic Arts, said \"In the case of [\"The Sims 3\"], we're moving this title to June 2 to give us additional time to build the worldwide marketing campaign a title like this deserves\". Grant Rodiek, Associate Producer of \"The Sims 3\" said:\n\nEA Singapore launched \"The Sims 3\" with a large launch party which was held on June 2, 2009 at the new shopping mall Iluma in Singapore. At the event, \"The Sims 3\" T-shirts were available for purchase. In Sydney, Australia on June 4, 2009 a fashion event to show off the freedom and self-expression in \"The Sims 3\" was held by Electronic Arts Australia, and included a performance by Jessica Mauboy.\n\nThe game was released as both a standard edition and a Collector's Edition. Both the collector's edition and the standard edition of the game comes with a coupon for 1000 Sim Points to spend at \"The Sims 3 Store\". The standard edition contains the first release of the core game, while the Collector's Edition includes the \"Sims 3 \"core game, a 2GB The Sims Plumbob USB flash drive (preloaded with wallpapers and screensavers of the game, and the main theme as an MP3 file) with matching Green Carabiner, an exclusive European-styled Sports Car download, a Prima Tips and Hints Guide (not the actual \"Sims 3\" Prima Guide), and Plumbob stickers. Those that pre-ordered the game also got a Vintage Sports Car download, \"The Sims 3\" Neighborhood Poster, and a quick start reference guide. A preview CD with more information about \"The Sims 3\", such as music samples, family descriptions, and career information, was also released.\n\nA version of \"The Sims 3\" was released on iOS, Android, Bada, Symbian, BlackBerry OS and Windows Phone on June 2, 2009. The iPhone game works similar to that of the PC version. In Create-a-Sim, instead of Lifetime Wishes, there are personas. Personas decide which lifetime wishes your sim will have, as a persona is the largest factor in a Sim's personality. Sims start out with a small house. The house can be expanded every five sim days if the player can afford it. There are four careers in the town: biology, politics, business, and culinary. As in the PC version, Sims can also learn skills. There are nearly 75 wishes in the game. When all of them are fulfilled, Sims unlock the criminal career and have the ability to purchase a car. In some events, such as appliances breaking down, the player must play a minigame to solve or do the action. The game was updated on November 30, 2010, to add support for the Retina display of newer devices.\n\nAn expansion pack for the iOS version, \"World Adventures\", was released on April 2, 2010. Unlike expansion packs for the PC, this is a standalone application. \"World Adventures\" adds tombs, new challenges, personas, and careers, new places to explore (Egypt, China and France), clothes and new furniture. A second expansion pack, \"Ambitions\", was released on September 16, 2010. As with \"World Adventures\", the game was a standalone application. \"Ambitions\" added new skills (firefighting, painting, parenting and sports), new community buildings, and the ability to have children. On November 6, 2009, EA announced the release of a vampire theme pack for the iPhone. The pack included Live it or Wear it Sets with Vampires and Werewolves, Castle and Campus Life themes. \"Live it\" sets contain car, furniture, decoration, wallpaper, and flooring. \"Wear it\" sets contain clothing, new CAS options, and hair styles.\n\n\"The Sims 3\" was released to game consoles on October 26, 2010, for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS and the Wii platform on November 15, 2010. The game was released for Nintendo 3DS on March 25, 2011.\n\nThe game allows the player to take on up to three friends in the Life Moments Game on the Wii, upload and download content on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, including furnishings, houses, and player creations or experience a full life simulation on a handheld with Nintendo DS. Reviews for the game ranged from average to moderately positive. Sims can age and die, but life cycles can be disabled optionally as well. \"The Sims 3\" features a new Karma system (similar to the influence system in \"The Sims 2\"). Sims can interact with child Sims around the neighborhood, or have children of their own. Unlike the PC version of the game, the console versions have loading times when moving from one area to another, and when accessing build / buy modes.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions received mostly positive reviews. On Metacritic, it currently holds an average score of 77 and 76 out of 100 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, respectively. Game Informer gave the 360 and PS3 versions a 9/10, praising the new Karma system and The Exchange. GameSpot gave the game a 7/10, noting that \"the game lacks fluidity, but is fun in its own right.\" In a positive review, IGN praised the game for its controls on consoles, but said they were disappointed by the fact that there is only one town in the game, as well as bugs, including a glitch where the game will not save once a certain week has been reached.\n\n\"The Sims 3\" expansion packs provide additional game features and items:\n\nStuff Packs only include new items e.g. furniture, clothing, hairstyles. They do not add any new functionality to the game. Stuff Packs are compatible with both Windows and OS X as with the main game and expansion packs.\n\nThe Sims 3 Store is an online store where players of \"The Sims 3\" can purchase and download content for their game online for additional fees. To date, unlike its counterpart for \"The Sims 2\", The Sims 3 Store only offers exclusive objects, clothing, skins, and hairstyles not found through any other medium. The Store also offers variants of special objects found in expansions (such as laundry and hot-tubs), which offer their features for players who haven't purchased those expansions. The store is updated with new items for purchase every month. Premium content, such as the foot massage chair and wind chimes, add new gameplay or animations. The update of August 2014 is the last.\n\nThe store uses a point system in which players can purchase additional SimPoints using a credit card or Points Card, which may be purchased at retail stores or via the Origin online store. It was launched on June 4, 2009 to coincide with the launch of the game. Players can download purchased items using the game launcher or the Store Mode interface found within the game itself. When a user purchases additional SimPoints, they obtain an object in the game for buying SimPoints.\n\nSeveral worlds and towns for players to play in have been published on The Sims 3 Store:\n\nThis is a departure from both the first and second generation of the franchise, in which new items were obtained primarily through expansion packs, stuff packs, and/or user-generation.\n\nEA reported that in its first week, \"The Sims 3\" sold 1.4 million copies. According to EA, this was the most successful PC game launch the company had ever had to date. According to retail data trackers Gfk Australia \"The Sims 3\" has been the top selling game in Australia from release until June 30, 2009. Response from critics and gamers alike were generally favorable, with Metacritic calculating a metascore of 86/100 based on 75 reviews. \"PC Gamer\" awarded \"The Sims 3\" a 92% and an Editor's Choice badge, calling it \"The best \"Sims\" game yet\". IGN PC awarded \"The Sims 3\" an 8.9/10, stating:\nGameSpot awarded \"The Sims 3\" a score of 9.0/10, the review praised the game: \"The latest Sims game is also the greatest, striking a terrific balance between the fresh and the familiar.\"\n\nThe game was ranked #91 in IGN's \"Top 100 Modern Games\". In a special edition of Edge magazine, listing their 100 top videogames of all-time, \"The Sims 3\" was number 89 on the list.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, EA confirmed \"The Sims 4\" would be released in 2014. The game was released in North America on September 2, 2014.\n\n"}

The eight-episode Netflix series is a prequel to Wain's 2001 film \"Wet Hot American Summer\", a parody of teen sex comedies which has since developed a cult following. Although many of the original film's ensemble cast have gone on to high-profile work, all of the then-adult actors returned for this series, playing even younger versions of their original roles. The episodes were released for online viewing at the end of July 2015.\n\n\nAfter years of speculation and reports on a possible sequel to \"Wet Hot American Summer\", shooting began on the miniseries in January 2015. The entire adult cast of the film returned in the same roles. Much of the film was shot in Los Angeles. Working around the availability of the cast members, many of whom had seen a significant rise in stardom since the original film, was difficult; some sources report that Bradley Cooper, who plays Ben, had to shoot all of his scenes in one day, although star and co-writer Michael Showalter has since denied this claim.\n\nAlong with the series, a making-of documentary on \"Wet Hot American Summer\", titled \"Hurricane of Fun: The Making of Wet Hot\", was released on Netflix on July 24, 2015, consisting of behind the scenes interviews and footage shot during the filming of the movie.\n\nOn April 27, 2016, it was announced that Netflix ordered a follow-up series entitled \"Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later\", set ten years after the events of the film. The series consists of eight episodes, and was released on August 4, 2017.\n\n\"Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp\" received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has a score of 92%, based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 7.44/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp\" offers more of the same goofy hijinks that fans of the cult classic crave, but outsiders might not be quite as enamored.\" On Metacritic, the series holds a score of 74 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nFor the 6th Critics' Choice Television Awards, John Slattery was nominated for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series.\n\n"}

{"id": "95864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95864", "title": "Wākea", "text": "Wākea\n\nIn the Hawaiian religion, Wākea, the Sky father weds Papahānaumoku, the earth mother. The two are considered the parent couple of the ruling chiefs of Hawaii. \n\n\"Wākea\" was the eldest son of Kahiko (\"Ancient One\"), who lived in Olalowaia. He is the ancestor of the \"aliʻi\" (nobility of Hawaii), the ruling class that make up the aristocracy known as the \"noho ali‘i o Hawai‘i\" (ruling chiefs of Hawai‘i). Wākea is the grandson of Welaahilaninui. The priests and common people come from his brothers, one of whom was called Makuʻu. \n\nWākea means expansive space, zenith, or heaven and Papa means foundation or surface; together, they create a symbol of land and sky or heaven and earth.\n\nWākea's first high priest was called Komoawa. \n\nWhen Wākea was on Earth in ancient times, he was a High Chief.\n\nIn one legend, Wākea lives in Hihiku and marries Papahānaumoku, who is a princess of Olalo-i-mehani and a granddaughter of Princess Kaoupe-alii. The Hawaiian Islands were created by Wākea and Papahānaumoku. Their daughter was Hoʻohokukalani, who was a mother of Haloa by Wākea.\n\nIn the genealogies, Wākea and Papahānaumoku are 37th in the Kumuhonua genealogy, and 28th in the Kumuʻuli. Kumuhonua, the ancestor of the Kumuhonua genealogy, was believed to be the first man in one tradition. \n\nTogether, Papahānaumoku and Wākea created Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, and Ho’ohokukalani. \n\nAfter having incest with his own daughter, Ho’ohokukalani, she gave birth to Haloa-naka, meaning trembling long stalk. It was a stillborn baby, which they later planted and became the first kalo or taro, a staple of the Hawaiian diet. After Haloa-naka, Ho’ohokukalani gave birth to another child named Haloa, meaning long stalk, and he became the first kanaka or Hawaiian person. \n\nThe relationship between Haloa-naka and Haloa describes the balance of relationships between the land and the people that live in it. Haloa-naka, as the elder sibling, is responsible for the well being of their younger siblings, that of which being Haloa. As Kalo, Haloa-naka upholds this by providing sustainance for the people, while the people take care of their older sibling by ensuring the life of the Kalo. Likewise, it is also inappropriate to argue in front of Kalo at any time as well as it is not allowed to argue in front of your older siblings, nor elders.\n\nLater on, Wākea reunites with Papahānaumoku and they create Ni'ihau, Lehua, and Kaʻula.\n\nIn one tradition, the first person on Earth was the woman Laʻilaʻi. She and her husband Kealiʻiwahilani are the parents of Kahiko, the father of Wākea. Wākea made the land and sea from the calabash or gourd (\"‘ipu\") of Papahānaumoku. He threw it up high, and it became the heavens. He made the rain from its juice and from the seeds he made the sun, moon, and stars.\n\nWanting to sleep with his daughter, Wākea made a bargain with his high priest, Komo’awa, to make Papahānaumoku go away for four nights. In her seclusion, it was \"kapu\" or restricted for her to eat certain foods; a tradition known as \"ʻaikapu\", which was a sacred eating arrangement established by Wākea. The purpose of the \"ʻaikapu\" was to separate the women from the men. In traditional Hawaiian society, men were responsible for cooking. \n\nExamples of some foods that Hawaiian women could not eat:\n\n\n"}
