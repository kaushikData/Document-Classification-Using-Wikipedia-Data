{"id": "8337211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8337211", "title": "Albert Nerenberg", "text": "Albert Nerenberg\n\nAlbert Nerenberg (born October 13, 1962) is a Canadian independent filmmaker, actor, journalist, hypnotist and laughologist. His films include \"Stupidity\" (2003), \"Escape to Canada\" (2005), \"Let's All Hate Toronto\" (2007), \"Laughology\" (2009) and \"Boredom\" (2013). Both \"Stupidity\" and \"Laughology\" are the first feature-length documentaries to discuss the topics of stupidity and laughter.\n\nBorn in London, Ontario in 1962, Nerenberg studied English Drama at McGill University in Montreal during the 1980s, where he formed Theatre Shmeatre, an improvisational theatrical company, and served as editor in chief of the \"McGill Daily\".\n\nFormerly a newspaper reporter with the \"Montreal Gazette\" and talk radio host at CKGM, Nerenberg told the Montreal newspaper, \"La Presse\", that he became a filmmaker after he smuggled a video camera through army lines during the 1990 Oka Crisis – a standoff between armed Mohawk Warriors and the Canadian military. The footage was later turned into his first documentary, entitled \"Okanada\".\n\nAmong his early films was \"1949\", so-named because it cost only $19.49 to make, taking advantage of the sophistication of Hi-8 video equipment at that time.\n\nNerenberg was recognized by the Cinémathèque Québécoise as a film innovator for having had a role in some of the developments in contemporary filmmaking; including the hand-held revolution, the Truvie where fictional films are shot in real situations, and in creating the format of fictional movie trailers. In 2001 Nerenberg was the subject of a retrospective at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal.\n\nNerenberg is the founder of Trailervision. Trailervision is the idea that movie trailers are their own artistic medium. CNN has profiled Trailervision, calling it an \"international cult phenomenon.\"\n\nNerenberg has directed over 70 Trailervision trailers and over a dozen TV documentaries.\n\nIn 2005, Nerenberg directed \"Escape to Canada\", a documentary about how Canada has unintentionally usurped America's place as the Land of the Free.\n\nIn 2007's \"Let's All Hate Toronto\", Mr. Toronto (Nerenberg's eye-patched co-director Rob Spence) embarks on a coast-to-coast Canadian tour to promote \"the centre of the universe\" by waving a banner that reads \"Toronto Appreciation Day.\"\n\nIn 2003 he founded \"The World Stupidity Awards\", an annual satirical awards show which was sponsored by the Just for Laughs festival from 2004 to 2007, honouring the \"Stupidest Statement of the Year\".\n\nNerenberg is also known for a widely publicized prank performed at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival. The director orchestrated the red carpet entry of a group of Trailervision actors as major movie stars to a major premiere. This was done by placing actors in the paparazzi who screamed the names of these fictional stars as they arrived by limo. The paparazzi responded by flashing their cameras frantically. The fake stars were rushed into the green room along with the real stars, \"where they got drunk like showbiz kings\". The prank is described in the online Museum of Hoaxes as The Toronto Film Festival Hoax.\n\nAs an actor, Nerenberg is known for his portrayal of the Modeman character, a mentally disabled janitor, who can speak \"modem\" and\ncreate web pages with his mouth. He also plays a sermonizing priest in the popular Trailervision web trailer, \"Kung Fu Jesus\".\n\nNerenberg said that he got the idea for competitive laughter after attending a UFC fight were two fighters unintentionally started laughing during a stare down. \"What I was seeing was a re-enactment of the greatest revolution that ever took place on the planet,\" he said in the Canal D documentary Extreme Laughter. \"The discovery of play.\" Nerenberg organized the first ever Montreal Laughing Championships where using stare-downs and laughing fits,12 competitors would compete to see who was the champion. The laughers would be judged for their contagiousness effect on the audience. After that event, laughing championships would be organized in Japan, France, The Czech Republic and in Slovenia. The first American Laughing Championships would take place in April 2013 in San Diego at the Westin Hotel Ballroom and opened by then Mayor Bob Filner.\n\n\"Punching people in the face is a sport. Poking people with sticks is a sport. Why not have a sport about the pursuit of joy?\" Nerenberg told The Pacific Standard.\n\nAt IdeaCity in 2014, Nerenberg made a controversial presentation suggesting that all drug and alcohol states can be replicated with hypnosis. He demonstrated by inviting volunteers from the audience. Under hypnosis he made one volunteer apparently drunk, while another on cocaine and two others on ecstasy. To conclude he asked the audience to invent a drug on the spot, which volunteers might experience. One audience member suggested \"Ludicron\" a drug which causes people to laugh and \"think the audience is naked.\" When the drug state was implemented a volunteer laughed and screamed and claimed she could see hundreds of naked people. Nerenberg launched a project called The Hypnotic Bar, a kind of temporary night club where people are hypnotized to be drunk while drinking only water. Nerenberg said he got the idea of the Hypnotic Bar after coming across a statistician stating that more people are currently dying of drug and alcohol overdoses than at any other time in human history.\n\nNerenberg has been an advocate for better public understanding of Hypnosis. In a speech at TEDX Queens, Nerenberg challenged the audience to take standard tests of hypnotizability. Many audience members appears to go to sleep and some acting as if they were chickens. Nerenberg stated that hypnotic chicken behaviour is actually quite profound, revealing as key aspect of human nature, that we believe our dreams.\n\nNerenberg's most recent documentary entitled \"Laughology\" premiered at Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in May 2009. The documentary makes the case that laughter is the original peace signal and the human ability to share and transmit laughter may have been key to the rise of human civilization. The film chronicles unusual laughter phenomena such as Holy Laughter, Laughter Parties and the Tanzanian Laughter Epidemic. Screenings of the film have been notable as fits of uncontrollable laughter have broken out following the film. Gabor Pertic writing in A&E Vibe described a packed screening at HotDocs International Film Festival in Toronto Canada. \"The screening had some of the loudest collective laughs I have ever heard in a movie theatre.\"\n\nNerenberg frequently tours and speaks as a \"Stupidity Expert\" and more recently as a Laughologist, an expert on laughter. After traveling to India and studying the benefits of Laughter Yoga with Dr. Madan Kataria, Nerenberg invented Laughercize, a system of joy-inducing exercise that works off natural human contagious laughter. This technique has been used in a number of Canadian alcohol and drug rehab centres. He also invented the Laughter Party, which creates the same atmosphere as a wild party, without the need of drugs and alcohol.\n\nNerenberg also worked as a newspaper columnist for The Montreal Gazette. His most recent work is a 10 column series about the benefits and importance of positivity in today's world. In 2013 he completed the feature documentary Boredom. He is currently working on a new film about The Hypnotic Bar and a documentary titled \"You Are What You Act\". You Are What You Act won the Jury Prize at the Illuminate Film Festival in Sedona, Arizona, in June 2018.\n\n"}

Only a few frames of the film survive.\n\nIt was also known as \"Quest for Gold\".\n\nEnglishman Jack Cardigan (Herbert J. Bentley) strikes gold and writes a letter to his girlfriend, Nora (Lilian Teece), to tell her of the news. He gives the letter to a friend, Ralph Blackstone (Hilliard Vox) who poisons Cardigan's drink, throws his body in the river and takes over his claim.\n\nHowever, when in Sydney, he accidentally allows the letter to come into Nora's possession and she decides to investigate. While Blackstone goes back to the mine by train, she tries to beat him there by taking a speedboat across Sydney harbour, then driving a fast car. She arrives to find Cardigan still alive and recovering. Cardigan gets his claim back and is reunited with Nora.\n\n\nIn 1911, the newly established West's Pictures wanted to get into feature production. They offered a £25 prize for a story about Australian life best suited for screen adaptation; bushranging themes were barred. Over 200 entries were received and the winner was stage comedian W.S. Percy for this script.\n\nThe car chase scene was shot near Springwood in the Blue Mountains. Lilian Teece had to drive a car alongside the passing of a fast train. The train arrived an hour earlier than scheduled and Teece had to chase after it. \"Passengers craned their heads through the windows and urged the driver of the train not to be beaten by a woman\", said a contemporary newspaper report. Teece got in front of the train just before the train disappeared in a cutting. \"If I had not passed him before I passed the camera I would have followed him to Bathurst\", said Teece.\n\nThe movie featured an early example of split-screen technology, with one scene showing Nora making a phone call, a boatman receiving the call, and Sydney harbour in between.\n"}
{"id": "27309565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27309565", "title": "Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood", "text": "Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a 2010 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the third major installment in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series, a direct sequel to 2009's \"Assassin's Creed II\", and the second chapter in the 'Ezio trilogy'. The game was first released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November and December 2010, and was later made available on Microsoft Windows in March and June 2011.\n\nThe plot follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The main story takes place immediately after the plot of \"Assassin's Creed II\", featuring Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in 16th century Italy and his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Ezio's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Ezio is able to freely explore 16th-century Rome to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game introduced a multiplayer component to the series, portrayed as a Templar training program.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim with critics praising its setting of Rome, content, gameplay improvements over its predecessor and the addition of a multiplayer mode; the story received a mostly positive response, although several critics found it to be inferior to \"Assassin's Creed II\"'s. It also won multiple awards including a BAFTA award for Best Action Game. It was followed in November 2011 by \"\", a direct sequel that served as a conclusion to Ezio's story and continued the story of Desmond Miles.\n\nA remastered version, along with \"Assassin's Creed II\" and \"\", was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on November 15, 2016 as part of \"The Ezio Collection\".\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" is an action-adventure video game with main emphasis on nonlinear, sandbox style gameplay, parkour movements, crowd-blending stealth, assassinations and melee fighting system. The combat system features several improvements and for the first time in the series, the game offers a multiplayer mode alongside 15+ hours of single-player gameplay.\n\nThe game introduces a new management system: the player can recruit new members by destroying any of twelve \"Borgia towers\" around Rome where papal troops are stationed and then rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from being harassed by guards. The player, as Ezio, can then send them to assignments around Europe or call them for support during missions (if they are not already occupied). Tasking the novice Assassins makes them gain experience, and the player is able to customize their appearance, skills, and weapon training to some degree by spending the skill points they have earned. Assassins can die on missions, from which they will not return. Ezio masters new gadgets, such as Leonardo da Vinci's parachute, which can be used when jumping from tall buildings, along with poison darts, a faster acting poison, a crossbow, and the ability to hold and throw heavier weapons like axes.\nThe primary setting is Rome, which has fallen into ruin due to the corrupt rule of the Borgia papacy and the Templars over the Papal States and concentrating all the wealth in the Vatican. Just like the town of Monteriggioni in \"Assassin's Creed II\", the player is able to invest in the city, witness its development, and unlock rewards. The player has to conquer and destroy Borgia towers to free city zones from the family's influence. Completing this unlocks new missions and opportunities. Rome is larger than any of the cities in the first two installments (Rome is three times bigger than Florence from \"Assassin's Creed II\") and includes five districts: Vatican (\"Vaticano\"), Central (\"Centro\"), Trans-Tiber (\"Trastevere\"), Country (\"Campagna\") and Antique (\"Antico\"). Unlike the previous installments, travel between different cities or regions is no longer present, as most of the action in the game takes place around the city of Rome. Instead, a series of tunnel networks throughout the city allow the player to travel to different sectors of the city with ease. However players will be able to explore the entire city of Rome, visit the harbour of Naples, a part of Navarre, Spain, Valnerina, Lake of Nevi and present day Monteriggioni.\n\nThe combat system has been modified. Striking first and offensive actions are more deadly in \"Brotherhood\" than previous games where counter-attacks were the most efficient. Before, this made the player wait until the AI struck, which slowed down the pace of fighting. The AI in this game is thus more aggressive and enemies can attack simultaneously. To dispatch them, Ezio can use melee and ranged weapons at the same time, as well as introducing the hidden pistol in combat. After killing one enemy the player can start an execution streak to dispatch multiple enemies quickly. Ezio can throw heavy weapons (axes, spears, and swords) at his enemies. There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those seen in \"Assassin's Creed II\" such as horsemen, arquebusiers, papal guards and others.\n\nHorses play a larger role in \"Brotherhood\", not only used as a means of transport (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. \"Brotherhood\" also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the flower pot in \"Assassin's Creed II\" to move faster inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow fast travel), as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.\n\nUnlike previous installments, Desmond can leave the Animus at almost any time. This allows Desmond to explore the present-day town of Monteriggioni. The player is also offered virtual training, a mini-game where the player may test their free-running or combat skills.\n\nLike \"Assassin's Creed\", characters based on historical figures are present in the game, including Rodrigo Borgia, Cesare Borgia, Niccolo Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza and Leonardo da Vinci. Locations in the game include the Colosseum and the Pantheon in Rome.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" is the first game in the main series to feature a multiplayer mode. The players are Templars in training at the Abstergo facility. They use the animi (plural for animus) seen at the beginning of \"Assassin's Creed II\" to access memories of old Templars and to acquire their skills using the \"bleeding effect\". There are eight game modes (Wanted, Alliance, Manhunt, Chest Capture, Advanced Wanted, Advanced Alliance, Escort and Assassinate) and different maps, including the areas from the second and the third game like Florence, as well as new maps like Rome, Castel Gandolfo, Siena and Mont Saint-Michel. The gameplay in multiplayer mode is similar to the core gameplay of the series, as players are required to use their assassination and stealth skills. The players must hunt down targets while being hunted themselves. Players earn points by performing assassinations, defending against pursuers, attaining bonuses or completing mode-specific objectives. It also contains a variety of characters, most of which must be unlocked.\n\nThe multiplayer mode also includes a leveling system, which allows players to unlock rewards by earning experience points during the matches and gaining new levels. Players can then unlock abilities, perks and streaks. Abilities are active skills, which can be used again only after a cool down time. Perks are passive skills, which can be equipped before the match and they are active all the time. Streaks are bonuses awarded for reaching certain number of successful or failed contracts. The multiplayer beta, exclusive to PlayStation 3 users, was announced at E3 2010. It began on October 4, 2010, with early access for PlayStation Plus subscribers from September 27, and ended on October 18, 2010. Three maps were playable in the beta: Rome, Castel Gandolfo and Siena.\n\nIn \"Wanted\", at least six players are on a map where they must find and assassinate each other. Each player is given another player as a target. The goal is to find and kill a target without being seen or killed by the player's own pursuer or pursuers. Players are indistinguishable from some of the NPC's throughout the maps. If the player kills an NPC by mistake or otherwise breaks cover, they are more easily spotted by pursuer or target alike, sometimes resulting in a chase. The player with the highest score at the end of the session wins. Players will lose their contract if they kill an NPC, are stunned by their target or their target is killed by another player. A player cannot kill another player who is not the target, but they can stun their hunter. \"Advanced Wanted\" mode is a variant of \"Wanted\" mode, with differences including an increased amount of NPCs on the map to make it difficult to pick out targets and a less accurate compass. There is generally more stealth involved in this mode than in basic \"Wanted\".\n\nThe \"Assassinate\" mode is similar to \"Wanted\", but instead of target contracts being assigned to players, all players are fair game. Players must identify other player characters and lock on before assassinating. Because two players can kill each other, whoever locks on first becomes the hunter and the other becomes the target. The standard compass found in \"Wanted\" is replaced by directional arrows based on proximity, that grow to become arcs around the perimeter of the compass as other players near, and will eventually create a full circle when other players are very close. As in other modes, the player with the highest score at the end of the session is the winner.\n\nIn \"Alliance\", there are three teams, each limited to two players, both of which use the same persona. The point of this mode is to get more points than the other teams, but each team is chased by another and is only allowed to kill one specific team (not the team chasing them, but they will be able to stun the team hunting them). This mode encourages players to work together, as teammates can help each other or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously. The \"Advanced Alliance\" mode is a variant of \"Alliance\" mode, however the players' compasses as well as target engagement becomes more difficult, similar to the \"Advanced Wanted\" mode.\n\nIn \"Manhunt\" there are two teams of four. One team is the hunters, the other is the hunted. Each team looks like a specific character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and remaining hidden. The team with the highest score wins. In \"Chest Capture\" there are two teams of four. One team is the hunters, and the other is the hunted who need to steal chests by standing close to them. Each team looks like a specific character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and stealing chests. The team with the highest score wins. The \"Escort\" mode sees one team of four players protecting a wandering NPC while the other team of four tries to assassinate him. There are two NPCs to protect at a time and they walk through a series of checkpoints, which are visible to both teams. When an escorted NPC is killed, another is synchronized. This mode has two rounds with each team playing once as an escort and once as assassins.\n\nPlayers are able to choose one of the 21 available characters, including: Courtesan, Barber, Priest, Noble, Prowler, Executioner, Doctor, Blacksmith, Captain, Smuggler, Engineer, Footpad, Thief, Hellequin (a female Harlequin, which is available through uPlay) and Mercenary. Two special characters were only available in the selected pre-order editions of the game: the Harlequin and the Officer. However, these two pre-order special characters are also included in \"The Da Vinci Disappearance\" downloadable content as are the formerly pre-order only Trajan Market and Aqueducts special locations. The pack contains 4 new characters, Dama Rossa, Knight, Marquis, and Pariah. Each character has unique assassination moves and a signature weapon. Characters can be customized as the player levels up. These customization options include changing the color of the outfit, and equipping different gear.\n\nDesmond's story continues where it left off, in 2012. After escaping the Templars' attack at the end of \"Assassin's Creed II\", Desmond Miles, Lucy Stillman, Rebecca Crane, and Shaun Hastings flee to Monteriggioni, establishing a new hideout in the ruins of the Villa Auditore. After restoring the electricity in the old tunnels under the villa, the player once again takes control of Ezio Auditore through Desmond's genetic memory, using the Animus 2.0 (which is the game's memory interface). Their mission is to find the Apple of Eden, an important and mysterious artifact that could prevent the impending disaster that is coming in that same year, believed to be perpetrated by the Templars.\n\nEzio's story continues in 1499, where he exits the Vault, confused by what he saw inside. He escapes Rome with his uncle, Mario Auditore, and returns to Monteriggioni. Once home, Ezio is comforted by the prospect that his personal vendetta is over; however, Niccolò Machiavelli challenges Ezio's decision to leave Rodrigo Borgia (now Pope Alexander VI) alive. The following morning - New Year's Day - Monteriggioni is besieged by Cesare Borgia, son of Rodrigo. Mario is killed at the hands of Cesare himself, and the Apple lost to Cesare and the Templars. Ezio escapes with his family and travels once more to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, once again seeking vengeance against the Borgias. There, he discovers that the Assassins are failing in their fight against corruption. Determined to rebuild the Guild, Ezio convinces Machiavelli that he has what it takes to lead while assembling a Brotherhood powerful enough to destroy the Templars and his new nemesis, Cesare.\n\nOver the next four years, Ezio executes various tasks meant to cripple the Borgias' hold in the capital, sabotaging Cesare's resources and assassinating key people close to and/or working with him in the process, and slowly restoring Rome to its former glory. After returning the Roman Assassins to full strength, Ezio is given the rank of \"Il Mentore\" (Italian for \"The Mentor\"), and made de facto leader of the Assassins in Italy. During this time, Ezio's sister Claudia is also made an Assassin.\n\nCesare, learning of Ezio's actions, confronts his suspicious father and desperately asks for more money, and the Apple itself. Rodrigo refuses, cautious of provoking the Assassins, and attempts to poison his son, realizing that Cesare's lust for power can't be held at bay. Cesare, however, turns the tables on his father and kills him instead. Ezio witnesses this and, after learning of the Apple's location, retrieves it from within St. Peter's Basilica. Ezio uses it to overwhelm Cesare's forces and gradually withdraw the backing of his supporters; Cesare is finally arrested by Pope Julius II's Papal Army after Ezio and the Assassins confront him and kill his remaining followers.\n\nSometime later, Ezio uses the Apple once more to check on Cesare, who has broken out of prison and, after gaining the support of his new patron, John III of Navarre, laid siege to the city of Viana, in Navarre. Ezio encounters Cesare on the battlements of a crumbling castle and fights him. Cesare claims that he cannot be killed by the hand of a mortal man, thus inciting Ezio to \"leave [him] in the hands of fate\" by dropping him off the battlements to his death. Ezio then takes the Apple and hides it in a First Civilization Temple built underneath the Roman Colosseum.\n\nUsing the coordinates taken from Ezio's memories, Desmond, Lucy, Shaun and Rebecca travel to the Temple, intending to use the Apple to locate the remaining Temples and keep the other Pieces of Eden out of the Templars' hands. As Desmond makes his way into the Temple, he is confronted with holographic apparitions of a being called Juno, who appears to be of the same race as Minerva; however, she is neither audible nor visible to Lucy, Shaun, or Rebecca. Most of her comments center on humanity's lack of knowledge. She states that humanity is \"innocent and ignorant;\" that people were not built to be wise, having been given only five of the six senses: sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, but lacking knowledge. Her careful cadence then drops, as she suddenly becomes angry, yelling, \"We should have left you as you were!\"\n\nAs Desmond approaches the Apple and touches it, time freezes around him, though he can still move and speak. Juno cryptically states that Desmond is descended from her race, and is their enemy; she also says there is a woman who would accompany him through \"the gate,\" but must not be allowed to. She takes control of Desmond's body and forces him to stab Lucy in the abdomen. Both fall to the ground, with Lucy dead and Desmond entering a coma. As the credits roll, two men are heard discussing whether to put Desmond back in the Animus.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" was developed by Ubisoft Montreal. Montreal also worked on both of the other main \"Assassin's Creed\" games in the series and was thus chosen to lead production for the third installment. A new \"Assassin's Creed\" episode featuring multiplayer was announced during Ubisoft's 2009 fiscal third quarter results while not revealing its name. In early May 2010, a GameStop employee published on the internet some images of a pre-order box featuring the \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" title while Ubisoft was teasing the game on Facebook and Twitter. Ubisoft then confirmed the authenticity of these pictures. \"Brotherhood\" has not been numbered unlike \"Assassin's Creed II\" because players, and even developers themselves would have expected a new setting and a new ancestor while this is only the continuation of Ezio's story.\n\nThe game was developed primarily by Ubisoft Montreal in Canada. Production was aided in part by four other Ubisoft developers: Annecy, Singapore, Bucharest and Québec City. The multiplayer mode is mainly developed by Ubisoft Annecy, the studio responsible for creating multiplayer mode in \"\". Ubisoft also announced plans for downloadable content (DLC) after the game's launch. Two sets of free DLC have already been released under the names \"Animus Project Update 1.0\" and \"Animus Project Update 2.0\". The first includes the new map \"Mont Saint-Michel\" and one new mode, \"Advanced Alliance\". The \"Animus Project Update 2.0\" was released in January 2011, was also free, and included another map, mode and the introduction of a player grading system. From the perspective of performance, Ubisoft have commented that they hope the gaps between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will be even smaller with Brotherhood.\n\nAdditionally, humorist Danny Wallace and actress Kristen Bell reprise their roles from Assassin's Creed II.\n\nWhile still in development, creative director Patrice Désilets left before the game's presentation at the E3 2010. Ubisoft and production manager Jean-Francois Boivin stated that he only took a \"creative break\" after completing his task on \"Brotherhood\". A teaser trailer of the multiplayer mode was released on the official site before the E3. A cinematic debut trailer was diffused during Ubisoft's E3 2010 press conference along a walkthrough of the game's beginning. \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" reached gold status on October 28, 2010. The Microsoft Windows version has Nvidia 3D Vision and multi screen support through AMD Eyefinity. It also uses Tagès copy protection, as well as Ubisoft online services platform, but doesn't require an always-on Internet connection to play. On November 30, 2010, a of the game was published. The novel is a sequel to the .\n\nThe music in the game was composed by Jesper Kyd, who created the scores to previous \"Assassin's Creed\" games. The soundtrack was released digitally on November 16, 2010. A physical CD-DA release of the soundtrack accompanied selected retail editions. However, the track-listing is altered from the digital release — the CD has 22 tracks, including 3 exclusive pieces, but is missing \"Apple Chamber\" present in the digital release.\n\nThere are different special retail editions of \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\". Different editions are available in different regions. There is also a certain number of pre-order bonuses, which may vary, depending on the retailer. Some retailers also offered the access to the multiplayer beta on the PlayStation 3 system as a pre-order bonus. All versions of \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" for the PlayStation 3 feature exclusive free additional downloadable content called the Copernicus Conspiracy which became available on the PlayStation Store on November 16, 2010. Players have access to several new missions featuring the famous Renaissance astronomer Copernicus. Extra content includes courier, assassination and protection missions — Ezio will be tasked with foiling the conspiracy against Copernicus and defending his philosophy. The PC version of \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" was released by Akella in Russia in exclusive Collector's Edition featuring 6 metal figurines of multiplayer characters.\n\nUbisoft's Uplay system enables further in-game enhancements which can be redeemed by points that are given when playing the game. The available awards are a \"Brotherhood\" theme or wallpaper for PC and PlayStation 3, Florentine Noble Attire, Armor of Altaïr, Altaïr's Robes, Gun Capacity Upgrade and Hellequin character.\n\n\"Copernicus Conspiracy\" is a free downloadable content pack for \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\", initially released exclusively for the PlayStation 3 on the game's release, later receiving official support on the PC via a patch on 23 May 2017 on both Steam and Uplay and later being automatically being available in the Ezio Trilogy Collection on the PS4 and Xbox One. It focuses on the famed astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who gets into trouble with the Vatican, who do not want Copernicus educating the public about astronomy. The pack consists of eight optional missions, ranging from courier, assassination and protection objectives.\n\nThe \"Animus Project Update 1.0\" included a new game mode and a new map. The game mode, \"Advanced Alliance\", is a version of the \"Alliance\" mode, with target identification and engagement more difficult than in the original, thus providing a more challenging experience for players. With three teams of two players each, \"Advanced Alliance\" is a tougher test for players and rewards teams that work together. The new map, Mont Saint-Michel, is located on a rocky tidal island of Normandy in France. Its particular topography of narrow streets, high-perched bell-tower, and multi-leveled architecture is perfect for hunters and predators alike to surge from out of nowhere to execute their prey. To survive, recruits need to use free-running and narrow roads to their advantage.\n\nThe \"Animus Project Update 2.0\" included a new game mode and map. The Pienza Map provides a free-running playground with wide-open plaza areas, where predators and targets can quickly blend and disappear, surrounded by narrow alleys and multi-story buildings for extra verticality. In the new \"Chest Capture\" multiplayer mode, two teams composed of three players compete as Hunters and Protectors; partnered with fellow Templars, Hunters will attempt to steal the contents of the chests scattered around the map as protectors attempt to prevent this. Also included in the update is a Templar Score feature to reward diligent work by Abstergo recruits. \"Advanced Alliance\" is also packaged with the new DLC, while the Mont Saint-Michel map is not. Only one DLC can be activated at a time, so players will either be missing the new map from the 1.0 update or the new mode, new map and Templar Scoring from the 2.0 update.\n\n\"The Da Vinci Disappearance\", on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live, features new content for both single player and multiplayer modes. For the single player game, this downloadable content includes 8 new missions, 2 new locations, and 10 trophies/achievements. The multiplayer content includes two new game modes, new map and four new characters. The PC version includes DLC for free (it must be activated through Uplay) along with both Animus Project Updates. In March, the \"Da Vinci Edition\" of \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\", was released for consoles. This version includes \"The Da Vinci Disappearance\" DLC.\n\nThe story revolves around Leonardo da Vinci's mysterious disappearance in the year 1506. Ezio arrives at Leonardo's workshop with his assistant Salaì and finds him missing. It is soon revealed that Leonardo found a secret vault and his plans were discovered by the Hermetics, members of the Cult of Hermes. Ezio finds writing on the floor that implies he should seek out five of Leonardo's paintings once owned by Ezio at Monteriggioni but now missing. The majority of this sequence focuses on the search for and retrieval of these paintings by Ezio. After finding these paintings, Ezio identifies the location of a new subterranean location in Roma and proceeds there, to find Da Vinci imprisoned by Hermetics. After freeing Leonardo, the two of them find another vault, in which they are revealed the numbers 43 39 19 N and 75 27 42 W. Ezio comments on these numbers \"It is not intended for us\". At the end of the sequence, two male voices (one is the Assassin, William) are heard commenting that Desmond has fallen into a coma. They also comment \"we have a location for the temple\" and \"then what are you waiting for, let's go.\" This DLC doubles as the technical \"Animus Project Update 3.0\", with the addition of the preorder multiplayer characters, the Harlequin and Officer, as well as the preorder-only special Drachen Armor for Ezio.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" received critical acclaim upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 90.55% and 89/100, the PlayStation 3 version 89.92% and 90/100 and the PC version 87.64% and 88/100. It won best Action Adventure game in the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2010 The game has also been nominated for 7 British Academy Video Games Awards in 2011, including Best Game. It won an award in the Action category, losing to Mass Effect 2 in the category for Best Game.\n\nThe multiplayer was heralded by many at E3 2010, where it was showcased for the first time. GameTrailers lauded it as the \"Best Multiplayer Game\" of the show. The multiplayer portion of \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" was generally well received by critics. \"Game Informer\" gave the \"Brotherhood\" a 9.25/10, commenting that the ability to raise a group of followers was a significant enhancement to the previous title's gameplay, and praising the new multiplayer mode as something never before seen. The magazine's review also gave very high marks to the graphics, sound effects and voice acting.\n\nEurogamer praised everything about \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\", giving it a 10/10, and particularly noted the maturity of the story: \"One mission sees Ezio disrupting an assassination attempt in the ruins of the Roman Colosseum during a play about the death of Jesus Christ. It demands a developer of poise and compassion to wield such thorny concepts deftly, and it's a measure of Ubisoft Montreal's maturity that it is more than equal to the challenge...Brotherhood builds an intriguing mystery around compelling characters, surrounds them with collectibles and secrets, and encourages play – and nothing feels out of place.\" In December 2015, \"Game Informer\" ranked the game as the best game in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series to date.\n\n\"The Da Vinci Disappearance\" add-on was also met with favorable reviews, and holds a Metacritic score of 75/100.\n\nReviews for the delayed PC version questioned the reason behind the delayed release date as the game was virtually unchanged from the console version albeit with better graphical enhancements and minor bonus content. However most praised Ubisoft's move to remove the DRM that marred the PC version of \"Assassin's Creed II\" as well as include all DLC free of charge.\n\nThe game passed the one million sales mark in less than a week after its release. \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" has become Ubisoft's fastest-selling European title ever. It also had the best Ubisoft's launch in Europe and is the best-selling launch title ever as of November 2010. As of May 2011, Ubisoft announced the game had shipped 8 million copies and helped the entire \"Assassin's Creed\" series to achieve over 28 million units sold.\nOn May 5, 2011, \"\" was revealed to be the next major installment in the \"Assassin's Creed\" franchise. It was released on November 15, 2011. The game is the second to have three playable characters (Altaïr, Ezio and Desmond) after \"Assassin's Creed II\", which focused on Ezio and Desmond while Altaïr made a brief playable cameo. It is set in Constantinople, at the peak of the Ottoman Empire. \"Revelations\" brought back the multiplayer experience first introduced in \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\" with \"more modes, more maps, and more characters\" according to the official announcement. It is also the last game featuring Ezio.'\n\nOn 17 September 2018 it was announced by Triton Noir the launch of a board game called \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice\". It will take place in 1509 (set between \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\" and \"Assassin's Creed: Revelations\") with Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Leonardo da Vinci, and Lucrezia Borgia; but it also include new characters like Alessandra. It was developed by Thibaud de la Touanne, it will have more than 20 hours of play, and it will be released in November.\n\n"}
{"id": "1467695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1467695", "title": "BBC controversies", "text": "BBC controversies\n\nThis article outlines, in chronological order, the various scandals surrounding or involving the BBC that have occurred.\n\nThe BBC was established as the privately controlled British Broadcasting Company in 1922. In 1926 the unions called for a General Strike and the Conservative Government feared the outbreak of revolution, as had happened in Russia in 1917. Labour Party politicians such as Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden criticised the BBC for being pro-Government and anti-Unions; however, throughout the strike, Reith insisted that the news bulletins report all sides of the dispute without comment.\n\nReith's attempts to broadcast statements by the Labour Party and TUC leaders were blocked by the Government; in partial response, he personally vetoed a statement that Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, wished to make, in the belief that allowing such a statement would give Winston Churchill both motive and opportunity to take over the BBC—something which Churchill had continually advocated since the beginning of the Strike. Reith admitted to his staff that he would have preferred to allow the Labour and TUC leaders to broadcast directly. A post-strike analysis carried out by the BBC's Programme Correspondence Department reported that of those polled, 3,696 commended the BBC's coverage, whilst 176 were critical.\n\nSince 1927, there have been arguments over impartiality at the BBC. In 1927, under a Royal Charter, the BBC became a public entity for the first time – with requirements including the need for impartiality and for staff not to express opinions on controversial subject matters.\n\nPrior to World War II, Sir John Reith excluded Winston Churchill from the BBC airwaves. At the time of the Munich Agreement of 1938, Churchill \"complained that he had been very badly treated...and that he was always muzzled by the BBC\".\n\nFrom the late 1930s until the end of the Cold War, MI5 had an officer at the BBC vetting editorial applicants. During World War II 'subversives', particularly suspected communists such as the folk singer Ewan MacColl, were banned from the BBC. The personnel records of anyone suspicious were stamped with a distinctively shaped green tag, or \"Christmas tree;\" only a handful of BBC personnel staff knew what the 'Christmas trees' meant.\nSee also Wikipedia entries for Ronnie Stonham and Michael Rosen.\n\nBecause the BBC had become both a monopoly and a non-commercial entity, it soon faced controversial competition from British subjects who were operating leased transmitters on the continent of Europe before World War II, to blast commercial radio programmes into the United Kingdom. John Reith who had been given powers to dictate the cultural output of the BBC retaliated by leading the opposition to these commercial stations. Controversy spilled over into the press when the British government attempted to censor the printing of their programme information. The pressure was created by the success of these stations. By 1938 it was reported that on Sundays 80% of the British audience was tuning into commercial radio, rather than the non-commercial BBC.\n\nA BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2005 claimed that it had evidence that a radio newsreader inserted the word \"exactly\" into a midnight timecheck one summer night in 1953, a code word to the Shah of Iran that Britain supported his plans for a coup. The shah had selected the word, the documentary said, and the BBC broadcast the word at the request of the government. Officially, the BBC has never acknowledged the code word plot. The BBC spokesman declined to comment on a possible connection.\n\nWinston Churchill's government passed the Television Act 1954 that permitted the creation of the first commercial television network in Britain, ITV. This was criticised in the House of Lords by, among others, Lord Reith. Churchill explained to his doctor, Lord Moran: \"I am against the monopoly enjoyed by the BBC. For eleven years they kept me off the air. They prevented me from expressing views which have proved to be right. Their behaviour has been tyrannical. They are honeycombed with Socialists—probably with Communists\".\n\n\"The War Game\" is a drama documentary recounting the fictional dropping of Soviet nuclear weapons on Britain, centring on projected events in Kent. Using then current scientific knowledge of the effects of such a development, the film was directed by Peter Watkins. Intended for the twentieth anniversary on 6 August 1965 of the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima, \"The War Game\" was dropped from the BBC programme schedule before transmission on the grounds that it was too horrifying to be shown. Although given a limited cinema release by the British Film Institute (BFI), and awarded an Oscar as Best Documentary, it was not screened by the BBC until 1985.\n\nJohn Pilger in 2012 argued that the BBC's power to prevent \"the truth\" being broadcast, as represented by Watkins' film, has made \"the state broadcaster [into] a cornerstone of Britain’s ruling elite\".\n\nMary Whitehouse launched her 'Clean Up TV campaign' in April 1964. In her view Hugh Greene as BBC Director General was \"more than anybody else ... responsible for the moral collapse in this country.\" The campaign of Whitehouse and her supporters soon became the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association; Mrs Whitehouse was opposed to the policies of liberalisation pursued by Greene and largely sustained by his successors at the Corporation. Whitehouse's campaign focused much more on the BBC than on ITV, and she had a high public profile for several decades. The tabloid press also criticised the BBC for what it perceived as lapses in programming quality.\n\n\"Yesterday's Men\" is a BBC documentary first broadcast in June 1971 about the former ministers of Harold Wilson's Labour government who were now experiencing opposition. The approach of the programme makers, who included reporter David Dimbleby, angered Wilson and the Labour Party who saw it as displaying explicit Conservative bias. According to the official History of the BBC web page on the incident, the Labour politicians were \"effectively tricked into taking part in a programme that would ridicule them\". During his own interview Wilson was asked by Dimbleby, in an untransmitted section of their encounter, about the money he had made from his memoirs, a question which led to a furious exchange between them. Wilson wanted the programme shelved, but it was broadcast with minor changes.\n\nIn November 1979 \"Panorama\" showed masked IRA men manning a roadblock in Carrickmore. The Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary withdrew their cooperation immediately and the Unionist leader James Molyneaux claimed that the filming was \"at least a treasonable activity\". The BBC governors issued a statement which blamed the \"Panorama\" team and admitted that the filming of the IRA roadblock \"would appear to be a clear breach of standing instructions in relation to filming in Ireland\". In the House of Commons the Conservative MP Tim Eggar requested that the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, \"contact the governors of the BBC to express extreme concern about the way in which the \"Panorama\" team seems to have encouraged the IRA to break the law in Northern Ireland\". Thatcher replied that the government contacted the BBC about the programme: \"My hon. Friend will know that this is not the first time that we have had occasion to raise similar matters with the BBC. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I think that it is time that the BBC put its house in order\".\n\nDuring the Falklands War, the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and some Conservative MPs believed that the BBC was excessively even-handed between Britain and Argentina, referring to \"the British\" and \"the Argentines\" instead of \"our forces\" and \"the enemy\".\n\nOn 2 May during a report for \"Newsnight\", Peter Snow remarked: \"Until the British are demonstrated either to be deceiving us or to be concealing losses, we can only tend to give a lot more credence to the British version of events\". The Conservative MP John Page complained that the programme was \"totally offensive and almost treasonable\". Answering a question from Page on 6 May, Thatcher said that \"many people are very concerned indeed that the case for our British forces is not being put over fully and effectively. I understand that there are times when it seems that we and the Argentines are being treated almost as equals and almost on a neutral basis. I understand that there are occasions when some commentators will say that the Argentines did something and then \"the British\" did something. I can only say that if this is so it gives offence and causes great emotion among many people\". \"The Sun\" newspaper published an editorial on 7 May titled \"Dare Call it Treason: There are Traitors in Our Midst\" which criticised Snow. The \"Daily Mirror\" came to Snow's defence in an editorial titled 'The Harlot of Fleet Street', calling \"The Sun\" \"coarse and demented\" and that it had \"fallen from the gutter to the sewer...The Sun today is to journalism what Dr Joseph Goebbels was to truth\".\n\nThe 10 May edition of \"Panorama\" (titled \"Can We Avoid War?\") also provoked outrage. The day after it was broadcast, the Conservative MP Sally Oppenheim asked Thatcher in the Commons: \"Is she aware that for the most part, but not all, it was an odious, subversive, travesty in which Michael Cockerell and other BBC reporters dishonoured the right to freedom of speech in this country?\" Thatcher responded: \"I share the deep concern that has been expressed on many sides, particularly about the content of yesterday evening's \"Panorama\" programme. I know how strongly many people feel that the case for our country is not being put with sufficient vigour on certain—I do not say all—BBC programmes. The chairman of the BBC has assured us, and has said in vigorous terms, that the BBC is not neutral on this point, and I hope that his words will be heeded by the many who have responsibilities for standing up for our task force, our boys, our people and the cause of democracy\".\n\nAccording to the commander of the British Naval Task Force, Sandy Woodward, while the British were preparing to land on San Carlos the BBC World Service broadcast that the Battle Group and Amphibious Group of the Task Force had joined up. Woodward later wrote: \"I had hoped that this particular rendezvous at least could have remained a military secret until after the actual landing, but as ever the British media were more interested in the truth than in the consequences for our own people. We were infuriated\". Some on the Task Force said that \"if we got hit on the way and lost a lot of men, the Director General of the BBC should be charged with treason\". Shortly before the attack on Goose Green, the BBC broadcast that an attack was imminent and that the 2 Para regiment were within five miles of Darwin. According to Woodward, there \"are still some who believe that BBC report was directly responsible for the Argentinian 'ambush' in which Colonel Jones and many others died. Standing in the Ops Room of \"Hermes\" on the day the BBC effectively informed the Args of our position and bearing, I am sure we all felt the same\". Thatcher later wrote: \"Many of the public (including us) did not like the attitude [of the media] particularly the BBC...My concern was always the safety of our forces. Theirs was news\". She was also angry about the BBC's disclosure of 2 Para's position: \"Can there ever have been an army which had to fight its battles against media reporting like that?\"\n\nIn January 1984 the BBC programme \"Panorama\" broadcast \"Maggie's Militant Tendency\" which claimed that three Conservative MPs (Neil Hamilton, Harvey Proctor and Gerald Howarth) had links to far-right organisations both in Britain and on the Continent. There was controversy over the editing of the programme: it juxtaposed shots of Howarth wearing a train driver's uniform at a steam railway enthusiasts' rally with the claim that he had attended a fascist meeting in Italy, implying that the uniform he was wearing was a fascist one. In response, Hamilton and Howarth sued the BBC. The Director-General, Alasdair Milne, told the governors that the BBC's defence was \"fire-proof\" but in late 1986 the acting chairman, Lord Barnett, realised that the programme would not withstand legal scrutiny. Hamilton and Howarth received around a million pounds in libel damages.\n\nFootage of the so-called \"Battle of Orgreave\" on 18 June 1984 had been filmed by a crew from the BBC. When this appeared on that evening's BBC news bulletins, it was edited and broadcast out of chronological sequence, falsely showing pickets throwing stones at the police and the police subsequently carrying out a mounted charge.\n\nThe \"BBC News at Six\" reporting of the American bombing raid on Libya outraged Thatcher and Conservative Party Chairman Norman Tebbit because they believed it accepted the Libyan government's propaganda about civilian casualties and because it gave no airtime to American or British spokesmen to explain their government's stance. Tebbit ordered Conservative Central Office to compile a dossier on the BBC's reporting and then to hand it to the lawyer Lord Goodman for a critique. Goodman's critique largely agreed with the dossier's findings and on 30 October Tebbit submitted it to Lord Barnett, saying that the BBC's coverage was \"a mixture of news, views, speculations, error and uncritical carriage of Libyan propaganda which does serious damage to the reputation of the BBC\". The BBC rejected its findings.\n\nIn 1986 BBC journalists went on strike to protest against police raids in search of evidence that a BBC television series in production, \"Secret Society\", had endangered national security. The police searched the BBC studios in Glasgow, Scotland, the London home of investigative journalist Duncan Campbell, and the \"New Statesman\" offices.\n\nOn 12 June 1985, the controller of BBC2, Graeme MacDonald, was offered a series of documentaries by the BBC studios in Scotland in conjunction with an offer to them by Duncan Campbell whose work had previously appeared in the \"New Statesman\" magazine. The programmes were six half-hour films by Duncan Campbell (researched and presented by Campbell and produced according to BBC standards), which illuminated \"hidden truths of major public concern\". The six programmes were:\n\nWork began on the series. In April 1986 Alan Protheroe, acting on behalf of BBC Director General Alasdair Milne was asked for permission to \"bug\" a private detective who said he could access a Criminal Records Office computer. Permission was granted and filming took place. The police were informed and the man was subsequently charged under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911.\n\nThe sixth programme would have revealed details of a top secret spy satellite and Alisdair Milne had already decided to cut it from the line-up when \"The Observer\" newspaper broke the story on 18 January 1987 with the headline: \"BBC gag on £500M defence secret\". Combined with this story was a report that the Home Office intended to restrict the broadcast receiver licence fee, the implication being that the government had decided to censor BBC investigative journalism.\n\nSoon afterwards, a series of programmes on BBC Radio Four called \"My Country Right or Wrong\" was banned by the government because it might have revealed sensitive secrets. The series was censored only a few hours before it was due to start because it dealt with similar issues to the television series concerning the British \"secret state\". However, it was eventually broadcast uncut, after the government decided that it did not breach any laws or interfere with national security.\n\nOn 29 January 1987 Alasdair Milne was sacked by the newly appointed chairman of the BBC Board of Governors, Marmaduke Hussey. He was replaced by a senior BBC accountant, Michael Checkland. Milne later wrote his account of this affair in \"The Memoirs of a British Broadcaster\".\n\nOn 19 October 1988, Conservative Home Secretary Douglas Hurd under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher issued a notice under clause 13(4) of the BBC Licence and Agreement to the BBC and under section 29(3) of the Broadcasting Act 1981 to the Independent Broadcasting Authority prohibiting the broadcast of direct statements by representatives or supporters of eleven Irish political and military organisations. The ban lasted until 1994, and denied the UK news media the right to broadcast the voices, though not the words, of all Irish republican and loyalist paramilitaries, while the ban was targeted primarily at Sinn Féin.\n\nGovernment intimidation and laws before the ban had already resulted in forms of self-censorship. An INLA interview in July 1979 on BBC's \"Tonight\" caused a controversy involving Prime Minister Thatcher and was the last time such an interview was heard on British television. The 1980 \"Panorama\" film of the IRA on patrol in Carrickmore was seized by police under the Prevention of Terrorism Acts following an outcry in parliament and the press. In 1985 an edition of BBC's \"Real Lives\" series (\"At the Edge of the Union\") was temporarily withdrawn under government pressure. BBC governors found themselves in conflict with management and the corporation's journalists went on strike for a day. The programme was later transmitted with minor changes.\n\nCoverage of Sinn Féin by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 Sinn Féin was only heard or seen on television 93 times, had only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews as compared to 121 interviews with the Conservative Party and 172 with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many other participants. However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn Féin and republican viewpoints, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often lead to coverage and films being dropped entirely.\n\nTo allow the continuation of news reporting on the subject, during a time when 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland were a matter of great importance and interest, the BBC used actors to speak Adams' words. The net effect of the ban was to increase publicity.\n\nOn 18 October 1998, a presenter of the children's television programme \"Blue Peter\", Richard Bacon, was in the headlines when it emerged he had taken cocaine. He was released from his BBC contract immediately.\n\nIn May 2003, the defence correspondent of the BBC Radio 4 \"Today\" programme, Andrew Gilligan, quoted a government official who stated that the British government had \"sexed up\" a dossier concerning weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, against the wishes of the intelligence services. A newspaper report claimed that Alastair Campbell (the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy), was responsible. The government strongly denied the claims and this prompted an investigation by parliament.\n\nA Ministry of Defence scientist, Dr David Kelly, was named as the alleged source of the news item, which led to official sources suggesting that Dr Kelly was not a credible source. The subsequent suicide of Dr Kelly resulted in an escalation of the conflict between the government and the BBC, during which both sides received severe criticism for their roles in the matter.\n\nThe publication in January 2004 of the \"Hutton Report\" into Dr Kelly's death was extremely critical of Andrew Gilligan, and of the corporation's management processes and standards of journalism. In the aftermath, both the chairman of the BBC Gavyn Davies and the Director-General Greg Dyke resigned, followed by Gilligan himself. Lord Hutton was accused of failing to take account of the imperfections inherent in journalism, while giving the government the benefit of the doubt over its own conduct. Large parts of the media branded it a whitewash.\n\nA second inquiry by Lord Butler of Brockwell did review the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction and the production of the dossier. Amongst other things, the \"Butler Report\" concluded that:\n\"... the fact that the reference [to the 45 minute claim] in the classified assessment was repeated in the dossier later led to suspicions that it had been included because of its eye-catching character.\"\nAndrew Gilligan claims that the \"Butler Report\" vindicated his original story that the dossier had been \"sexed up\".\n\nThe BBC fought to overturn a ruling by the Information Tribunal that the BBC was wrong to refuse to release to a member of the public under the Freedom of Information Act of 2000 (FOI) the Balen report on its Middle East coverage. The report examines the BBC's coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict.\n\nThe corporation was reported to have spent £200,000 on fighting the case and was accused by commentators of wasting licence fee payers' money. Critics called the BBC's blocking an FOI request \"shameful hypocrisy\" in light of the corporation's previous extensive use of FOI requests in its journalism.\n\nOn Friday 27 April 2007 the High Court rejected Steven Sugar's challenge to the Information Commissioner's decision. However, on 11 February 2009 the House of Lords (the UK's highest court) reinstated the Information Tribunal's decision to allow Mr Sugar's appeal against the Information Commissioner's decision. The matter goes back to the High Court for determination of the BBC's further appeal on a point of law against the Tribunal's decision.\n\nThe BBC's press release following the High Court judgement included the following statement:\n\n\"The BBC's action in this case had nothing to do with the fact that the Balen report was about the Middle East – the same approach would have been taken whatever area of news output was covered.\"\n\nMr Sugar was reported after his success in the House of Lords as saying:\n\n\"It is sad that the BBC felt it necessary to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money fighting for three years to try to load the system against those requesting information from it. I am very pleased that the House of Lords has ruled that such obvious unfairness is not the result of the Act.\"\n\nSteven Sugar died of cancer in January 2011, and it remains unclear what will happen with the legal battle. There is the possibility of someone picking up the case on Mr. Sugar's behalf. The Supreme Court says it has listed the case provisionally for another hearing in Autumn 2011.\n\nIn 2004 the BBC Governors approved a deal to outsource the BBC's IT, telephony and broadcast technology (which had previously been run by the corporation's internal BBC technology division) to the German engineering and electronics company Siemens IT Solutions and Services (SIS). It was claimed that the sale of BBC Technology would deliver over £30 million of savings to the BBC. In June 2007 a report published by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee was critical of the deal, claiming that BBC management had omitted £60 million' worth of hidden costs in its application to the Board of Governors and that the profits to Siemens had not been taken into account. Recorded savings to the BBC had amounted to £22m, 38% lower than the BBC's original forecast.\n\nThe BBC's partnership with Siemens underwent some high-profile difficulties, including issues with the corporation-wide switchover to a IP telephony system in 2009; a major outage of the BBC website in 2011; and Siemens was the original technology partner in the Digital Media Initiative until its contract was terminated in 2009 (see below). In December 2010, SIS was acquired from Siemens by the French company Atos and BBC IT, broadcast and website systems are now managed by Atos.\n\nA phone-in competition supporting Unicef, held by the children's programme \"Blue Peter\" in November 2006, was revealed to have been rigged. The winning caller in the competition was actually a visitor to the set who pretended to be calling from an outside line to select a prize. The competition was rigged because of a technical problem with receiving the calls. The controversy was the beginning of a wider controversy in which a number of other broadcasters were fined for faking telephone competitions.\n\nIn 2006 the BBC launched a free educational website for children, BBC Jam, which cost £150 million. Following complaints by a number of commercial suppliers of educational software that the BBC was engaging in anti-competitive practices by providing this service for free, the BBC Trust announced that the website would be suspended pending a review. The following year it was decided that the service would not be relaunched and it was closed permanently.\n\nIn early 2007 the BBC commissioned RDF Media to make a behind-the-scenes film about the monarchy, titled \"\", for BBC One. A 60-second trailer was shown at the BBC1 autumn launch in London on 11 July. The trailer showed two clips of Queen Elizabeth II; one in which she tells photographer Annie Leibovitz that she will not remove her crown to make the scene look \"less dressy\", and another in which the Queen says \"I'm not changing anything. I've done enough dressing like this\".\n\nThe shots in the trailer were edited out of sequence, making it appear as if the Queen had abruptly left the photo shoot, when in fact, the second shot showed her \"entering\" the shoot. BBC 1 Controller Peter Fincham told journalists at the launch that it showed the monarch \"losing it a bit and walking out in a huff\".\n\nThe next day, newspapers and other media sources ran headlines stating that the Queen had stormed out during the session. On 12 July, the BBC released a formal apology to both the Queen and Leibovitz. On 16 July, RDF Media admitted it was \"guilty of a serious error of judgement\"; Fincham and RDF Media chief creative officer Stephen Lambert both resigned.\n\nIn October 2007, the BBC released the report of its investigation into the incident. The investigation concluded that nobody at the BBC \"consciously set out to defame or misrepresent the Queen\" and that there was never a possibility \"that the misleading sequence could have been included in the finished documentary to be broadcast by the BBC\" but that nonetheless \"the incident reveal[ed] misjudgements, poor practice and ineffective systems as well, of course, as the usual helping of bad luck that often accompanies such sorry affairs.\"\n\nWhen the children's programme \"Blue Peter\" acquired a pet cat in January 2007, it held an internet vote to choose a name for the animal. In September of that year, it was revealed that viewers had selected the name Cookie, but producers changed the result to Socks instead, leading to accusations of breach of audience trust. An apology to viewers was subsequently made on the programme.\n\nIn a show recorded on 16 October 2008 and broadcast two days later, Brand made several phone calls, along with guest Jonathan Ross, to the home of actor Andrew Sachs, claiming that Brand had sexual relations with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie, along with further apparently lewd suggestions. Later coverage in the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper led to number of complaints, and ultimately Ross left the broadcaster.\n\nOn 22 January 2009, the BBC declined a request from the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to screen an aid appeal intended to raise money to aid the relief effort following then recent hostilities in the Gaza Strip. Explanations cited by Mark Thompson, the BBC's then Director General raised doubts about the possibility of delivering aid in a volatile situation and highlighted the need to avoid any risk of compromising public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in the context of an ongoing news story.\n\nBecause of a lack of consensus among UK broadcasters, with British Sky Broadcasting announcing it would follow the BBC's view, TV channels in the UK initially decided not to broadcast the appeal., A public demonstration occurred outside Broadcasting House on 24 January with former cabinet minister Tony Benn attacking the decision in an interview on BBC News 24 during which he read out the appeal address, and alleging that the Israeli government was preventing the appeal from being broadcast.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported that the BBC faced a revolt from its journalists over the issue, and that they had been threatened with dismissal if they spoke out. In an editorial, the paper described the refusal to broadcast the appeal as 'taking a partisan stance' and an error of judgement.\n\nFour days after the BBC refusal, ITV, Channel 4 and Five broadcast the appeal intact on 26 January. The BBC also broadcast substantial extracts from the appeal in its TV news programmes.\n\nThe BBC's decision came in for criticism across the political spectrum including from senior politicians such as Nick Clegg, Douglas Alexander and Hazel Blears and public figures like the Archbishops of York and Canterbury, although it was supported by a few commentators such as Dominic Lawson.\n\nOn 25 January 2009, then Secretary of State for International Development Douglas Alexander supported the appeal telling Sky News: \"My appeal is a much more straight forward one. People are suffering right now, many hundreds of thousands of people are without the basic necessities of life. That for me is a very straight forward case and I sincerely hope that the British people respond with characteristic generosity.\"\n\nMP Richard Burden put forward an early day motion calling on the BBC to screen the appeal which received the support of 112 MPs. Meanwhile, another Labour MP, Gerald Kaufman, complained about \"nasty pressure\" on the BBC from Israeli lobbyists. However, Mark Thompson, the Director-General of the BBC, denied that the decision was due to Israeli pressure. Complaints to the BBC about the decision were directed to Mark Thompson's blog. BBC's \"Newsnight\" programme reported that the BBC had received over 15,000 complaints as well as 200 letters of support.\n\nAfter the appeal was broadcast on Channel 4 on 26 January 2009, Niaz Alam resigned as an external member of the BBC's Appeals Advisory Committee in protest at the BBC's explanation of its refusal to broadcast the appeal, after news coverage gave the impression the whole of this committee had been party to the decision.\n\nA version of his resignation letter, was published in Private Eye, defending the impartiality of the Disasters Emergency Committee's recommendation and criticising the BBC's refusal to broadcast the appeal. The letter also disputed the logic of the justification to block the appeal on grounds of impartiality by pointing out that 'the ultimate logic of a policy of avoiding appeals arising out of politically controversial conflicts would be for the BBC to ignore major humanitarian crises.'\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Peter Oborne wrote and presented an edition of Channel 4's \"Dispatches\" titled \"Inside Britain's Israel Lobby, \" in which this controversy was featured as one small part towards the end, when he discussed the BBC's refusal to broadcast the 2009 DEC Gaza appeal with Niaz Alam.\n\nThe BBC Trust reported in its 'Decision of the BBC Trust' document on the appeal that, 'the BBC Executive had received about 40,000 complaints about the Director General's decision'. The BBC's chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson, affirmed the need to broadcast \"without affecting and impinging on the audience's perception of our impartiality\" and that in this case, it was a \"real issue.\"\n\nThe 2009 Gaza appeal is the only occasion on which the BBC is known to have refused an appeal broadcast request from the DEC.\n\nIt is reported the 2009 DEC Gaza appeal screened only by Channel 4 and ITV raised £8.3m. In August 2014 the BBC broadcast a new DEC aid appeal for people in Gaza, without similar controversy, which raised £16m over two years.\n\nFollowing the improved performance of the British National Party in the 2009 European elections, the BBC controversially changed its stance on the appearance of the BNP on the flagship current affairs talk show, \"Question Time\", and invited party leader Nick Griffin to appear on its edition of 22 October 2009. The BBC was also obliged to transmit party political broadcasts by the BNP.\n\nIn 2008 the BBC launched the Digital Media Initiative (DMI), a technology programme intended to streamline broadcast operations by moving to a fully digital, tapeless production workflow at a cost of £81.7 million. It was forecast to deliver cost savings to the BBC of around £18 million. DMI was contracted out to the technology services provider Siemens with consulting by Deloitte.\n\nCosts of the project rose after a number of technical problems and delays, and in 2009 the BBC terminated the contract with Siemens. BBC losses were estimated to be £38.2m, partially offset by a £27.5m settlement paid by Siemens, leaving a loss of £10.7m to the BBC. The BBC was criticised by the UK National Audit Office in 2011 for its handling of the project.\n\nIn 2009 the BBC brought the DMI project in-house and started work on a digital system to be known as \"Fabric\". Lord Hall, the BBC's Director General, announced in late May 2013 that the project was to be abandoned after costs reached £98 million.\n\nOn 29 November 2009 BBC News Channel broadcast claims by Denis Avey that he smuggled himself into Monowitz concentration camp in 1944. These claims were presented as fact on the BBC website and became the subject of the best-selling book \"The Man who Broke into Auschwitz\" co-authored by Avey and BBC journalist Rob Broomby. Avey's claims generated considerable controversy, and were questioned in a number of newspapers. The BBC came under criticism for having broadcast these and for promoting the book. The BBC subsequently acknowledged the controversy in a subsequent programme.\n\nIn 2009, the actress and comedian Victoria Wood stated that BBC panel shows were too male-dominated, and involved \"a lot of men topping each other\".\n\nIn February 2014 the television executive Danny Cohen said that there would no longer be any all male comedy panel shows on the BBC and all shows must contain a woman. The journalist Caitlin Moran referred to tokenism already existing on such shows. Dara Ó Briain, host of BBC 2 panel show \"Mock the Week\", also referred to tokenism and \"token woman\" speaking against this idea. Comedian Milton Jones called it \"counterproductive\".\n\nJournalist Deborah Orr, although she also considered it \"tokenistic\", wrote in favour of the plan: \"The issue of gender representation on panel games is comparatively trivial. But the fact is this: if comparatively trivial contemporary manifestations of long-standing disadvantage cannot be seen for what they are, and dealt with, but instead become bemired in trenchant opposition, what hope is there in tackling the vast, brutal and comprehensive ones.\"\n\nIn March 2010 Bob Geldof confronted Andrew Marr on a BBC report claiming the Ethiopian government used money raised for the famine to pay for weapons. Geldof and the Band Aid Trust reported the BBC to Ofcom over the incident. Development agency Christian Aid announced it too would make a complaint to the BBC Trust. The Ethiopian ambassador to the UK Berhanu Kebede called it a \"disgrace\" and a \"ridiculous report\" and said the BBC had \"destroyed its credibility in Africa\" by making such claims. Geldof said it would be a \"tragedy\" if British people refused to donate money due to the BBC claims.\n\nThe BBC initially announced that it was standing by its report and claimed to have evidence to back up its stance. The BBC was forced to broadcast a series of apologies in November 2010 after realising that it did not have enough evidence that any money was spent on weapons, basing much of the unfounded claims on a CIA report it had failed to question. It also apologised to Geldof for claiming that he had refused to respond to its fabricated story, with Geldof saying that much damage had been caused by the BBC to charity campaigns. Mr. Geldof also said \"appalling damage\" had been caused to the Band Aid Trust by the BBC.\n\nThe BBC was accused of ageism and sexism when news presenter Moira Stuart (55) – the first black female television newsreader – was sacked in April 2007 after more than two decades of presenting, despite many male presenters in similar situations being allowed to continue in their jobs.\nIn November 2008, four female \"Countryfile\" presenters (Michaela Strachan, Charlotte Smith, Miriam O'Reilly and Juliet Morris), all in their 40s and 50s, were dismissed from the show.\n\nThe issue returned in July 2009, when former theatre choreographer Arlene Phillips (66) was replaced on the \"Strictly Come Dancing\" panel by Alesha Dixon, a pop-star half her age. The males on the show were Len Goodman (65), Bruno Tonioli (53), Craig Revel Horwood (44), and Bruce Forsyth (81).\n\nFormer \"Countryfile\" presenter Miriam O'Reilly claimed she was \"warned about wrinkles\", and won an employment tribunal against the corporation on the grounds of ageism and victimisation – but not sexism. With other older women also dropped by the BBC, Joan Bakewell claimed the BBC's policy was \"damaging the position of older women in society\", whilst former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell said that the BBC was obsessed with youth culture and was shallow thinking.\n\nIn December 2010, the BBC broadcast an episode of its TV quiz show \"QI\" in which panellists made jokes during a discussion about Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who survived both atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Yamaguchi had died only earlier that year. The Japanese embassy in London wrote a letter of complaint to the BBC about the content of its quiz show after being alerted to the offensive content when viewers in Japan contacted diplomatic staff. Yamaguchi's daughter also made known how upset she was as a result of the comments broadcast on the BBC. She said that Britain, as a nuclear power, had no right to \"look down\" on her father.\n\nIn January 2011, the BBC issued an apology for \"any offence caused\" to Japan by the incident, recognising \"the sensitivity of the subject matter for Japanese viewers\". In February 2011, the BBC blamed a \"strength of feeling\" in Japan following its atomic bomb joke broadcast for the cancellation of the filming of part of its \"Planet Word\" documentary in Japan. The documentary was due to be presented by Stephen Fry, the host of \"QI\".\n\nOn 30 January 2011, the BBC broadcast an episode of its motoring TV show \"Top Gear\" during which presenters referred to Mexicans as both \"lazy\" and \"feckless\" and Mexican food as \"refried sick\". The broadcast caused many complaints in Mexico, including in newspapers and websites, while a motion of censure was considered in the Mexican senate and the BBC Spanish-language website BBC Mundo received protests. Richard Hammond, one of the presenters, expressed doubt that there would be any complaints against them as, he alleged, the Mexican ambassador would be asleep.\n\nBritish MPs described the comments as \"ignorant, derogatory and racist\" and called on the BBC to say it was sorry. Mexico's ambassador in London also requested that the BBC say it was sorry for the \"offensive, xenophobic and humiliating\" comments. The legal firm who previously pursued the media in the Shilpa Shetty case involving comments in \"Big Brother\" have engaged clients for the case.\n\nThe BBC then offered an apology, though it claimed there was no \"vindictiveness\" in the remarks and that they were just part of the stereotype-based comedy the organisation espoused, such as when it \"make[s] jokes about the Italians being disorganised and over dramatic, the French being arrogant and the Germans being over-organised\". Trevor Phillips, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, told \"The Sunday Times\" that he was \"not going to get hot under the collar about schoolboy provocation which frankly is organised so that we can get into a ruck and sell more DVDs for Jeremy Clarkson – Jeremy is rich enough\".\n\nThe BBC's 50-year-old flagship weekly current affairs programme \"Panorama\" had aired a documentary claiming that Bangalore-based suppliers of Primark, a hugely successful retailer with 220 stores across Europe, were using child labour in their production in 2008. The claim has been found to be untrue and the BBC apologised to Primark admitting its mistake. Responding to Primark's protest, the BBC conceded in a 49-page report that footage of three boys engaged in completing garments for Primark was \"more likely than not\" to have been \"not genuine\" after a three-year internal inquiry.\n\nThe BBC News website featured a story claiming that a dog had been sentenced to death by stoning by an Israeli court. It later transpired that the story was untrue. The story had been sourced from AFP and had originated from Israel's Maariv newspaper as a hoax story.\n\nThe BBC published a retraction and an explanation.\n\nOn 15 September 2011 \"The One Show\" presenters introduced a \"new member of the One Show family\", the dog trainer Jordan Shelley. The following day, Shelley was shown treating a problem of food guarding in a Jack Russell terrier called Roxy. Only confrontational methods were used, and at the end of the segment Alex Jones remarked that \"some people out there might argue that some of your techniques were a little aggressive\". According to an article in the \"Daily Mail\", the BBC quickly received over 400 complaints about the methods used by Shelley.\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" article was followed by an article on the \"Daily Telegraph\" website, saying \"Jordan Shelley doesn't seem to have any formal training or qualifications, and I've been unable to track down any evidence of his experience. High profile television programmes have a responsibility to ensure that advice given out is consistent with current best practice: \"The One Show\"’s dog training segment certainly does not do this\". The Kennel Club published a statement criticising the training methods used in the programme on its website, as did the Dogs Trust.\n\nImmediately after the show on 21 September, the BBC press office released a statement; \"\"The One Show\" has thanked viewers for all their comments and criticisms which were taken very seriously. Last night the show featured various differing opinions plus advice from The One Show's vet on the subject of dog training and care. There are currently no plans for this feature to return.\"\n\nOn 27 May 2012 the BBC News website used a photograph taken in Iraq in 2003 to illustrate a massacre which was reported as having taken place in Syria in 2012.\n\nDuring the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament in Poland and Ukraine, the BBC current affairs programme \"Panorama\" aired \"Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate\", which discussed racism in the sport. It included recent footage of supporters chanting various xenophobic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland, as well as Nazi salutes and the beating of a few South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was widely commented in the British press, but later criticised for being one-sided, sensationalist and unethical. The critics included other British media outlets, Polish anti-racism campaigners and black and Jewish community leaders in Poland. Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists, British fans visiting Poland and Ukraine and Gary Lineker also voiced similar concerns about the broadcast.\n\nThe executive director of the Jewish Community Centre of Kraków, Jonathan Ornstein, a Jewish source used in the film said: \"I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source. The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda... the BBC knowingly cheated its own audience – the British people – by concocting a false horror story about Poland. In doing so, the BBC has spread fear, ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I am profoundly disturbed by this unethical form of journalism.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported: \"Other sources have come forward to say that an interview with a Jewish Israeli player was also cut from the programme because he failed to confirm Panorama's \"anti-semitism\" thesis. The BBC interviewed midfielder Aviram Baruchian, who plays for the Polish team Polonia Warsaw. One source who was present said the Panorama journalists had complained afterwards that the interview was \"useless\". Panorama strongly denies this.\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" reported that the Football Association intended to write a letter of complaint to the BBC.\n\nDespite the BBC warning, Poland and Ukraine fans were not exhibiting racist attitudes. By the end of the tournament however, four other nations were fined by UEFA for the racist activities of their fans: Germany, Spain, Croatia and Russia.\n\nThe BBC's live television coverage of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee River Thames Pageant on 3 June 2012 attracted some criticism in the media, and the corporation reportedly received over 4500 complaints from members of the public about the broadcast. Criticism centred on the \"informal\" style of presentation which was perceived by some commentators to be too lowbrow for a royal occasion. Some reviewers thought that the BBC presenters had concentrated too much on interviewing celebrities and that they were insufficiently prepared to add depth to the TV commentary.\n\nThe actor and writer Stephen Fry was of the opinion that the coverage was \"mind-numbingly tedious\", and BBC radio presenter Sue MacGregor expressed disappointment that the coverage had failed to provide sufficient historical context to viewers. Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy and composer Gavin Greenaway publicly criticised the lack of television coverage given to the music which had been specially commissioned for the event. BBC creative director Alan Yentob defended the BBC's coverage, citing high audience approval ratings, and Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson congratulated BBC staff for their work on the broadcast.\n\nIn early October 2012, it was found that a Newsnight investigation to allegations of sexual abuse by the late Jimmy Savile had been shelved shortly before it was due to be broadcast. On 11 October George Entwistle, the Director-General of the BBC, directed the head of BBC Scotland, Ken MacQuarrie, to commence an investigation into why this program was cancelled, He also announced an investigation into the BBC's child protection policy, and another into the prevalent culture within the department, particularly at the time of Savile's employment.\n\nOn 23 October 2012, Entwistle appeared before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to answer questions following revelations that Savile had abused children on BBC property while working for the BBC. When asked by committee chairman John Whittingdale if the BBC's reputation for trust and integrity was in jeopardy, Entwistle stated that allegations of child abuse at the BBC were a \"very, very grave matter\". A \"Panorama\" investigation reported on what they considered to have been a paedophile ring that might have operated for at least 20 years, and possibly as long as 40 years, and BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson described it as the BBC's \"biggest crisis for over 50 years\".\n\nOn 12 November the BBC announced that its director of news Helen Boaden was \"stepping aside\", together with her deputy Steve Mitchell, prior to the outcome of an investigation into the Savile child abuse claims. Nick Pollard's report into the shelving of a \"Newsnight\" report on Savile in 2011 was published on 19 December 2012. It concluded that the decision to drop the original report was \"flawed\", but that it had not been done to protect programmes prepared as tributes to Savile. Pollard's report criticised George Entwistle for apparently failing to read emails warning him of Savile's \"dark side\", and stated that, after the allegations against Savile eventually became public, the BBC fell into a \"level of chaos and confusion [that] was even greater than was apparent at the time\". The BBC announced that \"Newsnight\" editor Peter Rippon and deputy editor Liz Gibbons would be replaced, and that deputy director of news Steve Mitchell had resigned, but that Helen Boaden would return to her role.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal, \"Newsnight\" investigated the North Wales child abuse scandal. On 2 November 2012, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home was reported on \"Newsnight\" claiming that a prominent, but unnamed, former Conservative politician had sexually abused him during the 1970s. The rumour was spread by users of Twitter and other social media which identified the politician. After \"The Guardian\" reported a possible case of mistaken identity, Lord McAlpine issued a strong denial that he was in any way involved, asserting that the allegations were wholly false and seriously defamatory. The accuser unreservedly apologised, admitting that, as soon as he saw a photograph of the individual, he realised he had been mistaken. The BBC also apologised.\n\nHowever McAlpine about whom the claims were made, began legal proceedings against the broadcasters who made allegations about him, eventually settling for £185,000 from the BBC and £125,000 from ITV. In a subsequent libel case, Sally Bercow, wife of John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, was prosecuted for libel regarding her Twitter posting which named McAlpine. Following a High Court verdict in favour of the plaintiff, where Bercow's comment was found to have been defamatory, she paid undisclosed damages to McAlpine.\n\nThe decision to broadcast the \"Newsnight\" report without contacting its subject led to further criticism of the BBC, and the resignation of its Director-General, George Entwistle on 10 November. It was later announced that Entwistle's severance package was in excess of £1.3 million. Harriet Harman, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, declared that Entwistle had been rewarded for 'failure'.\n\nOn 21 January 2013, the BBC News website ran a story that reveled that the BBC had received 216 complaints for their children's channel CBeebies having shown a repeat of a cancelled children's programme called \"Tweenies\" the previous day, that showed a character known as \"Max\" impersonating Jimmy Savile; the character had on a blonde wig (not usually part of \"his\" wardrobe), and used Savile's accent and catchphrase \"Now then, guys and gals\". \"Max\" is an adult character on this show which is set in a day care centre; he looks after pre-school-aged characters. \n\nGovernment media regulation body Ofcom said it had received \"tens\" of complaints as well.\n\nThe BBC responded with the following:\n\n\"This morning CBeebies broadcast a repeat of an episode of the Tweenies, originally made in 2001, featuring a character dressed as a DJ impersonating Jimmy Savile. This programme will not be repeated and we are very sorry for any offence caused.\"\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported that the BBC had spent a total of £28 million to include 'silencing clauses' in staff contracts, effective during, and following the end of, the contract periods.\n\nThe large severance payments given to departing BBC executives came to widespread media attention in 2013 when the National Audit Office conducted an investigation into BBC senior management pay. The practice had been going on for a number of years. Senior executives whose payments were criticised included: chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who received a total of £680,400 on her departure in 2011; Deputy Director-General Mark Byford who also left the BBC in 2011, taking £949,000; CEO of BBC Worldwide John Smith who was paid a total of £1,031,000 in 2011 (he later returned £205,000); George Entwistle who left the Director-General job after only 54 days following the Savile crisis, and received a payment of £511,500; and Roly Keating, the head of BBC Archives, who received a £375,000 severance payment in 2012 (which he later repaid in full). Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, criticised the practice, calling it an \"outrageous waste of licence fee payers' money.\" Following his appointment as Director General, Lord Hall introduced a £150,000 cap on severance payments. Mark Thompson stated to the PAC that the payments had been fully approved by the BBC Trust.\n\nBBC plans to broadcast the German ZDF film \"Generation War\" upset certain British residents of Polish origin, as the film had already been accused of slandering the Polish anti-Nazi underground Armia Krajowa as anti-Semites, and of portraying false stereotypes of Poles and Germans during the period of occupation. In Germany, after ambassador Jerzy Marganski sent a letter of complaint to ZDF, the broadcaster provided corrective actions producing and broadcasting film 'Kampf ums Überleben'.\n\nOn 14 August 2014, Cliff Richard's apartment in Berkshire was searched by South Yorkshire Police in relation to an alleged historical sexual assault on a boy aged under 16. BBC reporters were on the scene as police arrived, and a BBC helicopter covered the raid as it happened. Richard, who was in Portugal at the time, released a statement asserting that the allegation was \"completely false\" and complained that the press appeared to have been given advance notice of the search – whereas he had not been. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw stated that the media presence at Richard's home \"was highly unusual – it appears to be a deliberate attempt by police to ensure maximum coverage\", but added: \"That's not illegal - but there are strict guidelines.\" South Yorkshire Police initially denied leaking details of the property search, but later confirmed that they had been \"working with a media outlet\" about the investigation.\n\nBy 19 August, the BBC claimed to have received up to 594 complaints regarding the coverage. Barrister and broadcaster Geoffrey Robertson questioned the legality of the search and called for an independent inquiry into the police operation and the prior leaking to media of the property search. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve accused the police of having a \"collusive relationship\" with the BBC, claiming that the decision to tip off the BBC \"seems quite extraordinary.\" Officials from the BBC and South Yorkshire Police were called before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 2 September. There, the chief constable of South Yorkshire Police accused the BBC of \"extortion\"; however, MPs dismissed this, with chairman Keith Vaz stating that the BBC had \"acted perfectly properly\" in its coverage of the raid.\n\nAfter being told he would not be charged in June 2016, Richard said that he was considering suing the BBC. The BBC apologised for \"distress\" caused by its coverage but stood by the story as it believed it was in the public interest. Richard sued the BBC and was awarded £210,000 in damages in July 2018 after London’s High Court ruled that the broadcaster had infringed his right to privacy.\n\nThroughout the campaign preceding the Scottish independence referendum held on 18 September 2014, there were accusations claiming that the BBC was neither neutral nor impartial.\n\nOn 14 September 2014 thousands of protesters demonstrated outside BBC Scotland's headquarters in Glasgow accusing the corporation and its political editor Nick Robinson of broadcasting “lies” and of being “biased” against the Yes Scotland campaign. The demonstrators demanded that Robinson be dismissed. The 'Yes' campaign was not itself involved in the demonstration. The protestors also later complained that coverage about the demonstration was not broadcast by the BBC.\n\nAlex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, agreed with the view that the BBC was biased in favour of retaining the union. However, in an interview given after his clash with Robinson, he said he believed it was the fault of the BBC's London-based staff rather than BBC Scotland itself.\n\nProfessor John Robertson and a team at the University of the West of Scotland monitored news broadcasts of the BBC and ITV until September 2013 for their study \"Fairness in the First Year\". The report found that the BBC was biased against the 'Yes' campaign in matters of airtime, sequencing of news items, prevalence of \"bad news\" items, and misleading presentation of sources as impartial. John Boothman, BBC Scotland's head of news and current affairs, rejected Robertson's accusation that the BBC had suppressed coverage of the report, while Ken MacQuarrie, director of BBC Scotland, rejected the report's allegations.\n\nOn 11 March 2015, the BBC suspended Jeremy Clarkson after a reported altercation with a producer. It was later established that Clarkson, in a \"fracas\", had punched producer Oisin Tymon during an argument over catering arrangements at the \"Top Gear\" production crew's hotel. A petition on change.org to reinstate Clarkson gained over one million signatories before it was delivered to the BBC.\n\nOn 25 March 2015, the BBC announced that Jeremy Clarkson's \"Top Gear\" contract would not be renewed and that he would be dropped from the programme. After an internal investigation, the final decision had been taken by Tony Hall, director general of the BBC. This development led the other \"Top Gear\" presenters, Richard Hammond and James May, to support Clarkson by quitting \"Top Gear\" themselves (by allowing their BBC contracts to expire at the end of March without renewal).\n\nFollowing a dispute over the name the BBC was using to refer to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Director-General Tony Hall told MPs in a letter that the name a group of terrorists had chosen for itself must be used by the BBC because of the latter's duty to remain \"impartial\", regardless of the fact that the UK was at the time bombing the terrorist group:\nIn January 2016, the team behind the BBC's \"Daily Politics\" show co-ordinated the on-air resignation of Labour politician Stephen Doughty shortly before the start of Prime Minister's Questions. The show's output editor Andrew Alexander wrote a (later deleted) blog post for the BBC website explaining how this had come about. Alexander wrote: \"We knew his resignation just before PMQs would be a dramatic moment with big political impact\". The timing of the announcement ensured Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was caught off guard. BBC News political editor Laura Kuenssberg \"sealed the deal\" with Doughty before filming, even though it appeared to viewers that the resignation had been unplanned. A camera crew even filmed Doughty and Kuenssberg arriving at the studio together in advance of the announcement, this to televise later on news bulletins.\n\nIn July 2017, in response to a demand from the UK government as a condition of its new royal charter, the BBC published a list of all employees who earned more than £150,000. Of the 96 BBC employees making over this threshold, 62 were men and 34 were women, and of the seven highest earners, all were men. The disclosure prompted criticism of the BBC over the gender pay gap; other critics also criticised a lack of ethnic diversity among the highest-earning BBC personalities.\n\nEarly in January 2018, it was announced that Carrie Gracie, the BBC's China editor, had resigned from the role because of the salary gender disparity. A pre-broadcast conversation between \"Today\" presenter John Humphrys and Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, was leaked a few days later. Humphrys was recorded joking about the disparity. BBC management itself was said to be \"deeply unimpressed\" with Humphrys' comments.\n\nIt became known on 26 January that some of the BBC's leading male presenters would take a pay cut. According to the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan, Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine, and John Humphrys were among those to have agreed to a salary reduction.\n\n\nOther channels:\n\n"}
{"id": "5376630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5376630", "title": "Battle Dome", "text": "Battle Dome\n\nBattle Dome was a syndicated American television series that aired from September 1999 to April 2001. It combined elements of \"American Gladiators\" – inspired athletic competition with scripted antics more reminiscent of professional wrestling. Recurring character-athletes known as \"Warriors\" competed against weekly contestants in a variety of physically demanding (and sometimes dangerous) events. The series was filmed at the Los Angeles Sports Arena and produced by Columbia TriStar Television.\n\nThe entire first and second season of \"Battle Dome\" is available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon Video.\n\nA Warrior typically entered the show's arena accompanied by his own bombastic theme music and-in several cases-a comely female sidekick; in later episodes, weekly contestants were also allotted female companions, courtesy of \"Perfect 10\" magazine.\n\nThe announcer for the show was Steve Albert (brother of Marv and the uncle of Kenny); Scott Ferrall provided color commentary. Seth Stockton served as referee for the entire run. Downtown Julie Brown appeared in early episodes, as a sideline correspondent but was replaced by Kathleen McClellan for the run of the show. The \"Chairman\", whose face remained off camera, oversaw the proceedings. Halfway through the show's run, Ferrall and Brown were replaced by Ed Lover and Brien Blakely, respectively, and \"The chairman\" was dropped from the show.\n\n\"Battle Dome\" was also broadcast in the UK, on the Challenge and Bravo networks, as well as on Channel 5, now \"Five.\" It was also broadcast in Ireland on TV3.\n\nThree male contestants competed in a series of four or five events, which varied in intensity and danger factor. After the fourth or fifth event, the two highest scoring competitors advanced to the Battle Dome final. In addition to facing the contestants, the Battle Dome Warriors were in a show-long competition against each other for the Battle Dome Warriors Championship belt. The Warriors were ranked before the competition started and could move up or down the list depending on either how well they performed during the show or how well they politicked with the chairman or his on-camera assistant, Bobbie Haven (played by model Bobbie Brown, who prior to this was best known for her appearance in the video for Warrant's \"Cherry Pie\").\n\nIf the second and third place players were tied, the tie was broken in a rather novel way. Both players would stand on platforms on two separate metal discs, with the discs being pulled back and rammed together at high rates of speed. The intensity of the hit grew until one player fell off, at which point they would be going home. This also would help determine the Warriors champion if the championship was in question at the end of a show.\n\nAfter all ties and championships between the Warriors and contestants were settled, the two remaining players moved into the Battle Dome for the final round, in which the two competitors wrestled each other in an attempt to throw the opponent off an elevated platform. Doing so won the match, a cash prize, and a Battle Dome championship ring. The winner would also advance in the Battle Dome tournament, with the winner getting a large cash prize, a motorcycle, and a Battle Dome Championship belt at the end of the season.\n\n\nIn fall of 2000, the stars of \"Battle Dome\" and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began a brief cross-promotional feud. It kicked off when WCW wrestlers disrupted a \"Battle Dome\" taping. In retaliation, on the November 6 edition of \"Monday Nitro\", T-Money, Cuda, Mike O'Dell (husband of WCW star Midajah), D.O.A., and Bubba King began heckling in the audience as Diamond Dallas Page spoke to the Chicago crowd. Rick Steiner, Ernest Miller, and Buff Bagwell came to Page's aid before security ended the physical dispute. The feud between these men continued as far as November 20, mere months before the buyout of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nAll events were overseen by Referee Seth Stockton. His actual level of authority is unclear although he did ban a few warriors from competing for bad behaviour.\n\nBattle Wheel\n\nTwo warriors competed. The event took place on a large, rotating platform which resembled a right circular cone with its outside edge and apex flattened. The contenders had 60 seconds to force both warriors to touch the bottom ring of the wheel with any part of their body. The warriors were allowed to do essentially anything necessary to keep this from occurring. The contenders had to dispatch of the first warrior on the lower portion of the wheel (usually Jake Fury) before taking on the warrior at the top of the wheel (usually Cuda). 25 points were earned for removing the lower warrior from the wheel, and an additional 25 points were earned for getting the 2nd warrior off the wheel.\n\n\nTake Down\n\nA football type event. The contender was placed in the center of an enclosed area with 2 warriors on each end (Michael O'Dell participated in this event most often). Behind each warrior were 4 different lights with actuators beneath them. In the 1st season, a light was lit up behind the warrior (Steve and Scott typically noted that the warriors did not know which light was lit). On the referee's whistle, the contender tried to hit the actuator to turn the light off. Each light turned off was worth 25 points. The contender was only allowed one attempt per light; no \"second effort\" was allowed. After each attempt, the contender returned to the center and repeated against the other warrior. This would continue for 60 seconds. In the 2nd season, all 8 lights (4 at each end) were lit up. The contender chose which light to go after and the warrior would have to stop them. Otherwise, the rules remained the same from season 1.\n\nRollercage of Fire (1st Season), Rollercage (2nd Season)\n\nContenders were raised up into a revolving cylindrical cage with holes built into it. In the 1st season, a ring of fire was set outside the cage at each end, mainly to set the atmosphere. The fire ring was removed in season two, as well as the reference to it in the event's title. Contenders had 60 seconds to force the warrior (Almost always T-Money, with 1 or 2 appearances by DOA in the later part of the 1st season) through one of the holes while avoiding the same fate. Forcing the warrior out earned 25 points (later 50). Draws originally scored nothing, but were later increased to a 25-point score.\n\nAerial Kickboxing\n\nContenders and opposing warriors hung from an undulating metal grid roughly 10 feet off the ground. The contender attempted to kick the warrior (most often Bubba King) off the grid within 60 seconds without being removed from the grid themselves. Kicks to the head were technically against the rules and would result in DQ's. At least 1 contender was DQ'd because of head shots. If the contender kicked the warrior off the grid, the contender scored 50 points. Draws scored 25 points. Most contenders were lucky to score short of a DQ of the warrior. Bubba King and Sleepwalker were almost impossible to beat, but O'Dell actually was impossible to defeat, as he never lost a match and rarely surrendered a draw.\n\nAfter the match, the \"reporter\" had Bubba talk about the match. Bubba was angry, and complained about the contestant breaking the rules (by kicking him in the head), and Bubba said half his body went numb from the head kick.\n\nG-Force\n\nA central rotating tower had three arms extending from the top of the central tower. Each of the contenders hung onto a handle at the end of each arm. A warrior stood on a platform above this tower, throwing balls at the contenders as the tower spun. The tower's speed increased steadily as the event progressed. The last contender/s standing earned 25 points, and a bonus 25 points was earned for lasting 60 seconds.\n\nBattle Bridge\n\nA large bridge spun quickly in mid-air. The contender and the warrior were each given a large padded club to use to knock the other off the bridge as it spun. Contenders scored 50 points for successfully knocking the warrior off the bridge, or 25 points for lasting 60 seconds.\n\nBattle Field\n\nThis event was similar to Powerball on American Gladiators. Unlike Powerball, contenders competed one-on-one against a single warrior, who defended a single scoring bin. The scoring bin was located in the center of the playing field atop an approximately pyramid. The warrior wore boxing gloves and could freely attack the contender as much as they wanted to keep them from scoring. Each ball scored was worth 25 points.\n\nBattle Hoop\n\nContenders began in the center of a circular field. A large hanging hoop moved around the outside perimeter of the field, with its opening always facing the center of the field. A warrior stood on the outside perimeter of the field to block the contender from jumping through the hoop. Contenders had 60 seconds to try to jump through the hoop as many times as they could, returning to the center after each attempt. Each successful pass through the hoop earned 25 points.\n\nBattle Wall\n\nContenders had to get over three walls defended by the Battle Dome warriors. A warrior stood on the opposite side of each wall. Each wall was around 3 feet in height. The walls became narrower as the event went on making it harder to get by the warriors. Each wall that a contender was successful in climbing was worth 25 points.\n\nEvader\n\nA contender had to light targets while avoiding medicine balls being launched by two warriors. Contenders had 60 seconds to light up all the targets on the two towers (one at a time). Originally, the warriors only had to hit the contenders 3 times to end the match, but it was later increased to 5 times. Lighting up all the targets on a tower (this may not have ever been done) was worth 25 points and lighting up all the targets was worth 50. This event was considered to be Jake Fury's signature event.\n\nAnti-Gravity\n\nThis event, along with Interceptor, was always played last because of the point opportunities. Contenders had to light strips by hitting buttons on a grid while moving along handles placed on the grid. Every strip lit was worth 25 points, for a possible 150. The contenders were also chased by a Battle Dome Warrior, which was almost always The Commander, and could lose the game in one of two ways: either losing their grip, which would result in the contender floating away, or having the Warrior rip their harness off and send them to the floor.\n\nInterceptor\n\nCalled a game of cat and mouse, a contender had to fly around the Interceptor grid lighting targets worth 25 points each until caught by the warrior (again, almost always The Commander) or time ran out. Each target was worth 25 points. There was a maximum of 175 points available to the contenders.\n\nUltimate Body Slam\n\nThis was a tiebreaker, usually between the warriors for the right to hold the warrior belt. If the top warrior had been less than stellar and a fellow warrior close in the rankings had performed well, but not well enough to win the belt outright, the two warriors would compete in Ultimate Body Slam. This game was simply a test of endurance; each player stood on a platform behind a metal disk. The disks were then pulled back and slammed into each other at increasing speed until one of the two fell off and lost.\n\nDuring the first season, the warriors maintained distinct personalities, similar to professional wrestling characters. The warriors competed for the Battledome Belt. After each event the warriors were \"ranked\", according to how well they did in the competition. At the end of that days competition the top ranked warrior received the Battledome Belt. The \"ranking\" was done by the mysterious chairman. The chairman supposedly owned the Battledome. He was only seen in silhouette wearing a large cowboy hat. What little else was known about him is that he was supposedly an older man. Karen Ko was supposed to be his trophy wife, and Bobbie Haven his secretary. It was Bobbie he would deliver the messages from The chairman to the other warriors and the fans. At the start of the second season The chairman, standings board and the Battledome Belt were dropped from the competition.\n\nFirst season warriors\n\nThe original series had 9 warriors. Some competed every week with some making only a few appearances.\n\nThe \"king\" of aerial kickboxing. Had very few defeats and proved almost invincible with most challengers lasting a maximum of 30 seconds. Did not play any other event during the shows run.\n\nSpeciality event appeared to be Anti-Gravity with Interceptor a close second. One of the smaller warriors proved very speedy and powerful against challengers.\n\nThe largest warrior during season 1. Dominated Battle Wheel. Always appeared in the top position on this event. Did make fleeting appearances on other events.\n\nMade few appearances in Season one but became much more prolific in Season 2. Speciality event appeared to be Rollercage.\n\nThe wild and unpredictable Fury appeared in several games. Particularly able at games G- force and Evader. Suffered a severe ankle injury during season one while participating in Battle Wheel. Thankfully he recovered and did return for season 2.\n\nThe poster boy of Battledome. Handsome, toned and tanned. One of the most all round warriors. Played most games with Aerial Kickboxing and Takedown proving specialities.\n\nAppeared fleeting during season 1. Mainly as cover for injured warriors. Entered arena wearing a straitjacket and howling. Difficult to tell what he was good at as he didn't participate in many events.\n\nAnother warrior who seemed to be cover for fellow injured warriors. Did participate in Anti-Gravity and aerial kickboxing but suffered a shoulder injury in the event. Seemed very capable in events he participated in.\n\nSmug, arrogant and always accompanied by \"The Posse\". Blinged up with jewellery and a dollar sign chain around his neck. Very good at several games but Rollercage was his speciality. Did not take losing very well!\n\nSecond season warriors\n\nSeason 2 saw the departure of Payne and Sleepalker for unknown reasons. The remaining 7 warriors returned and were accompanied by 6 new warriors to bring the total up to 13.\n\n'Returning Warriors:\n\nNew Warriors \nSeemed to act as an alternate for injured warriors. Very impressive during his appearances. Virtually unbeatable in Takedown.\n\nDid not appear until later in the season then became a regular. Played several games. Takedown and Battle Hoop clearly his best.\n\nAn all-rounder who participated in lots of games. No real stand out performances but very capable on events he played in.\n\nDominated his early appearances and Participated in many games. Got injured later in the season and did not appear again.\n\nAppeared only fleetingly during the series. Mainly as cover for injured warriors. The biggest of all warriors weighing over 300 lbs.\n\nAnother warrior who made on and off appearances throughout the season. Played a few games with Battle Wheel proving his speciality.\n\nA partial list of female companions:\n\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/battle-dome/cast/\n\n"}
{"id": "275510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275510", "title": "Beer pong", "text": "Beer pong\n\nBeer pong, also known as Beirut, is a drinking game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side. Each team then takes turns attempting to shoot ping pong balls into the opponent's cups. If a ball lands in a cup (known as a 'make'), the contents of that cup are consumed by the other team and the cup is removed from the table. The first team to eliminate all of the opponent's cups is the winner.\n\nBeer pong is played at parties, bars, colleges/universities and other venues such as tailgating at sporting events.\n\nThe game was originally believed to have evolved from the original beer pong played with paddles which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of Dartmouth College in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since become part of the social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual ping pong game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each side of the table. Eventually, a version without paddles was invented and the names \"Beer Pong\" and \"Beirut\" were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s.\n\nBucknell University's student-run newspaper, \"The Bucknellian\", claims Delta Upsilon fraternity members at Bucknell created \"Throw Pong\", a game very similar to beer pong, during the 1970s, and that \"Throw Pong\" was then brought to Lehigh University by fraternity brothers who visited Bucknell and this led to the creation of the version of beer pong that is played today.\n\nIn some places, \"Beer Pong\" refers to the version of the game with paddles, and \"Beirut\" to the version without. However, according to a CollegeHumor survey, \"beer pong\" is the more common term than \"Beirut\" for the paddle-less game.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Beirut\" is disputed. A 2004 op-ed article in the \"Daily Princetonian,\" the student newspaper at Princeton University, suggested that the name was possibly coined at Bucknell or Lehigh University around the time of the Lebanese Civil War. Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, was the scene of much fighting during the war, particularly mortar fire.\n\nBeer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each. Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.\n\nAlthough the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating. Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables. However, the game can be played on any flat surface.\n\nThe most common cups used are disposable plastic cups (such as red Solo cups) with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table, teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team. Games typically use ten cups. Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.\nAn inexpensive pale lager or light beer of 3.2–5% ABV is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities consumed during the course of several games. Sometimes under house rules, there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, as is done at Utah State University, where alcohol is not allowed on campus; root beer is used instead. For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.\n\nTraditionally, the game of beer pong has been played by countless variations of rule sets. In recent years, organizations such as The World Series of Beer Pong have put forth \"official\" rules. Typically, players abide by a uniform set of \"house rules\" which are often consistent within one university or region of the country (e.g. \"West Coast rules\") or may vary on a \"house-by-house\" basis. Number of cups, bouncing, re-racking, amount of alcohol, distance shots must be taken from, etc. may all vary. All house rules should be posted or verbally stated and understood by both teams before the game starts.\n\nThe order of play varies - both players on one team can shoot, followed by both players on the other team, or players on opposite teams can alternate back and forth. A cup that is made must immediately have its contents drunk and be removed from play. Some rule sets allow for \"\"re-racking\" (also known as \"reforming\", \"rearranging\", \"consolidation\"\", and other names), which is a rearrangement of a team's remaining cups after some have been removed. The formations, number of cups, when to rearrange and so on, depend on the rule set. For example, a team with three remaining cups may ask the other team to \"re-rack\" the cups into a single triangle formation.\n\nCommon house rules allow players to 'finger' or blow the ball out of the cup if the ball spins around the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a 'rollback' occurs allowing each player to shoot again. In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball 'rollback' occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.\n\nBefore shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups of water in order to wash off the balls. However, research has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as \"E. coli\". As a result, players may put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from.\n\nThere are three common ways to shoot in beer pong: the arc, the fastball (or \"laser, snipe, kamikaze\"), and the bounce shot. The most common throwing technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with the tips of the thumb and forefinger, holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.\n\nSome players throw \"fastball\" style which uses more of a hard chopping motion to send the ball in a more direct line toward the intended target cup. A fastball shot may be favorable if house rules dictate that a cup knocked over is removed from the table, in which case a fastball can eliminate multiple cups if thrown hard enough.\n\nA bounce shot is performed by bouncing the ball towards the cups. Depending on house rules, if the other team has the opportunity to swat away a bounced ball, a bounce shot may be worth more than one cup.\n\nIf a team makes their last cup, the other team loses unless they can make all of their remaining cups; this is called a rebuttal or redemption. If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.\n\nAnother 'house rule' can be stated before or during the game in the midst of a shutout. A shutout in beer pong occurs if one team makes all ten of their cups and the opposite team makes none of their cups. If the shutout does occur, the losing team must do whatever the two teams decided on, such as going streaking (naked lap) or drinking a large quantity of beer.\n\nAlso depending on 'house rules', there are other ways to end the game. Cups that were accidentally left in the rack after being made are known as death/kill cups. These cups will immediately end the game if made again.\n\nThe game may have several associated health risks. As with any activity involving alcohol, beer pong may cause players to become drunken or even intoxicated enough to suffer alcohol poisoning. Also, the supposed cleaning effects of the water \"dunk\" cup may be offset by bacteria in the cups.\n\nSome writers have mentioned beer pong as contributing to \"out of control\" college drinking.\n\nSome municipalities and states have attempted to ban beer pong, either from bars or in general, due to the belief that it encourages binge drinking (see Health Effects above). In Oxford, Ohio, where Miami University is located, the city council tried to ban the game from being played outdoors. In Arlington, Virginia and Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, bar owners were told to stop allowing the game to be played in their establishments. In the fall of 2007, Georgetown University officially banned all beer pong paraphernalia such as custom-built tables and the possession of many ping-pong balls.\n\n\"Time\" magazine ran an article on July 31, 2008 called \"The War Against Beer Pong\", noting legal restrictions and bans on the game in college and elsewhere.\n\nIn many states, players have taken to placing water in cups in order to hold organized beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples of this can be found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nBeer pong tournaments are held in the United States at the local, regional, and national levels.\n\nThe World Series of Beer Pong (WSOBP) is the largest beer pong tournament in the world. WSOBP IV, held in January 2009 at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a $50,000 grand prize and over 800 participants from the US and Canada. WSOBP V, held in January 2010, had over 1,000 participants including teams from Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Japan. The World Beer Pong Tour has stops in various cities and cash prizes as well.\n\nA more common organization of beer pong games are leagues which operate on a local or regional level. Ordinarily, a group of pong enthusiasts will create teams (partnerships) and play weekly against each other. Sometimes, the leagues have websites, rankings and statistics, while others have been started by college students with the goal of intramural competition such as at University of California, Santa Barbara with the \"Isla Vista Beer Pong League\", and at New York University.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Time\" and other media outlets have reported on the increase in businesses selling beer pong paraphernalia, such as tables, mats, cups, or clothes. \"Last Cup: Road to the World Series of Beer Pong\" is a documentary which follows some competitive players as they prepare for the WSOBP II and ultimately compete against one another for the $20,000 grand prize. This documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay, premiered at the CineVegas film festival on June 13, 2008. Rick Reilly wrote an entire column about The World Series of Beer Pong IV for \"ESPN The Magazine\".\n\nThe Associated Press cited the game and other drinking games as a factor in deaths of college students.\n\n\"Time\" magazine recently had an article on the popularity of beer pong and posted a video on their website. In both, players claimed beer pong was a sport, rather than a game—similar to billiards and darts.\n\nThe game has been a recurring segment on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", with host Fallon playing against female celebrity guests such as Betty White, Serena Williams, Anna Kournikova, Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" featured a segment on the CDC study hoax.\n\n\"\", a sequel to the 2000 comedy \"Road Trip\", featured the game prominently. Agnes Scott College, where most of the movie was filmed, did not want to be listed in the credits after complaints from students.\n\nOn August 29, 2009, Chronicle Books published \"The Book of Beer Pong\", a 200-page fully illustrated guide to the game.\n\nBud pong was the branded version of beer pong that brewer Anheuser-Busch said involved the drinking of water, not Budweiser or any other beer. In the summer of 2005, the company began marketing \"bud pong\" kits to its distributors. Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, was reported in \"The New York Times\" as saying that bud pong was not intended for underage drinkers because promotions were held in bars, not on campuses. And it did not promote binge drinking, she said, because official rules call for water to be used, not beer.\n\n\"The New York Times\" quoted a bartender at a club near Clemson University as saying she had worked at several bud pong events and had \"never seen anyone playing with water. It's always beer. It's just like any other beer pong.\"\n\nSome expressed incredulity at Anheuser-Busch's public statements. Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Study at the Harvard School of Public Health, said: \"Why would alcohol companies promote games that involve drinking water? It's preposterous,\" while advertising news site Adjab opined that \"someone playing bud pong with water is about as likely as a teenage kid using the rolling paper he bought at the convenience store to smoke tobacco.\"\n\nHowever, the practice of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a sip from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate a large number of games during the party.\n\nIn July 2008, JV Games Inc. released a downloadable video game for the Wii console called \"Frat Party Games: Beer Pong\". After much outrage by parent and university groups, the game was renamed \"\" and all references to alcohol were removed.\n"}

{"id": "10383227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10383227", "title": "Christmas, His Masque", "text": "Christmas, His Masque\n\nChristmas, His Masque, also called Christmas His Show, was a Jacobean era masque, written by Ben Jonson and performed at the English royal court at Christmas of 1616. Jonson's masque displays the traditional folklore and iconography of Christmas at an early-modern and pre-commercial stage of its development.\n\nThe masque opens with the entrance of a personified Christmas and his attendants, one of whom leads the way in, beating a drum. Christmas is dressed in a doublet and hose (color unspecified) and a \"high-crowned hat;\" he has a \"long thin beard\" and white shoes. Christmas is soon followed by his ten children, who are led in, on a string, by Cupid (who is dressed like a London apprentice, with his wings at his shoulders). The \"Sons and Daughters\" of Christmas are Carol, Misrule, Gambol, Offering, Wassail, Mumming, New-Year's-Gift, Post and Pair, and even Minced-Pie and Baby-Cake. Each has his or her own fantastic get-up. Carol, for instance, wears a tawny coat and a red cap, and has a flute in his belt. Mince-Pie is attired \"like a fine cook's wife, drest neat,\" while Gambol is dressed \"like a tumbler, with a hoop and bells.\" Each of the ten is followed by a torchbearer-attendant, carrying marchpanes, cakes, bottles of wine, and other holiday gear. (The specific details of the costumes and furnishings, like \"an orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick in it,\" participate in a dense web of folklore connections. Baby-Cake comes last in the procession of children, for example, because miniature \"twelvetide\" cakes were associated with Twelfth Night, the last day of the Christmas holiday season.)\n\nCupid is soon joined by his mother Venus, who like her son is dressed down in contemporary London garb: the goddess appears as a \"deaf tire-woman\" who lives in Pudding Lane. The speeches of Venus and the other characters are rich in contemporary allusions and references; Venus, for example, mentions Richard Burbage and John Heminges, prominent actors with the King's Men. The masque proceeds to singing and dancing, with the stated intent to present \"A right Christmas, as of old it was.\"\n\n\"Christmas, His Masque\" was produced too late to be included in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616; it was the first masque in the second folio of 1641. It also exists in manuscripts.\n\nEarly commentators tended to dismiss Jonson's masque as a piece of holiday fluff, often noting that the work is less a true masque and more of a mummers' show. Modern critics have looked beneath its surface to detect serious political, social, and cultural implications. Jonson's text, in promoting a traditional Christmas, was taking a position favored by King James I and opposed to the contemporary culture of the merchants of the City of London and especially that of the Puritans, who were overtly hostile to the traditional holiday. The text of the masque shows an abundant and rather biting satire aimed at the anti-Christmas forces in Jacobean society.\n\nKing James had made an important speech before the Star Chamber earlier in 1616, in an attempt to promote traditional country life and pastimes, which were plainly in decline in an era of ever-greater urbanization and economic development. James would soon issue his proclamation known as the \"Book of Sports\" (1618), another attempt to support and reinforce the traditional country life in the face of rapid social change. Jonson's masque is one element in this larger cultural debate.\n\n"}

The theatre company occupies the historic New Century Club building.\n\nOriginally named the Children's Repertory Theatre of Wilmington, the organization began in 1973 with their first production of \"Pinocchio\". The organization relies on volunteers for all acting and nearly all support positions as a community theater. To cover operating expenses, DCT sells tickets and receives state support through the Delaware Division of the Arts.\n\nTony Award winner John Gallagher, Jr. initially played Tom Sawyer as a child actor at the theatre before going on to Broadway.\n\nThe Theatre occupies the historic New Century Club building. The organization constructed the building in 1893 and occupied it until 1975. The Delaware Dinner Theatre and Delaware Ballet Company then used the building until 1982 when DCT moved in.\n\nMinerva Parker Nichols of Philadelphia, an early female architect, designed the Colonial Revival building with Palladian windows and a gambrel roof. While serving partly as a clubhouse, it also held a theatre which was used for traveling shows as well as civic speakers, including future president Woodrow Wilson and birth control advocate Margaret Sanger.\n\nThe structure is listed as on the National Register of Historic Places and recognized as being an active place for the women's rights movement. The New Century Club was a progressive upper class women's group dedicated to social improvement and charity as well as women's suffrage. Notable members of the Club included Emily P. Bissell, a Red Cross campaigner against tuberculosis who has a state hospital named after her, and Emalea Pusey Warner, who successfully campaigned for public vocational education and has a local elementary school named in her honor. Other New Century women's clubs formed nearby in Milford and Newark, Delaware, as well as in Kennett Square, West Chester, and Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5782414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5782414", "title": "Duke Nukem Advance", "text": "Duke Nukem Advance\n\nDuke Nukem Advance is a portable video game in the \"Duke Nukem\" series. Although it is a first-person shooter and many of the graphics and sounds have been ported from \"Duke Nukem 3D\", the game has an original storyline and levels.\n\nFour difficulty levels can be selected at the beginning of the game. Multiplayer games are possible, with up to four players requiring a copy. An option to save ones progress appears at the completion of each level, with five save game slots to choose from.\n\nDuke Nukem, working for General Graves, is asked to investigate Area 51, after reports indicate the hostile infiltration of an alien species. After getting rid of much of the alien threat there, Duke learns about how the aliens require \"environmental regulators\" to exist, and follows them to the Temple of Amun in Egypt.\n\nWhile in Egypt, Duke Nukem discovers a vast collection of alien hybrid creatures in stasis, apparently an army meant to take over the world. A nearby power source detected by General Graves seems to supply their environmental regulators, so Duke is sent to shut it down. Subsequently, he learns that activating an override pump will drain the hibernation tanks, killing the entire alien hybrid army.\n\nNukem also manages to destroy the controller alien overseeing the stasis area, but it turns out that the alien activated a self-destruct sequence just before his death. Duke manages to narrowly escape the collapsing temple, using one of the alien transporters to get away.\n\nHaving re-establishing contact with the general, Duke Nukem discovers he has materialized in Sydney, Australia. Graves tells him to find one of the agency's undercover agents, who has sent out a distress call from a nearby nightclub.\n\nAfter rescuing the agent, Duke locates a doomsday weapon being created by the aliens. The controller alien in Egypt had mentioned it to be able to wipe out Earth's atmosphere, so Nukem is quickly sent to destroy the device. Once successful, he transports on board the orbiting alien spaceship.\n\nOnce Duke establishes his signal with General Graves, he learns that he must hack into the spaceship's system to find a weakness. After transmitting all the data from the ship he can find, Graves tells him they have detected four human females on board which Duke must once again rescue. He finds the first one and teleports her back to Earth, and after analysis, the general learns that she is in fact a cloned version of their undercover agent, Jenny. Duke deducts that the aliens are using the clones to help propagate their species.\n\nBy the time Duke has rescued the Jennys one by one, his General friend informs him that he can destroy the ship by shutting down its engine's coolant system. He does just that, then teleports \"Jenny 5\" back to Earth. The General's teleportation system is unable to beam out Duke Nukem too, however, requiring him to wade through more alien assailants in order to transport out using their teleporters. The ship subsequently blows up, and Duke Nukem arrives safely back on Earth.\n\nSince the Game Boy Advance has a limited number of controls, the game offers four different control setups. These set the buttons for shooting, jumping, strafing, weapon selection and looking up and down. When pausing the game, the player can also view the level's map. The player can pan around the map, as well as zoom in or out. Some of the level's secrets can also be discovered simply by looking at the map.\n\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Craig Harris of \"IGN\" called it \"without a doubt the most fun first-person shooter on the GBA to date.\" Frank Provo of \"GameSpot\" said: \"On the basis of technical merit, \"Duke Nukem Advance\" is nowhere near as pretty or diverse as the original 1996 PC game, but it's easily the best FPS to hit the GBA since \"Doom\".\" Martin Taylor of \"Eurogamer\" said: \"It breaks no new ground in gaming conventions, and it won't keep you playing for months, but it looks good and it plays well, which is more than can be said for some of its competition.\"\n\n"}

When the \"Freikorps\" units were dissolved in 1921, he began an unstable life working as a locksmith and mechanic at varying places. Back in Berlin from 1928, he was an early Nazi supporter, who helped organize Nazi radio listeners and handled the technical details at many of Hitler's mass rallies. Hadamovsky joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1930; the party's propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels commissioned him to build up the right-wing \"Reichsverband Deutscher Rundfunkteilnehmer\" (\"Reich association of German broadcasting participants\").\n\nShortly after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Hadamovsky served as the National Programming Director for the German \"Deutschlandsender\" broadcaster. A few months later, he was appointed Reich production director and head of the nationalized \"Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft\", whereby he played a vital role in the Nazi \"Gleichschaltung\" of the incorporated regional broadcasters. In 1935 he initiated the launch of the \"Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow\" TV station. Hadamovsky also served as vice-president of the broadcasting department in the \"Reichskulturkammer\" organization and in a variety of other posts during World War II. He was head of the radio department in the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 1940, however, Minister Goebbels was not entirely pleased with him, as is evident by many references in Goebbels' diaries. In 1942 Hadamovsky was replaced and took over the position as chief of staff in the Nazi Party's Central Propaganda Office (\"Reichspropagandaleitung\") in Berlin.\n\nHadamovsky authored seven propaganda books, the most significant of which was \"Propaganda and National Power\" (1933), the only book treating the general principles of propaganda published during the Third Reich. Other books include \"World History on the March\", which was published just before the 1939 Invasion of Poland, and applauded Nazi Germany in general and the return of the Memel Territory, Adolf Hitler's last negotiated territorial gain, previously lost to Lithuania after World War I. Hadamovsky was also author of \"Blitzmarsch nach Warschau: Frontberichte eines politischen Soldaten\" (Lightning March to Warsaw: Front Reports of a Political Soldier), an eyewitness account of the Invasion of Poland (1939).\n\nIn 1943, Hadamovsky volunteered for the Wehrmacht armed forces. Toward the end of World War II, he joined the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division and died in combat, shot through the heart, in the rank of an \"Obersturmführer\" (first lieutenant), fighting at the head of his company on the Eastern Front early in March 1945 at Hölkewiese near Rummelsburg in Pomerania. After his death, Goebbels wrote of him as one of the best comrades, an energetic and loyal companion and an old friend. Hadamovsky is buried in Endgrablage: Block 3 Reihe 31 Grab 1533 - 1548, German military cemetery Neumark / Stare Czarnowo, Poland.\n"}

{"id": "5661915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5661915", "title": "Film title design", "text": "Film title design\n\nFilm title design is a term describing the craft and design of motion picture title sequences. Since the beginning of the film form, it has been an essential part of any motion picture. Originally a motionless piece of artwork called \"title art\", it slowly evolved into an artform of its own.\n\nIn the beginning, main title design consisted of the movie studio's name and/or logo and the presentation of the main characters along with the actor’s names, generally using that same artwork presented on title cards. Most independent or major studio had their own title art logo used as the background for their screen credits and they used it almost exclusively on every movie that they produced.\n\nThen, early in the 1930s, the more progressive motion picture studios started to change their approach in presenting their screen credits. The major studios took on the challenge of improving the way they introduced their movies. They made the decision to present a more complete list of credits to go with a higher quality of artwork to be used in their screen credits.\n\nA main title designer is the designer of the movie title. The manner in which title of a movie is displayed on screen is widely considered an art form. It's often been classified as motion graphics, title design, title sequences and animated credits. The title sequence is often presented through animated visuals and kinetic type while the credits are introduced on screen.\n\nFrom the mid-1930s through the late-1940s the major film studios led the way in Film Title Art by employing artists like Al Hirschfeld, George Petty, Ted Ireland (Vencentini), William Galraith Crawford, Symeon Shimin, Alvan \"Hap\" Hadley, and Jacques Kapralik.\n\nQuality artists met this challenge by designing their artwork to \"set a mood\" and \"capture the audience\" before the movie started. An overall 10% jump in box-office receipts was proof that this was a profitable improvement to the introduction of their motion pictures.\n\nOne famous example of the form is the work of Saul Bass in the 1950s and 1960s. His modish title sequences for the films of Alfred Hitchcock were key in setting the style and mood of the movie even before the action began, and contributed to Hitchcock's \"house style\" that was a key element in his approach to marketing. Another well known designer is Maurice Binder, who designed the often erotic titles for many of the James Bond films from the 1960s to the 1980s. After his death, Daniel Kleinman has done several of the titles.\n\nHowever, the leader in the industry in the 1990s - 2000 was Cinema Research Corporation, with over 400 movie titles to its credit in that time period alone, and almost 700 titles in total from the 1950s to 2000.\n\nModern technology has enabled a much more fantastical way of presenting them through use of programs such as Adobe After Effects and Maxon Cinema4D. Although a form of editing, it's considered a different role and art form rather than of a traditional film editor.\n\n"}
{"id": "5565365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5565365", "title": "Fixed odds betting terminal", "text": "Fixed odds betting terminal\n\nA fixed odds betting terminal (FOBT) is a type of electronic slot machine normally found in betting shops in the United Kingdom and introduced in 2001. The terminals allow players to bet on the outcome of various games and events which have fixed odds, with the theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) being displayed on the machine by law. Like all casino games, the \"house\" (i.e. the betting shop) has a built-in advantage. Typically, slot machine FOBTs have an RTP of 90% to 94% depending on the chosen stake, and standard roulette FOBTs have a long-term average RTP of 97%.\n\nThe most commonly played game is roulette. The minimum amount wagered per spin is £1 and the maximum is £100. The largest single payout cannot exceed £500 and this can limit the wager size e.g. the maximum wager on a single number on roulette at odds of 35:1 is £14. Token coins can be of value as low as five pence in some UK licensed betting offices (LBOs). Other games include bingo, simulated horseracing and greyhound racing, and a range of slot machine games. There are plans to reduce the maximum outlay to £2 per game because the terminals encourage addictive problem gambling.\n\nFOBTs typically include a touchscreen and a slot for depositing cash. The major hardware manufacturers for the UK market are Scientific Games Corporation and Inspired Gaming.\n\nUnder current UK legislation, these machines are allowed to offer content classed as Category B2, Category B3 as well as Category C content. The main article tabulates the legal maximum stakes and payouts.\n\nShops are allowed up to four terminals, although this number also includes traditional slot machines. Most shops favour the new FOBTs over the traditional slot machines. The Gambling Commission reports that there were 33,319 FOBTs in Britain's betting offices between October 2011 and September 2012.\n\nFOBTs have been criticised due to the potential for addiction when playing the machines. They have been dubbed the \"crack cocaine\" of gambling by critics. In response to this criticism, in 2014 bookmakers represented by the Association of British Bookmakers introduced the facility for customers to set time and money limits when using FOBTs. In October 2017, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport began studying the possibility of reducing the £100 maximum bet limit and a decision was made in May 2018 to limit the maximum bet to £2. This new maximum bet limit will not come into effect until April 2019, with bookmakers stating they are likely to close many shops after its introduction.\n\nAs a result of the Scottish Referendum on Independence on 18 September 2014, The Smith Commission convened, led by Lord Smith of Kelvin KT. On 27 November 2014 the Report of the Smith Commission for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament was published. Page 22 under the heading \"Betting, Gaming and Lotteries\" states \"The Scottish Parliament will have the power to prevent the proliferation of Fixed-Odds Betting Terminals\". All five main parties (SNP, Greens, Conservative, Labour, Liberal) agreed the terms of the report. Devolution of this power to the Scottish Parliament will be enacted through the UK parliament in due course. Page 11 of the report states: \"The UK government has undertaken to produce draft clauses implementing\" ... this and ... \"will publish these clauses by 25th Jan 2015\".\n\nThere are over 900 FOBTs in operation in Northern Ireland, but campaign group Fairer Gambling argues that they may not be legal under Northern Irish law, as the Gambling Act 2005 only applies in England, Wales and Scotland. In 2015 the Department for Social Development said that only a judge could rule on their legality.\n\nA 2008 betting review in Ireland ruled that the machines should not be introduced in Irish betting shops but would be allowed in casinos.\n\nIt is claimed FOBTs are used for money laundering by paying cash into the terminal, making low-risk bets which involve a small relative loss, and withdrawing most of the proceeds as a voucher which is exchanged for cash at the shop counter. Changes in the UKGC regulators code have sought to eradicate the potential for money laundering.\n\n"}
{"id": "6265996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6265996", "title": "Frets on Fire", "text": "Frets on Fire\n\nFrets on Fire (FoF) is a free, open-source Finnish music video game created by Unreal Voodoo. Players use the keyboard to play along with markers which appear on screen, with the aim to score points, achieve a high point multiplier, and complete a song. \"Frets on Fire\" was the winner of the Assembly 2006 game development competition.\n\nThe game is written in the Python programming language, and is licensed under the GNU General Public License, although the game incorporates other free and open-source code under other licenses. The game's included song files and some internal fonts are proprietary, and their redistribution is not permitted outside of the Frets On Fire executable.\n\nAs there has not been an updated stable release of the original Frets on Fire since 2010, many former users have begun using Phase Shift, as it supports the use of song files originally created for Frets on Fire and offers more current support. Clone Hero had also released in 2017, and grew a large fanbase.\n\n\"Frets on Fire\" is a music playing video game. It is playable on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux. The player presses buttons in time to coloured markers, which appear on-screen, the markers are matched with the rhythm of the music. \"Frets on Fire\" can be played by using a keyboard by pressing the fret buttons and pick buttons, although there is support for joysticks, meaning that with the appropriate adapter and/or software, various guitar-type controllers can be used as well.\n\nColoured square-shaped markers appear on the player's screen, synchronized with the song and are played by holding the fret buttons that correspond with the correct colour and pressing one of the pick button at the correct moment. Every ten correct hits increase the score multiplier, which multiplies the points for every hit by up to four times. The multiplier is reset when the player misses a note or strums at the wrong time.\n\nFrets on Fire includes a built-in song editor (or \"fretting\" tool) that allows editing and creation of songs. This allows users to customise their own tracks. Other programs include \"EOF\" (EditorOnFire), \"dB\" (Feedback), and \"Freetar\" editors. MIDI sequences created in programs such as \"FL Studio\" and \"REAPER\" can also be used. The Frets on Fire Wiki has an extensive resource of custom song frets. There are also many other sites that have been created to provide songs and other resources for the game. Frets on Fire also allows users to import songs from other guitar games. These include \"Guitar Hero\", \"Guitar Hero II\" and \"\". The game also features a tutorial, which lets users unfamiliar with the gameplay get accustomed to the game. While the game contains a keyboard play mode, USB Joysticks can also be used. This allows regular joysticks and guitar controllers to be controllers for the game as well, helping to replicate the same feel that commercial guitar games provide.\n\nSince version 1.2.438, the game features \"hammer-on and pull-off\" notes, commonly abbreviated to \"HOPO\", although the game refers to them as \"tappable notes\". These notes allows the player to press only its fret button to play if the previous note was played correctly, emulating the feature of the Guitar Hero series. Bugs were found in the new gameplay element, and version 1.2.451 fixed them; this version also added an option to disable HOPO notes. Frets On Fire lacks the ability to allow players to use the whammy bar, while FoFiX has basic support for modulating the pitch of a track. This is referred to as either \"Killswitch\" or \"Pitchbend.\" This was added in the 3.100 update for FoFiX.\n\nMuch like console guitar-style games, Frets on Fire comes with \"World Charts\", an official online high score list. However, since the entire system is open source, players have the ability to host their own server as well.\n\nLatest versions of the game (1.2.512 and 1.3.110) are affected by major bugs and it may be hard or impossible to use them; a comfortable solution is to download a previous version, such as 1.2.451.\n\nOne popular version of the game is \"Frets on Fire X\" (commonly abbreviated \"FoFiX\"), a fork developed from a series of mods of version 1.2.451 of Frets on Fire. As well as having support for four players, this fork supports custom graphical themes (which enables users to create a \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\" look-alike), bass and drum tracks and preliminary support for lyrics. The latest stable version of FoFiX is 3.121 released on December 7, 2009. Currently in development for version 4.000 is the inclusion of Online-Multiplayer, Video Background Support, and support for both Guitar Hero and Rock Band styles of play among many others.\n\nFrets on Fire has received generally positive reviews in a variety of publications. Released for competition at Assembly, it won first place among its competition. As a free and open source game, it has not received as much attention from mainstream review sites, but many niche game sites as well as open source game review sites have discussed it, averaging between 7 and 8 out of 10. GameSpot's user ratings give the game an 8.1 as of November 2008; other sites such as Download.com average lower, around 3.5/5. However, because of the cross-platform nature of the game, it has garnered fans from both Linux and Mac gaming communities as well. Frets On Fire was included on the television show \"Click\".\n\nThe University of Nevada developed a modified version of Frets on Fire called Blind Hero which uses a haptic glove to make this game accessible to players who are visually impaired. A similar game has been developed as homebrew for the Wii named Guitars On Fire, which uses Frets on Fire songs, and incorporates the use of the guitar controller. A British developer designed a program based on Frets on Fire called Phase Shift which offers expanded compatibility for guitar peripherals, and includes capabilities for the use of real guitars as well as keyboards.\n\nFrets on Fire became a very popular Freeware game; the game was downloaded between 2007 and May 2017 alone over Sourceforge.net over 14 million times.\n\n\n"}

It was originally formed in 1896 as the Edison Quartet to record for Edison Records; it took its new name when recording for other companies. The name was a homage to Joseph Haydn, the classical composer; the spelling was later revised to Hayden, which reflects the way it was pronounced. The group disbanded in 1914.\n\nThe Edison Quartet formed in 1896, with a membership of John Bieling (tenor), Jere Mahoney (tenor), Samuel Holland Rous (who performed under the name S. H. Dudley, baritone), and William F. Hooley (bass). Mahoney was soon replaced by John Scantlebury Macdonald, who used the pseudonym Harry Macdonough. They recorded as the Edison Quartet (or Edison Male Quartet), before taking the name Haydn Quartet in order to record for companies other than Edison.\n\nIn 1901 they signed a contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company, and in 1902 also traveled to England to record for the Gramophone Company, which was Victor's affiliate. The group had great success over the next decade as one of the premier recording groups of the time, on a par with the Peerless Quartet. The Haydn Quartet often sang material at a slower tempo and in a statelier fashion than other groups.\n\nThe Haydn Quartet's biggest commercial successes for Victor included \"In the Good Old Summer Time\" (1903), \"Bedelia\" (1904), \"Sweet Adeline (You're the Flower of My Heart)\" (1904), \"How'd You Like To Spoon With Me\" (with Corinne Morgan, 1906), \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" (with Billy Murray, 1908), \"Sunbonnet Sue\" (1908), \"Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet\" (1909), and \"By the Light of the Silv'ry Moon\" (with Murray, 1910). Other influential recordings include their 1901 version of \"My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean\", \"Way Down Yonder in the Cornfield\" (1903), \"Will You Love Me In December As You Do In May?\" (1906), and \"My Wild Irish Rose\" (1907). The ensemble also performed vaudeville and minstrel show songs, one of which, \"The Camp Meeting Jubilee\", released in 1904 as Victor no. 4003, includes a very early recorded use of the phrase \"rockin' and rollin'\", albeit used with a spiritual rather than secular connotation.\n\nRecordings credited to the Haydn Quartet began to be phased out in 1908. After that time, Billy Murray frequently sang lead with the group, and S. H. Dudley was often replaced by Reinald Werrenrath. Following the successful collaborations between Murray and the Haydn Quartet, Victor organized a new group, the American Quartet, in 1910, with Murray, Bieling and Hooley from the Haydn Quartet, and baritone Steve Porter. The group's name was spelled Hayden after 1910. The quartet disbanded in 1914. As well as members participating in the American Quartet, Macdonough and Hooley, together with Reinald Werranrath and tenor Lambert Murphy, also formed the Orpheus Quartet, who recorded successfully until 1919.\n\nIn his book \"Pop Memories 1890-1954\", music archivist and statistician Joel Whitburn assessed a variety of sources such as \"Talking Machine World\" 's lists of top-selling recordings, and \"Billboard\" 's sheet music and vaudeville charts, to estimate the most successful recordings of the period. He concluded that the Haydn Quartet had 62 \"top ten\" hits in all between 1898 and 1914, and in the decade 1900-1909 had more successful recordings than any other group, behind only Macdonough and Murray, who recorded as solo artists in addition to their group performances. Although Whitburn's methods of assessment have been criticized, this confirms that the group were one of the most popular of their era.\n\n"}
{"id": "523025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523025", "title": "Kirtan", "text": "Kirtan\n\nKirtan or Kirtana (; ) is a Sanskrit word that means \"narrating, reciting, telling, describing\" of an idea or story. It also refers to a genre of religious performance arts, connoting a musical form of narration or shared recitation, particularly of spiritual or religious ideas.\n\nWith roots in the Vedic \"anukirtana\" tradition, a \"kirtan\" is a call-and-response style song or chant, set to music, wherein multiple singers recite or describe a legend, or express loving devotion to a deity, or discuss spiritual ideas. It may include dancing or direct expression of \"bhavas\" (emotive states) by the singer. Many \"kirtan\" performances are structured to engage the audience where they either repeat the chant, or reply to the call of the singer.\n\nA person performing kirtan is known as a \"kirtankara\" (or \"kirtankar\"). A Kirtan performance includes an accompaniment of regionally popular musical instruments, such as the harmonium, the veena or ektara (forms of string instruments), the tabla (one-sided drums), the \"mrdanga\" or \"pakhawaj\" (two-sided drum), flute (forms of woodwind instruments), and \"karatalas\" or \"talas\" (cymbals). It is a major practice in Hinduism, Vaisnava devotionalism, Sikhism, the Sant traditions and some forms of Buddhism, as well as other religious groups. Kirtan is sometimes accompanied by story-telling and acting. Texts typically cover religious, mythological or social subjects.\n\"kirtan\" () has Vedic roots and it means \"telling, narrating, describing, enumerating, reporting\". The term is found as \"Anukirtan\" (or \"Anukrti\", \"Anukarana\", literally a \"re-telling\") in the context of Yajna, wherein team recitations of dialogue-style and question-answer riddle hymns were part of the ritual or celebratory dramatic performance. The Sanskrit verses in chapter 13.2 of Shatapatha Brahmana (~800–700 BCE), for example, are written in the form of a riddle play between two actors.\n\nThe root of \"kirtan\" is \"kirt\" (). The root is found in the Samhitas, the Brahmanas and other Vedic literature, as well as the Vedanga and Sutras literature. \"Kirt\", according to Monier-Williams contextually means, \"to mention, make mention of, tell, name, call, recite, repeat, relate, declare, communicate, commemorate, celebrate, praise, glorify\".\n\n\"kirtan\", sometimes referred to as \"sankirtana\" (literally, \"collective performance\"), is a call-and-response chanting or musical conversation, a genre of religious performance arts that developed during India's \"bhakti\" devotional traditions. However, it is a heterogeneous practice that varies regionally according to Christian Novetzke, and includes varying mixture of different musical instruments, dance, oration, theatre, audience participation and moral narration. In Maharashtra for example, states Novetzke, a \"kirtan\" is a call-and-response style performance, ranging from devotional dancing and singing by a lead singer and audience, to an \"intricate scholarly treatise, a social commentary or a philosophical/linguistic exposition\", that includes narration, allegory, humor, erudition and entertainment – all an aesthetic part of \"ranga\" (beauty, color) of the \"kirtana\".\n\n\"Kirtan\" is locally known as \"Abhang\", \"Samaj Gayan\", \"Haveli Sangeet\", \"Vishnupad\", \"Harikatha\". The Vaishnava temples and monasteries of Hinduism in Assam and northeastern, called \"Satra\", have a large worship hall named \"Kirtan ghar\" – a name derived from their being used for congregational singing and performance arts.\n\nIn regional languages, Kirtana is scripted as ; Nepali & ; ; ; ; ; .\n\nMusical recitation of hymns, mantras and the praise of deities has ancient roots in Hinduism, as evidenced by the Samaveda and other Vedic literature.\n\nKirtan were popularized by the Bhakti movement of medieval era Hinduism, starting with the South Indian Alvars (Vaishnavism) and Nayanars (Shaivism) around the 6th century, which spread in central, northern, western and eastern India particularly after the 12th century, as a social and congregational response to Hindu-Muslim conflicts. The foundations of the \"Kirtan\" traditions are also found in other Hindu scriptures such as the \"Bhagavad-gita\" where Krishna describes multiple paths to spiritual freedom, including karma marga (way of works), jnana marga (way of knowledge) and bhakti marga (way of loving devotion to god). \"Kirtan\" relates to the bhakti marga tradition of Hinduism. References to \"Kirtan\" as a musical recitation are also found in the Bhagavata Purana, an important Vaishnava text.\n\nKirtan is often practiced as a kind of theatrical folk song with call-and-response chanting or antiphon. The ancient sage Narada revered as a musical genius, is called a \"kirtankar\" (singer of kirtan) in the Padma Purana. The famous story of Prahlada in the \"Avatara Katha\" mentions kirtan as one of nine forms of worship, called the \"nava vidha bhakti\" along with \"shravanam\" (listening), \"smaranam\" (remembrance), \"pada sevanam\" (service), \"archanam\" (offering), \"vandanam\" (obeisance), \"dasyam\" (servitude), \"sakhyam\" (friendship) and \"atmanivedanam\" (surrender). The so-called \"Naradiya Kirtan\" divides kirtan into five parts: \"naman\" (prayers), \"purvaranga\" (spiritual lesson based on old epics), chanting, \"katha\" or \"akhyan\" (exegesis) and a final prayer for universal welfare.\n\n\"Kirtan\" as a genre of religious music has been a major part of the Vaishnavism tradition, particularly starting with the Alvars of Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition between the 7th to 10th century CE. After the 13th-century, two subgenres of kirtan emerged in Vaishnavism, namely the \"Nama-kirtana\" wherein the different names or aspects of god (a Vishnu avatar) are extolled, and the \"Lila- kirtana\" wherein the deity's life and legends are narrated.\n\nThe Marathi Varkari saint Namdev (c. 1270–1350) used the kirtan form of singing to praise the glory of god Vithoba, an avatar of Vishnu. Marathi kirtan is typically performed by one or two main performers, called \"kirtankar\", accompanied by harmonium and \"tabla\". It involves singing, acting, dancing, and story-telling. The Naradiya Kirtan popular in Maharashtra is performed by a single Kirtankar, and contains the poetry of saints of Maharashtra such as Dnyaneshwar, Eknath, Namdev and Tukaram.Learned poets from 17th and 18th century such as Shridhar, Mahipati, Moropant contributed to the development of this form of kirtan.' 'Jugalbandi Kirtan\" is performed by two persons, allowing question-answer, dialogue and debate. Performance requires skill in music, dance, comedy, oratory, debate, memory, general knowledge and Sanskrit literature. Training takes place at the Kirtan Kul in Sangli, the Akhil Bharatiya Kirtan Sanstha in Dadar, Mumbai, the Narad Mandir at Sadashiv Peth, Pune and the Kalidas Mahavidyalay in Ramtek, Nagpur as well as at smaller schools in Goa, Beed and Ujjain.\nIn the early 16th century CE Chaitanya Mahaprabhu popularized adolescent Krishna based san-kirtana in Bengal, with Hare Krishna mantra and other songs, wherein the love between Radha and Krishna was symbolized as the love between one's soul and God. About the same time, Shankaradeva in Assam inspired Neo-Vaishnavite Bhakti movement that emphasized Advaita Vedanta philosophy within the framework of Bhagavata Purana and Vaishnavism. Shankaradeva helped establish \"Sattras\" (Hindu temples and monasteries) with \"kirtan-ghar\" (also called \"Namghar\"), for singing and dramatic performance of Krishna-related theosophy. Elsewhere, in Vrindavan of Braj region (Mathura), Vallabha launched a \"Kirtan\" singing devotional movement around the stories of baby Krishna and his early childhood, in early 16th century.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh,the compositions of Tallapaka Annamacharya, a 14th-century mystic, represent the earliest known music called \"sankirtana\". He wrote in praise of Lord Venkateswara, the deity of Seven Hills in Tirumala, where unbroken worship has been offered for over twelve centuries at the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple.\n\nAnnamcharya is believed to be the incarnation of Lord Venkateswara's sword. During his long and prolific career, he reputedly composed and sang 32,000 Sankirtanas and 12 Shatakas (sets of hundred verses). His works were in Telugu and Sanskrit.\n\nA \"Kirtan\" and a \"Bhajan\" are closely related, with both sharing common aims, subjects, musical themes and being devotional performance arts. A \"Bhajan\" is more free form, can be singular melody that is performed by a single singer with or without one and more musical instruments. \"Kirtan\", in contrast, differs in being a more structured team performance, typically with a call and response musical structure, similar to an intimate conversation or gentle sharing of ideas, and it includes two or more musical instruments, with roots in the prosody principles of the Vedic era.\n\nMany \"Kirtan\" are structured for more audience participation, where the singer calls a spiritual chant, a hymn or a devotional theme such as from Vaishnavism, the audience then responds back by repeating the chant or by chanting back a reply of their shared beliefs.\n\n\"Kirtan\" refers to devotional singing in Sikhism. It is typically performed at Gurdwaras (Sikh temples). Sikh scriptures and legends are usually recited in a song, to a certain \"raga\" and accompanied with musical instruments. The Gurus themselves created numourous musical instruments including the Dilruba, the Sarangi, the Esraj and a modification of the Pakhawaj creating an early form of the Tabla. A \"Shabad Kirtan\" refers to the musical recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture in the Sikhism tradition which is arranged according to \"raga\". The \"Shabad Kirtan\" can be listened to silently or sung along with the gathered congregation.\n\n\"Kirtan\" in Sikh history has been the musical analog of \"Kathas\" recitation, both preferably performed by \"ragi jatha\", or professional trained performers. A Sikh Kirtan is a religious, aesthetic and social event, usually held in a congregational setting on Sundays or over certain festivals to honor the historical Gurus, but major temples in the Sikh tradition recite \"Kirtan\" everyday as a mark of daily bhakti (devotional remembrance) of God's name. The congregational setting is called a \"Sangat\" or \"Satsang\", a word that in ancient Indian texts means \"like minded individuals, or fellow travelers on a spiritual journey\".\n\nAccording to Guy Beck, the music tradition did not develop in early Buddhism possibly because it was considered sensual and inconsistent with its core teachings. Later Buddhism did develop monastic chanting of the canonical literature, particularly in the ritualistic Vajrayana and other Mahayana traditions. Chants, songs and plays about the life of the Buddha by the Buddhists of Bengal were called \"Buddha-samkirtan\".\n\nParamhansa Yogananda, a Bengali saint was an early proponent of kirtan in the west, chanting Guru Nanak Dev's \"Hey Hari Sundara\" (\"Oh God Beautiful\") with 3,000 people at Carnegie Hall in 1923. Kirtan became more common with the spread of Gaudiya Vaishnavism by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness's (ISKCON) founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in the 1960s.\n\nKirtan singers have appeared in the West, such as Krishna Das, Bhagavan Das, Wah! and Jai Uttal as well as Snatam Kaur, Lokah Music, Deva Premal, Jim Gelcer, Jyoshna, Aindra Das, Gina Sala', and Gaura Vani & As Kindred Spirits. Yoga centers report an increase in attendance at kirtan; according to \"Pure Music\"’s Frank Goodman in conversation with Krishna Das in 2006, kirtan has taken on a wider popularity.\n\nThere are also Kirtan singers in the west who sing authentic traditional Indian style Kirtans such as Kamini Natarajan and Sheela Bringi.\n\nIn the United States case law, the term \"sankirtana\" has also been used to refer to evangelical activities of ISKCON. ISKCON had sought the right to perform \"sankirtana\" in California airports such as in Los Angeles. The court ruled that while ISKCON has a constitutional rights of protected speech, the Los Angeles airport also has a right to forbid any form of solicitation, out of \"a legitimate interest in controlling pedestrian congestion and reducing the risk of fraud and duress attendant to repetitive, in-person solicitation of funds\" by all groups including ISKCON.\n\nThe male given name Kirtan or Keerthan is used in South India for females as well, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\n\n"}

This\nclass of problems was considered in the economics literature by Boyan Jovanovic and Robert W. Rosenthal, in the engineering literature by Peter E. Caines and his co-workers and independently and around the same time by mathematicians and Pierre-Louis Lions.\n\nUse of the term 'mean field' is inspired by mean field theory in physics which considers the behaviour of systems of large numbers of particles where individual particles have negligible impact upon the system.\n\nIn continuous time a mean field game is typically composed by a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation that describes the optimal control problem of an individual and a Fokker–Planck equation that describes the dynamics of the aggregate distribution of agents. Under fairly general assumptions it can be proved that a class of mean field games is the limit as formula_1 of a \"N-player\" Nash equilibrium.\n\nA related concept to that of mean-field games is \"mean-field-type control\". In this case a social planner controls a distribution of states and chooses a control strategy. The solution to a mean-field-type control problem can typically be expressed as dual Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation coupled with Kolmogorov equation. Mean-field-type game theory is the multi-agent generalization of mean-field-type control.\n\n\n"}

Written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn as \"Kitty\", it was first recorded by UK music group Racey during 1979 appearing on their debut album \"Smash and Grab\". Toni Basil changed the name from Kitty to Mickey to make the song about a man.\n\nToni Basil's version of the song was initially issued as a single in the UK in May 1981, but did not chart at that time. Reissued in January 1982, \"Mickey\" quickly became a substantial UK hit, reaching number 2. It was issued in Australia by April, where over the Northern summer (Southern winter) it rose to number 1.\n\nFinally issued in North America in August 1982, \"Mickey\" became a number 1 hit in the US and Canada in late 1982, a year and a half after its original release.\n\nThe original Racey song did not include the famous \"Oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind\" chant, which Basil added.\n\nFor years, it had been rumored that the name was changed to Mickey because Basil had a crush on Monkees' drummer and lead vocalist Micky Dolenz after meeting him on the set of their movie \"Head\" for which she was the choreographer; however, this claim has been denied by Basil, who said she didn't know Dolenz that well.\n\nTwo different music videos for the song were recorded, one featuring Basil with a backing band, and another featuring costuming and choreography inspired by cheerleader dance routines. Filmed in 1981, the Cheerleader video is considered the very first choreographed dance video, and the opening stunt, where a cheerleader jumps through the center of a human pyramid, is now illegal in competition.\n\nRock critic Robert Christgau commented on the obscene content of the lyric \"So come on and give it to me / Any way you can / Any way you want to do it / I'll take it like a man\". Christgau wrote in a review at the time that Basil \"was the only woman ever to offer to take it up the ass on Top 40 radio.\" \n\nThe single scored number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for one week and number two in the UK Singles Chart. The song was Basil's only Top 40 success.

{"id": "1361846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1361846", "title": "Micro Machines", "text": "Micro Machines\n\nMicro Machines: The Original Scale Miniatures, also called Micro Machines or simply The Micros, are a line of toys originally made by Galoob (now part of Hasbro) in the mid-1980s and throughout the 1990s. Galoob licensed the idea behind Micro Machines from Clemens V. Hedeen, an American toy inventor from Wisconsin. Micro Machines were tiny scale component style \"playsets\" and vehicles that were slightly larger than N scale. Early Micro Machines television commercials were famous for featuring actor John Moschitta Jr., who was (at the time) listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the world's fastest talker.\n\nMany different styles of Micros were made including all the popular cars and trucks of the times, trains, emergency vehicles, tanks, boats, airplanes, helicopters, and motorcycles. The Tuff Trax series contained many of the popular TNT Motorsports Monster Trucks, including the influential Grave Digger truck. Star Trek and Star Wars models were also made, as were models from other science fiction franchises including Babylon 5, Power Rangers and MIB. They even immortalized James Bond and Indiana Jones in micro scale. After the Hasbro buyout, they came out with Winner's Circle NASCAR and G.I. Joe themed cars and playsets.\n\nWhile the Micro Machines collection was known primarily for sizing down automobiles, it also featured several playsets including 1991's fold-out Super Van City. Licensed character products would often be fold-open heads including miniature characters and vehicles interactive with their playset environment. Micro Machines also utilized several diverse features such as color-changing cars and \"Private Eyes\" vehicles that even allowed one to peek inside and view an illustration of the contents.\n\nOne of the many Micro Machines product lines was the Insiders series. Incredibly popular in the late 80s and early 90s, the Insiders series featured a small vehicle inside the standard size Micro Machine. The body and chassis of the larger vehicle connected via a hinge. Opening the larger revealed the smaller, which was a different model of car.\n\nMicro Machines released a special Presidential Limousine series, which used President Harry Truman's 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitan Bubble top limousine. President John F. Kennedy's Lincoln Continental or the X-100 convertible limousine, and President James Earl Carter's 1977 Lincoln Town Car was featured in series done in 1989.\n\nFor 3 to 4 years Micro Machines was the largest selling toy car line in the US with total dollar sales exceeding the combined sales of the next top selling lines: Hot Wheels, Matchbox and Majorette.\n\nMicro Machines had a well-known advertising campaign in the 1980s involving fast-talker John Moschitta Jr.. The commercials featured pitches in his trademark speedy style and ended with the slogan \"If it doesn't say Micro Machines, it's not the real thing!\".\n\nIn the 1990s, transforming playsets were released. Some could transform from one playset to another, such as a factory to a test track. Others could transform from giant vehicles to playsets, such as a 6x6 to a jungle. Earlier ones included one that could transform from a toolbox to a city. Another innovative release was a line of special boats in the 1990s. While past boats had merely sunk and were not intended for water use, these new sets could actually float.\n\nWhen sold to Hasbro, the basic line was largely discontinued, and new packaging of the toys didn't catch on as well as hoped, though some imitators continue to be sold in toy stores. In 2006, the brand name was visible only in the detail panel of the Star Wars and Transformers Titanium series die cast vehicles and figures.\n\nInterest in collecting Micro Machines has not reached the level of interest in collecting Hot Wheels. One possible reason is that toys are too new; not enough time has passed for collectors to develop an interest. Another reason is that one had to buy a pack at a time and typically only one would be a new model in any given year. Most sets are worth less than the $5 retail, though some like Civil War can command over $10, and the \"Aliens\" set of three are on eBay stores for $50. The rare US version of the action fleet Aliens dropship has been asking over $70. Some rare Star Trek sets and ships are being sold for $100 to $370 online. Some of the hardest to find packages of cars have commanded prices around $100. Those packages often contain prototypes never released to the public. Often large lots can be had for pennies per vehicle.\n\nMicro Machines kept sealed in the package take up a lot of space, so many collectors store them in other containers. Some collectors use one of the original showcases for Micro Machines while other store their collections in fishing tackle boxes.\n\nSome individual cars such as the SVO Mustang have changed hands for over $25 in the early 2000s, though with the appearance of traders who have nearly every vehicle for sale all the time, it is uncommon to see values over $5 for any one vehicle. However, there are some rare models that continue to trade at high values, such as the collector #CE3R Corvette from 1999. Some military vehicles are remarkably valuable models: those made with accurate markings or Soviet equipment such as the T-80BV. Rarer collections such as Star Trek or Star Wars are also valuable. A solid gold Star Trek model that was a grand prize in a drawing sold for over $5,000.\n\nCars can be identified by the name Galoob on the undercarriage.\n\nMicro Machines were featured in the 1990 Christmas movie \"Home Alone\", starring Macaulay Culkin. In the movie, Culkin's character sets dozens of Micro Machines at the bottom of a flight of stairs as a hazard for a pair of bungling burglars. This trap was also featured in the Sega Genesis game, though it's referred to generically as \"Toys\".\n\nThe Micro Machines brand was revived for a few years in response to the popularity of the similar Speedeez brand. Hasbro also opted to use many fantasy castings in the revival. The revival only lasted a couple years.\n\nThe brand 'Micro Machines' has also been incorporated into the packaging of the popular '' 3-inch vehicle range.\n\nThe Micro Mayhem is a stop-motion animation, in which the characters are played by Micro Machines.\n\nWith the release of the movie \"\", Hasbro released a new set of themed Micro Machines. This second revival lasted only a year; no more sets were released after Rogue One.\n\nThe idea for Micro Machines was conceived by Clemens V. Hedeen, Jr in his toy shop of Fun City USA in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin shortly after they got into the toy business. The inventor talked with someone from Galoob at Toy Fair who said they wanted to develop a new, reasonably priced car line. Work was done with their model maker/designer, to prepare 24 micro cars and packaging.\n\nThe first and only company that Clemens sent prototypes to was Galoob. They loved it and wanted to go to contract immediately. Saul Jodell and David Galoob were the masterminds behind marketing Micro Machines. Their vision at Galoob drove Micro Machines to become best-selling toys.\n\nMicro Machines thrived for years until Hasbro bought Galoob and Micro Machines for their Star Wars line and eventually put the line on the shelf. Micro Machines have been released periodically since then, but have had limited success since that time.\n\nThe inventor, Clemens, and his wife, Kay Hedeen, are still inventing at Fun City Toys in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.\n\n"}

Dillard. A 1910 Alabama Census confirms this information. Her father ran a grocery store (J.L. Dillard's Fish Co) in Birmingham. Myrtle appears in Baltimore mid-1925, 17 years old as a dancer with her partner Yank Brunson. The Baltimore Afro-American Newspaper described her as a local entertainer. Eventually, in late 1925, she joins Eddie Lemon's Stock Company, appearing at the Regent Theater's revue \"Who Dat?\". Early 1926, after Eddie Lemon left for Philadelphia, she remained at the Regent as part of the cast of \"Lew Peyton's Brownskin Vamps\", where she appeared in her own solo number dancing the Charleston. During this time, Myrtle met and married local mechanic, Cephus Watkins; however, the marriage ended shortly afterwards. The following month, she was entertaining at the 'all-white' Folly Cabaret in East Baltimore, her Charleston had caught on immensely with its patrons. Weeks later, she departed for Boston with the \"Rarin' to Go\" revue. In 1928, she toured around the Boston area with the Bostonian Harmony Lads singing light blues, where she wrote in the Afro-American that she missed Baltimore.\n\nDuring the winter of 1928, she joined the cast of the 2nd version of Lew Leslie's \"Blackbirds\" during the Boston auditions. She eventually met Eddie Thompson, one of the show's leading dancers and part of the duo Worthy & Thompson. Myrtle and Eddie returned briefly to New York (Feb.4 1929) to marry, another brief marriage. Blackbirds continued touring the Eastern US until May 31, when the troupe boarded the SS Ile de France for France. There they played three months the Moulin Rouge, before the French director renovated the Moulin into a cinema. The show opened on June 7 and was a sensation. Some of France's top stars attended, including Mistinguett and Maurice Chevalier. Adelaide Hall was the star attraction, and replacing Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson in this version were, John Worthy and Ed Thompson. Blackbirds returned to New York to briefly tour the East Coast again in September, but its return coincided with the famous Wall-Street Crash and there was no work. According to a 1930 New York Census, while living on 7th Avenue with her husband, Myrtle Dillard-Thompson confirms again her parents as being from Alabama.\n\nMyrtle returned to France late April 1930, with Gene Newton's \"Chocolate Revue\" and opened at the Comedy Nightclub. She began working at the famous supper club, Chez Florence with Elisabeth Welch. They danced in long orange satin gowns designed by Jean Patou and lifting their skirts to reveal their long legs. The following month, she appeared in the chorus of the Embassy cabaret floor-show \"Hot-Stuff\" which was advertised as, \"Harlem aux Champs-Elysees\". Directed by S.H. Dudley Jr., the show included Louis Cole, El Brown, comic Snow Fisher and much of the remaining cast of Blackbirds. The show ran for a successful month. At one point, she was briefly the dance partners with the Senegalese Folies-Bergere star, Feral Benga. A while later, she appeared again at the Embassy with the show \"Ebony Follies\". By late 1930, Most of the cast at the Embassy had already returned to Harlem, Myrtle left for the Champs-Elysees Nightclub, but eventually soon made her way southwest for Spain.\n\nEarly 1931, Myrtle appeared in Madrid's Lido Cabaret with Red Hot Coals Jazz Orchestra. She might have been invited by famous Spanish author and lyricist, Alvaro Retana, who was known to introduce black jazz musicians into Spain. Retana mentioned that Mytle performed semi-nude, imitating the Spanish dancer Carmen Tortola Valencia, under the name \"Perla de Oriente\". In April, the show stopped as the Spanish monarchy came an end. King Alfonso XIII had abdicated his throne peacefully and boarded a train to Paris for exile, celebrations filled the streets across Spain. Her appearances were a large success and instead of returning to Paris, signed a contract in June for the Ideal-Rosales Cabaret a few blocks away. It can be occasionally difficult to find where she was performing, as her name was constantly misspelled. Appearing with her at the cabaret was Argentine singer-guitarist Alfredo Marino and his partner, Hector Morel. During the summer, the trio packed up for a tour of northern Spain. While in San Sebastián, the director took the cast of the show down to the beach, where reporters remarked seeing Myrtle as a black Venus emerging from the waters. Upon returning to Madrid, she appeared at the Alcazar-Dancing in a large variety show, with Morel & Morino, occasionally joining Harry Flemming and his band in the Jardin Retiro. She later moved onto the Casanova En Stambul and the Teatro-Circo Price. Late October, she left for Barcelona to appear at the Eden Concert, Circo Barcelones and Buena Sombra music hall for the winter. While there, she worked closely with the Afro-Uruguayan singer \"Caruso Negro\" (Oscar Rorra). She also recorded several songs with the Barcelona Compañía del Gramófono.\n\nIn the spring of 1932, after a brief appearance in Valencia, she returned to Madrid to join Louis Douglas and his revue at the Lido de Madrid. At the same time, she also appeared with Spanish revue-star Perlita Greco at the Teatro Fuencarral. The revue was revised and re-opened in the summer with the title \"Modern Melodies\" at the Teatro Avenida with Myrtle dancing in front of the band in a costume with red feathers swinging on her backside. One visiting journalist for the Afro-American described her as the Josephine Baker of Spain: \"Miss Watkins is a very good dancer, with plenty of pep, and a pretty shapely figure. She is making conquests in high society and on her string is the marquis of one of Spain's bluest blue bloods. She lives at the Hotel Florida, one of the best hotels in the city, has a fine roadster, records for Spanish gramophone and radio, and entertains at one of the leading cabarets.\" In July, after the revue closed, Myrtle appeared at the Florida Bar in Zaragoza and the Cine Odeon in Huesca with Cuban saxophonist, El Negro Aquilino and his troupe. Returning to Madrid in October, Myrtle appeared in a show that might have been filmed, \"Movietone 1933\" with Perlita Greco and Scrappy Jones (from Douglas's revue). Shortly after, Myrtle joined Louis Douglas on a tour of Italy. Myrtle soon left the tour in March to appear in Seville , Spain. In June 1933, she was in Belgium with the bandleader Robert de Kers. While there, she recorded a new song, \"Lonely Brown Rose\" and appeared on the front of Belgian magazines alongside Josephine Baker. In September, while in Barcelona, she appeared at the Teatro Romea, \"Jazz-Show\" organized by Italian Impresario Max Guido. The show was a huge success and Myrtle was recognized as Spain's latest vedette. In November, she moved over to the Pompeya Musichall where she danced all evening, and then after midnight would climb downstairs and sing at the Hollywood nightclub which would be broadcast over the radio. In the winter she appeared at the exclusive Casa Llibre Tea Rooms singing for some of Spain's elite. That winter, Myrtle accompanied by pianist Tommy 'Puss' Chase and his band for a tour of the southern coast of France. \"Myrtle was a very enterprising, always had some kind of band with her, and was a very good looking and talented singer and dancer.\" They travelled to Cannes, Nice and ended in Monaco during the Rallye Monte Carlo.\n\nDuring the spring of 1934, Bricktop postponed the opening of her new club until Myrtle arrived, advertised as The world's most fascinating entertainer. She brought success and large crowds to Bricktop's-Monico, but decided to move on to the Basque Bar in June with Afro-British entertainer Evelyn Dove. While in Paris, Myrtle arranged to travel to London at the Granada Theatre in an 'all-colored' revue, \"Black Scandals\". On July 2, 1934, the show ran for a successful week. The films shown that week on the manager's weekly report states that both films were rather weak, and had it not been for the stage show, the takings would have been down. The revue was advertised as 'The Greatest Colored stage show in all of Europe.' She returned home to Spain at the end of the month, before continuing her tour that August, in The Hague dancing at the Palais de Danse cabaret and in London that October at the Cafe Anglais.\n\nEarly 1935, she returned to Paris at the Cuban-themed Melody-Bar with the Afro-American tenor, Opal Cooper. While there, she learned her estranged husband Eddie was ill with stomach cancer and had to halt his career while recovering in hospital. In March, she left for Berlin to appear in a film before returning in May, appearing at the Boeuf Sur Le Toit with Leon Abbey's orchestra. While touring Belgium again during the late summer, Leon Abbey arranged for Myrtle to appear with his orchestra for six months in Bombay, India. After boarding a ship in Venice, they arrived in Bombay early October, where it was quickly realized they didn't have the proper work permits. Later joined by Opal Cooper, the group appeared at the Taj Mahal Hotel and Green's Ballroom next door with much success. By December, however, Myrtle was laid low by a terrible bout of malaria. During her stay, she was introduced to a handsome Malaysian cricket player, Lall Singh, who was smitten with this new popular jazz artist in India. By the spring of 1936, Lall took a short break from cricket and returned to Europe with Myrtle, now working as her theatrical agent. Soon after, the couple quickly wed and Myrtle began wearing a sari and practicing Hinduism alongside her new husband. Around this time, her former husband in Harlem died of Stomach Cancer. During the following months, Myrtle appeared in Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia and finally ended the tour in Budapest, Hungary in a revue at the famous Arizona cabaret.\n\nUnable to return home to Spain, due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she instead traveled back to Paris the spring of 1937 in time for the Exposition Internationale, appearing at Le Grand Jeu Cabaret and the George V Restaurant where she held live-radio broadcasts and performed for every visiting dignitary and royalty at the Exposition. She was soon accompanied by Samuel Bonifacio Zarate, a Mexican violinist popular among French audiences for his virtuoso violin skills. He worked with Carlos Chávez's Sinfónica de Mexico at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and graduated from the Mexican National Conservatory, where he was a disciple of Luis G. Saloma. He earned a scholarship from the Mexican government and studied in Paris at the l'Ecole Normale Superieur (1932-1937). Earlier in the spring, he won the first prize at the International Violin Competition. To make ends meet, he entertained whenever possible, often with the Mexican-American Vedette, Reva Reyes. On one occasion, he was hired to entertain royalty at the George V restaurant. There he met Myrtle, who soon took on the name Paquita, and quickly became a musical team. In September, they moved over to the Pavillon-Elysees and spent the winter at the Villa d'Este cabaret. In June 1938, Adelaide Hall left for London, leaving behind her cabaret, the Big Apple Club. Myrtle became the club's main attraction while Bricktop ran the finances of the club. But Bricktop was no good in keeping the accounts straight, her temper was even worse, and soon the cabaret shut down that winter. Before the club fell apart, Myrtle returned to the Villa d'Este in September. In December, she appeared in \"Harlem au Coliseum\" at the Paris-Coliseum alongside other artists, such as her new partner Samuel Zarate and Zaidee Jackson. She later opened at the new Park-Lane Club with Louis Armstrong & his Cuban American orchestra. During the summer of 1939, while Myrtle and Zarate toured the Baltic coast, where her German films did so well, when the atmosphere suddenly grew dark in Europe. Posters appeared across everywhere \"Because of the aggressive attitude of the German government, France and the United Kingdom has declared a general mobilization.\" In August, she was in Poland appearing on Radio-Warsaw. A few weeks later, Polish musician, Stanley Laudan invited Myrtle to, La Bagatelle, his club in Katowice. On September 1, World War II started as Nazi troops quickly seized Poland. As Poland underwent military mobilization to defend itself, she was able to get documents to flee back to Paris. Upon arriving, Lall decided to renew his cricket contract and return to Malaysia and at some point couple probably decided to divorce in November. Soon as danger was at her doorstep again as the Germans turned their attentions on France early 1940.\n\nDanger was again at their doorstep as the Germans turned their attentions on France early 1940, Paquita and Zarate departed for a Middle Eastern tour, travelling across Egypt and Iraq during the early years of the war. By the summer of 1941, they made their way into India, with major success in Lahore's Hotel as well as Bombay's Taj Mahal and Green's Hotels. This attracted the attention from Calcutta's Grand Hotel which housed the popular American jazz musician, Teddy Weatherford, whom she met briefly in 1937 and who had just arrived from Ceylon and was now the music director of the hotel's ballroom. In November, the Grand Ballroom floor-show featured Myrtle dancing and singing Latin American numbers. She was soon broadcast over Indian radio and Myrtle recorded the numbers from the show with the Indian Columbia records, so the audience could enjoy her performance at home. In January 1942, Japanese troops occupied Kuala Lumpur. Lall Singh was seized and placed in a work camp with his brother, BS Gill (who eventually died) until the country was liberated in August 1945. Starting in Calcutta, the Quit India movement swept across the country, with protesters demanding independence from British rule. Myrtle obtained an American passport during the summer with plans of leaving the country before things got too bad. Soon the bliss of India was gone when Japanese planes were bombing Calcutta in early 1943, which was followed with a large famine all across India. Dead animals littered the street, starving children begged for food, half bombed buildings. The Grand Hotel became flooded with soldiers, and her shows were used to boost troop morale.\n\nDecided it might be time to move on, Paquita and Zarate now newly engaged, boarded the USS Hermitage, accompanied with Polish refugees, for California, arriving in San Pedro in during the summer of 1943. California was stirring with chaos as the Zoot Suit Riots broke out across the West Coast. Arriving in Los Angeles, the couple traveled south to Mexico to Zarate's hometown, El Oro de Hidalgo to spend times with his numerous relatives. After a while in Mexico, they returned to Los Angeles, because it offered more opportunities in the entertainment field. \"Paquita\" also began informing everyone that she was an Indian princess of the Brahman caste sent by her parents to study in Europe, a story probably developed to prevent racial issues she would have faced as an African-American artist. On January 6, 1944, the couple married quietly in Seattle. 'Zarate & Paquita' took their show across the Western & Southwestern United States, Hawaii, Alaska and Mexico. They played with big names across the US, including Liberace. They were regular entertainers around Reno, Salt Lake City, San Jose and Eugene, Oregon. They soon purchased a home in Evanston, Wyoming along Interstate-80 near Salt Lake City, with access to Utah, Nevada and California. During the summer of 1947, they performed at the Bastille Day celebrations in Reno for the French Consul. Their concerts usually began with Zarate playing classical violin and viola numbers in the first half and in the second half when Paquita would join Zarate on drums, dancing in a frenzy dressed in elegant gowns and singing songs from around the world in five different languages. With such a hectic touring schedule, it seems they bothered to take too many breaks. Despite Zarate often returning home to Mexico to visit relatives, it doesn't seem as if Paquita returned to Alabama to see any family; or even visit Detroit to attend her father's funeral in 1946.\n\nIn 1952, Zarate filed for American neutrality so could establish himself more in the United States. Zarate also took up contracts from numerous recording companies, particularly Northwestern. Zarate and Paquita's records sold well across the Western United States. Later on, Zarate opened his own music recording company, ZARPAC, based in their Los Angeles home, which also contained a recording studio. They recorded more than before, nearly a dozen recordings a year and appeared on American radio and television. They became known in performing foreign songs and also experimented in different genres, such as Calypso, which had become popular during the early-1950s. Sometime around 1953, while performing in Chicago, a strong wind damaged their home in Evanston, Wyoming. Cancelling their appearance, they traveled to California and bought a house in Sun Valley, confining their travels to the West Coast. In 1958, they released a religious album, each song dedicated to different religions across the world such as Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. In 1959, they performed in a year-long spectacle at the Lamplighter Lounge in Corvallis, Oregon.\n\nBy 1957, they began frequently touring the central Oregon coast under contract to one of the largest nightclubs in Portland. The owner of a new motel and lounge complex in Depoe Bay, Oregon wanted them to entertain there on a part-time basis. On their first visit, Zarate saw a 'For-Sale' sign on two concrete oxen standing outside a small green house called \"Trails End\" on six acres of brushland between Lincoln City and Depoe Bay. He suggested they buy it, but Paquita suggested otherwise, \"Yes, here in the middle of nowhere.\" The sign was still there upon their second visit and Zarate and Paquita bought the property in 1959. They built a new house and had the oxen separated and placed on either end of the driveway that loops off Highway 101. They built a studio, so Zarate could teach violin, guitar, piano, flute and organ - instruments he had mastered over the years. Paquita gave lessons in dance and numerous languages. There was also an adjoining restaurant, The Gingerbread House, providing traditional Mexican and Indian cuisine; children were permitted without charge to encourage more students and guests. A number of students enrolled at the Happy Village Cultural Center.\n\nBut the institution wasn't profitable, especially as Paquita became too involved with the children and it hurt her health, which was already debilitated by diabetes according to Zarate. To continue running things, they made numerous appearances over the years at the popular Amato's Supper Club and at the King Surf Beach Resort's Pagan Hut restaurant. Zarate performed at weddings across Oregon and they both entertained at gatherings hosted by the elite of the west coast. This helped bring money to continue running things back at their small estate. During the spring of 1962, in Wecoma Beach (now Lincoln City) they appeared in an International Music Recital where they presented their varied repertoires of dances and songs in numerous languages and instruments. Their stage appearances became very minimal for many years afterwards, except for the annual appearances in Mexico during the spring and winter. After 1965, they also began appearing annually at the Salishan Bar & Grill. Paquita watched as cars went faster and faster by their home, and it troubled her to think that people were in such a hurry. She wanted to give them a place where they could pull over for a few minutes and \"give their souls a chance to catch up with them.\" Zarate wanted to wait until her health improved, so they could build it together. Myrtle 'Paquita' Zarate died on November 10, 1968 of diabetic complications. Zarate immediately built a small white chapel on the property among the pines he planted in her honor, and hardly left except to visit relatives in Mexico during the winter. The Fine Arts School continued running, but doesn't seem to have drawn many students as they had before her death. Samuel Zarate continued performing across the Oregon and Mexico until his death in 1997.\n\n"}

It referred to the prohibition of dancing in all New York City spaces open to the public selling food and/or drink unless they had obtained a cabaret license. It prohibited \"musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement\" without a license.\n\nCritics argued that the license was expensive and difficult to obtain and that enforcement was arbitrary and weaponized against marginalized groups, but proponents insisted that the law minimized noise complaints.\n\nAccording to the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs,\n\nA Cabaret License is required for any business that sells food and / or beverages to the public and allows patron dancing in a room, place, or space.\n\nThe New York City Cabaret Law was passed in 1926, during the Harlem Renaissance. An attorney and professor challenging the cabaret law wrote that the law originally targeted jazz clubs in Harlem and the social mixing of races, but a historian of the period rejects the view and said there is \"little evidence\" for that to be the case.\n\nIn proposing the law, the Committee on Local Laws argued that \"there has been altogether too much running 'wild' in some of these night clubs and, in the judgement of your Committee, the 'wild' stranger and the foolish native should have the check-rein applied a little bit.\" In referring to \"running wild,\" the 1926 Committee may have been alluding to the popular 1920s song \"\", which popularized the Charleston dance.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1967, the New York Police Department issued regulations requiring musicians and other employees in cabarets to obtain a New York City Cabaret Card, and musicians such as Chet Baker, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, and Billie Holiday had their right to perform suspended.\n\nIn 1971, the Cabaret Law was modified to exempt musical performance \"by not more than three persons playing piano, organ, accordion or guitar or any stringed instrument,\" which disproportionately affected jazz since drums, reeds, and horns were not allowed, as was stated in the \"Chiasson I\" case and the Chevigny book. The so-called three-musician rule was not found in the original 1926 text of the bill.\n\nThroughout its history, the law was selectively enforced with its most notable enforcer, former mayor Rudy Giuliani, resurrecting the dormant rule as part of his implementation of broken windows policing to fine and shut down perceived nuisance bars in the late 1990s.\n\nAll applicants for a cabaret license had to be fingerprinted; to provide extensive financial records; to meet specific zoning, surveillance, physical security, fire, building, electrical, health, and record keeping requirements; and to pay the fees associated with each compliance.\n\nIn 2016, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs claimed there were then 118 cabaret licenses in a city of 25,100 licensed food service establishments.\n\nThe law was heavily criticized both by the general public and from within city government.\n\nThe limits on types of instruments were ruled unconstitutional in \"Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs\", 132 Misc.2d 640 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1986), and the three-musician limit was found to be unconstitutional in a later decision in the same case in \"Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs\", 138 Misc.2d 394 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1988). Although the code was change to reflect the ruling as to types of instrument, the text to reflect the elimination of he three-musician limit was not corrected in the text of the Administrative Code.\n\nA broader challenge to the Cabaret Law and New York City's Zoning Resolution under the New York State Constitution was rejected in \"John Festa v. New York City Department of Consumer Affair,\" 12 Misc. 3d 466 (Sup. Ct. NY County 2006), but the court urged legislative review of the law and concluded, \"Surely, the Big Apple is big enough to find a way to let people dance.\"\n\nIn 2015, Brooklyn attorney and bar owner Andrew Muchmore filed a still-ongoing case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the law, claiming it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution. The Muchmore case challenged the Cabaret Law but not New York City's Zoning Resolution.\n\nIn June 2017, New York City Councilmember Rafael Espinal introduced a bill for the full repeal of the regulation. It was passed 44-1 by the City Council on October 31, 2017.\n\nHowever, a venue can still be fined or closed by the city, as the law still requires the venue to be located in a zone that allows dancing.\n\n"}

It was released worldwide on 22 September 2017, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.\n\nSoon after the success of \"Project CARS\" after the May 2015 release, funding began to open for \"Project CARS 2\" on 23 June 2015. World of Mass Development and Slightly Mad Studios opened donations through the \"\"Project CARS 2\" official forum\". Forum members and visitors choosing to donate had the option to using membership through the forums. In exchange, donors could gain access to development builds and voicing thoughts, opinions, and suggestions critical to the progress of the game. On 8 February 2017, Project CARS 2 was officially announced as a game coming late 2017. Slightly Mad Studios soon revealed that the game was going to compose of 182 cars from 38 manufacturers and a variety of car and race car classes, new additions including the Honda Civic, Jaguar XJ220, Toyota GT-86 and Nissan R89C. The game also has a larger track roster, with 46 tracks (containing 121 layouts), the majority being laser scanned circuits, and new additions including Fuji Speedway, Knockhill, Long Beach and the Dirtfish rallycross track. A new time and weather system have also been included in-game which can allow multiple different changing weather conditions and changes within a given season (winter, spring, summer, autumn). A new game physics engine called LiveTrack 3.0 has also been included, bringing realistic track conditions throughout a race weekend.\n\nOnline mode has also been developed with a focus on E-sports, bringing an online ranking system, online championships, and better functionality in matchmaking.\nThrough the months leading up to a release, Slightly Mad Studios have worked closely with auto manufacturers, auto industry companies, and race car drivers to help them in making an accurate simulation. As a result, cars have specific performance characteristics and represents its real-life counterpart accurately. The tyre physics have also been built from the ground up, with more advanced tyre movements and actions.\n\nIn addition, \"Project CARS 2\" supports virtual reality (VR), up to 12K resolution, and triple screen support.\n\nIn an interview with Red Bull, when asked whether the game will arrive for Nintendo Switch, creative director Andy Tudor replied that despite being a big fan of Nintendo's platforms, there are no plans to release the game for Nintendo Switch.\n\nThere will be new manufacturers in the game, including: Porsche (they used Ruf in the first game), Ferrari, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Honda, Acura and Nissan.\n\nThey also developed a partnership with IndyCar, which includes all the lineup of the 2016 season, the official logo and the Indy 500.\nIn 2019, Project Cars 3 has rims, an exhaust, a livery maker and engine swap\nafter body kits transmissions.\n\n\"Project CARS 2\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n\"\"Project Cars 2\" may do a great many things exceptionally well, but it's hard to look past the mountain of gaffes that quickly pile up on and off the track. Racing, after all, is about results, not potential.\" was Josh Harmon's conclusion on Electronic Gaming Monthly with a score of 6/10.\n\nMatthew Kato from Game Informer gave the game a score of 7.75/10 saying that \"With all its customization options, racing demands, and copious track configurations (140-plus at over 60 locations), \"Project Cars 2\" has a lot to dive into. However, it's more than just a scattershot of content – it's a title that rewards players for exploring all of its nooks and crannies. It could still use a good coat of polish, but it has a charm and daring that is often missing in the sub-genre.\" \"Hobby Consolas\" also praised the breadth of content.\n\nRichard Wakeling of GameSpot awarded it 7/10 stating that \"When it all works as intended, \"Project Cars 2\" is a brilliant simulation racer provided you're playing with a wheel. It's ambitious in scope and depth, and the sheer breadth of available motorsports almost guarantees there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into. It's a shame, then, that there's always this nagging feeling in the back of your mind that a bug or moment of AI madness will disrupt the whole thing and more often than not, it will. These issues may be ironed out in the coming weeks and months, but with potentially stiff competition on the very-near horizon, Slightly Mad Studios might not have enough time to capture the hearts and minds of video game racing fans before they move on to pastures new.\" Eurogamer also mentioned the bugs.\n\n9.2/10 was Luke Reilly's score on IGN and said \"With its refined new handling and piles of race options, \"Project CARS 2\" is about as good as real racing gets right now.\" \"Edge\" agreed, saying that \"no racer offers such a breadth of choice, or seems so willing to let the player set the rules of the road.\".\n\n\"PC Gamer\"s Phil Iwaniuk scored the game an 89/100 with the consensus \"Serious racing for serious racers. Extraordinarily convincing at each of the disciplines on offer.\" Evo said it had \"excellent graphics and thundering, all-encompassing sounds\".\n\nMetro summed it up with \"It was always crazy for such a small team to create such an ambitious game, but despite a few potholes this succeeds better than it has any right to. It is certainly a better game than the original and while it can’t compete with the mega budgets of \"Forza\" and \"Gran Turismo\" , in terms of the amount of content, and a palpable love of motor racing, this is at least their equal.\" Driving.co.uk said it was \"Very tricky to master, which will put off the arcade racer crowd, but impressive attention to detail, realistic handling, speedy, atmospheric menus and a mouth-watering array of cars and tracks continue to make Project Cars one of the best racing games available.\"\n\nThe game was nominated for \"Best Racing Game\" and \"Best VR Experience\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.\n\n\"Project CARS 2\" reached number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind \"Destiny 2\". The game reached number 3 in both Australia and New Zealand. In Japan, it was the 6th best-selling PlayStation 4 game, and 11th overall.\n"}

UNAIDS estimates there are 1,200 prostitutes in the country. Many are from Cameroon.\n\nIn February 2018 an investigation by \"The Times\" newspaper found that Oxfam allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning sexual exploitation, the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation. A confidential report produced by Oxfam in 2011 found that there had been “a culture of impunity” among some staff in Haiti and concluded that 'it cannot be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged'. Among the staff who were permitted to resign was the charity's Belgian country director, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. According to the internal report, Van Hauwermeiren admitted using prostitutes at a villa whose rent was paid for by Oxfam with charitable funds. Oxfam's chief executive at the time, Dame Barbara Stocking, offered Hauwermeiren “a phased and dignified exit” because of concern that sacking him risked “potentially serious implications” for the charity’s work and reputation.\n\nA few days after \"The Times\" published its revelations, it emerged that Oxfam had been aware of allegations that, while serving as director of the organisation's relief operation in Chad in 2006, Van Hauwermeiren and other staff had repeatedly made use of prostitutes at the Oxfam team house there, and that one of Oxfam's staff members had been fired for his behaviour. In the wake of these revelations, Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned, taking full responsibility and acknowledging that \"(c)oncerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon\". New allegations were made by a senior staffer, Helen Evans, who had been the lead investigator of organizational sexual misconduct between 2012 and 2015.\n\nLike many Sub-Saharan African countries, HIV is a problem in Chad. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. Lack of understanding of the infection, low usage of condoms and poor access to healthcare contribute to a HIV prevalence rate of 20%. This figure is likely to be higher in the Lake Chad area.\n\nChad is a source, transit, and destination country for children subjected to sex trafficking. The country’s trafficking problem is primarily internal and frequently involves children being entrusted to relatives or intermediaries in return for promises of education, apprenticeship, goods, or moneey. Chadian girls travel to larger towns in search of work, where some are subsequently subjected to child sex trafficking or are abused in domestic servitude; child sex trafficking is also a concern among refugees and IDPs in Chad. NGOs report that the Nigerian terrorist groups Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State-West Africa are involved in child trafficking. In the Lake Chad area, since May 2015, attacks by Boko Haram and concurrent government military operations increased the number of IDPs, a population vulnerable to trafficking, to 76,225.\n\nIn 2015, authorities arrested the police commissioner of the city of Kelo on suspicion of involvement in child trafficking; however, after initial investigation for kidnapping, officials released the suspect from custody and, while the case remained open, it was unknown whether officials continued to actively investigate the charge. In 2016, the Chadian National Police Child Protective Services (Brigade des Mineurs) continued to investigate child abuse and exploitation, including trafficking. NGOs reported of some local officials’ complicity in trafficking during 2016.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Chad as a \"Tier 2 Watch List\" country.\n"}

The concept of \"sky father\" may also be taken to include Sun gods with similar characteristics. The concept is complementary to an \"earth mother\".\n\n\"Sky Father\" is a direct translation of the Vedic \"Dyaus Pita\", etymologically descended from the same Proto-Indo-European deity name as the Greek \"Zeû Pater\" and Roman \"Jupiter\", all of which are reflexes of the same Proto-Indo-European deity's name, \"*Dyēus Ph₂tḗr\". While there are numerous parallels adduced from outside of Indo-European mythology, there are exceptions (e.g. In Egyptian mythology, Nut is the sky mother and Geb is the earth father).\n\n\nIn late-19th-century opinions on comparative religion, in a line of thinking that begins with Friedrich Engels and J. J. Bachofen, and which received major literary promotion in \"The Golden Bough\" by James G. Frazer, it was believed that worship of a sky father was characteristic of nomadic peoples, and that worship of an earth mother similarly characterised farming peoples.\n\nThis view was stylized as reflecting not only a conflict of nomadism vs. agriculturalism but of \"patriarchy\" vs. \"matriarchy\", and has blossomed into a late ideological in certain currents of feminist spirituality and feminist archaeology in the 1970s.\n\nThe theory about earth goddesses, sky father, and patriarchal invaders was a stirring tale that fired various imaginations. The story was important in literature, and was referred to in various ways by important poets and novelists, including T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and most influentially, Robert Graves.\n\n"}

{"id": "38363686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38363686", "title": "The Montague Brothers", "text": "The Montague Brothers\n\nThe Montague Brothers was a strongman act of the early twentieth century made up of the three Woollaston brothers, Edwin John Woollaston (1876-1918), Alfred Montague Woollaston (Monte Saldo), and Frank Harold Woollaston (Frank Saldo). In the act the Brothers displayed acts of strength including supporting a heavy motor car complete with passengers and 'The Sculptor's Dream'.\n\nTaking its name from the middle name of the act's founder, Alfred Montague Woollaston (Monte Saldo), 'The Montague Brothers' grew out of the strongman act 'Ronco & Monte' - both of whom had served apprenticeships with famed strongman and bodybuilder Eugen Sandow. On 'Ronco & Monte' breaking up Monte Saldo then teamed up with his younger brother Frank Woollaston, and the new strongman act opened at the Hippodrome in London, followed by a European tour. During the tour the brothers appeared in Amsterdam, Dresden, Hamburg, Saxony, Prague and Paris, at the latter city regularly working out in the gymnasium of Edmond Desbonnet. On their return they appeared for a season at the London Pavilion.\n\nIn 1903 Monte Saldo added a new routine to the act which was designed to draw in large audiences, during which he supported a heavy motor car in the \"Tomb of Hercules\" position. Having prepared and rehearsed carefully, on stage a Darracq full of passengers was driven up a ramp and onto a bridge, where the ramp and supports were removed leaving Saldo supporting the entire weight of the vehicle and its contents on a section of the bridge. Later, the act was refined, with Saldo supporting the car on top of a ten foot high revolving platform. This act was taken on another international tour, for which Saldo received the largest salary ever paid to a one-man strongman act.\n\nIn 1906 Monte Saldo refined the act even further, teaming up again with his brother Frank Woollaston (now known as Frank Saldo) and older brother Edwin, the three of them billing themselves as \"The Montague Brothers\", and performing a new routine called \"The Sculptor's Dream\". \n\nThe act was described by Alexander Zass thus:\n\n\"... a real strongman, and a clever weightlifter to boot was Monte Saldo, whose stage showmanship was best displayed, perhaps, in a turn which he presented with his brother Frank, entitled \"the Sculptor's Dream,\" certainly of the most artistic and impressive of any ever given. \n<br>\nThe curtain rose disclosing a sculptor's studio, with the sculptor at work on a reproduction of a well known classical statue. The figure was Monte himself, painted and garbed in an excellent imitation of marble, and behind him was a mirror, in which the statue could be seen reproduced. After working a while, the sculpture wearied, and concealing his masterpiece behind curtains, stretched himself at length upon a couch, soon to be ostensibly asleep. The curtains thereupon parted on their own account, revealing the statue in another classical pose, again reflected in the mirror. Then once more they closed, only to re-open and repeat their re-opening to revelation of ever fresh poses and reflections, until finally the statue and the mirror reflection confront each other in a famous wrestler's attitude. \n<br>\nA pause, and then the mirror crashing as the 'reflection' - brother Frank, to be more explicit - leapt out to grapple with Monte, and execute on stage a variety of wrestling postures. This unique opening was followed by a series of equally novel strength feats in which both iron and human weights figured, closured by Monte pressing Frank aloft with one hand, and a twirl round of the supported performer. This twirl, by the way, was very smartly done. As Frank leant back to be supported on Monte's palm, the lifter would interpose a revolving disc on which his brother's back rested. Thus when Frank had been pressed aloft, it enabled Monte to spin him. \n<br>\nAt this juncture, the sculptor would commence to stir, whereupon both statue and 'reflection' would leap back and, resuming their original poses, thus satisfying the now awakened chiseller of marble that all which had transpired was actually nothing but a dream. \n<br>\nMonte Saldo was one of the few men who have enhanced a reputation made on the stage as a strongman by feats performed away from its atmosphere of glamour and make-believe. The first man in the world to 'swing' over his own bodyweight with one hand, and one of the most successful trainers of strong men ever known...\"\n\"The Entr'acte\" said of this new routine, \"An absolutely original athletic act is given by the Montague Brothers. Their performance is entitled 'The Sculptor's Dream' and provides the most original setting we have ever seen, being athletic and at the same time effective when it comes to feats of strength pure and simple. Their work is simply amazing.\" The sculptor was played by Edwin John Woollaston, the duo's older brother.\n\nThe act broke up in about 1909, with Monte Saldo opening a gym with William Bankier ('Apollo, the Scottish Hercules'), while Frank Saldo went into physical training and teaching. Older brother Edwin John Woollaston died in 1918.\n"}

While they originally and primarily produce video gaming-related content, they have expanded to produce content for tabletop games and role-playing games as well, and have also published their first video game in 2017. They primarily publish their content on YouTube and Twitch.tv through their shared main channel as well as affiliated channels run by other creators as part of the Yogscast network. The group had their roots in videos about the massively multiplayer online game \"World of Warcraft\", but rose to popularity with their playthrough of the sandbox game \"Minecraft\" and their self-produced role playing series \"Shadow of Israphel\" set in the same game. More recently, the group are known to play the sandbox game \"Garry's Mod\" and the action free roam game \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", as well as producing their own live action series. They are also known for their annual Christmas live streaming charity drive, currently named the Yogscast Jingle Jam, which has raised more than twelve million dollars for various charities .\n\nThe group was founded in July 2008 by friends Lewis Brindley (\"Xephos\") and Simon Lane (\"Honeydew\"), with the creation of their YouTube channel on 8 July 2008, and their first YouTube video uploaded on 25 July 2008. Brindley and Lane first began by recording iTunes podcasts and YouTube video guides on \"World of Warcraft\" from their own homes and joined by friends from their guild, desiring to share Lane's quirky style of humour with other people around the world. The name of their fledgling channel, \"Yogscast\", was derived from the title letters of their \"World of Warcraft\" guild Ye Olde Goone Squade, which itself originated from the forum community of Something Awful. In August 2010, they joined the multi-channel network TheGameStation, a sub-network of Maker Studios.\n\nIn December 2010, they recorded a \"Minecraft\" video series subsequently named \"Shadow of Israphel\" which amassed a large number of views and subscribers, and catapulted them to popularity. On 3 May 2011, Brindley and Lane officially incorporated the Yogscast as a registered company in Reading, Berkshire. They also moved into a house which they also shared with their friend Hannah Rutherford (\"Lomadia\") in Reading. They also started a secondary channel for showchasing dubbed-over trailers that they called \"yogscast2\". In October 2011, the Yogscast's main YouTube channel \"YOGSCAST Lewis & Simon\" hit one million subscribers, making them the biggest YouTube channel in the United Kingdom at that time. \n\nOther members of Ye Olde Goone Squade subsequently joined Brindley and Lane in creating their own content under the Yogscast brand. Rutherford initially ran the Yogscast's secondary channel which later became her own channel to create her own content, while other early associates such as Duncan Jones (\"Lalna\"), Paul Sykes (\"Sjin\"), and Chris Lovasz (\"Sips\") created their own channels to record their own videos, marking the start of the Yogscast family.\n\nThe Yogscast team held their own panel at MineCon 2011, where they showcased some of the work of the \"Minecraft\" community. Following the event, the group came under fire from \"Minecraft\" creator Markus Persson, who stated that he would no longer work with the group, citing use of profanity and unprofessional behaviour. These claims were questioned by some MineCon attendees as well as game commentator TotalBiscuit. The Yogscast responded on Reddit and via a YouTube video, denying the accusations and expressing their disappointment and frustration with the organisation of MineCon, as well as their respect for Persson and the \"Minecraft\" community at large. Persson later apologised for the misunderstanding and retracted his accusations, attributing the statements to stress and miscommunication. To date, however, the Yogscast have not published further coverage of subsequent MineCons, nor have they ever worked professionally with Persson.\n\nIn 2012, indie games developer Winterkewl Games ran a Kickstarter campaign to develop a video game called \"Yogventures!\" based upon the intellectual property of the Yogscast featuring Brindley's and Lane's in-game avatars. The goal of $250,000 was quickly reached, with a full total of $567,000 eventually being raised by 13,647 donators. However, the project stalled after Winterkewl Games ran out of funds, and was eventually cancelled in July 2014. Backers were compensated with a copy of the game \"TUG\" developed by Nerd Kingdom, who also took hold of all developmental \"Yogventures!\" artwork and source code. Later in September of that year, backers were also given a copy of the game \"Landmark\" by Sony Online Entertainment.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Yogscast continued to grow rapidly in scale and popularity. In 2012, Brindley and Lane moved their operations out of their bedrooms in Reading and set up their first office at New Bond House in Bond Street, Bristol, dubbing it \"YogTowers\". Bristol was chosen for its infrastructure and transport links to London and within South West England for ease of access by the other members of their team. Their team continued to expand as other members of the Yogscast also moved in to the office to consolidate their operations in the shared space, and by July 2012 the Yogscast had more than a dozen members and staff in their office.\n\nIn June 2012, the Yogscast's main channel became the first channel in the United Kingdom to reach one billion views, and by June 2013, they had acquired five million subscribers. A variety of new friends and content creators such as Martyn Littlewood (\"InTheLittleWood\") and Hat Films also joined, marking the expansion of the Yogscast line-up beyond the original \"World of Warcraft\" group.\n\nThe Yogscast also began to hold regular public appearances in exhibitions and events throughout the United Kingdom where they would perform live shows and organise signings at events like the Insomnia Gaming Festival and the London Comic Con. In 2014, Brindley was named by \"The Sunday Times\" as one of Britain's 500 most influential people.\n\nCiting professional difficulties, the Yogscast left Maker Studios in 2016 and set up their own multi-channel network. The Yogscast also partnered with Microsoft to produce and manage the Xbox On channel on YouTube on behalf of Xbox UK. In addition, numerous content creators such as Matthew Meredith (\"Caff\"), BasicallyBea, Radderss, GeestarGames, Overwatch Central, and Vidiots also joined as part of the larger Yogscast network.\n\nIn May 2017, the Yogscast announced their first published game, \"Caveblazers\", developed by indie games developer Deadpan Games, as part of their foray into the game publishing business. \n\nIn July 2017, the Yogscast left their old headquarters at Bond Street and shifted to larger offices elsewhere in Bristol at the King William House in Queen Street, furnishing it with new amenities and upgraded equipment. Their new dedicated recording suites were also made available for rental by content producers to record and stream content. These new headquarters were named the Yogscast Studios, abbreviated as \"YogStudios\". Old studio equipment that was previously used by the Yogscast in the old offices was also given to the National Science and Media Museum to be used as part of a new museum development.\n\nIn November 2017, the Yogscast spun off Fourth Floor Creative, a creative agency specialising in influencer marketing within the video game industry headed by the Yogscast's chief revenue officer Rich Keith. They were formed as a separate entity with the stated intention of drawing upon their experience gathered from being in the Yogscast to work with companies and influencers outside of the Yogscast. They began with a team of two, but within their first year they had grown to encompass eighteen staff and conduct 140 marketing campaigns, most of them for non-Yogscast influencers.\n\n, the main Yogscast YouTube channel had 7,261,134 subscribers, 3,858,530,380 video views, and featured 33 other YouTube channels, while the Yogscast Twitch channel had 711,226 followers and a total of 86,995,275 video views.\n\nThe Yogscast's \"World of Warcraft\" videos were the first videos released by the Yogscast and largely took the form of parodic how-to videos. In July 2010, Brindley and Lane also began a series of play-through videos previewing the \"\" expansion pack's closed beta. Much of the Yogscast's initial popularity was due to media and blog coverage of these videos, with Joystiq (later becoming Engadget) regularly covering them as they were released.\n\nOne of the most popular video features of the Yogscast are their many \"Minecraft\" series. In December 2010, Brindley and Lane began an ongoing series of Let's Play-style \"Minecraft\" survival multiplayer videos. As the series progressed, however, it evolved into a semi-improvised comedy drama named \"Shadow of Israphel\". This new series led to a boom in the number of the group's YouTube subscribers, and was a major contributing factor in their rise to fame. The last installment, episode 42, was released in July 2012. The series has been put on hold since and has not been officially cancelled, although its indefinite hiatus remains a recurring joke amongst the Yogscast and their audience.\n\nSince then, they have also produced other narrative-driven series set in \"Minecraft\" such as \"YogLabs\", \"MoonQuest\", \"MarsQuest\", and \"JaffaQuest\" which have also attracted a large audience.\n\nAnother of Brindley and Lane's \"Minecraft\" series also involved them playing and bumbling through different player-made adventure maps, showcasing different maps made by the player community.\n\nIn June 2011, the Yogscast curated and released a collection of \"Minecraft\" mods which they named the \"Yogbox\".\n\nThe Yogscast have participated and produced their own large-scale live action series. The most common of these are the group's coverage of various gaming conventions, as well as RPG sessions and studio-promoted \"challenge\" videos. Other notable live action productions include a discussion with television and radio presenter Jonathan Ross, a mockumentary-style interview with actor Warwick Davis, an interview with Sigourney Weaver, a promotional project with Peter Molyneux, and a series of promotional live action sketches with Ubisoft, EA, Microsoft, the BBC, Lucasfilm, Disney, Universal Studios, Blizzard Entertainment, Sony, and some smaller indie developers.\n\nThe YoGPoD podcast was first released on 5 February 2009, and was intended to run alongside the group's YouTube video releases. Along with hosts Brindley and Lane, it often featured other members of their \"World of Warcraft\" guild, and was initially released with a proposed weekly schedule. Releases became more sporadic over time, however, to the point that \"YoGPoD 42: Strawnana\" came out on 4 July 2012, 5 months after its predecessor. A Halloween-themed YoGPoD, \"YoGPoD 44: Halloween Spack-2-cular\" was released on 28 October 2012, followed by \"YoGPoD 45: Halloween Spack-3-cular\" on 30 October 2013. Following the 2013 Halloween YoGPoD, there was a short run of releases from October 2015 to January 2016, before the schedule paused again.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, a surprise Halloween-themed episode entitled \"YoGPoD 51: Halloween Spack-10-cular\" was released to celebrate a decade of Yogscast content. Despite the name, it was recorded and released far from Halloween.\n\n\"The YoGPoD\" has no strict structure, but one of the more prominent features has Lane impersonate public figures that Brindley then \"interviews\". Brian Blessed, Warwick Davis and Elizabeth II are often parodied in this fashion.\n\nThe podcast reached #1 on the iTunes UK Podcasts chart on 4 July 2012, following the release of \"YoGPoD 42: Strawnana\".\n\nTriforce! is a gaming and general discussion podcast hosted by Brindley, Sips and Pyrion Flax (Edward Forsyth). It was first released on 23 March 2016. The podcast is posted alongside \"The YoGPoD\" and features the trio talking about various ideas centred on gaming but also expand to current topics and sporadic thoughts. The structure of the podcast is fairly loose, with an introduction, miscellaneous topics, a gaming section, a reading from Pyrion Flax's homebrew fiction \"Bodega\" (Episode 19 to Episode 43) and a Q and A from Twitter followers at the close of the podcast.\n\nIn 2017, the official \"YoGPoD\" YouTube channel was rebranded for the \"Triforce!\" podcast. A spinoff audiobook style series, titled \"Bodega\", was also debuted.\nThe series features excerpts of the regular \"Triforce!\", podcast where Pyrion Flax narrates his homebrew fanfiction.\n\nThe Yogscast Christmas Livestreams, which has been known as the Yogscast Jingle Jam since 2014, are a series of live streams that are shown over the course of December each year with the intention to raise money for charity.\n\nHigh Rollers D&D is a \"Dungeons & Dragons\" series being played on the Sunday Tabletop RPG Show, part of the daily Yogscast live stream schedule. The show is broadcast live on the Yogscast Twitch channel on Sundays from 5pm GMT. It is the largest Dungeons and Dragons livestream in Europe, and has partnered with Wizards of the Coast on several miniseries.\n\nYogscast Poker Nights is a series of poker games broadcast live on Twitch. In June 2018, the Yogscast signed a six-episode sponsorship deal with KamaGames to promote the latter's \"Pokerist\" app on the live stream.\n\nSince 2011, the Yogscast have organised a series of live streams every year in December to benefit charity. The idea began when fans would send presents to Brindley and Lane during the Christmas season, but they would instead insist that the money be donated to charity.\n\nThe Yogscast started their first charity live stream in December 2011 with the intention to raise money for Oxfam's Give a Goat programme to \"send locally-sourced and vaccinated goats to families living in poverty.\" As part of their charity drive, the group hosted a live stream on Twitch every day in December while viewers were encouraged to donate to the charity through the JustGiving fundraising portal. The live streams were broadcast out of the basement of the house which Brindley, Lane, and Rutherford shared at that time. A total of £66,040.30 was raised, exceeding the target goal of £60,000. For this achievement, the Yogscast was named JustGiving's Most Popular Fundraiser of 2012.\n\nFor the 2012 holiday season, the Yogscast team conducted another charity drive for Oxfam called Honeydew's Honey Drive, with a target of raising £60,000. Improvements over the previous year included upgrading to a dedicated streaming studio in their new offices in Bristol, as well as the participation of other YouTube content producers such as Hat Films, TotalBiscuit, and Athene. The charity drive was organised in aid of Oxfam's 'Plan Bee' to provide training and equipment for beekeeping in Ethiopia and '365 Emergency Fund' for the provision of urgent aid in emergencies. In addition to viewer donations through the JustGiving website, the team also raised additional proceeds through the sale of Twitch subscriptions, merchandise and Christmas songs to be donated to charity. As incentive to donate and at Lane's goading, Brindley agreed to cross-dress in a female bee costume should the charity drive reach their target goal. The goal was reached, and as promised, Brindley dressed up in the costume for Christmas Day. Honeydew's Honey Drive was successful in raising £240,568.25, more than triple that of the previous year. The group were again nominated for JustGiving's Most Popular Fundraiser of 2013, and received a Special Recognition Award at the JustGiving Awards ceremony.\n\nIn 2013, the Yogscast hosted the Dwarven Dairy Drive. Starting with this charity drive, donations were made through Humble Bundle instead of JustGiving, allowing donators to receive an assortment of games and in-game content as a token of appreciation. Donations were also distributed to benefit multiple charities rather than just one — in addition to Oxfam, the charity drive also supported GamesAid, Little People UK, Special Effect, and War Child. This charity drive attracted considerably more donators than previous livestreams, and raised a total of $1,159,746.33, triple that of the previous year.\n\nIn 2014, the Yogscast named their live stream charity drive the Yogscast Jingle Jam, which has remained the theme for every year's charity drive since then. The Yogscast Jingle Jam 2015 invited special guests to the live streams including fellow YouTube celebrities Adam Montoya (\"SeaNanners\"), Jordan Maron (\"CaptainSparklez\") and Toby Turner (\"Tobuscus\").\n\nSubsequent years saw the charity drive break records in quick succession. The Yogscast Jingle Jam 2016 surpassed the previous year's total within the first week of the charity drive, and raised a total of $2,577,801.17, more than double their previous record made in 2013. As with previous years, it featured a list of supported charities, but also enabled a new option for donators to pick another beneficiary from a list of thousands of charities.\n\nThe 2017 installment was even more successful, raising $500,000 in the first hour, $1 million in the first day, and breaking the 2016 record within the first week. It also made the Yogscast the sixth-most watched channel on Twitch during the first week of December, with a peak of 60,400 concurrent viewers. By the end of the month, they had broadcast more than 700 hours of live streaming and were watched by 2.5 million people, amounting to 6.8 million viewer-hours or 779 viewer-years watched. The charity drive raised a grand total of $5,245,772, again more than twice that of the previous year. For their work with Whale and Dolphin Conservation, the Yogscast was awarded the Celebrity Charity Champion for the Third Sector Awards in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, the Yogscast launched the Yogscast Jingle Jam 2018, adding Save the Children and Call of Duty Endowment to the list of featured charities.\n\nIn all, , a cumulative total of $11,632,005.53 has been donated from all of the Yogscast's Christmas charity drives.\n\n"}
{"id": "808844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=808844", "title": "Ultra Magnus", "text": "Ultra Magnus\n\nUltra Magnus is a fictional robot superhero character from the various \"Transformers\" storylines in the Transformers robot superhero franchise, generally appearing as a chief lieutenant of Optimus Prime.\n\nDespite his incredible fighting skills, courage and unmatched talent for improvisation on the battlefield, Ultra Magnus is most comfortable when carrying out orders, and is not naturally at ease if the Autobot Matrix of Leadership should ever find itself placed upon him.\n\nIn Ultra Magnus' mind, he is a commander of the wreckers, and his reluctance to change that will see to it that he expends all options before accepting the idea that he is required to lead. As a leader, Magnus would be resolute, fair and courageous, ever-ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good of his companions and mission, and unyielding in preparation for protection of those under his command. Although not interested in overall command, Ultra Magnus was the City Commander for Autobot City in \"\", and his toy also featured him in the role of City Commander (a title also held by his original opposite number, the Decepticon leader Galvatron), which indicates that he at least is willing to accept a leadership role in a smaller capacity rather than as supreme commander, a role filled by both Optimus Prime and later Rodimus Prime.\n\nUltra Magnus is armed with missile launchers capable of hitting a target 30 miles away, and transforms into a car carrier able to transport his fellow Autobot troops.\n\nUltra Magnus makes his first appearance in Japan in the Japan-exclusive \"\". \"Scramble City\" never made it to the U.S.A. so most Americans didn't see him until \"\".\nUltra Magnus made his first continuity appearance in the Earth year 2005 as commander of Autobot City on Earth. Leading the defense of the city when it came under Decepticon attack, Magnus suddenly found himself commanding the entire Autobot army when Optimus Prime died after his epic fight with Megatron and passed the Matrix of Leadership to him despite his protestations. Subsequently, in a confrontation with the Decepticons on the planet of Junk, Magnus was blown apart and lost the Matrix to Galvatron, but was reassembled and reactivated by the Junkions. When Hot Rod recovered the Matrix from Galvatron and became Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus decided to step down as leader to give the role to Rodimus, but continued to act as his friend and advisor, keeping him on the straight and narrow and always reassuring him, attempting to urge him out of the shadow of Optimus Prime.\nMagnus had his share of personal adventures in 2006, such as when he was captured by a Quintesson scientist for study, along with the Wreck-Gar, Marissa Faireborn and Cyclonus; he and Cyclonus developed a mutual, grudging respect for each other as warriors during the ensuing events, as they worked together to escape a negative universe on the other side of a black hole.\n\nMagnus would later fall afoul of an unrepentant Cyclonus when he went to the aid of Wheelie and Daniel Witwicky when they stumbled into trouble while attempting to discover Magnus's birthday. In addition to these and other battles with Cyclonus, Magnus also found himself facing Galvatron on several occasions - the deranged Decepticon would even occasionally focus his rage more upon Magnus than Rodimus Prime; such a notion is not inappropriate, since Magnus was the being he was originally dispatched to destroy, and who thwarted him in varying ways, certainly enough to permanently earn the deranged Galvatron's ire.\n\nIn the Episode \"Only Human\", Ultra Magnus, Springer, Rodimus, and Arcee found their minds transferred into human-mimicking \"synthoid\" bodies by the human crime lord Victor Drath.\n\nIn Episode 78, \"Madman's Paradise\", Spike Witwicky and his wife Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. Grimlock followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the Red Wizard's side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the Golden One. Ultra Magnus, Blaster, Eject, Rewind, Ramhorn, and Steeljaw followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel are returned to Cybertron.\n\nWhen the galaxy became infected by the Hate Plague, Ultra Magnus was one of the first victims, and his calm, restrained soldier attitude was stripped away, leaving behind a raving, battle-hungry maniac who had particular interest in destroying Rodimus Prime. After the plague was cured by the resurrected Optimus Prime, Magnus subsequently led the defense of Cybertron during the battle for the power of the Plasma Energy Chamber in 2007.\n\nIn \"\", Ultra Magnus was voiced by Robert Stack. For the subsequent episodes of the animated series, he was voiced by Jack Angel, who had previously portrayed characters such as Astrotrain, Ramjet, and Omega Supreme. His character was most familiar for uttering the line \"I can't deal with that now\" whenever things got bad.\n\nAlthough the American animated series ended with the three-parter \"The Rebirth\" storyline, it was decided in Japan to continue production of new episodes; to that end, \"The Rebirth\" was discarded, and in its place, a new 35-episode series, \"\" was created.\n\nEarlier Japanese-exclusive media such as \"\" and TV Magazine's manga stories had previously detailed Ultra Magnus's earlier arrival on Earth and his role in the creation of Metroplex. In \"Headmasters\", Magnus was a supporting character for the early part of the series, once again in charge of Autobot City on Earth, taking a proactive role in the defense of the planet against the Decepticons when they re-emerged in 2011. During the opening skirmish of the renewed conflict, Magnus crossed swords with the large and powerful Decepticon ninja, Sixshot, who went on to lead the villains' earth-based forces, leading to a smoldering enmity between the two. Their rivalry eventually came to a conclusive end when Sixshot and Magnus engaged in a one-on-one duel. Magnus was no match for the multiple powers of Sixshot's numerous transformations, and was felled by his seventh, secret mode. With his dying gasp, Magnus told the Autobots to protect the Earth. At Metroplex's request, the Autobots buried Magnus on Earth.\n\nWhen Ultra Magnus died, his body did not turn white/grey, like all other Transformers who had died in the past (including those in the \"Headmasters\" series). Whether this is due to his body being composed of external armour over his truck-cab exoskeleton (like the original toy and Dreamwave comic) or simply because of animator error is open to fan-interpretation.\n\nAs \"The Headmasters\" cartoon is set in alternative \"Japanese continuity\" which officially doesn't belong to original American series that ended with 4th season in three-piece episode titled \"The Rebirth\", Ultra Magnus did not die in scope of original continuity.\n\nUltra Magnus did not appear in Marvel Comics' American \"Transformers\" comic book series outside of a comic book adaptation of a third-season episode of the animated \"Transformers\" series. However, its sister title in the U.K. \"did\" feature in the character extensively in its own original stories (particularly issues in and around the 100 mark); the American stories made no use of the new cast introduced in \"\", and U.K. writer Simon Furman pounced on the opportunity to use them in his own ways. Whereas all the other movie characters who appeared in the stories — such as Galvatron, Hot Rod and Kup — appeared via the use of time travel, it was Ultra Magnus's present-day self who played a key role in many of the important UK storylines. As per the original intent of his character and toy, Magnus was presented as the arch-foe of Galvatron.\n\nUltra Magnus was first introduced — and, debatably, first \"constructed\" — in the Earth year 1986, as the underground Autobot resistance on Cybertron prepared to execute their daring \"Operation: Volcano\" plan, which would involve luring the Decepticons' crack troops to one location where Magnus and the Autobot commando squad, the Wreckers, would finish them off. However, when the Matrix Flame (a flame denoting the activity of the robot containing the Creation Matrix) suddenly extinguished, Magnus was dispatched to Earth to discover what had happened to Optimus Prime.\n\nWith time nipping at his heels, the launch of Operation: Volcano going ahead whether he returned or not, Magnus allied himself with the Earth Autobots and worked to discover what had caused Optimus Prime, Prowl and Ratchet to vanish from the middle of the Autobot base, while the other Autobots battled the threat posed by Galvatron, a Decepticon who had travelled back in time from the future. The appearance of three more Autobots from the future, Hot Rod, Kup and Blurr, gave Magnus his answer: the mass-displacement effect yielded by Galvatron's time travel had shunted Prime and the others into the limbo between dimensions. Ultra Magnus then engaged Galvatron in battle as Kup and the others set up a scheme to force Galvatron back into the future, and even though Magnus was severely beaten by the more-powerful Decepticon, the plan succeeded and the future Decepticon returned to his own time. Magnus, however, was too late to return for Operation: Volcano, but the plan was nullified when the intended Decepticon victims were called away by Megatron, but a parting shot took the life of the Wreckers' leader, Impactor.\n\nIn 1987, when Optimus Prime was transported to Cybertron, Ultra Magnus and the Wreckers nearly killed him due to deliberate Decepticon misinformation that claimed he was a masquerading Decepticon agent which was disproved by Emirate Xaaron. Prime and Magnus then fought side-by-side on Cybertron for a period, until Ratbat cleverly deployed the Spacebridge to displace Magnus, Prime, and an insane Megatron to Earth. As Magnus adjusted to his temporary new home, he stumbled across Galvatron, who had returned from the future with a new scheme to harness the power of the Earth's core. Continuing their deeply bitter feud, Galvatron battled Ultra Magnus with help from the future Autobots, but in the end, the two leaders were entombed in volcanic lava.\n\nGalvatron was eventually able to effect his own release, and the Sparkler Mini-Bots (also known as the Sparkabots) extricated Ultra Magnus, who, by this stage, having suffered repeated defeats at Galvatron's hands, had developed a paralysing fear of confronting the Decepticon. Galvatron, to his own amusement, set about pulverizing the Sparklers, with the intention of further tormenting the temporarily quiescent Ultra Magnus. With his comrades' lives at risk, Magnus overcame his demons to defeat Galvatron.\n\nThe present-day Ultra Magnus would not have to face Galvatron again, but more terrifying threats were in store when he and the Sparklers returned to Cybertron and discovered that the city of Kalis had been overridden by hordes of zombie Transformers, reactivated by the renegade Autobot mad scientist, Flame. Ultra Magnus joined forces with the Wreckers and their allies to defeat Flame's plan to fire Cybertron's subterranean planetary engines and complete Megatron's ancient plan to turn the world into a huge battleship.\n\nSoon after, Magnus found himself involved in a grotesque illegal gladiatorial game, and although he defeated his monstrous opponent and delivered a stirring speech to the crowd decrying their spectation of such a sport, his words failed to get through.\n\nAlthough that was the last appearance of the present-day Ultra Magnus, the future version of Ultra Magnus (from the same era as Rodimus Prime) made further appearances. He was present when Rodimus Prime, Kup, and Blurr went back in time to confront Galvatron and Death's Head, stating his doubts about the mission, teamed up with Soundwave's Decepticons to defeat the Quintessons, and was part of Rodimus Prime's team in the Time Wars. He did not get his final confrontation with Galvatron, however, as Galvatron used Decepticon leader Scorponok as a living shield against Magnus' fire, prompting Scorponok's troops to attack him.\n\nThe U.K. \"Transformers\" continuity records that Magnus and the other future Autobots returned find to their own time-stream changed to a different, darker future, where Galvatron was alive and ruling most of Cybertron.\n\nUltra Magnus appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book \"The Lost Treasure of Cybertron\" by Marvel Books.\n\nUltra Magnus appeared in the 1986 story book \"Galvatron's Air Attack\" by Ladybird Books.\n\nUltra Magnus appeared in the 1986 Ladybird Books story \"Decepticon Hideout\" by John Grant.\n\nUltra Magnus from Dreamwave Productions' 21st century re-imagining of the Generation One universe took the opportunity to indulge two contentious aspects of Ultra Magnus previously resigned to fan speculation: here, he was revealed to be Optimus Prime's \"brother\" in the Dreamwave continuity, and also hinted to be Dion, a childhood friend of Optimus Prime from the animated series, due to the name of a strike force he led.\n\nMagnus first chronological appearance was in \"The War Within: Age of Wrath\" miniseries, where he had united the splintered Autobot factions such as the Wreckers and Lightning Strike Coalition (who had struck out on their own following Optimus Prime and Megatron's disappearance in a Space Bridge accident) and managed to negotiate a settlement with the Decepticons and Ultracons. The plan was derailed first by Starscream's Predacons and then by Megatron's return with an army of Seeker clones, with Grimlock taking a fatal shot meant for Magnus. After being beaten into submission by Megatron, Magnus was amongst those captured by the Decepticons. The closure of Dreamwave prevented the completion of the series.\n\nFollowing the disappearance of Optimus Prime and Megatron's troops four million years ago, Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus took fluctuating joint leadership of the Autobots, until Maximus abandoned the war.\n\nUltra Magnus appeared in as a major character in Dreamwave Productions \"Micromasters\" mini-series. In issue #1, \"Destined For Nothing\", Countdown and Groundshaker return from space to find the Autobot base largely abandoned. The first Autobots they encounter, Topspin and Twin Twist seem surprised to see them, and more surprised that Optimus Prime isn't with them. Countdown and Groundshaker are equally surprised that Optimus has not returned to Cybertron before they did. Countdown confronts Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus and informs them that Operation: Containment, an attempt to prevent the Decepticon threat from spreading beyond Cybertron, has failed. Countdown explains that the Decepticon Skystalker and his forces ravaged the peaceful planet, Paradron, and that the Autobots need to mount an intergalactic patrol force to prevent the same fate from befalling other worlds. Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus disagree, stating that Autobot forces are already underpowered and spread thin as it is. Groundshaker interrupts, belligerently demanding the Autobot command take action, before he is pulled from the room by Countdown. As Countdown and Groundshaker leave the command center, they overhear Big Daddy and his patrol griping about the day's events, which interests Countdown greatly. Big Daddy and company then confront Magnus and Maximus, upset that Crunch lost his life defending Roadbuster. The argument grows more heated, before Fortress Maximus orders the Hot Rod Patrol to turn in their weapons and dismisses them.\n\n100,000 years later, the Transformers, their war, and the entire planet of Cybertron itself ground to a halt when the world's energy supplies completely ran out, sending Cybertron into a period of reconstructive hibernation, during which the entire population was sent into stasis.\n\nThree thousand years ago, Shockwave was the first Transformer to be reactivated, and set about restoring the planet and its populace, quietly working towards his own sinister ends. Unifying the Autobot and Decepticon factions, he appointed Ultra Magnus as his second-in-command, who led the attack on the Ark when they travelled to Earth and arrested Optimus Prime and Megatron as war criminals. (In reference to the theory that Ultra Magnus was formerly Dion, the name of the team Ultra Magnus led to take the Autobots into custody was team Dion.)\n\nWhen Optimus Prime then led a rebel attack on Iacon, Shockwave turned on Magnus, apparently deactivating him. Ultra Magnus survived, however, and his inner robot emerged from his damaged larger form, teaming with Prime to stop Shockwave's plan to use the Matrix to access Vector Sigma.\n\nUltra Magnus came away from the encounter with less damage than Prime, and soon had his systems repaired. He was seen in his familiar blue outer shell assisting Prowl when the burden of leadership threatened to become too much for him, and headed a mission to one of Cybertron's moons to fortify it against attack. Dreamwave's bankruptcy and subsequent closure, however, meant that any further stories of Ultra Magnus went untold.\n\nThe \"Transformers: Classics\" story printed by Fun Publications is set in a continuation of the Marvel Comics Transformers series, ignoring the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics. Since Ultra Magnus only appeared in the U.K. comics (baring the movie adaption), the Ultra Magnus appearing in these stories is a new character.\n\nIn Transformers: Timelines volume 2 #2, \"Games of Deception\" this series Ultra Magnus leads a team of Autobots, which includes Elita One, Huffer, Snarl, Springer, , Swoop and Tryanotron in pursuit of the Decepticon Bug Bite and his forces to Earth. Once on Earth they contact Grimlock to aid them.\n\nIn the \"Beast Wars Shattered Glass\" story arc the G1 Ultra Magnus travels to Shattered Glass prehistoric Earth with Prowl, Ironhide, Silverbolt, and Grimlock. Adopting a wooly mammoth beast mode in order to survive the raw Energon radiation, he adopts the identity \"Ultra Mammoth\", which he attributes to Grimlock. With their home universe destroyed, Mammoth and his team did battle with Megatron's force of Decepticons, who had adopted alternative means of survival. Joined by an alternate version of Depth Charge, the former Autobots took on a new identity as Maximals. After a number of battles with Megatron's similarly renamed Predacons, Ultra Magnus gained possession of the Origin Matrix.\n\nUltra Mammoth and his comrades eventually made their way to the present of the Shattered Glass Universe, their own universe having been destroyed by the actions of Magnus' Shattered Glass counterpart. While most of his crew chose to take on normal Cybertronian forms, Ultra Mammoth retained his beast form, and through the heroic Galvatron learned that the Matrix he carried was a component of the Star Saber. He resolved to keep it until Nexus Prime returned, only to run afoul of his alternate self and engage him in a battle. The conflict was soon interrupted by Nexus Prime's arrival, and after sending the evil Magnus to another universe Nexus reclaimed the Matrix and resolved to use the Star Saber and Terminus Blade-the latter being reclaimed from Magnus-to prevent any other universes from suffering the same fate as Ultra Mammoth's.\n\nUltra Magnus would make another appearance in the second G. I Joe vs. the Transformers crossover from Devil's Due Publishing, again as one of the leaders of the Autobot resistance to Shockwave. He and Perceptor saved a group of G. I Joes and Cobras from Shockwave's Decepticons, erecting a forcefield to protect them while they worked to repair the damage caused by Teletran-3, powered by Magnus' own strength. The shield eventually gave out and Magnus was captured. However, they were all rescued when the Dinobots returned and routed Shockwave's forces.\n\nHe reappeared in the third crossover as part of the combined Autobot/G. I Joe force attempting to rescue Optimus Prime, and even held off Trypticon single-handedly at one point. In the fourth crossover, Magnus was left in charge of the Autobot forces on Cybertron when Optimus Prime journeyed to Earth.\n\nIn issue #3 of \"\", a white colored Transformer (resembling Magnus' Titanium War Within toy) is seen from behind at the funeral of Bumper and Fastback. Whether this is actually Magnus is unclear.\n\nIn the new IDW Publishing continuity Magnus is a feared Autobot law enforcement officer. Magnus tracked down all those who broke the accords - be they Autobot or Decepticon. After arresting the Decepticon weapons dealer Swindle, the unscrupulous Decepticon managed to talk his way out of it by offering Magnus an even more tempting prize - the whereabouts of Scorponok. Despite his own personal reservations about doing so, Magnus agreed (planting a tracker on Swindle in the process) and tracked Scorponok down on the planet Nebulos. There he discovered the Decepticon's plan - upgrading several of the Nebulans with Transformer technology. Magnus soon found Scorponok himself, and lost the subsequent fight. However, a shot from Scorponok's beast mode seemingly killed Scorponok's already upgraded partner Lord Zarak. Magnus managed to shoot Scorponok in the head, but the Decepticon escaped again. Much later, after apprehending Swindle (again), the Decepticon again attempted to deal his way out. He reappeared briefly again in the \"Spotlight\" issue on Arcee, where he tracked down, battled and defeated the deranged Arcee, not realising that the facility he was in was actually being used by Jhiaxus for the expansion.\n\nUltra Magnus also appears in the IDW ongoing series. He comes to Earth some three years after the events of the \"All Hail Megatron\" series, once again tracking Swindle. As acting Autobot commander, Bumblebee attempts to persuade Ultra Magnus to abandon his law enforcement duties and take up the fight against the Decepticons that still remained on Earth.\n\nIn \"The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye\", Ultra Magnus serves as second-in-command of the starship \"Lost Light\" under the command of Rodimus. Ultra Magnus' obsession with rules often serve as comic relief in the series. However, coping with the end of the Great War causes Magnus to suffer a mental breakdown. It is then revealed that Ultra Magnus is an identity partially created by Chief Justice Tyrest; when the original Ultra Magnus died, Tyrest created a suit replicating Magnus' armor for an Autobot to wear, thus continuing the identity of Ultra Magnus to serve as the duly appointed enforcer of the Tyrest Accord long after the original's death. The current holder of the Magnus Armor is Minimus Ambus, which is revealed in the \"Remain In Light\" story arc. In the second season of \"More Than Meets the Eye\", Minimus Ambus learns to grow more comfortable outside of the Magnus Armor, and is exiled from the \"Lost Light\" along with any other Autobots who befriended the defected Megatron.\n\nIn the altered chronology of the \"Binaltech\" saga, Optimus Prime is still alive, having never had the final showdown with Megatron at the Battle of Autobot City. When Ravage arranges for the Autobots to be alone in the battle against the threat of Unicron, Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus team up to take on the planet-eater, having discovered that the Matrix is the key to Unicron's destruction. Within Unicron's body, Optimus Prime is severely damaged, and although not fatally, he passes the Matrix to Ultra Magnus to complete the mission. Ultra Magnus sheds his outer armor and proceeds on, successfully opening the Matrix and initiating the destruction of Unicron. Magnus and Prime escape the exploding giant.\n\nUltra Magnus is the main character in the Famicom video game \"\". The game is a typical side-scroller in which he battles Decepticons. This game has been poorly received.\n\nUltra Magnus appears among the Transformers box art on the back of larger third year Transformers toys. He is flying in robot mode without his armor. For many years this was his only depiction in non-armored mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first new character to bear the name of Ultra Magnus since the Generation 1 original was known as God Magnus in the Japanese 2000 line, \"Transformers: Car Robots\". God Magnus owed his name and alternate mode to Ultra Magnus (and also to Godbomber, an earlier character who disassembled to form armor for his Prime-styled partner), so when the series was translated for release in the West in 2001 as \"\", the name change was obvious, and Ultra Magnus returned to TV screens for the first time since the G1 series. Later, a smaller \"Spy Changer\" figure of Magnus, unique to \"Robots in Disguise,\" was released\n\nUltra Magnus transforms into a car carrier capable of transporting other Autobots such as the Autobot Brothers. In addition to his remarkable strength and fighting ability, he is armed with the \"Blue Bolts\" - a variable-configuration weapon of immense destructive power. His weapon can either fire as a rapid fire gun or as a high powered laser. His back-mounted jetpack allows for periods of short flight. In addition to these new abilities, for the first time, was able to combine with Optimus Prime (Robots In Disguise toyline) forming Omega Prime.\n\nAs a nod to their origins in \"Generation 1\" Ultra Magnus and Optimus Prime (\"Fire Convoy\" in Japan) were created at the same time by Alpha Trion, but when Prime was chosen to carry the Matrix by Vector Sigma, Magnus felt passed over, jealous and was left carrying a hatred against his brother. That grudge eventually exploded into violence when he arrived on Earth with the intention of taking what he believed was rightfully his - by force, if necessary. Before meeting up with Optimus, Magnus fought and easily defeated the Decepticons on his own (not even Ruination could beat him). When he met Optimus, he offered Magnus a chance to join him, but Magnus outright refused and attacked him. Severely injuring Prime, who refused to fight back, Magnus tracked him to a desert island, where he pretended to offer him the hand of friendship, only to attempt to absorb the Matrix for himself, forcing the brothers into the combined form of Omega Prime \"(God Fire Convoy)\". Through this link, Magnus was also able to channel the power of the Matrix, which he used to supercharge the Autobot Brothers into newly coloured forms. Although Magnus remained a free agent, refusing to take orders from his brother, his animosity dwindled and he frequently helped the Autobots by combining with Prime to battle the Predacons and Decepticons. As Omega Prime, they faced Galvatron together at the Earth's core and defeated him once and for all.\n\nNote that in \"Car Robots\", there is not one singular Matrix, but multiple ones, each held by a high-ranking Autobot. Magnus already possesses a Matrix, and simply seeks to steal the power of Prime's to increase his own (the overspill resulting in the supercharging of the Autobot Brothers).\n\nThe character of also made one appearance in Dreamwave Productions' Summer Special in a story presented as being in continuity with the animated series, which pitted him against Scourge, as both denied and debated their Autobot heritage and relation to Optimus Prime. No further \"RiD\" stories were published by Dreamwave before their closure, as \"Beast Wars\" claimed victory over \"RiD\" in a poll to choose the next mini-series.\n\nThree versions of Ultra Magnus would appear in the BotCon exclusive \"\" storyline.\n\nAlthough the \"Robots in Disguise\" incarnation of Ultra Magnus did not return to TV screens, his toy was re-released on the shelves of Sam's Club in 2003's parallel-universe-spanning \"\" line, slightly redecoed with bluish-black parts in place of his dark blue ones. Featured in the pages of the \"Transformers: Universe\" comic book exclusive to the Official Transformers Collectors Convention, this character was established to the \"RiD\" Magnus, who, along with Optimus Prime, was plucked from his home universe at a point after the conclusion of \"Robots in Disguise\" to become part of a battle between armies gathered from across space and time by Unicron and Primus. Led by Optimus Primal into the final battle, the combatants found their conflict halted when Unicron began to crumble beneath them. Primal's team gathered together to escape through a portal, but when Magnus and Prime passed through, they did not find themselves where they expected...\n\nIn another universe, an Autobot bearing a great physical resemblance to Ultra Magnus called Ultra Trion appeared, being killed by the Decepticon leader Megazarak. According to series artist Dan Khanna in a message board response, Ultra Trion was meant to be an alternate universe counterpart to Ultra Magnus, who acted as Alpha Trion's successor until his demise. Ultra Trion was later retconned into being a version Ultra Magnus, who merged with a dying Alpha Trion in an alternate future version of a \"Robot in Disguise\" universe, where Cybertron is ruled by Megazarak and the Autobots are near-extinct.\n\nYet another version of Ultra Magnus appeared, in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play, and this character was seemingly yet another new Ultra Magnus taken from a parallel dimension to that of the \"Robots in Disguise\" fiction. The toy for this version of Ultra Magnus is a recolor of the \"Robots in Disguise\" toy and came packaged with Ironhide. This package was a Walmart store exclusive in 2004. The Voice Actor Drama was written for OFTCC 2004 by Simon Furman, set after the events in the comics. Spy Changers Optimus Prime, Prowl, Ultra Magnus and Ironhide were among those taken from their world via teleportation beam by Unicron and his Decepticon minions. The Autobot forces opposing Unicron attempted to deflect the beam, which left them all trapped on an uninhabited ice-world. The Autobot forces teamed up to overcome the Decepticons led by Reptilion. Presumably the Autobots were then returned to their own worlds.\n\nPrime and Magnus's toys were released once more in 2005's \"\" - exclusively to Costco, with Magnus's toy remaining unchanged from his \"Universe\" redeco - with bios which once again presented them to be the same characters from \"RiD\" and \"Universe\". It was within the pages of the \"Cybertron\" comic available through the Official Transformers Collectors Club that the story was continued, as the portal through which Magnus and Prime had vanished in \"Universe\" transported them into the \"Cybertron\" universe; there, a black hole left in the wake of Unicron's destruction in that universe had caused multiversal ripples which had resulted in the collapse of Unicron in the \"Universe\" timeline the brothers had just departed, and materialized on Cybertron...\n\nIn the \"Cybertron\" universe, Cybertron was under attack by two of the Heralds of Unicron, Nemesis Prime and Ramjet. They had already damaged Alpha Trion, and while Ramjet engaged Vector Prime in a duel high above Cybertron, Nemesis Prime got past Sentinel Maximus and revealed his plan - he was going to use the Dead Matrix, a corrupted version of the Matrix of Leadership, to drain the lifeforce of Primus and use it to revive Unicron (destroyed in a black hole at the conclusion of ). But he was confronted by the most unexpected foe of all - Omega Prime. Omega then split into Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus, and while Prime attended to Primus, Magnus defeated Nemesis Prime. Informing Sentinel Maximus of what went on, they then stored the Dead Matrix away forever, unaware they were being observed by Soundwave.\n\nSoundwave subsequently stole the Dead Matrix and threw it into the black hole, reviving Unicron, who took a nearby planet as his new body. Unicron attacked Cybertron again in the midst of a Mini-Con civil war, duelling with Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime. The battle was inconclusive, but Unicron was driven away by Primus himself. The brothers recovered - only to receive Optimus Prime, bearing word of Vector Prime's death in battle. Prime and Magnus were subsequently seen planning the hunt for Unicron.\n\nA God Magnus Leader Class figure was released in 2000, that transforms from car carrier to robot. In car carrier mode, he can hold up to three Deluxe-sized cars (most notably the Car Brothers from the \"Car Robots\" series. His main weapon fires spring-loaded missiles and can fold into three different configurations. This battery-operated figure features truck horn sounds, weapons sound effects and voice samples of God Magnus. Combines with Fire Convoy (sold separately) to form God Fire Convoy. Once combined, God Fire Convoy emits different sound effects and voice clips (\"\"Chou-Kyoudai Gattai!\" God Fire Convoy!\" and \"God Fire!\"). A Toys \"R\" Us Japan exclusive gift set was offered in late 2000, featuring God Magnus and Super Fire Convoy packaged with the God Sword (a repaint of the sword from the Japanese G1 Fortress Maximus).\n\nIts American counterpart, \"Robots in Disguise\" Leader Ultra Magnus, was originally released in 2001. It is similar to the Japanese release, only with the Japanese voice replaced with the English voice (with the phrase, \"Ultra Magnus, Transform!\"). Autobot emblems have been placed on the side panels in this version. Much like the Japanese version, this figure combines with Optimus Prime's normal robot mode to form Omega Prime, with a different set of voice and sound clips (\"Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Combine!\" and \"Omega Fire!\").\n\nA \"Robots in Disguise\" Spy Changer Ultra Magnus was released in 2002. The Spy Changer of Ultra Magnus was repainted as the Dairycon 2002 exclusive figure Campaign Car.\n\nIt was in the second installment of the Unicron trilogy, \"\", that the Overload toy was repainted into Ultra Magnus's blue, white and red colors and released in the west under the name \"Ultra Magnus\" in a limited production run.\n\nThe \"Energon\" version of Ultra Magnus, like all the recolorations of Armada toys featured in the early stages of the toyline, never appeared in the TV show, or the Dreamwave comic.\n\nAlthough \"Transformers: Cybertron\", the third installment of the \"Unicron Trilogy\" timeline, saw \"Robots in Disguise\" Magnus enter its timeline, it was not without its own characters bearing the name. The \"\" toyline was the first to re-use Magnus' name, although not in the west - in Japan, where the character known as Overload in English was named Ultra Magnus. It was not an ill-fitting name, as the first, unpainted pictures of the toy had caused speculation that it was intended to \"be\" a new version of Magnus, bearing as it does his stylistic shoulder design.\n\nUltra Magnus appeared in the text story from Fun Publications called \"\". This story explained where he was during the events of the \"Cybertron\" story. Ultra Magnus is commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. He also serves as captain of the Iron Hope which was crewed by Bonecrusher, Grimlock, Ironhide, Knock Out, Overcast, Prowl, Quickstrike, RipTide, Skyblast, Smokescreen, Swoop, Wreckage and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team.\n\n\"Ask Vector Prime\" later revealed that Ultra Magnus previous possessed a form similar to Optimus Prime's, but that he was rebuilt using the schematics of Overload after being badly damaged in battle with Treadshot.\n\nThis version of Ultra Magnus is a recolor of \"Armada\" Overload. It was released in 2004 and came with a recolor of the \"Armada\" Space Mini-Con team. The \"Transformers: Universe\" white and blue repaint of \"Armada\" Optimus Prime designated Ultra Magnus was also incorporated into this version of the character.\nIn 2007, \"USA Today\" polled people as to which Transformer they want to appear in the next Transformers film. Ultra Magnus came in tied for fourth with Shockwave. Ultra Magnus was considered to appear in \"\", before the role was given to Sentinel Prime. The design that was intended to be used for the character is seen briefly during the film's prologue, repurposed as the design of a generic deceased Autobot. To date it is unknown if Ultra Magnus will appear in any future movies.\n\nIn the Cartoon Network series \"Transformers Animated\", Ultra Magnus serves as the Autobot commander on Cybertron and Optimus Prime's superior and father figure, he believes Optimus has potential to be a born leader, despite being kicked out of Autobot Academy. His head resembles that of the Generation 1 character's super robot mode. He wields a large war hammer called the Magnus Hammer, which can discharge massive amounts of electricity and command lightning bolts. He turns into an 8-wheeled missile launcher truck. In doing Ultra Magnus' voice, Jeff Bennett emulates the voice of Robert Stack, who voiced Magnus in \"\".\n\nUltra Magnus is the incumbent Supreme Commander of the Autobots, and led his faction through the Great War with the Decepticons. During the war, Ultra Magnus commissioned Project Omega as a desperate measure to defeat the Decepticons, despite his regret that the Autobots were creating a series of living doomsday weapons. After Ultra Magnus led the Autobots to victory, the Decepticons were exiled from Cybertron, leaving the planet at peace. Ultra Magnus later regretfully expelled Optimus from the Autobot Elite Guard after he assumed responsibility for the apparent death of Elita-1. However, due to liking Optimus and suspecting that Sentinel was not telling the whole truth of the incident, he promoted him to Optimus Prime and gave him command of the stasis-locked Omega Supreme.\n\nIn the pilot of \"Transformers Animated\" Ultra Magnus learned that's crew had discovered the Allspark and ordered them to stay put until it could be retrieved. He also told Prime not to try to be a hero; unfortunately Optimus disobeyed and had the ship take off anyway, stating that \"\"Ultra Magnus\" wasn't carrying the Allspark\". Ultra Magnus comes to Earth personally in the episode \"The Elite Guard\" with his fellow Cybertron Elite Guard members Sentinel Prime and Jazz. He took on an Earth-vehicle mode. After the battle against some out-of-control police droids and a fragment of the Allspark was retrieved, Ultra Magnus began to respect Optimus Prime as a commander and told Sentinel Prime that he can learn a thing or two from him. During \"Mission Accomplished\", he informs Optimus and his crew to pack up and get ready to head back to Cybertron, believing that Optimus is emboldening the Decepticons with his shaky claims of Megatron's return. Ultra Magnus is convinced of the Decepticon presence on Earth by a battle with Starscream, and departs to deal with Decepticon attacks on Autobot space bridges, entrusting Optimus' crew with the protection of Earth.\n\nIn \"TransWarped\", Ultra Magnus realizes that the uprisings were too organized and deduced that Cybertron may have a double agent. He then sends Sentinel and Jazz to Earth to get an update from the Earthbound Autobots. In \"Where Is Thy Sting?\", Longarm Prime (Shockwave) is outed as the traitor, and Magnus is savagely attacked and barely able to reveal the identity of his attacker to Ironhide. According to in \"Decepticon Air,\" Ultra Magnus is currently on 'spark-support.' By this time, Sentinel Prime takes over as the new Magnus. In \"This Is Why I Hate Machines,\" the attack by Shockwave and the image of Ultra Magnus in the infirmary are used as propaganda in Sentinel's fanatical government policies. While on spark-support, Ultra Magnus is nearly destroyed by his own hammer when Shockwave attacks the infirmary, but is saved by Ratchet, who takes the hammer with him to Earth and promises to return it once Ultra Magnus recovers.\n\nFor a time, Ultra Magnus's ultimate fate was not revealed before the end of the series, but Derrick J. Wyatt stated that if a fourth season of the show was made, Magnus was to have died from his injuries.\n\nThe first toy for this version of Ultra Magnus was released in 2008 and transformed from a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck to robot. He came with a spring-loaded Magnus Hammer and is armed with numerous guns mounted on his shoulders. The figure emits two sound effects and phrases as voiced by Jeff Bennett. This toy was later recolored in a green, black, and orange theme, in a homage to the \"Generation 1\" robot superhero Roadbuster. The version released in Japan in 2010 had metallic paint and Japanese voice clips.\n\nUltra Magnus is the leader of the Wreckers, and Optimus Prime's second-in-command. Like the \"Animated\" version of the character, this Ultra Magnus carries a hammer, in actuality a depleted Forge of Solus Prime.\n\nUltra Magnus appears in the third season of \"\", entitled \"Beast Hunters\". He is revealed to be Optimus Prime's second-in-command, who survived the war for Cybertron. He is a by-the-book commander, requesting that the subordinate Autobots, with the exception of Ratchet, and even the humans address him as \"sir\".\n\nThough he is not mentioned by name prior to his arrival, his image-or a very similar one-appeared when the amnesiac Optimus Prime, then going by Orion Pax, looked up Optimus Prime in the Decepticon database. Ultra Magnus himself arrives on Earth in \"Scattered\" and meets with Arcee and Jack. Like Wheeljack, he has his own personal vessel, though his is a good deal larger.\n\nIn \"Prey,\" Ultra Magnus tells Jack and Arcee that he detected five Autobot life signatures that remained online. Ultra Magnus also mentioned that he had encountered other Autobots during his travels, many of which perished in Decepticon attacks. Later, he helps Bulkhead, Wheeljack and Miko escape from the Predacon named Predaking before finding Ratchet, Bumblebee and Raf at the Harbinger and meeting Agent Fowler and June Darby. Ultra Magnus decides that the Autobots must defeat Megatron once and for all and, after taking command, offers them a large supply of weapons to assist in the fight.\n\nIn \"Rebellion\", Ultra Magnus leads the assault on Darkmount, where Predaking is sent through a Ground Bridge into the Antarctic. Magnus goes after Megatron, but is defeated. Before the Autobots can be executed, a recently repaired Optimus Prime arrives and destroys Darkmount. Later, Magnus gives Optimus command over the Autobots again.\n\nIn \"Project Predacon\", Ultra Magnus' vehicle form is revealed, a nearly all-blue version of Optimus' semi-truck form. It is also revealed that he was put in charge of the Wreckers on Cybertron during the war, as he felt there needed to be someone to keep them in order. Once again taking charge of the Wreckers on Earth, Ultra Magnus also takes the Forge of Solus Prime as a new weapon, as it had no more power and he wanted to give it a \"practical use\".\n\nIn \"Chain of Command\", Ultra Magnus constantly criticizes Wheeljack's actions, such as attacking without orders, and bringing Miko along. It is revealed that Ultra Magnus becoming the leader of the Wreckers was the reason Wheeljack deserted. When fighting Predaking in the mine and losing, Magnus once again criticizes Wheeljack for detonating a grenade in a confined space. Ultimately Wheeljack deserts the Wreckers once again, though he returns to the Autobot base back in Nevada. This is shown in the episode \"Plus One\", in which Ultra Magnus, Bulkhead, and Miko return to Nevada in Magnus' ship instead of by groundbridge, bringing with them the reclaimed Apex Armor.\n\nIn \"Evolution\", Ultra Magnus begins to realize that the Autobots aren't very welcoming towards him, not just Wheeljack. Later he partakes in a battle at what is believed to be a Decepticon energon mine, and he takes the Wreckers inside of the mine with Smokescreen. He and Wheeljack stumble upon Shockwave's Predacon cloning lab, and proceed to battle him, but Shockwave escapes and the Predacons begin to awaken. Wheeljack detonates a grenade next to the synthetic energon, and they attempt to make their escape, just as Predaking arrives. Predaking is enraged by the loss of his Predacon brethren and tries to kill the two Autobots. The Wreckers put up more of a fight against Predaking in his robot mode, but eventually are defeated. Predaking crushes Magnus's hand by stepping on it and destroys the Forge of Solus Prime. When he is about to kill them, Optimus Prime comes in and saves them both. Magnus is later being treated by Ratchet, and learns from Optimus that the bond of family is greater than that of any army.\n\nUltra Magnus continues to work the Autobots, with a metal claw as a replacement for his destroyed hand. He leads the Wreckers in the final battle against the Decepticons in \"Deadlock\", until the Decepticons are defeated upon the death of Megatron, and witnesses the revival of Cybertron through the use of the Omega Lock.\n\nIn the TV movie, \"Predacons Rising\", Ultra Magnus is left in command while Optimus goes to retrieve the Allspark. When investigating the Sea of Rust with Smokescreen, they come across two Predacons, Skylynx and Darksteel. Magnus tries to fight off Skylynx, but is brutally beaten by him, and barely escapes with Smokescreen's help. He spends the rest of the movie under Ratchet's medical attention. He is however seen, still on a medical chair, when Optimus sacrifices himself for Cybertron's restoration with the AllSpark.\nHe and many others made a cameo in robots in disguise.\n\nUltra Magnus appears in the novel \"\", its sequel, \"\", and \"\", the third installment in the series. Unlike the animated series, the Wreckers form around Ultra Magnus, who becomes a leading figure amongst the early Autobots. Wielding a powerful hammer, Magnus eventually became leader of the Autobot resistance to Shockwave on Cybertron following the departure of the \"Ark\" and the \"Nemesis.\" Ultra Magnus and his team played a role in the \"Ark's\" successful departure, delaying Trypticon and the Decepticons long enough for the \"Ark\" to be launched. He then takes up leadership of the Autobot forces resisting Shockwave's domination of the planet, corresponding with Alpha Trion and leading his Wreckers into battle against the enemy. In \"Retribution\" his role is expanded when Alpha Trion is taken prisoner by Shockwave and experimented upon, prompting him to assemble several Wreckers along with Jetfire and Omega Supreme to liberate the captured Prime. Their plan would be further complicated by an invasion of Sharkticons sent by the Quintessons to reclaim Cybertron, but they eventually escaped with the aid of the bar owner Maccadam.\n\nUltra Magnus also appeared in the \"Transformers: Prime\" comic mini-series, \"Rage of the Dinobots\". Like many Autobots, he developed something of an aversion to the Dinobots due to their altered nature. Due to his rigid personality, he also looked unfavorably upon their combat tactics. However, after they played a significant role in enabling him to depart Cybertron, Magnus came to respect the Dinobots as comrades.\n\nUltra Magnus makes a cameo, along with Arcee and Bulkhead, in the \"Transformers: Robots in Disguise\" comic, secretly observing Bumblebee and his team fight a Decepticon bird named Flamefeather. He along with Arcee and Bulkhead meet Team Bee during a conflict with Clipshade in issue 2\n\nUltra Magnus appears as a character in the Nintendo DS game \" - Autobots\". He is a level boss that must be defeated, which unlocks him as a playable character. He is also available in the Decepticons version of the game. If the sewer level with Motormaster is played with Autobot characters, Ultra Magnus is used to replace Motormaster.\n\nUltra Magnus is available as downloadable content for \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUltra Magnus is one of the evil Autobots in Fun Publications' \"Shattered Glass\" universe. In this universe, he is also Optimus Prime's younger brother, and formerly one of the chief lieutenants in the Autobot dictatorship.\n\nHowever, he eventually staged a failed coup against Prime, and had his face ripped away for his trouble, leaving him with a skeletal visage. Exiled to Paradron, he eventually formed an alliance with Wreck-Gar and others, obtaining the Omega Blade and copying Optimus's latest form in preparation to make another grab for power. This would lead to an invasion of the Classics universe, which was eventually destroyed as a result of Magnus' actions while its version of Earth was transported to Magnus' home universe. This would subsequently be revealed to be part of a scheme to harvest the energy of destroyed universes and use it against Optimus, but Magnus ran into unexpected opposition when his counterpart from the universe he destroyed, now known as Ultra Mammoth, engaged him and was exposed to a reaction of the Origin Matrix carried by him. This caused him to briefly go on a rampage, until he was subdued by the arrival of Nexus Prime, who promptly claimed the Omega Blade for his own use. Magnus attempted to escape, but Nexus banished him into another reality and trapped him there before setting out to insure that a plan such as his could never be employed again.\n\nUltra Magnus' original form is depicted by the \"Universe\" toy, which is a repaint of \"Armada\" Optimus Prime.\n\nAlongside Optimus Prime, The character Red plays Ultra Magnus as a playable character in Angry Birds: Transformers..\n\n"}
