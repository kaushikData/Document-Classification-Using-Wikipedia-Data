{"id": "43501641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43501641", "title": "Ante Over", "text": "Ante Over\n\nAnte Over (also known as Eenie Einie, Auntie Over, Andy Over, Anti-Over, Annie I Over, Ante-I-over, Annie Annie Over, Annie Over, Annie Over the Shanty, Antony Over, Antny Over, Anthony Over, Andrew Over, Ankety Over, Eenie I over, and other regional variants) is a children's game played in the United States and Canada, dating back to at least the late nineteenth century. The game requires a ball or any other small object and a barrier (usually a small gabled building) between the two teams over which the ball is thrown.It is played over a lower building that you can throw a ball over and be able to run all the way around it. You call out Annie-Annie Over and throw the ball over the building to the kids on the other side. If they catch the ball they can sneak around the building and throw the ball at you or catch you and tag you. You have to keep an eye open for them coming and beat them to the other side of the building. If you make it then that is your side but if you are tagged then you are on their side. There can be an even number of kids on each side to start with. When there are three-four kids on a side they can split up and some go each way and then you don't know who has the ball. If the ball is not caught then they can wait a moment to try and fool you and then holler out Annie-Annie Over and throw the ball back. If the ball doesn't go over the building, the throwers can yell 'Pigtail!', and then try to throw it again. The ball must be caught in order to run around the building after you. When the last kid on a team is tagged then that team wins.\n\nThere are two teams, one on each side of the barrier. A player on the team that starts with the ball throws the ball over the roof to the other team, yelling some version of \"Ante Over\" to warn them that it has been thrown. If the other team fails to catch the ball before it hits the ground, then they will yell \"Ante Over\" and throw it back. If the team that is thrown to catches the ball, then the player holding the ball runs around the building and tries to hit one of the members of the opposing team with the ball. Players are \"safe\" if they succeed in running around the building without being hit. If a player is hit, they then join the team of the player who hit them with the ball. Gameplay continues until one team has all of the players or there is just one is left.\n\nIn some areas, if the ball bounces off the wall or rolls back without going over the roof, the thrower will yell \"Pig's tail\", \"pigtails\", \"Back, ball\", or \"Uncle\" to let the other team know the ball has been thrown but did not go over. They then yell \"Ante Over\" again and make another attempt to throw the ball over the roof.\n\nAn indoor version of the game uses a curtain instead of a building. Any tall obstacle that obscures the other team works for the game, although a gabled roof is part of traditional play.\n\nWhen a building is used instead of a fence or some other narrow object, in some variations the ball must touch the other side of the roof. Having the ball bounce this way can make it tougher for the other side to catch. Some players even learn to finesse the ball rolling it up and over the roof.\n\nWhen it is fence, or a similar obstacle that can be seen through, it is more difficult for the players to cheat as the other side can see if the ball does or does not hit the ground. When it is a building, or other opaque barrier, players can sometimes stealth to the other side, catching the other team by surprise.\n\nOne rule has it that the opposing player can only be hit below the waist as a safety precaution like in dodge ball.\n\nIn most versions players only have to run to the other side of the building to be \"safe\", while other versions require them to run all the way around the building.\n"}

Animation and distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. It is a sequel to \"\". It premiered at the New York Comic Con on October 8, 2017, was released digitally on October 10, 2017, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 17, 2017. Based on the 1960s \"Batman\" TV series, the film stars Adam West (in his final role before his death), Burt Ward and Julie Newmar reprising their roles of Batman, Robin and Catwoman from the series. The film included a tribute to the late West.\n\nBatman and Robin are invited to a top-secret demonstration hosted by Professor Hugo Strange and his assistant Dr. Harleen Quinzel that may eventually change the future of Gotham forever. Along the way, Batman takes a stop at Gotham State Penitentiary to visit Catwoman (whose suicide attempt from somehow failed) to give her a book on poetry by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. This is something to keep her occupied for the next 36 months of her life until she is let out of prison for good. At the laboratory, they meet district attorney and Bruce Wayne's ally in the war against crime Harvey Dent who is famous for having stopped a coin counterfeiting gang while keeping a two-faced quarter as a souvenir from the case.\n\nHugo Strange believes that good and evil are all but one-sided and has created an \"Evil Extractor\" to which the volunteering criminals Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Egghead, and Mr. Freeze, will be purified of their corruption. Batman bluffs it off, saying that there are no easy fixes to the straight and narrow path, but Strange conducts his experiment anyway, despite the fact that it will make the jobs of Batman, Robin and Harvey obsolete. All goes well until the Joker entices his fellow villains to overload the machine. Noticing this, Professor Strange orders Dr. Quinzel to shut it down...but is too late and Harvey (as opposed to acid from the comic book mythos) is horribly scarred by the explosion of the containment vat, with Batman being successful in saving the right side of his face.\n\nHarvey, now re-christened Two-Face, goes on a crime spree as seen in the opening credits, all of which his attempts are foiled by the Dynamic Duo. He is eventually whisked to a hospital where his face has been given reconstructive surgery. His sanity has apparently been restored as well.\n\nNow returning to his old job as the assistant to the assistant district attorney, Harvey spends the next six months in charge of his own fate. At the same time, King Tut and his henchmen have been robbing an biplane. At Wayne Manor, Aunt Harriet is getting ready for a soiree in Bruce and Dick's place while they investigate the crime as Batman and Robin.\n\nAfter implying comparisons between King Tut and Two-Face, Batman and Robin return to the Batcave where they realize that a double decker bus company are planning to hold the millionaires, Alfred Pennyworth, and Aunt Harriet hostage. They arrive on the bus via Batmobile and fight King Tut and the Tutlings while Alfred escorts the patrons to safety. Unfortunately, the Dynamic Duo are subdued by a pair of twin snakes with knockout venom.\n\nIn an urn trap as seen in King Tut's debut episode, Batman and Robin are to be entombed in the foundations of the Pyramid Towers that are soon to be erected above the digging spot where they are trapped. Cement pours over them and when it appears as though they are doomed, they press the back of their soles against the sides of the jars, triggering the Batjets. They fly to confront King Tut in one final battle and a brick to the head restores his memory of Professor William McElroy. As they take him away, a pair of twins seize the jewels that were stolen by the Tutlings.\n\nBatman, Robin, Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara interrogate King Tut as Harvey waits in the shadows, with O'Hara constantly hitting Tut on the head with his baton. King Tut's lawyer Lucille Diamond intervenes and ushers them out of the room so that she can speak to him. At King Tut's trial, she implicates that the concussion is nothing more than a threat to a mild-mannered man. Chief O'Hara tearfully confesses to hitting King Tut and Harvey calls Batman as his next witness, but Professor McElroy himself admits his guilt, ready to suffer the minimum penalty of being rehabilitated in prison. After the sentencing, Harvey shares a highball with Bruce Wayne much to Dick's annoyance at bearing the hardships of a third wheel.\n\nHarvey is then due to a attend a charity for underprivileged twins at the Winning Pair casino just as Bruce and Dick resume their identities as Batman and Robin once more. A package has arrived at Commissioner Gordon's office, a World Atlas book marked for Batman...with its pages eaten away in three holes. Robin surmises the culprit to be Bookworm and the duo race off in the Batmobile to find him at the Gotham City Library where a fight ensues and the three priceless books that Bookworm had his eyes on have disappeared.\n\nBatman and Robin deduce that the stolen books were all about duality, but Two-Face has already been reformed and so they try to find another way behind it. Regardless, they head to an abandoned sign factory with Two-Face and the twins waiting for them. After defeating the twins, Two-Face pins them with a large number two and the flip of his coin landing on the right side spares their lives. Once they have left, Batman believes that Harvey has made a lot of enemies in his career and they are all out to destroy it. Meanwhile, Harvey is having some problems of his own after he makes a phone call to...Two-Face, who kidnaps Professor Strange as part of their scheme.\n\nRobin is punished to his room by Batman after nearly getting into a row about Harvey’s involvement in Two-Face’s plans and Catwoman, who by now has been stood up, escapes her cell by switching places with Lucilee Diamond. Following Harvey to the laboratory, Robin is ambushed by Two-Face and Professor Strange corrupts him with the same gas of the extractor that mutates the left side of his body. Batman is forced to fight his beloved sidekick who cures him back at the Batcave, following Two-Face to the casino where he is in fact revealed to be Dent, having suppressed his bad side (á la Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). Once the Dynamic Duo are strapped to a large silver dollar, he unmasks Batman and deduces Robin’s true identity. Then Two-Face invites Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Egghead, Shame, Clock King and Catwoman to an auction for the highest bidder of Batman’s true identity.\n\nWith Catwoman’s help, Batman and Robin defeat the villains, but Two-Face gets away on the biplane stolen by King Tut, intending to use the evil gas to remake Gotham City in his image. The Dynamic Duo manage to shoot him down towards a flaming factory where Batman goes one on one with Two-Face having completely taking over Harvey’s body. In a battle of wits, Batman urges Harvey to regain self-control and he does, defeating Two-Face for good as they escape the factory.\n\nThe next morning, Batman and Robin use the Batwing to cure the infected Gothamites. Months later, Harvey still appears to have repressed Two-Face and forgotten Batman's secret identity. He holds a bachelor auction at Wayne Manor with the caped crusader himself as the first bachelor. Batman appears before everyone, and to his delight, ends up having the first person to bid for him being none other than Catwoman.\n\nIn the post-credits, there is a memorial for Adam West, who portrayed Batman. It also stated \"Rest Well, Bright Knight\". In a scene exclusive to the Blu-Ray edition, Dr. Quinzel busts Joker out of prison dressed as her new persona of Harley Quinn.\n\n\nA sequel to \"\", entitled \"Batman vs. Two-Face\", was planned to be released in 2017 with William Shatner voicing Two-Face as the main antagonist. On June 9, 2017, Batman's voice actor Adam West died from leukemia. Despite this, according to Bleeding Cool, West and Shatner recorded their lines separately with West finishing his lines by October 2016. Burt Ward and Julie Newmar reprised their roles as Robin and Catwoman. Lee Meriwether previously played Catwoman in the 1966 feature film and has a voice cameo in this production.\n\n\"Batman vs. Two-Face\" premiered at the New York Comic Con on October 8, 2017 and was released digitally on October 10, 2017 and on DVD and Blu-ray on October 17, 2017.\n\nThe score by Lolita Ritmanis, Michael McCuistion & Kristopher Carter was released on October 6, 2017 on CD by WaterTower Records as an exclusive with FYE.\n\nIGN awarded the film a score of 8.4 out of 10, saying \"\"Batman vs. Two-Face\" is a worthy entry in the 1966 canon and a fine send-off for the late Adam West\".\n\n\"Batman vs. Two-Face\" earned $145,865 from domestic DVD sales and $596,303 from domestic Blu-ray sales, bringing its total domestic home video earnings to $742,168.\n\n"}
{"id": "43293538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43293538", "title": "Blek", "text": "Blek\n\nBlek is a 2013 puzzle video game for iOS and Android by Kunabi Brother, a team of brothers Denis and Davor Mikan. The player draws a snakelike black line that recurs in pattern and velocity across the screen to remove colored dots and avoid black dots. It is minimalist in design, features excerpts of Erin Gee, and takes inspiration from Golan Levin, the Bauhaus, and Japanese calligraphy. The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game \"Snake\" and worked on the game for over six months. It was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android.\n\nThe game received positive reviews, and critics praised the game's degree of unrestricted play. The game reached the top of the Apple App Store charts several months after its release. It received a 2014 Apple Design Award, and has sold over one million copies.\n\n\"Blek\" is a puzzle game in which the player draws a \"snake-like\" black line on the screen that is recorded and played back like a pattern, recurring repeatedly across the screen. The object is to draw a line that it will remove colored dot targets when it repeats across the screen without hitting a black dot. Lines that travel off the top or bottom of the screen reset the level, while lines that travel off the left or right of the screen reflect back towards the dots. Aside from repeating the player's drawn pattern, the stroke mimics the player's pace in drawing the stroke. The game begins with no prompt or tutorial other than to use a finger on the screen and experiment. The first puzzles are \"on open, white canvasses\" where the player can solve the simple puzzles \"by accident\". The 80 levels progress in difficulty and require more complex solutions. Added elements include a \"chain reaction\" dot that launches other dots when struck. Its sound consists of a \"whoosh\" that accompanies the traveling stroke, a \"chime\" when colored dots are hit, and a human \"disappointed grumble\" when black dots are hit, resetting the level. The game is depicted in flat, plain colors, with no pause feature and no option menu other than Game Center achievements. Players navigate between puzzles using three small onscreen icons. There are no in-app purchases or in-game advertisements.\n\n\"Blek\" was built for iOS by brothers Denis and Davor Mikan. While both had coding experience, neither were game developers by trade. This was their first game together as Kunabi Brother. Denis had published short stories and a novel, and Davor released music on a Crónica Electrónica. Davor previously made Flash games and developed the idea for \"Blek\" from this experience. He approached Denis about converting the video game \"Snake\" for touchscreens, and Denis returned with the idea of \"a line representing an idea that springs to life after it has been drawn\". This thought was likely inspired by the calligraphy and ink drawings in a book by Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō that Denis was reading. They had several prototypes by mid-2013, when Davor joined an Parisian artist in residence program, where he felt he was treated differently when he introduced himself as a game developer instead of as a musician. This experience invigorated his interest in the game medium and led to the brothers' push to finish the game over the next six months.\n\n\"Blek\" was released for iPad in December 2013, and an iPhone and iPod Touch version followed on January 7, 2014. Four months after the release, they reinvested their earnings from the game into marketing. After a few YouTube campaigns, \"Blek\" was listed in Apple's App Store lists. An Android version was released in July. Kunabi Brother are not planning a sequel, though they intend to further \"experiment with touchscreens\".\n\n\"Blek\" received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Though the game first released in December 2013 to little fanfare, critics \"widely praised\" the game, and it became popular in April 2014. It appeared in the top ten paid App Store games chart in April, reached the top by May, and was listed into June. \"Blek\" received a 2014 Apple Design Award and was featured in their Indie Game Showcase. While it had sold 30,000 copies by February 2014, upon being featured in the App Store, it sold 500,000 copies by May, and over a million copies by June. \"Edge\" compared its aesthetic to iOS puzzle game \"Hundreds\". Reviewers praised the game for the amount of freedom it affords its players.\n\nChristian Donlan of \"Eurogamer\" wrote that the game is personal. He compared its core mechanics to handwriting and doodling, noting that the recurring stroke also captures the player's \"speed and hesitancy\". Donlan wrote that the game is \"lots of kinds of puzzle games\" as the player may read negative spacing or try to predict the motion of a reflected stroke, and compared the later stages to mazes or minefields. Shaun Musgrave of \"TouchArcade\" noted that the game's difficulty increases around level 20, where player precision is required, and considered this part a low point. He felt that the small margin of error in later levels lent towards frustration. Jared Nelson of the same website wrote that the game was uniquely suited for the touchscreen.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6993136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6993136", "title": "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo", "text": "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\n\n\"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.\" is a grammatically correct sentence in American English, often presented as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create complicated linguistic constructs through lexical ambiguity. It has been discussed in literature in various forms since 1967, when it appeared in Dmitri Borgmann's \"\".\n\nThe sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word \"buffalo\":\n\nMore easily decoded, though semantically equivalent, would be:\"Buffalo from Buffalothat other buffalo from Buffalo bully[themselves] bully buffalo from Buffalo.\"\n\nThe sentence is unpunctuated and uses three different readings of the word \"buffalo\". In order of their first use, these are:\n\nThe sentence is syntactically ambiguous; however, one possible parse (marking each \"buffalo\" with its part of speech as shown above) would be as follows:\n\nWhen grouped syntactically, this is equivalent to: [(Buffalonian bison) (Buffalonian bison intimidate)] intimidate (Buffalonian bison).\n\nThe sentence uses a restrictive clause, so there are no commas, nor is there the word \"which,\" as in, \"Buffalo buffalo, which Buffalo buffalo buffalo, buffalo Buffalo buffalo.\" This clause is also a reduced relative clause, so the word \"that\", which could appear between the second and third words of the sentence, is omitted.\n\nAn expanded form of the sentence which preserves the original word order is:\n\"Buffalo bison, that other Buffalo bison bully, also bully Buffalo bison.\"\n\nThus, the parsed sentence reads as a claim that bison who \"are intimidated or bullied by bison\" are themselves \"intimidating or bullying bison\" (at least in the city of Buffalo – implicitly, Buffalo, New York):\n\nThomas Tymoczko has pointed out that there is nothing special about eight \"buffalos\"; any sentence consisting solely of the word \"buffalo\" repeated any number of times is grammatically correct. The shortest is \"Buffalo!\", which can be taken as a verbal imperative instruction to bully someone (\"[You] buffalo!\") with the implied subject \"you\" removed, or as a noun exclamation, expressing e.g. that a buffalo has been sighted, or as an adjectival exclamation, e.g. as a response to the question, \"where are you from?\" Tymoczko uses the sentence as an example illustrating rewrite rules in linguistics.\n\nThe idea that one can construct a grammatically correct sentence consisting of nothing but repetitions of \"buffalo\" was independently discovered several times in the 20th century. The earliest known written example, \"Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo\", appears in the original manuscript for Dmitri Borgmann's 1965 book \"Language on Vacation\", though the chapter containing it was omitted from the published version. Borgmann recycled some of the material from this chapter, including the \"buffalo\" sentence, in his 1967 book, \"\". In 1972, William J. Rapaport, now a professor at the University at Buffalo but then a graduate student at Indiana University, came up with versions containing five and ten instances of \"buffalo\". He later used both versions in his teaching, and in 1992 posted them to the LINGUIST List. A sentence with eight consecutive \"buffalo\"s is featured in Steven Pinker's 1994 book \"The Language Instinct\" as an example of a sentence that is \"seemingly nonsensical\" but grammatical. Pinker names his student, Annie Senghas, as the inventor of the sentence.\n\nNeither Rapaport, Pinker, nor Senghas were initially aware of the earlier coinages. Pinker learned of Rapaport's earlier example only in 1994, and Rapaport was not informed of Borgmann's sentence until 2006. Even Borgmann's example may not be the oldest: computational linguist Robert C. Berwick, who used a five-\"buffalo\" version in a 1987 book, claims he had heard the sentence as a child (\"before 1972, to be sure\") and had assumed it was part of common parlance.\n\nVersions of the linguistic oddity can be constructed with other words which similarly simultaneously serve as collective noun, adjective, and verb, some of which need no capitalization (such as \"police\").\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Loretta Young and Alan Ladd. David Jones, one of the main characters wearing a fedora, a brown jacket, and khakis, was an inspiration for Indiana Jones.\n\nIn 1941, in Mei-Ki, China, war profiteer David Jones (Alan Ladd) narrowly escapes with his life when Chinese Captain Tao-Yuan-Kai arrests him for selling oil to the Japanese but releases him because he is American. Japanese aircraft bomb the town, and Jones drives toward Shanghai with his partner, Johnny Sparrow (William Bendix), who has brought with him an orphaned baby boy.\n\nAfter nightfall, they are forced to stop because Chinese refugees crowd the road and beat the Americans until Carolyn Grant (Loretta Young), an American schoolteacher born in China, tells them to stop. Carolyn sneaks her group of female college students into the back of Jones's truck and insists that Jones proceed without headlights because they might be sighted by Japanese bombers. As she has an intimate knowledge of the local terrain, Carolyn takes over driving the truck, and has her friend, Lin Wei, sit on the hood to watch for potholes.\n\nWhen Jones realizes that Carolyn has loaded his truck with refugees, he ruthlessly starts to throw them out, fearing that the extra load will use up the gas he needs to get to Shanghai, but relents when he learns that the students are young women.\n\nAlong the road the next day, they encounter Lin Wei's first and second brothers, Lin Cho and Lin Yun, who have formed a guerrilla band and are posing as peasants. Lin Cho warns them to take an alternate road, as the Japanese are approaching, and Jones reluctantly heads the truck to the family farm of Tan Ying, a girl he tried to throw off the truck.\n\nAt the farm, Carolyn tries again to persuade Jones to take the students to Chungtu, where they can continue their studies, rather than Japanese-occupied Shanghai, but Jones is unconcerned with the struggle of the Chinese, and refuses. After Johnny leaves the baby, whom he has dubbed \"Donald Duck,\" with Tan Ying's family for safekeeping, the journey resumes. \nThey are forced to abandon the truck when Japanese aircraft strafe the road, but Lin Cho and his compatriots shoot the enemy aircraft down.\n\nWhen Carolyn discovers that Tan Ying has slipped off the bus to rejoin her family, she insists on returning for her. While the rest of the group hikes to a monastery, Jones and Carolyn drive back to the farm and are shocked to find that the Japanese have burned the farm, and murdered Tan Ying's parents and Donald Duck. Jones then finds three Japanese soldiers raping Tan Ying, and shoots them without hesitation, while Carolyn comforts the hysterical woman. After the group takes refuge in the monastery, Tan Ying dies.\n\nFinally cognizant of the nature of the Chinese struggle, Jones is now inspired to join the fight against the Japanese, and offers his help to the three brothers. They determine that they must close a mountain pass in order to prevent the further onslaught of the Japanese, but only the Japanese army has the necessary dynamite. That night, Jones, Johnny, Lin Wei, Lin Cho and Lin Yun swim across a river to raid a Japanese encampment and steal the dynamite. When their presence is detected, a fierce gun battle ensues, during which Lin Wei, and all but two other guerrillas, are killed. Before he dies, Lin Wei honors Jones by calling him his \"fourth brother.\"\n\nThat night, Carolyn rejects Johnny's marriage proposal because she is in love with Jones, and later, the new lovers Jones and Carolyn spend a final night together. The next day, the small band of fighters places the dynamite along the mountain pass road.\n\nWhen the Japanese convoy appears early, Jones stops them on the road to give the guerrillas time to lay the dynamite, and pretends that he is stranded. The Japanese general explains to Jones that Japan has just bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States, and that their intention is to create a new world order. After the general's second-in-command shoots Jones, the Chinese set off the dynamite causing an avalanche that buries the Japanese troops, and closes the road. Carolyn and Johnny mourn the loss of their friend as they drive the students to Chungtu.\n\n\nThe script was based on \"Fourth Brother\", an unproduced play by Archibald Forbes about an American oil salesman in China who joins in the fight against the Japanese with three Chinese guerillas. Paramount bought the screen rights for $25,000 in May 1942.\n\nThe film originally was considered a vehicle for Loretta Young, who was an enthusiastic supporter of China during the war and who had just signed a three-year deal with Paramount to make two movies a year. By September, Alan Ladd and William Bendix were assigned to the film, with John Farrow to direct, in colour. Young pulled out, claiming she was dissatisfied with her role. However, she appears to have changed her mind. \"I thought it was going to be good,\" she said. \"It was a war picture. It was full of action and a bit of vindictiveness... pretty little orphan girls.\"\n\nWilliam Bendix was cast as Ladd's sidekick, a departure from the \"heavy\" that he had played in earlier roles. He would go on to play Ladd's sidekick in \"The Blue Dahlia\" (1946), \"Calcutta\" (1947) and \"The Deep Six\" (1958).\n\nExcept for the three leads and a small supporting role of Ladd's girlfriend, all of the cast were Chinese, causing the filmmakers to look outside normal casting avenues. Sen Yung, Philip Ahn and Richard Loo played lead supporting roles.\n\nHelena Kuo was meant to play a small role but did not end up appearing in the film.\n\nFilming started 27 October 1942. In December Hedda Hopper wrote in her gossip column \"wonder why so many battles between producer, director, Loretta Young and Alan Ladd on \"China\"? Could it be a bad story? Could be...\"\n\nLoretta Young later said she objected to a scene where her character had to condone the suicide of one of the Chinese girls as she wouldn't \"propagandize suicide as the answer to anything\". (Young was a devout Catholic.) She claims Farrow and Paramount's head of production Buddy de Sylva agreed to cut the scene, but it reappeared in the script during production. Young refused once more and threatened to lead the film. The scene was not shot.\n\nYoung also admitted she had difficulties with Alan Ladd. \"He was a whiner and I hate that... Any man who calls for his agent every time he doesn't get his own way and his agent happens to be his wife (Sue Carol) there is something radically wrong. The last little thing that would happen, he'd be on the phone saying, 'Sue, you'd better get over here and straighten this out.\"\n\n\"I don't remember hearing him laugh, or ever seeing him laugh,\" said Young. \"Everything that concerned him was very serious.\"\n\"China\" was the third war film in a row John Farrow had directed after being discharged from the Canadian navy. Farrow was keen to make the movie as accurate as possible. \"We have a big army and there are bound to be service men in every theatre,\" he said during the film's shoot. \"Not only that, every mother's son has a mother - and you can bet she knows what it's all about too. As far as I'm concerned, when I decide to make a picture about anything - no matter what - I feel I should be truthful.\"\n\nLadd was injured during filming the battle scenes, suffering a cut arm and sprained ankle. He also had to make a 20-foot dive off a bridge, which former diver Ladd found easy.\n\nThe scene where 4,000 Japanese troops were killed in explosion was thought to set a record for Japanese killed on screen in a Hollywood film.\n\nParamount purchased the rights to \"Work as One\", a popular Chinese marching song by Shu Mo, to use in the film. Part of the purchase price went to the United China Relief Campaign Fund. The song was recorded by the All-Chinese Choir of the Chinese First Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles.\n\nThe film premiered in New York at the Paramount in April 1943, with an appearance by Harry James and his orchestra. Teenage fans ended up rioting, smashing a window and breaking a policeman's ribs. \"Every indication points to a record breaking run, however,\" wrote the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nThe film was a big hit and Paramount reunited Young and Ladd on \"And Now Tomorrow\" (1944).\n\nBosley Crowther in his film review for \"The New York Times\", noted that Hollywood had churned out an unsatisfactory look at a topical subject, \"... a small host of Chinese worthies play their countrymen in the accepted style. But the film scarcely does justice to their country — or to the title which it bears. By and large, it is Hollywood trumpery ...\"\n\nThe review in \"Variety\" was more charitable, noting, \"Frank Butler generates authenticity in the dramatic evolvement of his screenplay [from a play by Archibald Forbes], while director John Farrow neatly blends the human and melodramatic elements of the yarn.\" \n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"the hostility expressed in some quarters towards \"China\" can probably be laid to the title as much as anything. Hollywood's penchant for the grandiose has a way of kicking back unexpectedly - and \"China\", apparently, has got itself in the pan. Except in the narrow movie sense, it hardly justifies so sweeping a name. In the narrow movie sense the picture is, however, as good as most melodramas treating of some phase of the global war and - in certain moments of realism - rather better than that.\"\n\nRadley Metzger praised the film, saying John Farrow \"brilliantly mastered\" the technique of the tracking shot and that \"China\" \"has the most fabulous shots I've ever seen.\"\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Moreover, in the same decade, the Italian Carlos Crespi directed the major documentary \"Los Invisibles Shuaras del Alto Amazonas\". Between 1930 and 1931, the advent of talkies stopped the development of Ecuadorian film, which tried to cope with the new films using \"live sound\" (\"sonorización en vivo\"), that is, the interpretation of texts and songs simultaneously with the projection, though without success. Because of this, for around two decades Ecuadorian cinema revolved around documentaries, news programs, and promotional tourist films, with the exception of dramatic feature films in 1950. However, Ecuadorian cinema was promoted by intellectuals in the 1960s, including Ulises Estrella, director of the Cinemateca Nacional. During this period, Mexican-Ecuadorian co-productions proliferated. During the next decade, the documentary genre was strengthened, and in 1977 the Asociación de Autores Cinematográficos del Ecuador was legalized.\n\nBetween the 1980s and the present, Ecuadorian cinema returned to the production of feature films. One example of this trend was the 1989 cinematic adaptation of José de la Cuadra's \"La Tigra\", directed by Camilo Luzuriaga. Luzuriaga also directed \"Entre Marx y una Mujer Desnuda\", a cinematic adaptation of \"1809-1810: Mientras llega el día\" by Jorge Enrique Adoum, which related the story of Quiteño independence. Other major films in the rebirth of Ecuadorian cinema were \"Ratas, ratones y rateros\" (1999) and \"Crónicas\" (2004) by director Sebastián Cordero. As of 2008, Cordero was filming his third feature film in Spain, an adaptation of the novel \"Rabia\" by the Argentine writer Sergio Bizzio. Recently the film \"Qué tan lejos\" by Cuenca's Tania Hermida was highly acclaimed, receiving the Silver Zenith Award Montreal World Film Festival for the best directorial debut. Other recent productions that are making their way through festivals include the documentary \"El Comité\" by Mateo Herrera and \"Cuando me toque a mí\" by Víctor Arregui. When \"Cuando me toque a mí\" was presented at the Biarritz Festival of Film and Culture of Latin America, the lead actor, Manuel Calisto, won the prize for best actor.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Ecuador would typically produce one film a year, with this rising to around twelve a year by the mid-2010s.\n\n"}

{"id": "288458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288458", "title": "Close and open harmony", "text": "Close and open harmony\n\nA chord is in close harmony (also called close position or close structure) if its notes are arranged within a narrow range, usually with no more than an octave between the top and bottom notes. In contrast, a chord is in open harmony (also called open position or open structure) if there is more than an octave between the top and bottom notes. The more general term \"spacing\" describes how far apart the notes in a chord are voiced. A triad in close harmony has compact spacing, while one in open harmony has wider spacing. \n\nClose harmony or voicing can refer to both instrumental and vocal arrangements. It can follow the standard voice-leading rules of classical harmony, as in string quartets or Bach chorales, or proceed in parallel motion with the melody in thirds or sixths.\n\nOrigins of this style of singing are found in harmonies of the 1800s in America. Early radio quartets continued this tradition. Female harmonists, like The Boswell Sisters (\"Mood Indigo\",1933). The Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce (\"Who? You That's Who!\", 1927), then became Three X Sisters. Both performed and recorded this style in the 1920s, and continued this onto commercial radio of the 1930s. Close harmony singing was especially popular in the 1940s with Pop and R&B groups using the technique quite frequently. The Andrews Sisters capitalized on a similar style too with swing music. \n\nMany gospel and soul groups in the 1950s and 60s also used this technique, usually 3- or 4-part SSAA or TTBB harmony with one person (either bass or lead) doing a call-and-response type lead. Examples of this are The Blind Boys of Alabama, a group that is still recording today. The folk-rock duo Simon & Garfunkel used close harmony, echoing their chosen role-models, The Everly Brothers. The Louvin Brothers were a duo that used close harmony in the genre of country music.\n\nBarbershop harmony has a unique TTBB structure: the melody is in the 2nd tenor or \"lead\" voice, while the 1st tenor takes the next part up, usually in 3rds, with the baritone and bass voices supporting. The bass line tends to be more rhythmic and covers the root notes of the harmonic progression, providing more \"support\" and independence than in classical vocal music, since Barbershop is usually sung a cappella. Barbershop can be sung by males (TTBB) or females (SSAA). Public domain pieces, such as \"Sweet Adeline\", and newer pieces are abundant. National organizations promote the music with local chapters in many communities.\n\nSoul and gospel groups flourished in America in the years after World War II, building on the foundation of blues, 1930s gospel songs and big band music. Originally called \"race music\" by white mainstream radio and its target market, it was the precursors to rock and roll and rhythm and blues of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, influencing many English and American artists of that era. As noted above, they often used the more traditional TTBB or SSAA 4-part structure, but with heavy use of solos and call-and-response, which is rooted in the African American church. These groups sometimes sang a cappella but also used more instrumental backing, especially when recorded by the bigger labels. Pop music and doo-wop can be seen as a commercialization of this genre.\n\nImpressionist composers like Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel often used close harmony in their works and other intervals, such as 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths may be used since the chords have four or more notes and the harmonies are more complex. In jazz, this influence flowered in the works of George Gershwin and Duke Ellington.\n\nA well-known example of consistent instrumental close harmony is Glenn Miller's \"Moonlight Serenade\" which uses the full range of single-reed wind instruments (soprano clarinet, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones) to make a distinctive sound by harmonizing the different sections all within a single octave. Miller studied the Schillinger technique with Joseph Schillinger, who is credited with helping Miller create the \"Miller sound\", and under whose tutelage he himself composed what became his signature theme, \"Moonlight Serenade\".\n\nIn organ performance, block harmony means that close position chords are added below the melody in the right hand, and the left hand doubles the melody an octave lower, while in open harmony the middle note of the chord is played an octave lower creating a \"open\" space in the chord.\n\n"}

The lead melody instrument is most often the bandola oriental (bandolín), but a button accordion, a violin, or a harmonica might play this role as well. The bandola oriental differs from the bandola llanera, in its four double courses of mixed metal and nylon strings, in contrast with the bandola llanera's four single-course nylon strings. Also, its more linear melodies differ from the bandola llanera's frequent alternation between strings. The cuatro, considered to be the Venezuelan national instrument, provides rhythmic and chordal framework for the music. Joropo oriental playing style, however, is distinguished by its generous use of rasgueado texturing of the rhythm, in which the right hand opens as the fingers stroke the strings, creating more of a sustained, finger-roll sound than a crisp strike. Maraca playing style differs in Oriente from that of the plains, with different hand patterns producing a more lyrical rhythmic sound.\n\n"}

{"id": "4073155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4073155", "title": "Golden Age of Mexican cinema", "text": "Golden Age of Mexican cinema\n\nThe Golden Age of Mexican cinema (in Spanish Época de Oro del Cine Mexicano) is a period in the history of the Cinema of Mexico between 1933 and 1964 when the Mexican film industry reached high levels of production, quality and economic success of its films, besides having gained recognition internationally. The Mexican film industry became the center of commercial films in Latin America.\n\nThe Golden Age began symbolically with the film \"Let's Go with Pancho Villa\" (1935), directed by Fernando de Fuentes. In 1939, during World War II, the film industry in the US and Europe declined, because the materials previously destined for film production now were for the new arms industry. Many countries began to focus on making films about war, leaving an opportunity for Mexico to produce commercial films for the Mexican and Latin American markets. This cultural environment favored the emergence of a new generation of directors and actors considered to date, icons in Mexico and in Hispanic countries and Spanish-speaking audiences.\n\nIn 1939 Europe and the United States participated in World War II, and the film industries of these regions were severely affected. Europe due to its location and the United States because the materials used to produce films (such as cellulose), became scarce and were rationed. In 1942, when German submarines destroyed a Mexican tanker, Mexico joined the Allies in the war against Germany. Mexico won the status of most favored nation. Thus, the Mexican film industry found new sources of materials and equipment and secured its position in the production of quality films worldwide. During World War II, the film industry in France, Italy, Spain, Argentina and the United States focused on war films, which made it possible for the Mexican film industry, with much more versatile themes in its films, to become dominant in the markets of Mexico and Latin America.\n\nSince the beginning of talkies in Mexico, some films (like \"Santa\" (1931), directed by Antonio Moreno and \"The Woman of the Port\" (1934), directed by Arcady Boytler, were a huge blockbuster that showed that Mexico had the equipment and talent needed to sustain a strong film industry.\nOne of the first blockbusters was the film \"Allá en el Rancho Grande\" by Fernando de Fuentes, which became the first classic of Mexican cinema; this film is referred to as the initiator of the \"Mexican film industry\".\n\nIn the early 1940s began the emergence of great Mexican film studios settled in Mexico City, they begin to support the mass production of films. Among the most important are CLASA Films, FILMEX, Films Mundiales, Cinematográfica Calderón, Películas Rodriguez and Producciones Mier y Brooks, among others.\n\nMexican cinema continued to produce works of superb quality and began to explore other genres such as comedy, romance and musical. In 1943, the film \"Wild Flower\", brought together a team comprising the filmmaker Emilio Fernández, the photographer Gabriel Figueroa, the actor Pedro Armendariz and actress Dolores del Río. The films \"María Candelaria\" (1943) and \"The Pearl\" (1947), were considered pivotal works by Fernández and his team, and gave Mexican cinema enormous prestige, with their works being shown worldwide in major film festivals. \"María Candelaria\" was awarded in 1946 with the Golden Palm in the Cannes Film Festival. \"The Pearl\" was awarded the Golden Globe of the American film industry, being the first Spanish film to receive such recognition.\n\nMexican cinema in its Golden Age, mimicked the \"Star System\" that prevailed in Hollywood. Thus, unlike other film industries, Mexican cinema saw the development of the \"cult of a star\", in a way very similar to that of the American film industry. However, unlike what happened in Hollywood, Mexican film studios never had total power over the big stars, and this allowed them to grow independently and develop in a wide range of genres, mainly figures emerged in Mexican cinema in the early 1950s, much more versatile and complete than those of the previous decade.\n\nAmong the actors who attained the status of idols in the Mexican cinema, arguably Pedro Infante stands out the most. His first films were not aimed toward creating a myth. The result of his meeting with the director Ismael Rodríguez in the film \"Nosotros los pobres\" (1947), served to consolidate the figure of Infante within the mythology of Mexican cinema. For many, Infante represented what every Mexican should be: a dutiful son, an unconditional friend, a romantic lover.\nIn the extensive gallery of stars of Mexican cinema, Pedro Infante is the only one who could unify public sentiment. His popularity has continued to grow as new generations are born. His figure remains the most important in Mexican cinema.\n\nAnother one of the early mass idols in Mexican cinema was Jorge Negrete. In addition to his role as an actor, Negrete was also a prominent singer and one of the leading representatives of Mexican ranchera music. Negrete was one of the highest grossing actors of Latin American Cinema during almost the entire decade of the 1940s. His premature death led to collective mourning in Mexico.\nMaria Félix was an exceptional case in the Mexican Cinema. A woman of a stunning physical beauty and strong personality, who immediately dominated the roles as a \"femme fatale\" in Mexican movies. Before the success of Maria Félix, women were in supporting roles (self-sacrificing mothers, submissive girlfriends). Based on the success of Félix, more movies with female themes began to be made. The film \"Doña Bárbara\" (1943), began the myth of Maria Felix as \"La Doña\". The unique real personality of María merged with her on-screen personality leading to one of the most fascinating myths of the seventh art. Her legend was forged without her lifting a finger. The imagination of the people did all the work.\nDolores del Rio at her best moments, represented one of the highest ideals of the Mexican female beauty. The myth of Dolores del Río did not begin in Mexico, but in Hollywood, where the actress reached the status of \"Diva\" in the 1920s and 1930s, very difficult for an actress of Hispanic origin. After a more than worthy career in Hollywood, Dolores returned to Mexico, where she managed to maintain and even raise the prestige that she enjoyed in the American film industry, thanks to a series of films made especially for her, by her eternal admirer, the filmmaker Emilio Fernández, where he stripped away the stony image acquired in Hollywood and highlighted her indigenous features. Films like \"Wild Flower\" and \"Maria Candelaria\"(1943), spread the image of Mexico around the world, and Dolores del Río became a national symbol, after being, for many years, a symbol of \"the Mexican\" abroad.\n\nOne of the faces that captivated the audiences was Pedro Armendariz. Although he did not have any indigenous roots whatsoever, Armendáriz managed to embody the Mexican essence better than any other actor in Mexico. This shared appreciation from historians, critics, colleagues and admirers, is based significantly on the characters that the actor starred as under the direction of Emilio Fernandez. Later, Armendáriz dabbled in Hollywood and some European countries.\n\nArturo de Córdova was another prominent male figure in Mexican Cinema. His specialty was the roles of tormented men who often sank into madness. His good looks and contrived elegance made him famous. He was certainly one of the most requested heartbreakers by Hispanic women. He had always surrounded himself with female beauties, while his graying temples were becoming a personal and non-transferable trademark. \nMario Moreno, Cantinflas, was a comedian and mime, who emerged from the popular theater. He achieved great popularity in the cinema with his portrayal of the character \"Cantinflas,\" a charismatic poor man, a \"friendly neighbor\" with quite a peculiar speech. The character of \"Cantinflas\" was to Mario Moreno as The Tramp was to Charles Chaplin. But unlike Chaplin, Cantinflas based his character on joy, rather than melancholy. His characters were always exhilaratingly funny. Cantinflas enjoyed remarkable success.\nAnother successful star was the comedian Germán Valdés, \"Tin Tan\". He was a great versatile actor and excellent singer. He became famous for portraying the character of The Pachuco (a cultural movement of the 1940s and 1950s, originating in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and migrated into Los Angeles, where it developed further). His films were mainly based on parody and absurd situations, skilled musical numbers portraying visual mischief with an attractive female. \"Tin Tan\" had a huge cultural impact among some sectors of the Mexican public, and his films reached the status of cult films. \nSome other Mexican figures achieved recognition for foreign level. Katy Jurado became an important and sought-after actress in the Hollywood films (primarily in the \"Western film \"), achieving recognition as the Golden Globe (1952) and a nomination for Academy Award of the American Film Academy (1954).\nMeanwhile, Silvia Pinal achieved recognition in the field of \"art cinema\", especially thanks to her collaborations with the filmmaker Luis Buñuel. The film \"Viridiana\" (1961), probably the most legendary film in Buñuel's cinematography, was headlined by Pinal. Awarded with the Golden Palm of Cannes Film Festival, \"Viridiana\" captured Pinal in the history of world cinema. Beautiful, charismatic and endowed with a wonderful versatility, Pinal enjoyed a successful career spanning several decades in the Mexican stardom.\nSara García, called \"Mexico's Grandmother\", deserves special mention. She was an outstanding actress who possessed great versatility and a strong dramatic intensity. She is, just as Cantinflas and Tin Tan, a part of Mexican popular culture, and her fame stands the test of time.\n\nAmong the most prominent actresses in Mexican cinema in its heyday were Columba Dominguez, one of the main muses of filmmaker Emilio Fernández. Endowed with a strong appeal, she worked in leading, internationally renowned bands such as \"Pueblerina\" (1949).\nMiroslava was a dazzling beauty of European origin who achieved fame in Mexican cinema between late 1940 and the mid-1950s, before dying tragically in 1955. Marga López was an important and outstanding actress with a very broad acting range. The dazzling Elsa Aguirre was one of the most important \"femme fatales\" of the Mexican film industry. Another important actress was Gloria Marín, who enjoyed a large following in the early 1940s thanks in part to her famous pairing with Jorge Negrete in a series of romantic movies. María Elena Marqués was another important actress with a strong personality.\nAmong the dazzling beauties that flooded the Mexican screens were also Esther Fernández, Rosario Granados, Rosita Quintana, Rita Macedo, Emilia Guiú, Alma Rosa Aguirre or Lilia Prado, among many others.\n\nAmong the best actresses who shone in this period was Carmen Montejo, an actress with an impeccable presence in film, theater and television. Meanwhile, Andrea Palma was considered the first \"Diva\" of Mexican Cinema, immortalized in the beginning of the Mexican film industry as \"The Woman of the Port\", and later specialized in roles as a sophisticated prostitute. Emma Roldán was one of the pioneers of the Mexican film industry with a career spanning more than a hundred films. Meanwhile, Prudencia Grifell, a veteran revue star in the 1920s, was immortalized (with Sara García) in Granny roles in the films.\n\nAs Mexico was the main film industry in the Spanish-speaking countries, its industry attracted other important figures from other Hispanic film industries. The most important were the Spanish Sara Montiel, who achieved international renown after making a name for herself in Mexican cinema during the first half of the 1950s, and Argentinean Libertad Lamarque, who after leaving her country in 1947 after an award-winning career in Argentine cinema, settled in Mexico, where she made most of her films and practically remained active for the rest of her life.\nFrom Spain there were other such actors, like Jorge Mistral, Armando Calvo or Lola Flores; from Argentina there were Niní Marshall and Luis Aldás. From Cuba there were René Cardona, Rita Montaner or Rosita Fornes, while Irasema Dilián was imported from Italian Cinema.\nAmong the greatest actors was Ignacio López Tarso, one of the most versatile Latin American actors who had a very prominent film, television and stage career. López Tarso was the protagonist of \"Macario \" (1959), first Mexican film nominated for an Academy Award of the American Academy. The Soler Brothers: Domingo, Andrés, Fernando and Julián Soler, were probably some of the Mexican actors with the most movies in their careers. In a great variety of roles, both dramatic and comic, their talent prevailed in their films. David Silva reached an enormous popularity to embody the hero of lower-class neighborhoods and in numerous films of social Film or urban cinema. Emilio Tuero was one of the first film heartthrobs with massive success in the Mexican film industry in the early 1940s. Roberto Cañedo was an actor with a very long film career that spanned more than fifty years in film, theater and television. Fernando Fernandez besides being an outstanding singer, achieved enormous popularity in musical films incarnating roles of good and noble man.\n\nMany other comedians achieved consecration in Mexican cinema. From comic slapstick couples (in the style of Laurel and Hardy) to independent actors who achieved a huge poster. Many of these comedians emerged from the called \"Carpas\" or Mexican popular theaters.\nJoaquín Pardavé, was a popular actor who captivated with the same dramatic or comic characters. Pardavé was also a composer and film director, and his beginnings in the industry, from the Silent films, made him a \"symbolic father\" of all Mexican comedians from the thirties to the sixties.\nAntonio Espino y Mora, better known as \"Clavillazo\" was another Mexican actor who began his career in the Carpas. More than 30 films are in his repertoire and is one of the most beloved and remembered artists. Another artist who started in the Carpas and also his sympathy, noted for his picturesque way of dancing was Adalberto Martínez \"Resortes\", who had a long career, then worked for over 70 years in film and television.\n\nGaspar Henaine and Marco Antonio Campos better known as \"Viruta and Capulina\" were a comic duo that were found in the form of white humor win the affection of the people. Viruta and Capulina began their career together in 1952, although individually had worked on other projects. They filmed more than 25 films.\n\nAlthough they do not have a large number of films together, Manuel Palacios \"Manolín\" and Estanislao Shilinsky Bachanska are remembered for their great chemistry in the theaters and later in the films.\n\nThe Musical film genre in Mexico was strongly influenced by the Mexican folk music or Ranchero music. Stars as Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Luis Aguilar and Antonio Aguilar made dozens of musical films of these gender who served as a platform to promote Mexican music. The songs of important composers like Agustín Lara or José Alfredo Jiménez served as the basis for the arguments of many films. Libertad Lamarque also highlighted by her performances where music and songs were the main protagonists.\n\nThe tropical music that was popular in Mexico and Latin America since the 1930s, and was also reflected in Mexican cinema. Numerous music magazines were made in the 1940s and 1950s. In these productions it was common to see figures ranging from Damaso Perez Prado, Toña la Negra, Rita Montaner, María Victoria or Los Panchos. However, the musical film in Mexico was mostly represented by the so-called \"Rumberas film\", a unique cinematic curiosity of Mexico, dedicated to the film exaltation of the figure of the \"rumba\" (dancers of Afro-Antillean rhythms). The main figures of this genre were Cubans María Antonieta Pons, Amalia Aguilar, Ninón Sevilla and Rosa Carmina and Mexican Meche Barba. Between 1938 and 1965 more than one hundred Rumberas films were made.\n\nIn Mexico, the Film Noir genre popular in Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s was represented by the actor and director Juan Orol. Inspired by the popular Gangster film and figures like Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson, Orol created a filmic universe and a particular style by mixing elements of classic Film Noir with Mexican folklore, urban environments, cabaret, and tropical music. Examples include the classic film \"Gangsters Versus Cowboys\" (1948).\n\nAlthough the 1960s are considered the Golden Age of Horror and science fiction in Mexican cinema, during the Golden Age they were found some remarkable works. Chano Urueta, a prolific director who began in the silent era, had had their approaches with the supernatural in \"Desecration\" (1933) and \"The Sign of Death\" (1939), however his greatest contributions come with \"The Amazing Beast\" (1952), film that first introduced the wrestlers in the genre. Other works in the genre would \"La Bruja\" (1954), \"Ladrón de Cadáveres\" (1956), the trilogy \"El Jinete sin cabeza\" (1957), the terror western, \"The Baron of Terror\" (1962) and \"The Living Head\"(1963).\n\nFernando Mendez was the most prolific filmmaker in the Horror films of the era. His most successful film was \"El vampiro\" (1957), starring Germán Robles, lead actor of the genre for the next two decades. Another actors highlights of gender were Abel Salazar, Lorena Velázquez and Ariadne Welter.\n\nAmong the major filmmakers who contributed to consolidate the Mexican cinema in its Golden Age include the following:\n\n\n\nThe first transmissions of the Mexican television started in 1950. In a few years, the television reached enormous power to reach the public. By 1956, the TV antennas were common in Mexican homes, and new media grew rapidly in the province. The first black and white television pictures appeared in a very small and oval screen, and thus the image was quite imperfect as they did not have the clarity and sharpness of the actual film image. However, not only in Mexico but throughout the world, the filmmakers immediately resented competition from this new media. This competition decisively influenced the history of cinema forcing the film industry to seek new ways both in the art itself, as in the treatment of subjects and genres.\n\nThe technical innovations came from Hollywood. Wide screens, three-dimensional cinema, color improvement and stereo sound were some of the innovations introduced by the American cinema during the early 1950s. At the time, the high cost of these technologies made it difficult for Mexico to compete; therefore, not for some years was it able to produce films incorporating these innovations.\n\nOn April 15, 1957, the whole country mourned with the news of the death of Pedro Infante. His death also marked the end of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.\n\nThe world was changing and so was the way film was produced by other countries. The elimination of censorship in the United States allowed a more bold and realistic treatment of many topics. In France, a young generation of filmmakers educated in film criticism began the New Wave movement. In Italy, the Neorealism had claimed the careers of several filmmakers. The Swedish film with Ingmar Bergman made his appearance, while in Japan Akira Kurosawa appeared.\n\nMeanwhile, Mexican cinema had been stalled by bureaucracy and difficulties with the union. Film production was now concentrated in a few hands, and the ability to see new filmmakers emerge was almost impossible due to the impositions of the directors of the Union of Workers of the Cinematographic Production (STPC). Three of the most important film studios disappeared between 1957 and 1958: Tepeyac, Clasa Films and Azteca.\n\nAlso in 1958, the Mexican Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to discontinue the Ceremony of the Ariel Award recognizing the best productions of the national cinema. The Ariel was instituted in 1946 and emphasized the thriving state of the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film, which was originally released by Paramount Pictures, is the first cartoon to feature Bimbo, as he attempts to gain a lover during the film.\n\nThe title is meant to show Bimbo's delight when he finds another girl, as 'Hot Dog' is North American exclamation slang for \"An expression of delight\".\n\nCopyrighted on the 29th March 1930, and released the same day, the film is part of the \"Talkartoons\" cartoon series, which was released by Paramount Pictures.\n\nThe film begins with Bimbo in his car. He then stops at a line of three girls, and in an attempt to charm them, tips his hat to them. This does not work on two of them, who both reject him. However, when the third one accepts and turns around, Bimbo comically realises that the third \"girl\" is a male lion. So, the car comically digs a hole in the road in order to escape him. Bimbo tips his hat to him as he leaves. The police officer notices this and start to pursue Bimbo. Whilst the police officer is doing that, Bimbo is attempting to charm another girl, by whistling at her and putting his arm around her. This ends in the flowers on the girl's hat comically turning into a fist and then striking Bimbo in the head. Bimbo then tries to kiss the girl, whilst calling her \"his sweetheart\". This ends with the girl's shoes turning into roller skates and she skates away from Bimbo. When he is trying to catch her, the police officer spots him, and tries to get him. Bimbo tries to walk away, but ends up in a police march. The band play \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" whilst going to the station. Bimbo then ends up in court. The judge asks him to explain his presence. Bimbo, then brings out his banjo, and starts to play \"St. Louis Blues\". The entire court starts to dance to the song, with the Liberty painting on the wall comically dancing as well. He then starts to sing. His testimony is recording as squatting, due to its presences in the song that he is singing. He then gets on the judge's desk and continues to scat and then he comically uses the judge's beard as a banjo, which angers the judge. He then bounces on his banjo and tips his hat to the entire court. The film ends with Bimbo comically leaving the court house riding his banjo like a unicycle.\n\nIn this film, there is a plethora of characters. One of them is Bimbo, who is the main character in the film. Bimbo tries multiple times to gain a lover, however he fails at doing so and ends up in court. There are also the police officers, who attempt to pursue him throughout the film. There are also the women, who Bimbo attempts to charm them throughout the film. The film features both humans and animals, as the court room is entire consisted all humans, whilst the streets are all animal.\n\n\"Hot Dog\" was well received by the cinema magazine \"Variety\". The magazine said that the film was \"Quite a laugh\", and also said that the film possesses a \"real hot quality\".\n\n"}
{"id": "11230933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11230933", "title": "Hugo (video game)", "text": "Hugo (video game)\n\nThere are several Hugo video games based on early episodes of ITE's television show \"Hugo\" and are a part of the international \"Hugo\" franchise. From 1992 to 2000, ITE developed and released versions for Amiga, Commodore 64 and PC, as well as for PlayStation consoles, exclusively for European markets. Since 2011, Krea Media / Hugo Games published a series of mobile game remakes for Android. An online slot machine adaptation was also released in 2016.\n\nThe games closely resemble the early editions of the TV show they have been adapted from; in almost all of them, the player guides the titular protagonist (a small, friendly troll named Hugo) to save his wife and children from the evil witch Scylla. To rescue his family, Hugo must navigate safely through dangerous environments in various minigame scenarios.\n\nTwo Amiga games, \"Hugo\" (originally titled Hugo - På Nye Eventyr: Del 1) and its sequel, Hugo 2 (originally Hugo - På Nye Eventyr: Del 2) were released in 1992. These were re-released as a 1994 compilation, \"Hugo\" (Hugo På Nye Eventyr), and ported to the PC in 1995-1996. Both games were similar to the television show where the contestant would try to completes arcade sequences to collect points and avoid obstacles using a phone, and the ending minigames are identical to the ones seen on TV. Later PC releases included Hugo 3 to Hugo 6, Hugo: Wild River (1998), and their upgraded compilations Hugo Gold (1998), Hugo Platin (1999) and Hugo XL (1999).\n\nSeveral of the releases were partially incorporated into 2000's \"Hugo - Die Geburtstagsparty\" and \"Hugo Safari\" (both of which were also based on newer \"Hugo\" works) and the \"Hugo Classic Collection\" (compiling the first titles). The latter consisted of seven or eight releases (depending of country): \"Hugo Classic 1-4\", based on the original series, and \"Hugo Classic 5-6\" based on the \"\" series.\n\nThe two PlayStation games, which reused the titles \"Hugo\" and \"Hugo 2\", are compilation remakes of the computer games. They feature improved graphics and sound (including musical tracks for each stage), and also a rendered opening animation in \"Hugo 2\". In 1997, \"Hugo 2\" was also ported by Laguna and Infogrames to the Game Boy. \"Hugo 2\" features simplified graphics and gameplay. The game was later ported to the Game Boy Color by Bit Managers and Infogrames in 1999 under the title Hugo 2½.\n\nIn the games' story, a horrible witch named Scylla (also known as Sculla and named differently in some countries, including \"Afskylia\" in the original Danish version, and resembling the Dark Queen from \"Battletoads\") arrives at the home of Hugo the troll and kidnaps his wife Hugoline and their three young children (Rit, Rat and Rut) because she needs them for a magical beauty treatment. Hugo must rescue Hugolina and the children and defeat the villainess to bring peace to the woods.\n\nThe player must complete a number of minigames and guessing games; most have 2.5D graphics and are controlled with button presses as Scylla the witch watches Hugo's progress and casts spells to stop him from reaching her lair in the Skull Cave at a mountain peak. During the games Hugo (voiced in Danish by Michael Brockdorf and German by Michael Habeck, Oliver Grimm and Oliver Baier) and Scylla (voiced in Danish by Winnie Engell and in German by Karin Kernke) communicate with the player with digitized speech, and can also knock on (or scratch) the screen from the inside, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nIn order of release:\n\n\nIf the players manage to complete the journey and reach their destination, Hugo proceeds to one of the final minigames:\n\n\nSome games feature alternative final minigames that do not take place in Scylla's lair:\n\nThe games received mixed and often negative reviews. According to Francisco Delgada from Spanish magazine \"pcmanía\", while \"Hugo\" is \"not a bad game\", it is \"a bit bland and repetitive, especially since the video game version only differs from television [game] in its difficulty\". Arkadiusz Matczyński from Polish magazine \"Świat Gier Komputerowych\" recommended it as a \"fantastic\" game for younger Amiga users, but noted the more mature audience might get bored quickly. Other reviewers were harsher. Mike Goldsmith from \"Arcade\" wrote about the PlayStation releases: \"Advertised as being 'designed for children aged 6+', \"Hugo\" will come off as simplistic at best, patronising at worst - a real shame given the quality of edutainment titles that could be ported from PC and Mac\". Nevertheless, the games were a commercial success. The original PC release has remained Germany's #1 best-selling PC floppy disk game for a long time, including in March 1995, June 1995, July 1995, October 1995, and November 1995. Retrospectively, \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" listed Hugo, described as \"bloody rubbish\", atop its list of worst PlayStation characters. In 2012, \"Game Informer\" made a Replay-section retro video poking fun at the PlayStation \"Hugo\" and \"Bubsy 3D\".\n\n\"Hugo\" online slot game based on the game was developed by Play’n GO in 2016 (in Denmark it was released exclusively for RoyalCasino.dk). Its story involves finding treasures in a mine and rescuing Hugolina from Afskylia/Scylla.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "413066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=413066", "title": "Impresario", "text": "Impresario\n\nAn impresario (from the Italian \"impresa\", \"an enterprise or undertaking\") is a person who organizes and often finances concerts, plays, or operas, performing a role similar to that of an artist manager or a film or television producer. The term “impresario” was used by the Spanish, and then English-speaking settlers of the Pacific Northwest to describe, “one who brought a new community into being and managed affairs to ensure its prosperity.”\n\nThe term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera, in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season. The owners of the theatre, usually amateurs from the nobility, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk. In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce \"Der Schauspieldirektor\" (\"The Impresario\"). Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera \"Orlando finto pazzo\" was followed by numerous others.\n\nAlessandro Lanari (1787–1852), who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes, eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the Teatro La Pergola, in Florence, which presented the premieres of the first version of Verdi's \"Macbeth\", two of Bellini's operas and five of Donizetti's, including \"Lucia di Lammermoor\". Domenico Barbaia (1778–1841) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at La Scala, in Milan, where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced roulette.\n\nDuchess Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg was a harpsichordist who also presided over seventeenth-century North German court music as an impresario.\n\nThe traditional term is still used in the entertainment industry to refer to a producer of concerts, tours and other events in music, opera, theatre and even rodeo. Important modern impresarios in the traditional sense include Thomas Beecham, Rudolf Bing, Sergei Diaghilev, Richard D'Oyly Carte, Fortune Gallo, Sol Hurok, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Aaron Richmond, and jazz festival producer George Wein. Bill Graham, who produced music shows at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, was known as a rock music impresario.\n\nWhile the term is not often used for women, a modern example of a female impresario would be Vivianne Westwood, who was largely responsible for bringing modern punk and new wave fashions into the mainstream.\n\nThe term is occasionally applied to others, such as independent art museum curators and conference organizers who have a leading role in orchestrating events.\n\nJacques-Yves Cousteau said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration. Nicholas Wade described James D. Watson and E. O. Wilson in \"The New York Times\" as impresarios of Charles Darwin's works.\n\n"}

Held annually in the years 1984–1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004–2006, 2011–2015 and then in 2018, it is described as \"celebrating [C's] syntactical opaqueness\". The winning code for the 25th contest, held in 2018, was released in May 2018.\n\nEntries are evaluated anonymously by a panel of judges. The judging process is documented in the competition guidelines and consists of elimination rounds. By tradition, no information is given about the total number of entries for each competition. Winning entries are awarded with a category, such as \"Worst Abuse of the C preprocessor\" or \"Most Erratic Behavior\", and then announced on the official IOCCC website. The contest states that being announced on the IOCCC website is the reward for winning.\n\nThe IOCCC was started by Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel in 1984 while employed at National Semiconductor's Genix porting group. The idea for the contest came after they compared notes with each other about some poorly written code that they had to fix, notably the Bourne shell, which used macros to emulate ALGOL 68 syntax, and buggy version of finger for BSD. The contest itself was the topic of a quiz question in the 1993 Computer Bowl. After a hiatus of five years starting in 2006, the contest returned in 2011.\n\nCompared with other programming contests, the IOCCC is described as \"not all that serious\" by Michael Swaine, editor of \"Dr. Dobbs\".\n\nEach year, the rules of the contest are published on the IOCCC website. Rules vary from year to year and are posted with a set of guidelines that attempt to convey the spirit of the rules.\n\nThe rules are often deliberately written with loopholes that contestants are encouraged to find and abuse. Entries that take advantage of loopholes can cause the rules for the following year's contest to be adjusted.\n\nEntries often employ strange or unusual tricks, such as using the C preprocessor to do things it was not designed to do, or avoiding commonly used constructs in the C programming language in favor of much more obscure ways of achieving the same thing. Two contest winners generated a list of prime numbers using the C preprocessor \"spectacularly\", according to \"Dr. Dobbs\". Some quotes from 2004 winners include:\n\nContributions have included source code formatted to resemble images, text, etc., after the manner of ASCII art, preprocessor redefinitions to make code harder to read, and self-modifying code. In several years, an entry was submitted that required a new definition of some of the rules for the next year. This is regarded as a high honor. An example is the world's shortest self-reproducing program. The entry was a program designed to output its own source code, and which had zero bytes of source code. When the program ran, it printed out zero bytes, equivalent to its source code.\n\nIn the effort to take obfuscation to its extremes, contestants have produced programs which skirt around the edges of C standards, or result in constructs which trigger rarely used code path combinations in compilers. As a result, several of the past entries may not compile directly in a modern compiler, and some may cause crashes.\n\nWithin the code size limit of only a few kilobytes, contestants have managed to do complicated things – a 2004 winner turned out an operating system.\n\n\"Toledo Nanochess\" is a chess engine developed by Mexican Oscar Toledo Gutiérrez, a five-time winner of the IOCCC. In accordance with IOCCC rules, it is 1255 characters long. The author claims that it is the world's smallest chess program written in C.\n\nThe source code for \"Toledo Nanochess\" and other engines is available.\nBecause \"Toledo Nanochess\" is based on Toledo's winning entry from the 18th IOCCC (Best Game), it is heavily obfuscated.\n\nOn February 2, 2014, the author published the book \"Toledo Nanochess: The commented source code\", which contains the fully commented source code.\n\nAs of February 7, 2010, it appears to be one of only two chess engines written in less than 2 kilobytes of C that are able to play full legal chess moves, along with \"Micro-Max\" by Dutch physicist H. G. Muller. In 2014 the 1 kilobyte barrier has been broken by \"Super Micro Chess\" – a derivative of Micro-Max – totaling 760 characters (spaces and newlines included).

{"id": "477374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477374", "title": "Jean Rouch", "text": "Jean Rouch\n\nJean Rouch (; 31 May 1917 – 18 February 2004) was a French filmmaker and anthropologist.\n\nHe is considered to be one of the founders of cinéma-vérité in France. Rouch's practice as a filmmaker, for over sixty years in Africa, was characterized by the idea of \"shared anthropology\". \n\nInfluenced by his discovery of surrealism in his early twenties, many of his films blur the line between fiction and documentary, creating a new style: ethnofiction. He was hailed by the French New Wave as one of theirs. His seminal film \"Me a Black\" (\"Moi, un noir\") pioneered the technique of jump cut popularized by Jean-Luc Godard. Godard said of Rouch in the Cahiers du Cinéma (\"Notebooks on Cinema\") n°94 April 1959, \"In charge of research for the Musée de l'Homme (French, \"Museum of Man\") Is there a better definition for a filmmaker?\"\n\nJean Rouch began his long association with African subjects in 1941, when he arrived in Niamey as a French colonial hydrology engineer to supervise a construction project in Niger. \n\nThere he met Damouré Zika, the son of a Songhai traditional healer and fisherman, near the town of Ayorou, on the Niger River. After ten Sorko workers were killed by a lightning strike in a construction depot which Rouch supervised, Zika's grandmother, a famous possession medium and spiritual advisor, presided over a ritual for men, which Rouch later claimed sparked his desire to make ethnographic film. He became interested in Zarma and Songhai ethnology. He filmed the rituals and ceremonies of the Songhai people. During his work in Niger, Jean Rouch documented such events and sent his work to Marcel Griaule, his teacher, who encouraged him to continue his work with the Songhai and go deeper into his studies.\n\nShortly afterwards he returned to France to participate in the Resistance. After the war, he did a brief stint as a journalist with Agence France-Presse before returning to Africa where he became an influential anthropologist and sometimes controversial filmmaker. \n\nDamouré Zika and Rouch became friends. In 1950, Rouch started to use Zika as the central character of his films, registering the traditions, culture, and ecology of the people of the Niger River valley. The first film in which Zika appeared was \"Bataille sur le grand fleuve\" (1950–52), portraying the life, ceremonies and hunting of Sorko fishermen. Rouch spent four months travelling with Sorko fishermen in a traditional pirogue. \n\nHis early films-such as Hippopotamus Hunt (Chasse à l'Hippopotame, 1946), Cliff Cemetery (Cimetière dans la Falaise, 1951), The Rain Makers ( Les Hommes Qui la Pluie, 1951)- were traditional, narrated reports, but he gradually became an innovative influence. \n\nRouch made his first films in Niger: \"Au pays des mages noirs\" (1947), \"Initiation à la danse des possédés\" (1948) and \"Les magicians de Wanzarbé\" (1949), all of which documented the spirit possession rituals of the Songhai, Zarma, and Sorko, peoples living along the Niger River. Jean Rouch is generally considered the father of Nigerien cinema. Despite arriving as a colonialist in 1941, Rouch remained in Niger after independence and mentored a generation of Nigerien filmmakers and actors, including Damouré Zika.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Rouch began to produce longer ethnographic films. In 1954 he filmed Damouré Zika in \"\", as a young Songhai man traveling for work to the Gold Coast. Three men dramatized their real-life roles in the film, and went on to become one of the first three actors of Nigerien cinema. Filmed as a silent ethnographic piece, Zika helped re-edit the film into a feature-length movie which stood somewhere between documentary and fiction (docufiction), and provided dialogue and commentary for a 1969 release. In 1957 Rouch directed in Côte d'Ivoire \"Moi un noir\" with the young Nigerien filmmaker Oumarou Ganda, who had recently returned from French military service in Indochina. Ganda went on to become the first great Nigerien film director and actor. By the early 1970s, Rouch, with cast, crew, and co-writing from his Nigerien collaborators, was producing full-length dramatic films in Niger, such as \"\" (\"Little by Little\" : 1971) and \"\" (\"Cocka-doodle-doo Mr. Chicken\": 1974).\n\nStill, many of the ethnographic films produced in the colonial era by Jean Rouch and others were rejected by African filmmakers because in their view they distorted African realities.\n\nHe is considered as one of the pioneers of Nouvelle Vague, of visual anthropology and the father of ethnofiction. Rouch's films mostly belonged to the \"cinéma-vérité\" school – a term that Edgar Morin used in a 1960 France-Observateur article referring to the Kino-Pravda newsreels of Dziga Vertov. His best-known film, one of the central works of the Nouvelle Vague, is \"Chronique d'un été\" (1961) which he filmed with sociologist Edgar Morin and in which he portrays the social life of contemporary France. Throughout his career, he used his camera to report on life in Africa. Over the course of five decades, he made almost 120 films.\n\nWith Jean-Michel Arnold he founded the international documentary film festival, the Cinéma du Réel, at the Pompidou Centre in Paris in 1978. \n\nHe died in a car accident in February 2004, 16 kilometres from the town of Birni-N'Konni, Niger.\n\nIn her 2017 essay \"How the Art World, and Art Schools, Are Ripe for Sexual Abuse,\" contemporary artist Coco Fusco details an early encounter with Rouch: \"I was sexually accosted by the renowned ethnographic filmmaker Jean Rouch, who is credited with having invented a better way to look at Africans.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dockstader performed as a solo act and in his own a popular minstrel troupe.\n\nHe was born George Alfred Clapp on August 7, 1856 in Hartford, Connecticut to Chester Clapp and Sarah Reed. He married Lucin Brown on December 20, 1883 in Hartford and had a daughter, Mildred Havlin Clapp, who married Warren Palmer.\n\nIn 1898 he teamed up with George Primrose to form \"Primrose and Dockstader's Minstrel Men\", which toured the vaudeville circuit till 1904.\n\nDockstader appeared on film in a number of comedy shorts from 1904 to 1907. \n\nOn May 20, 1904 Dockstader was detained by the New York City Police Department for attempting to distribute a film \"intended to caricature [President Theodore Roosevelt] and the office you hold.\" The film was \"in the possession of the Edison Kinetoscope people and, if they had not been taken in hand at once, would undoubtedly have had a wide circulation through the various agencies and mechanism of that large organization.\" Dockstader agreed to surrender the film to the New York City Police in exchange for the charges against him being dropped.\n\nUnfazed by his detention in 1904, in 1906 Dockstader began impersonating Theodore Roosevelt as part of his vaudeville show. He claimed that Roosevelt had personally given him permission to do the impression. \n\nThree years later, while Roosevelt was in British East Africa as part of the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition he commissioned a writer to prepare a sketch entitled \"Dockstader in Africa, or Rescuing Roosevelt.\" He failed to pay the writer and was sued for non-payment. The sketch was never performed. \n\nHe played the title role in the 1914 feature silent film \"Dan\".\n\nHis wife died in 1919. In January 1923 he was injured in a fall in New Brunswick, New Jersey from his nascent cancer. His last performance was at Keith's Star Theater in December 1923. He died on October 26, 1924 in New York City of bone cancer on his left leg, at age 68. His funeral was at All Angels' Church and he was buried in Kensico Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20155503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20155503", "title": "Nik Wallenda", "text": "Nik Wallenda\n\nNikolas \"Nik\" Wallenda (born January 24, 1979) is an American acrobat, aerialist, daredevil, high wire artist, and author. He is known for his high-wire performances without a safety net. He holds nine Guinness World Records for various acrobatic feats, but is best known as the first person to walk a tightrope stretched directly over Niagara Falls.\n\nWallenda is a seventh-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family, and he participated in various circus acts as a child. He made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13, and he chose high-wire walking as his career in 1998 after joining family members in a seven-person pyramid on the wire. In 2001, he was part of the world's first eight-person high-wire pyramid. He performed with his family at various venues from 2002 to 2005, forming his own troupe in 2005. He performed with Bello Nock in 2007 and 2008 in a double version of the Wheel of Steel that he helped invent. In 2009, he set new personal bests for highest and longest tightrope walks, completing a total of 15 walks above in the air that year.\n\nIn 2008, Wallenda set Guinness World Records for longest and highest bicycle ride on a high-wire ride at above the ground in New Jersey. He nearly doubled the height record in 2010 to . On the same day in 2010, he upped his personal best by tightrope walking over in a single performance. He set a world record in 2011 by performing on the Wheel of Death atop the 23 story Tropicana Casino and Resort. Later that year, he and his mother tightrope walked between the two towers of Condado Plaza Hotel in Puerto Rico. The feat was a re-creation of the one that killed Karl Wallenda, Nik's great-grandfather and primary source of inspiration. On June 10, 2011, Wallenda hung from a helicopter off the ground using only his toes to hold on.\n\nWallenda crossed Niagara Falls on June 15, 2012 on a live ABC special, following a two year legal battle involving both sides of the Canada–United States border to gain approval. He was required to wear a safety harness for the first time in his life. A reality show aired on the Science Channel which followed his feats. In 2013, he released a memoir entitled \"Balance\". He became the first person to high-wire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge on June 23, 2013, crossing the Little Colorado River outside Grand Canyon National Park; the feat aired live on Discovery. He followed that up with \"Skyscraper Live\", a live Discovery special that aired on November 2, 2014, in which he completed two tightrope walks and set two new Guinness World Records: one for walking the steepest tightrope incline between two buildings, and the other for the highest tightrope walk while blindfolded. \n\nWallenda is married with three children, and considers his Christian faith to be a central aspect of his life.\n\nWallenda is a seventh-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family of aerialists. His ancestors were primarily of Austro-Hungarian descent and have been circus performers since the 1700s; they have been doing balancing acts without nets since Karl Wallenda made the family famous for the feat in the 1920s. Nik Wallenda is a direct descendant of Karl, whom he calls his role model and his \"biggest hero in life\". Several members of the family have lost their lives while training or performing. In 1962, the troupe's famous seven-person pyramid collapsed, killing two family members and paralyzing Wallenda's uncle Mario. In 1978, Karl Wallenda died after falling from a tight rope at age 73 in Puerto Rico.\n\nWallenda was born in Sarasota, Florida on January 24, 1979 to Delilah Wallenda and Terry Troffer. His parents bought him a swing set when he was two. Before Troffer had even finished assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. Around the same time, he began performing with his family in their circus act. His first public performance was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. He would play on his parents' practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet off the ground. His parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America.\n\nWallenda transitioned from being a clown to juggling to a dog act. He made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13. When he graduated from high school, his parents encouraged him to go to college and explore his options. With live circus losing popularity, becoming a performer did not seem like a viable career path.\n\nWallenda briefly considered becoming a doctor, and was accepted into college. However, his plans changed in 1998 when he participated in a re-creation of Karl Wallenda's seven-person pyramid on the high-wire in Detroit, alongside his father, mother, and other family members.\n\nNik Wallenda has produced a variety of large-scale productions for amusement parks and similar venues in several countries. The acts often feature him alongside family members, especially his wife Erendira. Wallenda's children are sometimes part of the act. His youngest child, Evita, has been performing balancing feats since she would balance in the palm of her father's hand at six months old. Wallenda's shows have incorporated water and diving feats, the Wheel of Death, incline motorcycles, aerial silk and hoop, the Globe of Death, and of course the high-wire. \"We've performed nearly every circus or daredevil skill there is,\" claims Wallenda. \"I like to mix it up\", he says. \"It keeps [our family] on our toes and gives the public something new to see every year.\" Wallenda's father, Terry Troffer, serves as his safety coordinator, having retired from acrobatics after 36 years in the business. Troffer's brother Mike serves as chief engineer. Wallenda has never had a serious accident, describing the worst injury of his life as a broken toe while playing football.\nWallenda performs without a safety net or harness. \"My great-grandfather taught that safety nets offer a false sense of security,\" he explains. He notes that a safety net is no guarantee – an uncle was killed while performing despite falling into a safety net. However, he says he does not have a \"death wish in any way. I plan on living and dying a natural death when I'm old.\" Asked about fear, he remarked \"I would say the only thing I fear is God\". He adds that his Christian faith allows him to \"know where I'm going to go when I die ... I'm not scared of dying.\"\n\nWallenda says that the high-wire performance is not a daredevil act or a mere stunt, but rather an athletic feat requiring great physical training. \"I see a stunt as somebody who gets in a barrel and goes over the edge and hopes they don't hit a rock,\" he said commenting on his walk across Niagara Falls. \"What I do is very calculated. I train a long time for it and I consider it more of an art. I guess I don't get offended by [people] calling it a stunt, but to me it's more of an art than anything.\" He aims to be \"over-prepared\" for every event he does, training six hours a day, six days a week. He does ten hours of weight training and five hours of aerobic exercise each week. Even so, he says wire walking is primarily a mental skill.\n\nWallenda has developed several tricks that he often incorporates into his high-wire routine including stopping to make a phone call, sitting on the wire, and lying down on the wire. He is said to be \"obsessed\" with the technological aspects of his acts, insisting on calculating every detail himself. When asked why he risks his life on the high-wire, he replied \"I do this because I love what I do ... If I won the lottery tomorrow, I'd still be doing what I do.\" \"Walking the wire to me is life,\" he adds. Wallenda and his family spend roughly 48 weeks per year on the road.\n\nAs of 2013, Wallenda has a contract with the Discovery Channel for near-exclusive broadcast of his acts. He carries a US$20-million insurance policy. He has called his career \"extremely lucrative, more lucrative than I would have ever dreamed of.\" He plans to retire at age 50.\n\nIn 2001, Wallenda appeared with seven other family members at Japan's Kurashiki Tivoli Park in an attempt at the world's first ever eight-person high-wire pyramid. After five months of four hours per day, six days a week preparation, the family successfully walked across a tightrope in six minutes, setting a Guinness World Record. Nik Wallenda cited Karl Wallenda as the primary inspiration for the feat, and stated, \"It was a landmark experience for our profession, as well as our family and me personally.\"\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, Wallenda performed alongside his wife, children, and other family members at Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe in Greensboro, North Carolina. They also toured the United States as part of various circuses. One early act featured Wallenda riding a motorcycle across the high-wire in the air. In 2005, Wallenda and his wife, Erendira, took their act to Raging Waters in San Dimas, California, while his mother and sister stayed at Wet 'n Wild. Throughout this time period, Wallenda continued to participate in the family's signature seven-person pyramid.\n\nIn 2006, McDonald's sponsored a show in Detroit. To promote the restaurant's new coffee, Nik Wallenda and his older sister Lijana did an act where they met in the middle of a high-wire and sat down to have some coffee, after starting on opposite ends. After exchanging several toasts, Nik stood up and stepped over his sister. As the siblings headed back to their platforms, a crane winch malfunctioned, preventing Lijana from exiting the wire. After Nik descended to the ground, a crane was moved to reduce the tension on the wire and he rode a hook up to rescue his sister.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, Wallenda was a featured performer in the Ringling Brothers production \"Bellobration\", performing with Bello Nock on a newly contrived, double version of the Wheel of Steel. At the beginning of the act, Wallenda and Nock stood balanced atop twin circles 39 feet in the air. To the audience, the circles appeared to be connected until the act started with a burst of fireworks. The wheels then split, sending the performers in opposite directions without safety nets or harnesses. To stay on the device, the duo had to move in unison, running at up to 20 miles an hour. Vibrations were transferred from one wheel to the other, meaning each performer was affected by what the other was doing. At the top of each arc the performers were rendered weightless, while being subjected to several times the force of gravity at the bottom.\nThe act was set around a story line. During the first half of the circus, Wallenda's wife, Erendira, played the love interest of Nock. After intermission, Wallenda and Nock \"battled\" it out on the Wheel, competing for her heart. To enhance the entertainment value, they mixed jumping rope, somersaults, and leaps into the routine. In all, the Wheel performance lasted seven minutes.\n\nAlso part of the same show was a sway pole performance by Nock and Wallenda's wife. Using poles that swayed as much as in all directions, the couple did a series of tricks that included climbing up and sliding down the poles, swinging all around, and jumping from pole to pole. In all, sixteen members of the Wallenda family were part of \"Bellobration\".\n\nThe double Wheel of Steel was invented by Wallenda and Nock. The two had grown up together in Sarasota and had talked about teaming up for years before coming up with the double Wheel concept, drawing up the initial plans on a tablecloth during dinner in 2005. They then spent nine months building the device in Nock's backyard workshop, and a further four months testing it and designing a performance. The greatest challenge was to find a way to split the wheels while they were still spinning. \"There were a lot of back-to-the-drawing-board moments\", Wallenda later recalled. Ultimately, the problem was solved via a system of piston-like pneumatic cylinders. Wallenda's uncle, Timothy Stephenson, who is an engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), suggested that an axle be built of custom-blended, hardened steel alloy to keep it from breaking. In the end, the device cost more than $100,000 to produce.\n\nOn October 15, 2008, Wallenda performed on a live broadcast of \"Today\". The plan was to walk and then bicycle off the roof of the Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135 feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the cable with a balancing pole. Halfway through, he sat down on the wire and called the \"Today\" show hosts. \"Where are you?\" he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. \"I actually slipped,\" he said later. \"I lost focus there for a moment\" because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.\n\nWallenda then crossed the high-wire on an ordinary bicycle with the tires and handlebars removed. Near completion, he paused, causing the bike to slide backward as it lost grip on the wire. He regained control and finished, then jumped onto the roof of Prudential Center and hugged his wife and three children. He explained in an interview: \"The back wheel started to slip ... It was a little nerve-racking at the end.\" Five years later, he said the slip was closest he ever came to disaster. \"It really shook me up\", he recalled. By completing the ride, Wallenda set the world record for both highest and longest bike ride on a high-wire. A representative from Guinness World Records was on hand to present him with a certificate documenting the achievement.\n\nIn 2009, Wallenda took his high-wire act to ten Cedar Fair amusement parks in what was dubbed as the \"Walk Across America Tour\". The tour began with a walk at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City and ended at Carowinds, where Wallenda twice walked across the North Carolina-South Carolina state line on the high-wire. As part of the tour, he walked at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio from the front gate to the Eiffel Tower on August 15. Traveling at above the ground, it was the highest walk of his career at the time. He completed the walk in about 25 minutes as several thousand people watched.\nOn July 3, Wallenda wire walked over the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh as the headline act of the 2009 Three Rivers Regatta. He paused several times during the performance to kneel and wave to the crowd. At one point, he had to stop for a few minutes to regain his balance in the strong winds and rain. Although Wallenda's team had ordered an ungreased wire, it was covered in oil when it arrived. To compensate, Wallenda did the walk in his socks rather than in his tightrope shoes. At , the 25-minute walk was the longest of his career to that point.\n\nIn total, Wallenda completed 15 high-wire performances at 100 or more feet in the air during 2009. In 2010, he performed in his home town of Sarasota for the first time. On February 4, he walked from the roof of One Watergate Condominium to the roof of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel. The performance lasted 12 minutes and was aired on national television. From February 12–28, he anchored a version of The Flying Wallenda seven-person pyramid at Circus Sarasota.\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Wallenda performed at the Atlantis Paradise Island resort in the Bahamas. For the first part of his act, he rode a bicycle along a high-wire above the ocean. The ride set a new Guinness World Record for highest bike ride on a high-wire, nearly doubling Wallenda's own record from 2008. Following the bike ride, Wallenda tightrope walked over the resort's marine habitat filled with barracuda, piranha, and sharks. It was the longest walk of his career.\n\nBetween the morning bike ride and the late afternoon tightrope walk, Wallenda's father and safety coordinator Terry passed out from a combination of heat and stress and was rushed to the hospital. Performing without his father watching \"was one of the hardest decisions I ever made in my life\", Wallenda said, \"but my family history and my family tradition is that the show must go on.\" It was the first time in his career that he performed without the assistance of his father. In addition, he had to battle rain, strong winds, and lightning in the area to complete the feats.\n\nOn April 28, 2011, Wallenda visited the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey for a pair of performances. In the first, he walked a tightrope inside the casino's shopping center. Performing with a balancing pole, in the air, he dropped to one knee and then onto his back during the performance. He walked both forwards and backwards before completing the journey. Afterwards, Wallenda said he had previously noted the casino's raised ceiling painted with a sky scene and said to himself \"I've gotta walk there!\"\n\nLater in the day, Wallenda went outside to perform the Wheel of Death off the roof and over the side of the casino's 23rd floor. In the act, he walked inside the wheel for roughly 10 rotations, then climbed atop it where he walked and jumped rope around it. Part of the act, he performed blindfolded. The performance set a world record for the greatest height at which the Wheel had ever been performed. It was also the first time anyone had performed the act off the side of a building.\n\nOn June 4, 2011, Wallenda completed a high-wire crossing between the two towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The performance was a recreation of the act that had killed his great grandfather Karl Wallenda in 1978. For the performance, Wallenda's mother, Delilah (Karl's granddaughter), joined him. The mother and son team started at opposite ends of the wire. When Delilah reached the middle of the wire, roughly the spot Karl had fallen, she sat down on the wire and Nik stepped over her before the two continued to opposite ends of the wire. At one point during the performance, Nik knelt down on the wire and blew a kiss in honor of his great-grandfather's memory.\n\nAfter the feat, Wallenda said he was \"not scared at all,\" but admitted that the circumstances of Karl's death had haunted him for years. \"This has been a dream of mine to recreate this walk\", he explained. \"To be able to walk in his exact footsteps is an extremely huge honor, and I did this for him as much as I did it for my family to get some closure.\" He also called the walk the biggest and most emotional moment of his career to that point. \"I can't even put it into words. It was so emotional\", he said a week later.\n\nOn June 10, 2011, Wallenda performed while hanging from a helicopter above Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri. First he hung from a trapeze with two arms, then one arm, then his legs, and finally by his teeth. In so doing, Wallenda set his sixth world record. He called it his most difficult feat to date, and remarked that training \"was very difficult. It was very painful. I had neck problems for months afterwards\".\n\nFor the next couple months, Wallenda performed daily shows at Silver Dollar City with his family. The highlight of the show was a three-person \"Chair Pyramid\" on the high-wire. Wallenda and Jonah Finkelstein rode bicycles across the wire while Delilah Wallenda sat in a chair atop a balance bar they carried. In the middle of the performance, Wallenda would purposely act like he was losing control and move the balance bar erratically to heighten the drama. He would then shout \"Watch it, Mom!\" before regaining control. Acting off balance was the hardest part of the act, according to Wallenda.\n\nOn February 15, 2012, Nik Wallenda received official approval from Ontario's Niagara Parks Commission (NPC) to walk a tightrope across Niagara Falls, a dream he had had since he was a child. The plan called for crossing the Niagara River and its deep gorge from the American side at Goat Island or at the smaller Luna Island, and making his way across the river to land at the Canadian side near the site of Table Rock. The American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls would be behind him and to his right, while the Canadian Falls would be on his immediate left and behind.\n\nThe approval came after nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the executive vice president of Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. Trevino later recalled: \"I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have you ever thought about walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever since I was a little kid,’ and then he asked about the steps involved.\" Wallenda later remarked \"I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously because you just never know [who you are talking to]\". Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011.\n\nOn the Canadian side, things went less smoothly. In June 2011, public statements by NPC board members made it clear that they were opposed to Wallenda's plan. After an October meeting with Wallenda, the twelve-person board voted on December 7 to maintain their anti-stunting rules. NPC officials, led by chair Janice Thomson, feared Wallenda's plan could bring back the days when amateur daredevils routinely got themselves injured or killed at the Falls, and also believed it would cheapen the area's natural beauty. \"It's sensationalism, and that's not what the falls is supposed to be about,\" said Thomson. In response, Wallenda funded an economic impact survey conducted by Enigma Research. The results suggested direct revenue potential of $20.5 million for the city, with up to $122 million of \"legacy effects\" over the next five years. The survey also predicted worldwide viewership of 460 million people. Wallenda further promised to fund all the necessary safety-contingencies and to leave no footprint on the environment. Seeing the economic benefits, Ontario Minister of Tourism Michael Chan convinced the NPC to take a second look. On February 15, 2012, the commission voted unanimously to give Wallenda's plan the go ahead, provided that he paid rigging and commission costs of C$105,000. Wallenda described the legal battle as the biggest challenge of his career and \"probably more remarkable\" than the walk itself. He attributed the eventual success to divine intervention. \"God's hand is involved in every step of my life,\" he explained. \"I believe doors were opened for me that weren't opened for others\". Six previous high-profile wire walkers had failed in their attempts to gain approval to walk the Falls since 1971.\n\nIn preparation for the event, municipal authorities on both sides of the border met to discuss the long-term economic impact of the event, and how to capitalize efficiently on the large number of tourists expected at the Falls when it was held. The event was expected to bring in millions of dollars in tourist revenue on both sides of the border. The Niagara Parks Commission has stated it will be at least twenty years before another major stunt is approved.\nWallenda hopes that eventually he can make the Niagara Falls region a prominent aspect of his business. \"I do plan on spending a lot of time in this community,\" he told local reporters months before his historic walk. \"This isn't a one-off event where I'll show up and do an event and be gone. I would like to make this my second home and bring a full-time show here that I would be performing throughout the season along with all my family members as well.\"\n\nThe Discovery Channel had Wallenda under contract and negotiated with several of the major television networks for broadcast rights. On May 11, 2012, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Lincoln Square Productions announced they had secured worldwide broadcasting rights for the event. Josh Elliott and Hannah Storm were chosen to host the coverage. In Canada, CTV's coverage of the event, although a direct feed from ABC, invoked simultaneous substitution over ABC network broadcasts in some parts of Canada.\n\nOn his final performance before heading to Niagara for training, Wallenda walked above Baltimore's Inner Harbor. According to Wallenda, it was the first time anyone had attached a high-wire to a barge; he remarked that the configuration made the walk \"a little more unstable\" than normal. Near the end of the journey, he had a significant slip, but managed to regain his balance quickly. He called the slip \"a wake-up call\" for Niagara. \"My friend was up in the basket and I started talking to him, and it was just enough of a distraction\", he explained. \"The wire kind of moved a little bit and I just misstepped. It's why I've trained for so long: you stay on the wire. Your heart jumps up into your throat and two seconds later, you're fine.\" The May 9 event was sponsored by Ripley's Believe It or Not which was opening a museum on the harbor. When it opened it June, a feature exhibit allowed visitors to walk on a piece of the wire Wallenda had used in Baltimore.\n\nTo prepare for the Niagara event, Wallenda practiced in the parking lot of Seneca Niagara Casino for eleven straight days. He had fire trucks spray him with water and brought in a high-powered fan to try to simulate the conditions he would face over Niagara Falls. Practices were open to the public. Wallenda's safety coordinator and father, Terry Troffer, said the training was primarily mental. \"This is a mental game. It's convincing himself that ... it's just a different location,\" Troffer explained.\n\nEleven days before the scheduled walk date, Wallenda faced a new challenge. Official permits had not yet been granted in New York and park officials were threatening to cancel the event over payment issues. Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account to foot the bill. Permits were issued the next day. However, two days before the event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, \"the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract.\" However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were \"some tense moments\", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. Ultimately, a wire transfer by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side.\nOn the day of the walk, June 15, 2012, crowds estimated in the tens of thousands gathered on the American side of the falls. On the Canadian side, the crowd was estimated at 120,000 people. Due to the location, the wire could not use supports and had to be custom made. As a result, the wire was able to sway significantly in the breeze, making the crossing more difficult than it would have otherwise been. It was the first time in Wallenda's career that he performed without guy wire stabilizers. The wire was two inches (five centimeters) in diameter, significantly wider than the 5/8 of an inch wire Wallenda typically uses, and weighed roughly 8.5 tons (7,700 kg). The extra width was necessary to make the cable strong enough to withstand the tension required. Getting it across the Falls was a major technological challenge. On June 12, a helicopter flew a yellow rope across the canyon. The rope was attached to the steel high-wire and a giant winch was used to slowly pull the wire across as the crew slowly increased tension to support the increasing weight. Weighted pendulums were attached every to keep the wire from twisting.\n\nTo make the walk accessible to viewers worldwide, it was held after dark, with the first step coming at 10:16 p.m. local time (02:16 June 16 UTC). The time was also advantageous to Wallenda, as half of the volume of water going over the Falls is diverted for power generation purposes after dusk. Wallenda wore a microphone for the event which allowed Troffer to talk with him, while the public listened in, throughout the walk.\n\nWallenda's chosen path took him across the widest part of the falls. He slowly inched his way across the slippery wire, praying and praising Jesus Christ as he went. As he took his first steps over the water, walking on a downward slope, he told reporters, \"It's a beautiful view ... A dream in the making.\" Later he described the first step over the falls as the toughest part of his journey. \"Mentally, your mind goes, 'What are you doing?'\" he recalled. When he reached the midpoint, he was roughly lower than where he started due to the sag of the wire. The second half of the walk brought him uphill, back to the same elevation at which he began.\n\nWallenda did not falter or totter in the slightest during his walk, nor did he stop to do any extra tricks during the walk (as he often does). Talking to ABC reporters live, as he entered the final phase of the trip he admitted, \"I'm drained ... My hands are going numb. I feel like I'm getting weak.\" Later he said, \"my forearm just started to cramp worse than it ever has been before\", attributing it the stress of the day. Near the end, he stopped, got down on one knee, and blew a kiss to the crowd. He got up, pumped his fist, and ran the final few steps. He completed the crossing at 10:41 p.m. EDT, 25 minutes after he started. In so doing, Wallenda became the first person to cross directly over Niagara Falls on a high-wire. In the 1800s, a few tightrope walkers had crossed over the Niagara Gorge down river, but none had ever crossed directly over the Falls. He also set the world record for longest walk over a waterfall. Prior to Wallenda, the last person to cross the river on tightrope was James Hardy in 1896. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it to Canadian border guards waiting for him upon his arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.\n\nABC required Wallenda to wear a safety harness for the walk. After the decision was made in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: \"We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that.\" Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating \"It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything.\" The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt \"like a jackass\" wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. \"When I first found out about it, there was no doubt in my mind I was going to take it off\", he later said. \"But as [the event] got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity.\" He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. \"The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people,\" he said. \"If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me.\" In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.\nProject costs were between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's financial support (and with it, their demand of a safety harness). \"I'd dare say that never in the history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much,\" said Wallenda. The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. \"It's been a tough situation all around\", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the safety harness for inhibiting sponsorship deals. When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. He eventually met his goal of $50,000. Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables – one for the performance and a shorter one for practice – and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was \"clearly worth it\" in the long term. With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. \"I think people still have the impression that Nik Wallenda is going to walk away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case,\" he commented.\n\nAfter completing the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected. \"That mist was thick. It was hard to see at times. The wind was wild. It'd come at me one way and hit me from the front, and hit me from the back.\" Weather instruments showed gusts up to 14 mph during the walk. Wallenda further remarked that the turbulent waters below made it difficult for him to see the wire. Before the walk, Jay Cochrane, a veteran wire walker who had unsuccessfully petitioned to walk Horseshoe Falls for 30 years, said of the local weather \"Unpredictable is a mild word. It is unforgiving ... [Horseshoe Falls] can spray mist anywhere from 380 to 590 feet in the air. I've seen it, I've measured it.\" He added that walking Horseshoe Falls was an opportunity \"like none other in history.\" Long-time circus performer, Jackie LeClaire, remarked \"aerialists always try to calculate risk. Nik couldn't do that because this walk had never been done before.\" Local historian, Paul Gromosiak, who has researched daredevil activity in the Niagara region for his books, said Wallenda's proximity to the falls made his act far more dangerous than any prior act.\n\nAfter talking briefly with reporters, Wallenda called his grandmother, who reportedly had been too frightened to watch the walk, in order to let her know he made it safely. In a news conference shortly thereafter, Wallenda remarked \"I feel like I'm on cloud nine right now ... The impossible is not quite the impossible if you set your mind to it.\" He credited a combination of prayer, concentration, and preparation for his success.\nOn June 16, Engima Research estimated that one billion people had seen or heard about Wallenda's walk, up from an estimate of 410 million prior to the event. Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati declared that \"the stars aligned perfectly\" allowing the event hit its \"full potential.\" Media representatives from Australia, China, France, Germany, Great Britain, Korea, and the Middle East were on hand to cover the event. Overnight Nielsen Ratings indicated that the two-hour special was the most watched television broadcast in the United States for the night. Initial estimates put the show at a peak rating of 7.7, representing almost 13 million viewers during the last half-hour of the program. When final numbers were released, the viewership number was upped to 13.3 million for the final half-hour, and an average of 10.3 million for the entire two-hour special. Viewership peaked at around 16 million.\n\nIt was ABC's highest rated Friday night program since November 2007, and the highest non-sports summertime program on any of the major networks in six years. The program, together with the NBA finals, helped ABC beat their nearest competitor by 36% in total viewers and 88% in the important 18-49 demographic for the week. In Buffalo, New York the show peaked at a 48.5 rating/67 share for the last half-hour, meaning two out of every three TV viewers at the time in that area were watching the event. The rating possibly represented the highest summertime viewership for any program in history there. In Canada, the program averaged 3.9 million viewers, with viewership peaking as the walk ended with 6.8 million watching. The program set a new summertime record for most watched non-sports special. Viewership was highest in Toronto where the production brought in a 20.8 rating/50.4 share, meaning more than half of the city's television were tuned in.\n\nThe morning after walking Niagara Falls, Wallenda drove his family to the airport so they could rejoin the Fabulous Wallendas Famous Family Circus in Branson, Missouri. Later on June 16, Niagara Falls, New York, mayor Paul A. Dyster presented Wallenda with the key to the city. He also said that the city may erect a permanent memorial on Goat Island to document Wallenda's feat. Dyster had initially been skeptical of the event, but was won over by Wallenda's personality. \"The way he's been conducting himself since he's been in Niagara Falls has won him a lot of friends,\" Dyster explained. On the Canadian side, Diodati said he would like to erect a statue of Wallenda at Table Rock with a green screen photo booth to allow visitors to \"participate\" in the historic walk. On June 27, Janice Thomson said plans were in the works to install plaques near Table Rock and on White Water Walk. Previously, she described the event as a complete success, remarking that it had showcased the river's natural beauty to an international audience.\n\nOn July 20, it was revealed that Niagara Falls, New York, was attempting to bill Wallenda an additional $25,000 for police and fireman overtime. City officials cited the state law passed to allow the walk, which read \"Mr. Wallenda shall pay ... reasonable costs associated with security or law enforcement stemming from this activity\". Dyster said to forgive the alleged debt would amount to \"a gift of public funds\". Wallenda called the request \"disgusting and sad,\" saying \"This was a great thing for the area ... [They] gave me a key to the city, and now they want to ask for more money?\" He noted that the city staged a downtown festival to take advantage of the crowds, and said he should not have to pay the security costs related to the festival. His lawyer, John P. Bartolomei, said Wallenda was only responsible for money spent by the city in the park itself, which had already been more than paid. He also noted that Wallenda's contract was with the state parks commission, not the city itself. Senator Maziarz called the city's position \"shortsighted\" and accused Dyster of being \"disingenuous\". He noted that Dyster had been against the walk from the beginning and that the city had never tried to bill other entertainers for costs associated with their acts. On July 24, the city council passed a resolution encouraging Dyster to stop pursuing the alleged debt by a 4-1 margin. Dyster responded by stating he was legally obligated to continue his efforts, remarking \"Since the council didn't establish the fee I'm not sure if the council can forgive it\". He did, however, say he would ask the state comptroller for second opinion.\n\nOn the Canadian side, Diodati and the NPC said Wallenda had fulfilled all financial obligations. Diodati added that he was not billing Wallenda for $10,000 of unbudgeted costs incurred by the city. \"We're treating this event as an investment, not as an expense. We're quite happy with the way this turned out\", he said. Wallenda says that the experience has made him less likely to stage a permanent attraction on the American side of the falls.\nAccording to \"The Buffalo News\" Wallenda was seen picking up cigarette butts and other trash long after most of the media had left. He grabbed a shovel and helped fill in the hole left by apparatus. \"It's just something that has to be done,\" he said. \"I'm not scared of working.\" \"We take great pride in being a zero-impact operation\", he said prior to the event. A parks official said the area was clean and back to normal by 3 p.m. the day after the walk. Wallenda reiterated that he hopes to develop a lasting presence in Niagara Falls. \"There will always be a piece of my heart in Niagara Falls,\" he remarked. \"I do see a future here and hope to have a show in this area and hope to spend more time here.\" He did, however, rule out a repeat performance saying, \"No. That's not really my thing. I've done it. It's done.\"\n\nResearch released by Niagara University's Hospitality Training and Research Center on July 1, suggested that Wallenda's walk had brought in $3.3 million of revenue for the city of Niagara Falls, New York. The research indicated that 38,000 people gathered on the American side of the falls to watch the act, 41% of which were from out of town. Among the out-of-town visitors, 52% came specifically to see Wallenda. Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation reported that hotel bookings and related business was up 30% in the two weeks after the walk. Website traffic and sales of multiple attraction passes experienced similar increases. Data released by Smith Travel Research indicated that June hotel occupancy in Niagara Falls, New York, rose from 76.5 percent in 2011 to 81.6 percent in 2012.\n\nOn the Canadian side, no official effort was made to calculate the economic impact, although Enigma Research said the event \"might have done better\" than the $21.5 million the company estimated before the event. Wallenda's feat has also been credited with creating a \"surge of interest in circus and circus arts across the world\".\n\nA reality show, originally titled \"Danger By Design\", following Wallenda and his family premiered on The Science Channel on June 18, 2012. The show's pilot had previously aired in 2010 under the title \"Life on a Wire\", before Discovery decided to hold the show until after the Niagara Falls walk. The pilot episode, which tracked Wallenda's high-wire walk and bicycle ride in The Bahamas, was described as \"a sometimes painfully candid look at the creative tensions — and the strong familial bond — between Wallenda and his dad, Terry Troffer, who got so stressed out during preparations for that stunt he wound up in the hospital\" by the \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\". Later episodes showcased Wallenda hanging from a helicopter by his teeth, preparing for the Wheel of Death in Atlantic City, blowing himself up in a box, and retracing the steps of Karl Wallenda's fatal last act in Puerto Rico. The show focused on the science and engineering that go into Wallenda's acts.\n\nAfter two episodes had aired, the show was renamed \"Nik Wallenda: Beyond Niagara\". The next week, on July 2, it was put \"on hold\" by The Science Channel. Wallenda said the decision was \"not that surprising\" given the limited marketing efforts and multiple name changes. The Science Channel declined to comment on the decision.\n\nOn June 20, 2012, Wallenda rejoined his family in Branson. He was greeted by a parade in his honor at the Silver Dollar theme park. For Wallenda, it was back to business as usual. \"I never want to get complacent\", he said in a press release. \"I could get hurt just as easily on a wire here as walking over Niagara Falls.\"\n\nOn August 9, Wallenda conducted a tightrope walk across the Atlantic City beach from Sovereign Avenue to the Tropicana Resort, roughly in the air. According to him, the walk was a unique challenge due to potentially dangerous ocean winds. Additionally, Wallenda was surprised by the large amount of sand that stuck to the wire and considered cancelling as a result. \"I learned a lesson,\" he remarked. \"There was a lot of sand on the cable and it actually made it a little bit slippery, definitely eerie at the beginning\". Ultimately, he completed the half-hour walk without any visible difficulty. Large crowds were reported for the public event, with attendance estimates ranging from 100,000 to 150,000. Wallenda believes that the feat marked the first time that a wire walker attempted such a walk on any beach.\n\nThe beach walk was done to promote Wallenda's new show, \"Beyond the Falls: Nik Wallenda and the Wallenda Family Experience\", which premiered at the Tropicana Resort on August 12. The show featured Nik, wife Erendira, mother Delilah, cousin Blake, and about a dozen other performers in a variety of circus acts including contortion, quick-change artistry, and juggling. Michael Richter served as the lead clown and the show ended with the Wallendas doing a bicycle pyramid on the wire. Amy Rosenberg of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" described the show as \"an old fashion vaudeville variety act\" and remarked \"I dug the show and so did all the little kids around me\".\n\nOn June 4, 2013, Wallenda's memoir, \"Balance: A Story of Faith, Family, and Life on the Line\", was published by FaithWorks. Ghost written by David Ritz, the book details his family history, Christian faith, and his circus career. Ritz got in touch with Wallenda after his Niagara walk to pitch the idea. He then spent several months following Wallenda around and asking questions. Erendira, who has an excellent memory, supplied much of the dialogue.\n\n\"Balance\" weaves in themes of faith throughout, as it chronicles Wallenda's childhood, adolescence, and adult career, with particular emphasis on the ups and down of his marriage and personal life. It concludes with the Niagara Falls crossing. \"One of the challenges of writing a book\", Wallenda commented, \"is there's things you probably don't want people to know about you ... It was very emotional telling these stories at times ... It is a challenge to reveal your life story.\"\n\nReviewer John Law remarked, \"Wallenda is really juggling two books with \"Balance\" – one about his tireless belief in God's plan, and the stuff readers actually want to know: The hardships, the drama, the thrill of life on a wire.\" He said the book felt \"rushed\", likely in an attempt to get it out before Wallenda's crossing of the Grand Canyon, but said it is \"worth it for the chapter on the Falls\".\n\nOn June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in Navajo territory outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. The event, billed as a \"Grand Canyon crossing\" and titled \"Skywire Live with Nik Wallenda\", aired live worldwide on the Discovery Channel with a 10-second delay. Opinions varied on whether the event was truly a walk across the Grand Canyon. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply \"the Grand Canyon\", while the Associated Press described it as a \"gorge near the Grand Canyon.\" According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge.\n\nWallenda originally obtained permits to walk across the canyon in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing \"within a year\". In August 2012, he said that he was \"98 percent\" certain that the walk would take place in May or June 2013 and said he would get \"something in writing\" that no safety harness would be required for the walk. On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights.\nAccording to Wallenda, \"There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict [in the Canyon]\". To prepare for the winds, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He used wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to and practiced during the heavy rain of Tropical Storm Andrea. Wallenda said it was \"hard to prepare for [the updrafts] ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we’re not in control.\"\n\nAt , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using a wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing .\n\nAs the walk began, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying \"Thank you, Jesus.\" Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge.\n\nAfter the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that \"it took every bit of me to stay focused\". He said that dust had accumulated in his contacts and called the walk unusually stressful. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity \"was a dream come true.\" \"Skywire Live\" drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. During the walk itself, viewership increased to 13 million. It became the highest rated live program in Discovery's history and won 71% of TV-related social media usage for the day.\n\nDuring a live interview on \"Skywire Live\", Wallenda said for his next feat he would like to walk between the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building in New York City. The following day the New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the city would not grant permission for a stunt like that.\n\nWallenda was unable to get permission to do the walk in New York City, but, in April 2014, announced he was scouting skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois for a televised tight walk event for the Discovery Channel. Wallenda said he was very interested in tight walking between the Willis Tower with another nearby skyscraper. On November 2, 2014, Discovery aired the special, entitled \"Skyscraper Live\", and an official mobile game, \"SkyBalance by Nik Wallenda\", was developed by Tapinator, Inc. to coincide with the event. In the special, Wallenda completed two tightrope walks, setting two new Guinness World Records: one for walking the steepest tightrope incline between two buildings (19 degrees) and the other for the highest tightrope walk while blindfolded.\n\nIn the long run, Wallenda's goal is to achieve global recognition and celebrity. \"I've had a vision for my name since I was very young, that I was going to take it to the top of my industry\", he says. His wirewalking \"wishlist\" includes traversing the Bosphorus continental divide in Turkey and Inca ruins at Machu Picchu. He would like to do an event with the Eiffel Tower and Egypt's pyramids. \"There's a lot of expectations on my end\", he says, adding that he wants to \"[reinvent] the circus\". \"Whenever we're someplace unique or different,\" says Erendira, \"he's always looking around – 'Oh, I could string a wire from here to there and walk there.'\" Wallenda, who spent the summer of 2014 in Western New York with shows at Darien Lake and the Erie County Fair, hopes to develop a longer-term tourist attraction near Niagara Falls honoring stuntmen such as his family.\n\nIn 1999, Wallenda proposed to his future wife Erendira (née Vasquez, from famous Mexican circus family) on a wire high during a performance in Montreal, Quebec. Having just performed a seven-man pyramid act with his family, he stayed on the platform while the family descended. He walked to the middle of the wire and got down on one knee, proposing to Erendira in front of 25,000 people. A week later, they were married. \"I don’t know if either of us could be married to someone who didn’t perform,\" says Erendira. \"I can’t see either of us ever being happy sitting behind a desk.\"\nWallenda credits God for his success, saying that what he does on the high-wire is a gift from God. He grew up in \"a Bible-believing, God-fearing family\" and describes himself as a \"born-again Christian\". Faith is \"the most important part of my life,\" he says. According to family friend Michael Mascitto, \"When he started doing some of these bigger stunts, he realized that he was developing a platform, or rather God was giving him a platform, to use his abilities for God’s glory\". Mascitto says Wallenda's faith has been strengthened as his profile grew. \"He truly believes it’s because God has given him this platform for a reason — to glorify Him ... Him with a capital H.\"\n\nBefore every wire walk, Wallenda joins his family in prayer and he always wears a cross as he performs. He remarks, \"The Bible says pray without ceasing and I'm always praying.\" He denies that his stunts \"test\" God. \"To test God would be to never train, never practice, and then to walk across the Grand Canyon; or to jump off a building, or throw myself in front of a truck,\" he says. Wallenda says he tries to live \"an upright life\" and be a good example. Despite his success, Wallenda wants people to think of him as just a regular guy. \"I want people to like me, just for who I am,\" he says. \"What you get is a regular person. I want people to relate to me.\" Friends described him as a lighthearted guy who is always cracking jokes.\n\nWallenda describes himself as a challenge-driven person. \"Don't tell me, 'It can't be done,' because I'll find a way to do it\", he says. \"My whole thing\", he says, \"is I don't want to just break records. I want to set myself apart from any record that's been done before.\" Wallenda lives by the mantra \"Never Give Up\". He believes that through hard work, one can achieve anything they desire. \"I think [challenges are] what life is about\", he remarks. \"We all go through challenges. But once we get through them, we look back and say look how much our lives have changed by going through that challenge.\"\n\nWallenda and his wife own and operate Wallendas Inc. They have three children: Yanni, aged 16, Amadaos, 13, and Evita, 10. The children are free to choose their own professions, Wallenda says. Evita is said to be the most interested in following in her father's footsteps. \"In the back yard we have a wire that's two feet off the ground and that's what's fun for my daughter. Kids want to do what their parents do,\" Wallenda remarks. Erendira and the children are always nearby; the six days they were separated from Nik while he prepared for Niagara Falls was the longest separation in nine years.\n\n"}

Most sex workers are migrants, mainly from the former Eastern Bloc countries.\nAccording to a 2010 TAMPEP study, 78% of sex workers in Austria are foreigners.\n\nOver the Middle Ages there existed an uneasy association between those selling sex (usually women) on the one side, and church and state on the other. While the practice was frowned on, it thrived, and was tolerated. The Habsburg Rudolph I of Habsburg (1273-1291) made it an offence to insult these \"gelüstigen Frauen\" in 1276. After all they paid their taxes (two pfennigs a week). On the other hand, on Sundays and during Lent, they were obliged to stay away from the towns.\n\nThe first recorded mention of the existence of brothels (\"Freudenhäusern\") in Vienna can be found in a charter of Duke Albrecht III (1365-1379). Some councilors wanted to set up a charitable foundation for prostitutes who renounced their sinful life. However very soon councilors were actually establishing brothels and even supported a nunnery from the taxes.\nThe last time prostitution was completely forbidden in Austria was under Maria Theresa of Austria (1740-1780) who shipped prostitutes along with other \"antisocial\" people down the Danube to Timișoara in the Banat region of Romania.\n\nHowever, since this did little to reduce prostitution, Austrian laws changed to consider prostitution as a necessary evil that had to be tolerated but regulated by the state. In 1850, Dr. Nusser of the Vienna police suggested that prostitutes be required to register with the police, receive medical examinations twice a week, and obtain special health certificates. In 1873, Anton Ritter von Le Monnier, head of the Vienna police, reformed Vienna's prostitution law, and health certificates have been obligatory since that time. Prostitutes who complied with the requirements of registration and examinations were no longer prosecuted by the police. A newspaper article of October 27, 1874 reported that 6,424 prostitutes had received health certificates and were under observation by police and health authorities. According to police estimates, at least 12,000 more women lived on the proceeds of \"free love\" without being registered. Most of these were factory workers who received so little pay that they needed the additional income. Of the registered prostitutes, 5,312 were unmarried, 902 widows, and 210 married. The youngest was 15 and the oldest 47 years old.\n\nHomosexual male prostitution was legalized in 1989. under paragraph § 210 of the penal code (\"Strafgesetzbuch\").\n\"Durch das Bundesgesetz BGBI. Nr. 243/1989 wurde der § 210 StGB, der bislang die gewerbsmäßige gleichgeschlechtliche Unzucht mit einer Person männlichen Geschlechts unter Strafe stellte, aufgehoben. Diese gesetzliche Maßnahme ist das Ergebnis einer ausführlichen Diskussion, in der die Befürworter hauptsächlich dahingehend argumentierten, dass die im Zusammenhang mit der Verbreitung von AIDS getroffenen Gegenmaßnahmen, insbesondere die Durchführung regelmäßiger Untersuchungen sowie die behördliche Registrierung aller Prostituierten, durch die allgemeine Strafbarkeit der männlichen homosexuellen Prostitution in ihrer Effizienz stark beeinträchtigt würden.\"\n\nProstitution in Austria is regulated under the penal code (\"Strafgesetzbuch\").\nunder \"Zehnter Abschnitt Strafbare Handlungen gegen die sexuelle Integrität und Selbstbestimmung (§§ 201-220b)\" \n(Part Ten: Offences against sexual integrity and self-determination (§ § 201-220b)).\n\nAlthough sex work itself is not forbidden, Section 207b\"Sexueller Missbrauch von Jugendlichen\" (Sexual abuse of juveniles) allows for prosecution of clients of workers younger than 18. Additional restrictions are specified in § 214 to 217. Medical examinations are required by the AIDS and STD laws. The laws of the federal States of Austria place further restrictions on the times and places where prostitution may occur. The most restrictive law is that of Vorarlberg, where prostitution is legal only in licensed brothels and to date no such licenses have been issued.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Austria (\"Oberster Gerichtshof\") held in 1989 that Prostitution was a \"sittenwidriger Vertrag\" (Unconscionable contract); therefore, a prostitute had no legal recourse against a customer who refuses to pay (OGH June 28, 1989, 3 Ob 516/89). This sentence was revised in 2012 (OGH April 18, 2012, 3 Ob 45/12g), explaining that prostitution can no longer generally be considered as unconscionable because moral attitudes have changed and prostitution is regulated by local laws. In particular, prostitutes now have the legal right to sue for payment.\n\nUnder \"Strafgesetzbuch\" § 216, it is forbidden to receive a regular income from the prostitution of another person, so a prostitute cannot legally be considered an employee.\n\nProstitutes are considered to be self-employed, and since 1986 they have been required to pay taxes. The Arbeits- und Sozialrechts-Änderungsgesetz (ASRÄG) 1997 included them in social insurance.\n\nAustrian cities do not have red-light districts like the Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main), the Reeperbahn in Hamburg, or the De Wallen in Amsterdam; the sex industry is widely distributed over the cities and its presence often goes unnoticed.\n\nIn April 2007, 1,352 female and 21 male prostitutes were officially registered in Vienna. In 2003, the oldest prostitute was a 71-year-old Austrian woman, who offered her service in the second district of Vienna, the so-called Leopoldstadt. The number of women working legally and illegally at least from time to time as prostitutes is estimated between 3,500 and 6,000; it is estimated that they totally serve 15,000 clients per day. A similar relation of prostitutes to population number can also be found in other Austrian cities. For example, in 2008 there were 120 registered prostitutes in Linz, which has approximately 10% of the size of Vienna.\n\nBefore the Wende there was a relatively good cooperation between police and prostitution from which both sides had their benefits: The pimps were allowed to regulate their turf wars themselves; on the other hand they served as informants for the police. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, however, the situation changed. Many young women from the former Eastern bloc came to Austria and were willing to work for less money than the Austrian women. Additionally organized crime groups from southern and eastern Europe entered the prostitution scene in Austria.\n\nIn the following years, in particular in the 1990s, the number of registered prostitutes decreased and the number of unregistered prostitutes increased. Nowadays 60 to 90 percent are migrants, mainly from the former east bloc countries, among them many commuters from the close Slovakia. For example, the police detained several nurses from Bratislava who earned more money in one night on the streets of Vienna than in a whole month in the hospital in Bratislava.\n\nThe Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior considers the illegal prostitution as a problem because it comes along with crimes like human trafficking, pimping and rape. In addition, unregistered prostitution creates health problems. A quarter of the arrested unregistered prostitutes had multiple infections with sexually transmitted diseases. On the other hand, according to the health authorities of Vienna, registered prostitutes are the most healthy group of persons. Because of this, the Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior wants to transform illegal prostitution into legal regulated prostitution. Similar to the ministry, several human rights and migrants organizations who highlight the bad life and working conditions of prostitutes want a detabooization of prostitution and improve the working and social conditions of sex workers and to abolish the discrimination in the working rights and in the rights of residence. In early 2007 this topic was also discovered by politics and it was discussed to end the unconscionable state of prostitution and to find a legal regulation similar to the German law.\n\nSupport for (migrant) sex workers in Austria exists since the beginning of the 1990s through the NGO LEFÖ (Information, Education and Support for Migrant Women) LEFÖ is the Austrian partner of the pan-European network TAMPEP that provides HIV/STI prevention and health promotion among (migrant) sex workers. Other counselling centres for sex workers exist in Vienna (Sophie) and Linz (LENA). Additionally the organization Maiz in Linz offers consulting for migrants working in the sex industry. Since 2005, the group www.sexworker.at is a platform for sex workers and allies that is based in Vienna and operates in the German-speaking region. They are a self-organisation of sex workers and promote the recognition of sex work as legitimate activity and the self-determination and political inclusion of sex workers into decision-making and policy development, implementation and evaluation.\n\nThere is an increase of Nigerian prostitutes in Austria, whereby it was found out that many of them are victims of human trafficking and forced prostitution. The NGO Exit documents stories of these victims to increase public awareness. Furthermore, Exit counsels victims who seek help in special African dialects. Exit was initiated by Joana Adesuwa Reiterer, a Nigerian actress and writer based in Vienna who, after escaping a marriage with a pimp, started her research on human trafficking from Africa to Austria for sexual exploitation.\n\nThe Young Socialists (\"Sozialistische Jugend Österreich\") have a policy on prostitution, in their women's platform (\"Frauenpolitik\"). While considering prostitution a social evil that should be eradicated, at the same time states that so long as it exists the party advocates solidarity with sex workers, their protection and opposes criminalisation as a step that merely drives the trade underground. Amongst other approaches, they suggest unionisation.\n\nAustria is both a transit and a destination country for women and children trafficked from Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Belarus, Ukraine, Slovakia, Nigeria, and sub-Saharan Africa for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. Most trafficked women are brought to Austria with promises of unskilled jobs, such as nannies or waitresses. Upon arrival they are often coerced into prostitution. According to police, there also were some women who knowingly entered the country to work as prostitutes but were forced into dependency akin to slavery. Most victims were in the country illegally and feared being turned over to authorities and deported. Traffickers usually retained victims' official documents, including passports, to maintain control over them. Victims reported being subjected to threats and physical violence. A major deterrent to victim cooperation with authorities was fear of retribution, both in Austria and in the victims' countries of origin.\n\nTraffickers include citizens, who are generally connected with licensed brothels, and foreign nationals, who are involved primarily with unlicensed brothels. Authorities estimated that organized crime groups from Eastern Europe, including Russia, controlled much of the trafficking. Police were also aware of cooperation between domestic and foreign citizens to traffic foreign prostitutes through the country. Some victims are trafficked through Austria to Italy, France, and Spain. Women from Africa are trafficked through Spain and Italy to Austria for the purpose of sexual exploitation.\n\nPolice and NGOs identified a combined total of 203 trafficking victims in 2008, up from 170 in 2007. In 2007, 30 trafficking offenders for whom trafficking was the leading charge were convicted, an increase from 18 such convictions in 2006. The government improved its funding for victim protection, and continued to undertake proactive prevention campaigns in 2008. The government published a brochure on child trafficking in 2008 to raise awareness and provide advice on assisting this population of victims.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Austria as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n\n\n"}

It provided a service similar to that of Muzak.\n\nThe Seeburg 1000 phonograph was introduced in 1959 as model BMS1. The system replaced the Seeburg Library Unit, which served the same purpose but played standard 45 rpm records. The Seeburg 1000 is enclosed in a metal cabinet 22 inches (55 cm) wide by 14 inches (35 cm) tall by 12 inches (30 cm) deep.\nA later version (the Seeburg Background Music Compact, model BMC1) is housed in a windowless, blue- and grey-painted metal box. This version contains only the record-playing mechanism, without any amplifier or timer built in.\n\nThe player is capable of playing both sides of up to 28 records and repeating the process indefinitely. The records are stacked on the spindle with the first side to be played on the bottom of the stack. A special tone arm, with two needles (one above and one below), is used to play both sides of each record. \nA rotating base plate below the records prevents damage to the bottom playing surface while re-stacking the records. A similar weight on top of the stack ensures stable playback of the bottom side of the topmost record.\n\nThe mechanism causes the lower portion of the spindle to rotate clockwise like an ordinary record player, while the top half of the spindle rotates counterclockwise to permit the bottom of the record to be played in the correct direction. The spindle contains three sets of retractable claws which hold the records in the upper and lower playing positions, and permit one record at a time to be dropped from the upper to the lower playing position.\nA release button in the top of the spindle permits the operator to retract the record-holding claws to remove the record stack.\n\nThe BMS 1000 was so called because it played both sides of 25 records, each side containing 20 songs (hence 1,000 songs). The phonographs used the old Pickering \"Red-head\" stereo cartridge, introduced on Seeburg jukeboxes in late 1958 for the 1959 model year. Although the mono Seeburg jukeboxes used 1 mil styluses and the stereo Seeburgs used .7 mil styluses, the background-music systems used a .5 mil stylus, but played the special mono records. The BMS phonographs were non-selectable and only played these proprietary formatted 9\" records with 2\" center holes - sequentially, and at 16rpm.\n\nIn 1963, Seeburg introduced the next generation BMS, the BMS2. This phonograph has been nicknamed \"the Microwave\" in recent years due to its resemblance to the kitchen appliance, and was made for the public view. There was a lighted window where one could see the records playing, and the chrome speaker grille and trim made the little phonograph noteworthy. These BMS2s used transistorized amplifiers. \n\nBMS phonographs lacking a power amplifier or internal speaker could have an optional preamplifier. Early preamps were tube-(valve-) type and (after 1963) transistorized. In 1963 the Seeburg BMCA1 \"Companion Audio\" speaker/4-watt amp unit became available, using both tubes and transistors. If more power or an amp was needed Seeburg had the HFA4-56, 60-watt tube (valve) amp available.\n\nA Seeburg Background Music record is a vinyl record of a non-standard 9 inch (23 cm)-diameter size with a 2 inch (5 cm) center hole. The recording is monaural, with a playing speed of 16⅔ rpm and a density of 420 grooves per inch. A 0.5 mil diamond stylus is used for reproduction. Each side contains approximately 40 minutes of music (typically 20 songs). Records in each series were numbered 1-28 or 101-128; however, these numbers meant nothing other than where a record belonged in the stack.\n\nInitially, the records were distributed four times a year, in sets of five records. In 1966 this changed to sets of 7. The operator was supposed to replace records in the system with new records of the same number (e.g. MM-125). Each box was labeled with the library type, date to place in service, and instructions for the operator (including that each record was to be returned to Seeburg after use). Upon return, the records were destroyed. A Basic library box from 1971 states that the records are the property of \"Seeburg Music Library, Inc., 1510 N. Dayton St, Chicago 22, Ill\".\n\nSeeburg provided three different libraries of music for use with the Seeburg 1000 system: Basic, Mood and Industrial. These library names were changed to Lifestyle, Penthouse, and Upbeat in 1979.\nThe Basic library consisted of mid-tempo music selected from top 40 hits, show tunes and standards. The arrangements (created for Seeburg) were nearly all instrumental, featuring horns, strings and keyboards. \nThe Mood library consisted of medium- to slow-tempo songs in lush arrangements (with primarily stringed instruments). The music was derived from standards, show tunes and some pop music; the first song on each side of each record was often a current pop hit. \nThe Industrial library consisted of lively, medium- to quick-tempo music to induce workers to be more productive. This was perhaps the most varied and adventurous of the libraries; it contained polkas, mariachi music, twangy guitar, Hawaiian songs, and occasionally synthesizer.\n\nA portion of the records were exchanged every three months: on April 1, July 1, October 1 and December 26. The number of records changed at each three-month interval was five in 1963, and seven according to record boxes issued in 1966 and later. The first sets of Seeburg 16 rpm records issued in 1959 had a five-pointed star in the space later used for the \"place-in-use\" dates. This was superseded by a notice which read \"Replace No. 1\", \"Replace No. 5\" etc. This meant \"Replacement Records - Set No. 1\", \"Set No. 5\" etc. In 1961 this was again superseded by the \"place in use\" dates, which remained in use through the end of 1975. For the April 1, 1976 sets, the \"place in use\" dates were replaced by a code: RR-66. This meant \"replacement records – set #66\" and the number advanced with each subsequent set. Over time, the records were sent out less on a schedule. The last sets were sent out in 1986 and bore the code R-97.\n\nThe Christmas holiday season required a special set of records. A box of 25 Christmas records was issued to be played during the month of December. This set consisted of Christmas music, interspersed with non-holiday music. \nIt was the job of the machine operators to replace all Christmas music with standard fare on December 26. This was a large undertaking - in New York, \"the entire service and installation force, and even the office help, are pressed into service to still the sound of Christmas past for another 11 months.\"\n\nAs of 2017, the Seeburg 1000 website continually livestreams the best of the Seeburg 1000 Background Music Library recordings.\n\n"}

He began to publish in 1913 and just before the Russian Revolution he became associated with the ego-futurists. Soon after the publication of \"Iron Pause\", he became heavily involved in the Siberian futurist movement known as \"Creation\" along with artists such as Nikolay Aseyev and David Burlyuk. Perhaps his most famous play at the time was the anti-imperialist \"Roar China!\" (1926), about the Wanhsien Incident.\n\nTretyakov was one of the founders of the constructivist journal \"LEF\", (1923–1925), and its successor \"Novyi LEF\" (\"New LEF\")(1927–1928), and of the associated artistic movement, whose main driving force was the poet Mayakovsky. They declared war on 'bourgeois' culture and claimed that the experimental avant garde works they produced were the artistic voice of the Bolshevik revolution. Boris Pasternak did not believe that any of the group actually wanted to destroy pre-revolutionary art, with one exception - \"The only consistent and honest man in this group of negationists was Sergei Tretyakov, who drove his negation to its natural conclusion. Like Plato, Tretyakov considered that there was no place for art in a young socialist state.\"\n\nHis first play, \"Earth Rampant,\" also known as \"The World Turned Upside Down\", premiered on March 4, 1923, directed by Vsevolod Meyerhold, was a commercial success that ran to 44 performances in 11 weeks, rescuing Moscow's Sohn Theatre, in which it was staged, from imminent bankruptcy. It was dedicated to 'the Red Army and the first soldier of the RSFSR, Leon Trotsky'. His next two of Tretyakov's first plays, \"Can You Hear Me. Moscow?\" and \"Gas Masks\" were directed by the young Sergei Eisenstein. The latter was staged in the Moscow Gas Works, for maximum realism. In 1924 Sergei Tretyakov made a lengthy visit to China, where he taught Russian literature and collected materials for some of his later publications. \"Roar China (Rychi Kitai)\" had its premier at the Meyerhold Theatre on January 23, 1926, and later went on foreign tour, and on tour of provincial theatres in the USSR. Tretyakov also wrote the controversial \"I Want a Baby\" (\"I Want a Child\") (1926), which has seen recent performances in Europe and America. The play advocated selective breeding for the purposes of political (not racial) purity. Meyerhold immediately accepted it for production, but then spent four years battling with the censorship to get it put on stage. Between 1930 and 1931 Tretyakov travelled in Germany, Denmark, and Austria. Before he fell foul of the authorities he translated and popularised other European writers such as Bertolt Brecht. Brecht was also familiar with Tretyakov's literary work and indeed stayed with him in 1935. Tretyakov contributed song lyrics to the film \"Pesn' o geroyakh\" (Song of Heroes) by Joris Ivens set in music by Hanns Eisler.\n\nTretyakov was arrested on July 25, 1937 and charged with espionage. He had fallen under suspicion because of his contacts with foreign writers, and because the political attitudes he had expressed in the 1920s were no longer tolerated. His play \"I Want a Baby\" was denounced in \"Pravda\" in December 1937 as \"a hostile slur on the soviet family.\" He was sentenced to death on September 10, 1937, though in the introduction to the English publication of \"I Want a Baby\", Robert Leach says it seems that in a last act of defiance he threw himself to his death down the stairwell at Butyrka prison. It was standard procedure for those sentenced to death to be photographed prior to execution: the last photograph of Tretyakov, staring defiantly at the camera, is reproduced in David King, \"Ordinary Lives.\" Tretyakov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.\n\n\nTretyakov worked with:\n\nBy S.M Tretyakov:\n\nOther notable performances:\n\n\n"}

It is the first installment in the \"Sharknado\" film series. It first aired on the Syfy channel on July 11, 2013, and stars Tara Reid, Ian Ziering, John Heard and Cassie Scerbo. It was also given a one-night-only special midnight theatrical screening via Regal Cinemas and NCM Fathom Events, where it earned less than $200,000 from 200 screenings. The over-the-top premise and theatrics of the film quickly earned it a cult following.\n\nFour sequels were produced: \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\". \"\", the sixth and final film in the franchise, was released on August 19, 2018. Though the original film was not explicitly a comedy, maintaining at least a facade of seriousness despite the implausible plot, the sequels were more openly comedic in nature.\n\nA freak cyclone hits Los Angeles, causing water spouts that scoop up man-eating sharks and flood the city with shark-infested seawater. Bar owner and surfer Fin sets out with his friends, Baz, Nova, and George, to rescue his estranged wife, April, and their teenage daughter, Claudia, after the bar and boardwalk are destroyed by the flooding. While heading to April's home, the group stops in a freeway to save people as flooding causes sharks to attack. George is killed and the group learns of a tornado warning. They arrive at April's house just before the first floor is flooded and shark-infested. Collin, April's boyfriend, is eaten by sharks, but the rest of the group escapes unharmed from the house, which collapses.\n\nFin stops the car to save the children stuck in the bus from the assaulting sharks. Afterwards, the bus driver is killed by a letter in the Hollywood Sign. While Nova is driving the car, a shark lands on top of the car and rips the roof off. Fin's hand is cut and the group abandons the car before it explodes. They steal another car and meet up with Fin and April's son Matt, who is found taking shelter at his flight school. They borrow equipment from a nearby storage and Matt and Nova become attracted to each other. Matt and Nova decide to stop the threat of the incoming \"sharknadoes\" by tossing bombs into them from a helicopter. Two are destroyed, but they are unable to stop the third one.\n\nAs Nova fights off a shark that had latched onto the helicopter, she falls out of the helicopter and directly into another shark's mouth. Matt is heartbroken. Baz is also lost in the storm along with Matt's friends Bobby and Luellyn. Ultimately, Fin destroys the last sharknado with a bomb attached to his car and the sharks begin to plummet toward the ground. One falling shark flies directly toward the remaining members of the group. Fin jumps into its mouth with a chainsaw and cuts his way out. He emerges carrying an unconscious but otherwise unharmed Nova. Matt is reunited with Nova, and Fin gets back together with April.\n\n\n\"Sharknado\" was directed for film studio The Asylum by Anthony C. Ferrante, whose previous directing credits include the horror film \"Boo\", and written by Thunder Levin, whose previous writing credits include the film \"Mutant Vampire Zombies from the 'Hood!\". The film's tagline is \"Enough said!\" \"Sharknado\" is one of many B-movies commissioned by Syfy. Robbie Rist said in an interview that he came upon the film's poster at the American Film Market and became enthusiastic about the concept. When his friend Ferrante said that he had been approached to direct the film, Rist insisted that Ferrante take the job. Rist was given a small role in the film and composed the theme.\n\nActress Tara Reid said of the film, \"It is silly, and there's only a certain amount of barriers you could go into. You can't take it so seriously when it's absolutely the sharks flying in the sky. It's so out there that it's actually really funny.\" The cast had to imagine the presence of sharks due to a green screen being frequently in use. Ian Ziering stated that he had serious reservations about the script but was motivated, in part, by the need to earn enough to qualify for Screen Actors Guild health insurance for his family.\n\nIn an interview with Uproxx's Danger Guerrero, Ferrante summarized the film's plot: \"There's a flood. And a storm. Don't worry about it.\"\n\nThe premiere of the film was watched by 1.37 million viewers, which is slightly below the average audience of 1.5 million viewers for a typical Syfy original film. The film was a trend on Twitter, including discussion by celebrities such as Damon Lindelof, Wil Wheaton, and Olivia Wilde and also by Cory Monteith, whose last tweet before his death was about the film. Due to an increase in publicity (mostly through Twitter), Syfy repeated \"Sharknado\" on Thursday, July 18, 2013, one week after its premiere. The airing was watched by 1.89 million viewers, an increase of 38% over its initial airing. On July 27, a third airing of \"Sharknado\" got 2.1 million viewers, continuing the increase in popularity of the film and setting a record for most watched original film encore in Syfy history. \"Sharknado\" was projected to increase revenue for The Asylum from $5 million in 2009 to $19 million in 2013.\n\nA representative of the National Weather Service jokingly recommended what to do in case of a sharknado, saying: \"As with any waterspout or tornado, the best advice is to be in an interior part of the lowest floor of a sturdy building – and not outside, whether sharks are raining down or not.\" Organizations such as the Red Cross of Oklahoma City also used the film as an opportunity to pass on storm safety information while others incorporated it into their own advertising.\n\nRegal Cinemas announced that at midnight on August 2, 2013, it would play the film in roughly 200 theaters nationally. Tickets sold out quickly in New York, Boston, and Seattle, where more showings were added to appease customer demand. Box office numbers were weak for the midnight showings; estimates were at under $200,000.\n\n\nSyfy and The Asylum announced in August 2013 that \"Sharknado\" merchandise would be made available, including T-shirts and potentially other products.\nFunko acquired the licensing agreement to manufacture the POP Vinyl version of Sharknado \n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 82% based on 17 reviews; the average rating is 6.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Proudly, shamelessly, and gloriously brainless, \"Sharknado\" redefines 'so bad it's good' for a new generation.\"\n\nReviewer Mary McNamara, writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", mentioned that the plot holes are \"the whole point of movies like this: fabulous in-home commentary. Often accompanied by the consumption of many alcoholic beverages.\" David Hinckley of the New York \"Daily News\" said \"\"Sharknado\" is an hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back. And you won't want to.\"\n\nKim Newman of \"Empire\" called the film \"cynical rubbish, with an attention-getting title and just enough footage of terrible CG sharks in a terrible CG tornado chomping on people to fill out a trailer suitable for attracting YouTube hits.\"\n\n\"Sharknado\" has become a cult film. The film was used for a RiffTrax Live event in July 2014, where former \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" cast members mocked the film for a live audience and broadcast to other theaters through NCM Fathom; the idea for using the film for this was prompted by the \"Sharknado\" producers discussing the film with Fathom at the same time. After the event, Ferrante said that \"Being skewered by the MST3K guys was an honor.\" In 2016, Homes.com added a page to their disaster prep guides on How to Prepare Your Home For a Sharknado.\n\nThe success of \"Sharknado\" spawned a series of sequels with the sixth entry in the series being released on August 19, 2018.\n\n"}

This drop rule is speculated to have been invented in the 15th century and possibly connected to the practice of 15th century mercenaries switching loyalties when captured instead of being killed.\n\nThe earliest predecessor of the game, chaturanga, originated in India in the 6th century. Shogi in its present form was played as early as the 16th century, while a direct ancestor without the drop rule was recorded from 1210 in a historical document \"Nichūreki\", which is an edited copy of \"Shōchūreki\" and \"Kaichūreki\" from the late Heian period (c. 1120).\n\nTwo players face each other across a board composed of rectangles in a grid of 9 \"ranks\" (rows) by 9 \"files\" (columns). In Japanese they are called \"Sente\" (first player) and \"Gote\" (second player), but in English are conventionally referred to as Black and White, with Black the first player.\nThe board is nearly always rectangular, and the rectangles are undifferentiated by marking or color. Pairs of dots mark the players' promotion zones.\n\nEach player has a set of 20 wedge-shaped pieces of slightly different sizes. Except for the kings, opposing pieces are undifferentiated by marking or color. Pieces face \"forward\" (toward the opponent's side); this shows who controls the piece during play. The pieces from largest (most important) to smallest (least important) are:\n\nSeveral of these names were chosen to correspond to their rough equivalents in international chess, and not as literal translations of the Japanese names.\n\nEach piece has its name written on its surface in the form of two \"kanji\" (Chinese characters used in Japanese), usually in black ink. On the reverse side of each piece, other than the king and gold general, are one or two other characters, in amateur sets often in a different color (usually red); this side is turned face up during play to indicate that the piece has been promoted.\n\nFollowing is a table of the pieces with their Japanese representations and English equivalents. The abbreviations are used for game notation and often when referring to the pieces in speech in Japanese.\n\nEnglish speakers sometimes refer to promoted bishops as \"horses\" and promoted rooks as \"dragons\", after their Japanese names, and generally use the Japanese term \"tokin\" for promoted pawns. Silver generals and gold generals are commonly referred to simply as \"silvers\" and \"golds\".\n\nThe characters inscribed on the reverse sides of the pieces to indicate promotion may be in red ink, and are usually cursive. The characters on the backs of the pieces that promote to gold generals are cursive variants of 'gold', becoming more cursive (more abbreviated) as the value of the original piece decreases. These cursive forms have these equivalents in print: for promoted silver, for promoted knight, for promoted lance, and for promoted pawn (tokin). Another typographic convention has abbreviated versions of the original values, with a reduced number of strokes: for a promoted knight , for a promoted lance , and the as above for a promoted silver, but for \"tokin\".\n\nThe suggestion that the Japanese characters have deterred Western players from learning shogi has led to \"Westernized\" or \"international\" pieces which use iconic symbols instead of characters. Most players soon learn to recognize the characters, however, partially because the traditional pieces are already iconic by size, with more powerful pieces being larger. As a result, Westernized pieces have never become popular. Bilingual pieces with both Japanese characters and English captions have been developed as have pieces with animal cartoons.\n\nEach player sets up friendly pieces facing forward (toward the opponent).\n\n\nTraditionally, the order of placing the pieces on the board is determined. There are two commonly used orders, the \"Ōhashi\" order 大橋流 and the \"Itō\" order 伊藤流. Placement sets pieces with multiples (generals, knights, lances) from left to right in all cases, and follows the order:\n\n\nA \"furigoma\" 振り駒 'piece toss' is used to decide who moves first. One of the players tosses five pawns. If the number of tokins (promoted pawns, と) facing up is higher than unpromoted pawns (歩), then the player who tossed the pawns plays \"gote\" 後手 'white' (that is, getting the second move). Among amateur tournaments, the higher-ranked player or defending champion performs the piece toss. In professional games, the furigoma is done on the behalf of the higher-ranked player/champion by the timekeeper who kneels by the side of the higher-ranked player and tosses the pawn pieces onto a silk cloth. In friendly amateur games, a player will ask the opponent to toss the pawns out of politeness. Otherwise, the person who tosses the pawns can be determined by Rock–paper–scissors.\n\nAfter the piece toss \"furigoma,\" the game proceeds. If multiple games are played, then players alternate turns for who goes first in subsequent games. (The terms \"Black\" and \"White\" are used to differentiate sides although there is no difference in the color of the pieces.) For each turn, a player may either move a piece that is currently on the board (and potentially promote it, capture an opposing piece, or both) or else drop a piece that has been previously captured onto a square of the board. These options are explained below.\n\nProfessional games are timed as in international chess, but professional shogi players are almost never expected to keep time in their games. Instead a timekeeper is assigned, typically an apprentice professional. Time limits are much longer than in international chess (9 hours a side plus extra time in the prestigious \"Meijin\" title match), and in addition \"byōyomi\" (literally \"second counting\") is employed. This means that when the ordinary time has run out, the player will from that point on have a certain amount of time to complete every move (a \"byōyomi\" period), typically upwards of one minute. The final ten seconds are counted down, and if the time expires the player to move loses the game immediately. Amateurs often play with electronic clocks that beep out the final ten seconds of a \"byōyomi\" period, with a prolonged beep for the last five.\n\nThe usual goal of a game is for one player to checkmate the other player's king, winning the game.\n\nMost shogi pieces can move only to an adjacent square. A few may move across the board, and one jumps over intervening pieces.\n\nThe lance, bishop, and rook are \"ranging\" pieces: They can move any number of squares along a straight line limited only by intervening pieces and the edge of the board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by removing it from the board and replacing it with the moving piece. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece must stop short of that square; if the friendly piece is adjacent, the moving piece may not move in that direction at all.\n\nA king (玉/王) moves one square in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal.\n\nA rook (飛) moves any number of squares in an orthogonal direction.\n\nA bishop (角) moves any number of squares in a diagonal direction. Because they cannot move orthogonally, the players' unpromoted bishops can reach only half the squares of the board, unless one is captured and then dropped.\n\nA gold general (金) moves one square orthogonally, or one square diagonally forward, giving it six possible destinations. It cannot move diagonally backwards.\n\nA silver general (銀) moves one square diagonally, or one square straight forward, giving it five possible destinations. Because an unpromoted silver can retreat more easily than a promoted one, it is common to leave a silver unpromoted at the far side of the board. (See Promotion).\n\nA knight (桂) jumps at an angle intermediate to orthogonal and diagonal, amounting to one square straight forward plus one square diagonally forward, in a single move. Thus the knight has two possible forward destinations. Unlike international chess knights, shogi knights cannot move to the sides or in a backwards direction. The knight is the only piece that ignores intervening pieces on the way to its destination. It is not blocked from moving if the square in front of it is occupied, but neither can it capture a piece on that square. It is often useful to leave a knight unpromoted at the far side of the board. A knight \"must\" promote, however, if it reaches either of the two furthest ranks. (See Promotion.)\n\nA lance (香) moves just like the rook except it cannot move backwards or to the sides. It is often useful to leave a lance unpromoted at the far side of the board. A lance \"must\" promote, however, if it reaches the furthest rank. (See Promotion.)\n\nA pawn (歩) moves one square straight forward. It cannot retreat. Unlike international chess pawns, shogi pawns capture the same as they move. A pawn \"must\" promote if it arrives at the furthest rank. (See Promotion.) In practice, however, a pawn is usually promoted whenever possible. There are two restrictions on where a pawn may be dropped. (See Drops.)\n\nAll pieces but the knight move either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. These directions cannot be combined in a single move; one direction must be chosen.\n\nEvery piece blocks the movement of all other non-jumping pieces through the square it occupies.\n\nIf a piece occupies a legal destination for an opposing piece, it may be \"captured\" by removing it from the board and replacing it with the opposing piece. The capturing piece may not continue beyond that square on that turn. Shogi pieces capture the same as they move.\n\nNormally when moving a piece, a player snaps it to the board with the ends of the fingers of the same hand. This makes a sudden sound effect, bringing the piece to the attention of the opponent. This is also true for capturing and dropping pieces. On a traditional \"shogi-ban\", the pitch of the snap is deeper, delivering a subtler effect.\nA player's \"promotion zone\" consists of the furthest one-third of the board – the three ranks occupied by the opponent's pieces at setup. The zone is typically delineated on shogi boards by two inscribed dots. When a piece is moved, if part of the piece's path lies within the promotion zone (that is, if the piece moves into, out of, or wholly within the zone; but \"not\" if it is dropped into the zone – see Drops), then the player has the option to \"promote\" the piece at the end of the turn. Promotion is indicated by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the character of the promoted piece.\n\nIf a pawn or lance is moved to the furthest rank, or a knight is moved to either of the two furthest ranks, that piece \"must\" promote (otherwise, it would have no legal move on subsequent turns). A silver general is never required to promote, and it is often advantageous to keep a silver general unpromoted. (It is easier, for example, to extract an unpromoted silver from behind enemy lines; whereas a promoted silver, with only one line of retreat, can be easily blocked.)\n\nPromoting a piece changes the way it moves. The various pieces promote as follows:\n\nWhen captured, a piece loses its promoted status. Otherwise promotion is permanent.\n\nA promoted rook (\"dragon king\", 龍王 \"ryūō\") moves as a rook and as a king. Alternate forms: 龍, 竜.\n\nA promoted bishop (\"dragon horse\", 龍馬 \"ryūma\") moves as a bishop and as a king. Alternate form: 馬.\n\nA promoted silver (成銀 \"narigin\") moves the same as a gold general. Alternate forms: 全, cursive 金.\n\nA promoted knight (成桂 \"narikei\") moves the same as a gold general. Alternate forms: 圭, 今, cursive 金.\n\nA promoted lance (成香 \"narikyō\") moves the same as a gold general. Alternate forms: 杏, 仝, cursive 金.\n\nA promoted pawn (と金 \"tokin\") moves the same as a gold general. Alternate forms: と, 个.\n\nCaptured pieces are retained in hand and can be brought back into play under the capturing player's control. The Japanese term for \"piece(s) in hand\" is either 持ち駒 \"mochigoma\" or 手駒 \"tegoma.\" On any turn, instead of moving a piece on the board, a player may select a piece in hand and place it – unpromoted side up and facing the opposing side – on any empty square. The piece is then one of that player's active pieces on the board and can be moved accordingly. This is called \"dropping\" the piece, or simply, a \"drop\". A drop counts as a complete move.\n\nA drop cannot capture a piece, nor does dropping within the promotion zone result in immediate promotion. Capture and/or promotion may occur normally, however, on subsequent moves of the piece.\n\nA pawn, knight, or lance may not be dropped on the furthest rank, since those pieces would have no legal moves on subsequent turns. For the same reason, a knight may not be dropped on the penultimate (player's 8th) rank.\n\nThere are two additional restrictions when dropping pawns:\n\n\nIt is common to keep captured pieces on a wooden stand (駒台 \"komadai)\" which is traditionally placed so that its bottom left corner aligns with the bottom right corner of the board from the perspective of each player. It is not permissible to hide pieces from full view.\n\nIt is common for players to swap bishops, which oppose each other across the board, early in the game. This leaves each player with a bishop in hand to be dropped later. The ability for drops in shogi give the game tactical richness and complexity. The fact that no piece ever goes entirely out of play accounts for the rarity of draws.\n\nWhen a player's move threatens to capture the opposing king on the next turn, the move is said to \"give check\" to the king and the king is said to be \"in check.\" If a player's king is in check, that player's responding move must remove the check if possible. Ways to remove a check include moving the king away from the threat, capturing the threatening piece, or placing another interposing piece between the king and the threatening piece.\n\nTo announce check in Japanese, one can say \"ōte\" (). However, this is an influence of international chess and is not required, even as a courtesy. Announcing a check vocally is unheard of in serious play.\n\nThe usual way for shogi games to end is for one side to checkmate the other side's king, after which the losing player will be given the opportunity to admit defeat. However, there are three other possible ways for a game to end: \"repetition\" ( \"sennichite\"), \"impasse\" ( \"jishōgi\"), and an \"illegal move\" (反則手). The first two – repetition and impasse – are particularly uncommon. Illegal moves are also uncommon in professional games although this may not be true with amateur players (especially beginners).\n\nUnlike western chess, there is no tradition of offering a mutual draw by agreement.\n\nIf the king is in check and there is no possible move which could protect the king, the move is said to \"checkmate\" (\"tsumi\" 詰み) the king. Checkmate effectively means that the opponent wins the game as the player would have no remaining legal moves. (See also: tsumeshogi, hisshi.)\n\nThe losing player will usually resign when the situation is thought to be hopeless and may declare the resignation at any time during their turn. Although a player may resign just after they are checkmated, playing up to the checkmate point rarely occurs in practice as players normally resign as soon as a loss is deemed inevitable – such as when a \"tsume\" (forced mate sequence) is realized by the losing player. \n\nIn traditional tournament play, a formal resignation is required – that is, a checkmate is not a sufficient condition for winning. The resignation is indicated by bowing and/or saying 'I lost' (負けました \"makemashita\") and/or placing the right hand over the piece stands. Placing the hand over the piece stand is a vestige of an older practice of gently dropping one's pieces in hand over the board in order to indicate resignation. In western practice, a handshake may be used.\n\nIn professional and serious (tournament) amateur games, a player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. The loss stands even if play continued and the move was discovered later in game. However, if neither the opponent nor a third party points out the illegal move and the opponent later resigned, the resignation stands as the result. \n\nIllegal moves include:\n\n\nIn friendly amateur games, this rule is sometimes relaxed, and the player may be able to take back the illegal move and replay a new legal move.\n\nIf the same game position occurs four times with the same player to move and the same pieces in hand for each player, then the game ends in a repetition draw or \"sennichite\" (lit. \"moves for a thousand days\"), as long as the positions are not due to perpetual check. (Perpetual check is an illegal move, which ends the game in a loss in tournament play.)\n\nIn professional shogi, a repetition draw outcome is not a final result as draws essentially do not count. There can be only one victorious through wins. This is a significant difference from western chess, in which a player can play specifically to obtain draws for gaining points. In the case of a repetition draw, professional shogi players will have to immediately play a subsequent game (or as many games as necessary) with sides reversed in order to obtain a true win outcome. (That is, the player who was White becomes Black, and vice versa.) Also, depending on the tournament, professional players play the subsequent game in the remainder of the allowed game time.\n\nThus, aiming for a repetition draw may be a possible professional strategy for the White player in order to play the second replay game as Black, which has a slight statistical advantage and/or greater initiative. For instance, Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook is a passive strategy for White with the goal of a repetition draw (as it requires two tempo losses – swinging the rook and trading the bishops) while it is a very aggressive strategy if played by Black.\n\nRepetition draws are rare in professional shogi occurring in about 1–2% of games and even rarer in amateur games. In professional shogi, repetition draws usually occur in the opening as certain positions are reached that are theoretically disadvantaged for both sides (reciprocal zugzwang). In amateur shogi, repetition draws tend to occur in the middle or endgame as a result of player errors.\n\nThe game reaches an Impasse or Deadlock (\"jishōgi\") if both kings have advanced into their respective promotion zones – a situation known as 相入玉 (\"ai-nyū gyoku\" \"double entering kings\") – and neither player can hope to mate the other or to gain any further material. An Impasse can result in either a win or a draw. If an Impasse happens, the winner is decided as follows: each player agrees to an Impasse, then each rook or bishop, promoted or not, scores 5 points for the owning player, and all other pieces except kings score 1 point each. A player scoring fewer than 24 points loses. (If neither player has fewer than 24, the game is no contest—a draw.) \"Jishōgi\" is considered an outcome in its own right rather than no contest, but there is no practical difference.\n\nAs an Impasse needs to be agreed on for the rule to be invoked, a player may refuse to do so and attempt to win the game in future moves. If that happens, there is no official rule about the verdict of the game. \n\nAs a practical matter, when an opponent's king has entered a player's own territory especially with supporting defending pieces, the opponent's king is often very difficult to mate given the forward attacking nature of most shogi pieces. This state is referred to as entering king (入玉 \"nyū gyoku\"). If both players' kings are in entering king states, the game becomes more likely to result in an impasse.\n\nIn the adjacent diagram example, although White's king is in a strong Anaguma castle, Black's king has entered White's territory making it very difficult to mate. Therefore, this position favors Black.\n\nHowever, for amateur games there are various guidances. Fairbairn reports a practice (considered a rule by the now defunct Shogi Association for The West) where the dispute is resolved by either player moving all friendly pieces into the promotion zone and then the game ends with points tallied. \n\nAnother resolution is the 27-Point (27点法) rule used for some amateur tournaments. One version of this is simply the player who has 27 or more points is the winner of the Impasse. Another version is a 27-Point Declaration rule. For instance, the Declaration rule on the online shogi site, 81Dojo, is that the player who wants to declare an Impasse win must (i) declare an intention win via Impasse, (ii) have the king in the enemy camp (the promotion zone for that player), (iii) 10 other pieces must be in the promotion zone, (iv) not be in check, (v) have time remaining, and (vi) must have 28 points if Black or 27 points if White. If all of these conditions are met, then the Impasse declarer will win the game regardless of whether the opponent objects. \n\nYet another resolution to a refusal to agree to Impasse is the so-called Try Rule (トライルール). In this case, after both kings have entered their corresponding promotion zones, then the player who first moves the king to the opponent's king's start square (51 for Black, 59 for White) first will be the winner.\n\nIn professional tournaments, the rules typically require drawn games to be replayed with sides reversed, possibly with reduced time limits. This is rare compared to chess and xiangqi, occurring at a rate of 1–2% even in amateur games. \n\nThe 1982 \"Meijin\" title match between Makoto Nakahara and Hifumi Katoh was unusual in this regard with an impasse draw in the first (Double Yagura) game on April 13–14 (only the fifth draw in the then 40-year history of the tournament). This game (with Katoh as Black) lasted for 223 moves with 114 minutes spent pondering a single move. One of the reasons for the length of this game was that White (Nakahara) was very close to falling below the minimum of 24 points required for a draw. Thus, the end of the endgame was strategically about trying to keep White's points above the 24-point threshold. In this match, \"sennichite\" occurred in the sixth and eighth games. Thus, this best-of-seven match lasted eight games and took over three months to finish; Black did not lose a single game and the eventual victor was Katoh at 4–3.\n\nAmateur players are ranked from 15 \"kyū\" to 1 kyū and then from 1 \"dan\" to 8 dan. Amateur 8 dan was previously only honorarily given to famous people. While it is now possible to win amateur 8 dan by actual strength (winning amateur Ryu-oh 3 times), this has yet to be achieved.\n\nProfessional players operate with their own scale, from 6 kyū to 3 dan for pro-aspiring players and professional 4 dan to 9 dan for formal professional players. Amateur and professional ranks are offset (with amateur 4 dan being equivalent to professional 6 kyū).\n\nShogi has a handicap system (like go) in which games between players of disparate strengths are adjusted so that the stronger player is put in a more disadvantageous position in order to compensate for the difference in playing levels. In a handicap game, one or more of White's pieces are removed from the setup, and instead White plays first.\n\nThere are two common systems used to notate piece movements in shogi game records. One is used in Japanese language texts while a second was created for western players by George Hodges and Glyndon Townhill in the English language. Other systems are used to notate shogi board positions.\n\nIn western piece movement notation, the format is the piece initial followed by the type of movement and finally the file and rank where the piece moved to. The piece initials are K (King), R (Rook), B (Bishop), G (Gold), S (Silver), N (Knight), L (Lance), and P (Pawn). Simple movement is indicated with -, captures with x, and piece drops with *. The files are indicated with numerals 1–9 as are the ranks 1–9. Thus, Rx24 indicates 'rook captures on 24'. Promoted pieces are notated with + prefixed to the piece initial (e.g. +Rx24). Piece promotion is also indicated with + (e.g. S-21+) while unpromotion is indicated with = (e.g. S-21=). Piece ambiguity is resolved by notating which square a piece is moving from (e.g. N65-53+ means 'knight from 65 moves to 53 and promotes').\n\nThe Japanese notation system uses Japanese characters for pieces and promotion indication and uses Japanese numerals instead of letters for ranks. Movement type aside from drops is not indicated, and the conventions for resolving ambiguity are quite different from the western system. As examples, the western Rx24 would be 2四飛 in Japanese notation, +Rx24 would be 2四龍, S-21+ 2一銀成, S-21= 2一銀不成, and N65-53+ could be either 5三桂左成 or 5三桂右成 depending on whether the knight moved from the left or right.\n\nAlthough not strictly part of the notational calculus for games, game results are indicated in Japanese newspapers, websites, etc. with wins indicated by a white circle and losses indicated by a black circle.\n\nShogi is similar to chess but has a much larger game tree complexity because of the use of drops, greater number of pieces, and larger board size. In comparison, shogi games average about 140 moves per game where as western chess games average about 80 moves per game and minishogi averages about 40 moves per game. \n\nLike chess, however, the game can be divided into the opening, middle game and endgame, each requiring a different strategy. The opening consists of arranging one's defenses usually in a castle and positioning for attack, the mid game consists of attempting to break through the opposing defenses while maintaining one's own, and the endgame starts when one side's defenses have been compromised.\n\nIn the adjacent diagram, Black has chosen a Ranging Rook position (specifically Fourth File Rook) where the rook has been moved leftward away from its starting position. Additionally, Black is utilizing a Silver Crown castle, which is a type of fortification structure constructed with one silver and two gold pieces and the king moved inside of the fortification – the \"silver crown\" name comes from the silver being positioned directly above the king's head on the 27 square as if it were a crown. In the diagram, White has chosen a Static Rook position, in which the rook remains on its starting square. This Static Rook position is specifically a type of Counter-Ranging Rook position known as Static Rook Anaguma that uses an Anaguma castle. The Anaguma fortification has the king moved all the way into very edge corner of the board on the 11 square as if it were a badger in a hole with a silver moved to the 22 square in order to close up the hole and additional reinforcing golds on 31 and 32 squares. This board position required 33 moves (or 12 move pairs as counted in western chess) to construct.\n\nShogi players are expected to follow etiquette in addition to rules explicitly described. Commonly accepted etiquette include following:\n\nShogi piece sets may contain two types of king pieces, (king) and (jewel). In this case, the higher classed player, in either social or genuine shogi player rank, may take the king piece. For example, in titleholder system games, the current titleholder takes the king piece as the higher.\n\nThe higher-ranked (or older) player also sits facing the door of the room and is the person who takes the pieces out of the piece box.\n\nShogi does not have a touch-move rule as in western chess tournament play or chu shogi. However, in professional games, a piece is considered to be moved when the piece has been let go of. In both amateur and professional play, any piece may be touched in order to adjust its centralization within its square (to look tidy).\n\nTaking back moves (待った \"matta\") in professional games is prohibited. However, in friendly amateur games in Japan, it is often permitted.\n\nProfessional players are required to follow several ritualistic etiquette prescriptions such as kneeling exactly 15 centimeters from the shogi board, sitting in the formal seiza position, etc.\n\nFrom \"The Chess Variant Pages\":\nIt is not clear when chess was brought to Japan. The earliest generally accepted mention of shogi is (1058–1064) by Fujiwara Akihira. The oldest archaeological evidence is a group of 16 shogi pieces excavated from the grounds of Kōfuku-ji in Nara Prefecture. As it was physically associated with a wooden tablet written on in the sixth year of Tenki (1058), the pieces are thought to date from that period. These simple pieces were cut from a writing plaque in the same five-sided shape as modern pieces, with the names of the pieces written on them.\n\nThe dictionary of common folk culture, (c. 1210–1221), a collection based on the two works and , describes two forms of shogi, large \"(dai)\" shogi and small \"(shō)\" shogi. These are now called Heian shogi (or Heian small shogi) and Heian dai shogi. Heian small shogi is the version on which modern shogi is based, but the \"Nichūreki\" states that one wins if one's opponent is reduced to a single king, indicating that drops had not yet been introduced. According to Kōji Shimizu, chief researcher at the Archaeological Institute of Kashihara, Nara Prefecture, the names of the Heian shogi pieces keep those of chaturanga (general, elephant, horse, chariot and soldier), and add to them the five treasures of Buddhism (jade, gold, silver, katsura tree, and incense).\n\nAround the 13th century the game of dai shogi developed, created by increasing the number of pieces in Heian shogi, as was sho shogi, which added the rook, bishop, and drunken elephant from dai shogi to Heian shogi. The drunken elephant steps one square in any direction except directly backward, and promotes to the prince, which acts as a second king and must also be captured along with the original king for the other player to win. Around the 15th century, the rules of dai shogi were simplified, creating the game of chu shogi. Chu shogi, like its parent dai shogi, contains many distinct pieces, such as the queen (identical with Western chess) and the lion (which moves like a king, but twice per turn, potentially being able to capture twice, among other idiosyncrasies). The popularity of dai shogi soon waned in favour of chu shogi, until it stopped being played commonly. Chu shogi rivalled sho shogi in popularity until the introduction of drops in the latter, upon which standard shogi became ascendant, although chu shogi was still commonly played until about World War II, especially in Kyoto. Dai shogi was much less often played, but must have been remembered somewhat, as it is depicted in a woodcut by Kobayashi Kiyochika from around 1904 or 1905.\n\nIt is thought that the rules of standard shogi were fixed in the 16th century, when the drunken elephant was removed from the set of pieces present in sho shogi. There is no clear record of when drops were introduced, however.\n\nIn the Edo period, shogi variants were greatly expanded: tenjiku shogi, dai dai shogi, maka dai dai shogi, tai shogi, and taikyoku shogi were all invented. It is thought that these were played to only a very limited extent, however. Both standard shogi and Go were promoted by the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1612, the shogunate passed a law giving endowments to top shogi players (). During the reign of the eighth shōgun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, castle shogi tournaments were held once a year on the 17th day of Kannazuki, corresponding to November 17, which is Shogi Day on the modern calendar.\n\nThe title of \"meijin\" became hereditary in the Ōhashi and Itō families until the fall of the shogunate, when it came to be passed by recommendation. Today the title is used for the winner of the Meijin-sen competition, the first modern title match. From around 1899, newspapers began to publish records of shogi matches, and high-ranking players formed alliances with the aim of having their games published. In 1909, the was formed, and in 1924, the was formed. This was an early incarnation of the modern , or JSA, and 1924 is considered by the JSA to be the date it was founded.\n\nIn 1935, \"meijin\" Kinjirō Sekine stepped down, and the rank of meijin came to be awarded to the winner of a . became the first Meijin under this system in 1937. This was the start of the (see titleholder system). After the war other tournaments were promoted to title matches, culminating with the in 1988 for the modern line-up of seven. About 200 professional shogi players compete. Each year, the title holder defends the title against a challenger chosen from knockout or round matches.\n\nAfter the Second World War, SCAP (occupational government mainly led by US) tried to eliminate all \"feudal\" factors from Japanese society and shogi was included in the possible list of items to be banned along with Bushido (philosophy of samurai) and other things. The reason for banning shogi for SCAP was its exceptional character as a board game seen in the usage of captured pieces. SCAP insisted that this could lead to the idea of prisoner abuse. But Kozo Masuda, then one of the top professional shogi players, when summoned to the SCAP headquarters for an investigation, criticized such understanding of shogi and insisted that it is not shogi but western chess that potentially contains the idea of prisoner abuse because it just kills the pieces of the opponent while shogi is rather democratic for giving prisoners the chance to get back into the game. Masuda also said that chess contradicts the ideal of gender equality in western society because the king shields itself behind the queen and runs away. Masuda’s assertion is said to have eventually led to the exemption of shogi from the list of items to be banned.\n\nThere are two organizations for shogi professional players in Japan: the JSA, and the , or LPSA. The JSA is the primary organization for men and women's professional shogi while the LPSA is a group of women professionals who broke away from the JSA in 2007 to establish their own independent organization. Both organize tournaments for their members and have reached an agreement to cooperate with each other to promote shogi through events and other activities. Top professional players are fairly well-paid from tournament earnings. In 2016, the highest tournament earners were Yoshiharu Habu and Akira Watanabe who earned ¥91,500,000 and ¥73,900,000. (The tenth highest earner, Kouichi Fukaura, won ¥18,490,000.)\n\nThe JSA recognizes two categories of shogi professionals: , and . Sometimes \"kishi\" are addressed as , a term from Go used to distinguish \"kishi\" from other classes of players. JSA professional ranks and female professional ranks are not equivalent and each has their own promotion criteria and ranking system. In 2006, the JSA officially granted women \"professional status\". This is not equivalent, however, to the more traditional way of \"gaining professional status\", i.e., being promoted from the : leagues of strong amateur players aspiring to become a professional. Rather, it is a separate system especially designed for female professionals. Qualified amateurs, regardless of gender, may apply for the \"Shoreikai System\" and all those who successfully \"graduate\" are granted \"kishi\" status; however, no woman has yet to accomplish this feat (the highest women have reached is \"Shoreikai 3 \"dan\" league\" by Kana Satomi and Tomoka Nishiyama), so \"kishi\" is de facto only used to refer to male shogi professionals.\n\nThe JSA is the only body which can organize tournaments for professionals, e.g., the eight major tournaments in the titleholder system and other professional tournaments. In 1996, Yoshiharu Habu became the only \"kishi\" to hold seven major titles at the same time. For female professionals, both the JSA and LPSA organize tournaments, either jointly or separately. Tournaments for amateurs may be organized by the JSA and LPSA as well as local clubs, newspapers, private corporations, educational institutions or municipal governments for cities or prefectures under the guidance of the JSA or LPSA.\n\nSince the 1990s, shogi has grown in popularity outside Japan, particularly in the People's Republic of China, and especially in Shanghai. The January 2006 edition of stated that there were 120,000 shogi players in Shanghai. The spread of the game to countries where Chinese characters are not in common use, however, has been slower.\n\nIn Europe there are currently (November 2017) over 1,200 active players.\n\nShogi has the highest game complexity of all popular chess variants. Computers have steadily improved in playing shogi since the 1970s. In 2007, champion Yoshiharu Habu estimated the strength of the 2006 world computer shogi champion Bonanza at the level of two-dan shoreikai.\n\nThe JSA prohibits its professionals from playing computers in public without prior permission, with the reason of promoting shogi and monetizing the computer–human events.\n\nOn October 12, 2010, after some 35 years of development, a computer finally beat a professional player, when the top ranked female champion Ichiyo Shimizu was beaten by the Akara2010 system in a game lasting just over 6 hours.\n\nOn July 24, 2011, computer shogi programs Bonanza and Akara crushed the amateur team of Kosaku and Shinoda in two games. The allotted time for the amateurs was one hour and then three minutes per move. The allotted time for the computer was 25 minutes and then 10 seconds per move.\n\nOn April 20, 2013, GPS Shogi defeated 8-dan professional shogi player Hiroyuki Miura in a 102-move game which lasted over 8 hours.\n\nThe highest rated player on Shogi Club 24 is computer program Ponanza, rated 3455 on December 13, 2015.\n\nOn April 10, 2016, Ponanza defeated Takayuki Yamasaki, 8-dan in 85 moves. Takayuki used 7 hours 9 minutes.\n\nFrom a computational complexity point of view, generalized shogi is EXPTIME-complete.\n\nHundreds of video games were released exclusively in Japan for several consoles.\n\nThe backwards \"uma\" (shogi horse symbol) is often featured on merchandise (such as on large decorative shogi piece sculptures, keychains, and other keepsakes) available for sale in Tendō. It is also serves as a symbol of good luck. (Cf. Rabbit's foot.) There are multiple theories on its origin. One is that \"uma\" (うま ) spelled in the Japanese syllabary backwards is まう \"mau\" (舞う), which means \"(to) dance\" and dancing horses are a good luck omen.\n\nIn the manga series \"Naruto\", shogi plays an essential part in Shikamaru Nara's character development. He often plays it with his sensei, Asuma Sarutobi, apparently always beating him. When Asuma is fatally injured in battle, he reminds Shikamaru that the shogi king must always be protected, and draws a parallel between the king in shogi and his yet-unborn daughter, Mirai, whom he wanted Shikamaru to guide.\n\nShogi has been a central plot point in the manga and anime \"Shion no Ō\", the manga and anime \"March Comes in Like a Lion\", and the manga and television drama \"81diver\".\n\nIn the manga and anime \"Durarara!!\", the information broker Izaya Orihara plays a twisted version of chess, go and shogi, where he mixes all three games into one as a representation of the battles in Ikebukuro.\n\nIn the video game \"Persona 5\", the Star confidant is a high school shogi player looking to break into the ranks of the professionals. The player character will gain knowledge stat when spending time with the confidant, supposedly from learning to play shogi. The abilities learned from ranking up the confidant comes from Japanese shogi terms.\n\nIn the light novel, manga, and anime \"The Ryuo's Work is Never Done!\", protagonist Yaichi Kuzuryū is a prodigy shogi player who won the title of Ryūō at the age of 16. He is approached by Ai Hinatsuru, a 9-year-old girl who begs him to make her his disciple. Astonished by Ai's potential, Yaichi agrees to become her master, and the two then brave themselves together in the world of shogi with their friends and rivals.\n\n\n\n\nRules\n\nOnline play\n\nOnline tools\n"}

Privately owned movie theaters were subsequently replaced with government-controlled film houses, and about 500 films were projected annually.\n\nThe Somali Film Agency (SFA) was established in 1975 as an adjunct to the federal Ministry of Information and National Guidance, growing out of the Ministry's visual aids arm. The SFA's duties included overseeing the importation, distribution and censorship of movies in the country. It later also oversaw the production of both long and short films. Most of the imported films were brought in from Egypt, Italy, the Soviet Union and East Germany. To facilitate processing and post-production, the SFA also forged a working partnership with British Films LTD, a British movie company.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1983, the Somali filmmaker Ali Said Hassan served as a representative of the Somali Film Agency in Rome. The Somali Film Agency also annually organized the Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis) in Mogadishu.

{"id": "4219147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4219147", "title": "Surprise factor", "text": "Surprise factor\n\nThe surprise factor is a technique used in storytelling to produce a visceral reaction from the audience. It is created by telling a story in a way which creates a certain perception of events which is then revealed to be false often in exact opposition to original perception. The term most often refers to its use in many forms of humour which provides the audience with the twist or punch line, intended to elicit amusement. However it can also be used to elicit a tragic reaction, rather than a comic one. \n\nIt has been theorised that the essence of humour lies in two elements or factors, the \"relevance factor\", and the \"surprise factor\". First, it is necessary to present something familiar or relevant to the audience. This accounts for gaining the involvement and scrutiny of the audience, who may believe they know the natural follow-through thoughts or conclusion. Next, the actual amusement results from the presentation of some twist on what the audience expected, or else from interpreting the original situation in an unexpected way. These twists and unexpected interpretations may be summarized as the surprise factor.\n\nFor this reason, knowing a punch line in advance, or some situation which would flub the delivery of the punchline, can destroy the surprise factor, and in turn destroy the entertainment value or amusement the joke may have otherwise provided; such information is known in some contexts as a spoiler. On the other hand, a person previously holding the same unexpected conclusions or secret perspectives as the comedian could derive amusement from hearing those same thoughts expressed and elaborated. That there is commonality, unity of thought, and an ability to openly analyze and express these (where secrecy and inhibited exploration was previously thought necessary) can be the surprise factor in these situations. This phenomenon explains much of the success of comedians who deal with same-gender and same-culture audiences on gender conflicts and cultural topics, respectively.\n"}

In 1962 TVM was launched as a Maltese public broadcaster by the Public Broadcasting Services. TVM remains the most popular channel in the country. It is a member of the EBU.\n\nIn 1991 the government opened the television market to more stations, but rather than allow private companies, they initially gave licenses to the two main political parties and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta. The Labour Party's television network One remains the second most popular network, while the Nationalist-controlled NET Television is the third most popular.\n\nToday there are also three private channels Smash Television, fLiving Channel and Xejk - currently transmitted by digital terrestrial, free-to-air signals. Smash, the largest commercial TV station, attracts an audience of 2%. Cable, terrestrial and satellite reception are all available, though the cable service is the most diffused, with Melita Cable. The Malta Communications Authority reported that there were 147,896 pay TV subscriptions active at the end of 2012, which includes analog and digital cable, pay digital terrestrial TV and IPTV. For reference the latest census counts 139,583 households in Malta. Satellite reception is available to receive other European TV networks such as RAI and Mediaset from Italy and the BBC from the United Kingdom. \n\nThe Broadcasting Authority supervises all local broadcasting stations and ensures their compliance with legal and licence obligations as well as the preservation of due impartiality; in respect of matters of political or industrial controversy or relating to current public policy; while fairly apportioning broadcasting facilities and time between persons belong to different political parties. The Broadcasting Authority ensures that local broadcasting services consist of public, private and community broadcasts that offer varied and comprehensive programming to cater for all interests and tastes.\n\nTwo commercial licences were awarded in Malta in 2005 to Multiplus Ltd and Maltacom (now GO). On July 2005, Multiplus Ltd started commercial operations in direct competition to the existing dominant cable operator utilising a total of 8 frequencies. Multiplus Ltd was acquired by GO in February 2007.\n\nMalta transitioned terrestrial broadcasts to digital television using the DVB-T standard in October 2011. In preparation for the transition, the Malta Broadcasting Authority developed a General Interest Objectives classification to determine which existing terrestrial channels would be assigned to the digital subchannels of the new digital free-to-air broadcasting system.\n\nFollowing the transition, terrestrial channels in Malta are distributed through a network of transmitters operated by the national broadcaster Public Broadcasting Services. The licensed terrestrial channels are broadcast as digital subchannels of UHF channel 66 from Delimara (Marsaxlokk), Nadur, Mellieħa, Mtarfa, Naxxar and Portomaso (St. Julian's).\n\nThe channels licensed for free-to-air digital broadcast are TVM, TVM2, Parliament TV, One, NET Television, Smash Television, F Living, and Xejk.\n\n"}

It was not easy in the early stages and the Trust owes a huge debt of gratitude to the Relgious and others who supported them in many ways, not the least financially. Particular mention should be made of the help and support received from the TRAC group, the Brothers of St John of God, Caritas Salford and the many, many female Religious Orders in the UK.\n\nThe primary mission of The Medaille Trust is the empowerment of women, men and children, who have been freed from the human-trafficking and the modern day slavery industry in the UK, enabling them to regain their dignity and self-worth. We do this by providing safe housing and offering opportunities for physical and psychological healing, rehabilitation and protection to the victims in our care. \n\nSince 2006 the Trust continues to grow and meet the needs of the increasing number of victims identified in the UK.

{"id": "9741899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9741899", "title": "Youxia", "text": "Youxia\n\nYouxia (, ) was a type of ancient Chinese warrior folk hero celebrated in classical Chinese poetry and fictional literature. It literally means \"wandering vigilante\", but is commonly translated as \"knight-errant\" or less commonly as \"cavalier\", \"adventurer\", \"soldier of fortune\" or \"underworld stalwart\".\n\nOf the two characters of the term, \"yóu\" (遊) literally means to \"wander\", \"travel\" or \"move around\", and \"xiá\" (俠) means someone with power who helps others in need. The term refers to the way these men solely travelled the land using physical force or political influence to right the wrongs done to the common people by the powers that be, often judged by their personal codes of chivalry. \"Youxia\" did not come from any social class in particular. Various historical documents, wuxia novels and folktales describe them as being princes, government officials, poets, musicians, physicians, professional soldiers, merchants, monks and even humble farmers and butchers. Some were just as handy with a calligraphy brush as others were with swords and spears.\n\nAccording to Dr. James J. Y. Liu (1926–1986), a professor of Chinese and comparative literature at Stanford University, it was a person's temperament and need for freedom, and not their social status, that caused them to roam the land and help those in need. Dr. Liu believes this is because a very large majority of these knights came from northern China, which borders the territory of \"northern nomadic tribes, whose way of life stressed freedom of movement and military virtues\". Many knights seem to have come from Hebei and Henan provinces. A large majority of the characters from the \"Water Margin\", which is considered one of China's best examples of knight-errant literature, come from these provinces.\n\nOne good example of Youxia poetry is \"The Swordsman\" （剑客） by Jia Dao (Tang Dynasty):\n\nAccording to Dr. Liu, Jia’s poem \"seems...to sum up the spirit of knight-errantry in four lines. At the same time, one can also take it as a reflection of the desire of all those who have prepared themselves for years to put their abilities to the test for some justice.\"\n\n\n\n"}
