It is played by one participant throwing a ball, and others catching it for points.\n\nThe players include a thrower and many catchers. The thrower will decide if points will be awarded if the ball is caught directly ('alive'), if the ball must be picked up after it hits the ground ('dead'), or either. The thrower also has the responsibility to determine the number of points that should be distributed. For example, a thrower calls out, \"100, dead!\" and throws the ball straight up in the air. All the catchers must wait until the ball touches the ground before they pick it up in order to receive the 100 points at stake. If a catcher's score goes over 500, that person will revert to 0 and will become the thrower, and the thrower will in turn become a catcher.\n\nThe game can be played using a frisbee instead of the ball.\n\nKick Ball 300 is a variation where the ball is kicked as well as being thrown and caught. It was designed as a training exercise to promote cooperation in competitive games.\n"}
{"id": "15271735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15271735", "title": "Acro dance", "text": "Acro dance\n\nAcro dance is a style of dance that combines classical dance technique with precision acrobatic elements. It is defined by its athletic character, its unique choreography, which seamlessly blends dance and acrobatics, and its use of acrobatics in a dance context. It is a popular dance style in amateur competitive dance as well as in professional dance theater and in contemporary circus productions such as those by Cirque du Soleil. This is in contrast to acrobatic, artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, which are sports that employ dance elements in a gymnastics context under the auspices of a governing gymnastics organization (such as FIG) and subject to a Code of Points. Acro dance is known by various other names including \"acrobatic dance\" and \"gymnastic dance\", though it is most commonly referred to simply as \"acro\" by dancers and dance professionals.\n\nAcro is an especially challenging dance style for dancers as it requires them to be trained in both dance and acrobatic skills. Acro dancers must be in excellent physical condition as well, because acro is a physically demanding activity.\n\nAcrobatic dance emerged in the United States and Canada in the early 1900s, as one of the types of acts performed in vaudeville. Although individual dance and acrobatic acts had been performed in vaudeville for several decades prior to 1900, it was not until the early 1900s that it became popular to perform acts that combined dance and acrobatic movements.\n\nAcrobatic dance did not suddenly appear in vaudeville; rather, it appeared gradually over time in a variety of forms, and consequently no individual performer has been cited as its originator. Sherman Coates (1872–1912), who performed with the Watermelon Trust from 1900 to 1914, was recalled by fellow dancers as the first acrobatic dancer they had ever seen. Another of the earliest documented acrobatic dance performers was Tommy Woods, who became well known for his slow-motion acrobatic dance in \"Shuffle Along\", in which he would execute acrobatic movements precisely in time with the music. In 1914, acrobat Lulu Coates formed the Crackerjacks, a popular vaudeville troupe that included acrobatic dance in their performance repertoire up until the group disbanded in 1952. Many other popular vaudeville companies combined acrobatics and dance in their shows, including the Gaines Brothers.\n\nSince the decline of the vaudeville era, acrobatic dance has undergone a multi-faceted evolution to arrive at its present-day form. The most significant aspect of this evolution is the integration of ballet technique as the foundation for dance movements, thus bringing into acro dance a precision of form and movement that was absent in vaudeville acrobatic dance. Also, vaudeville acrobatic dances were often little more than acrobatics set to music, whereas modern acro dance is fundamentally dance, with its acrobatic movements performed in a dance context.\n\nA defining characteristic of acro is the smooth, graceful transitions between dance and acrobatic movements. Also, a dance must have a significant percentage of dance movement, with respect to its acrobatic content, in order for it to be categorized as acro. For example, a gymnastics floor exercise is not considered to be acro because it has little or no dance movement compared to its acrobatic content, and also because it lacks smooth transitions between dance and gymnastic movements.\n\nThe dance movements in acro are founded in ballet, jazz, lyrical and modern dance styles. Acro dance movements are not restricted to these dance styles, but the complete absence of these styles will typically cause a dance to be categorized as something other than acro (e.g., breakdance).\n\nThe acrobatic movements and acts of balance performed in an acro dance are referred to as \"tricks\". A variety of tricks are commonly performed in acro dance, varying widely in complexity and the skills required to perform them. Aside from the obvious requirement that dancers possess the requisite skills to perform tricks, the types of tricks that can be performed in an acro dance depends on the number of dancers.\nSolo tricks can be performed by independent dancers in solo or group dances. Examples of this are:\n\nDouble tricks—also known as \"partnering tricks\"—can only be performed by a pair of dancers. An example of this is the \"pitch tuck\", in which one dancer forms a \"saddle\" with his hands. The second dancer steps onto the saddle and then the first dancer thrusts the saddle upward. The second dancer, who is propelled upward with back rotation, lands on her feet after a complete revolution in the air. Acro partners will sometimes execute lifts and adagio in addition to single and double tricks.\n\nGroup tricks generally require three or more dancers. Examples of this are:\n\nAcro dances are typically performed on hard stages with widely varying surfaces. Such floors differ substantially from a gymnastics floor, which is constructed by layering a standard surface over cushioning foam and spring floor. Whereas gymnasts perform barefoot and rely on the standard gymnastics floor for traction and cushioning, acro dancers seldom dance barefoot, instead depending on footwear such as acro shoes or foot thongs to provide the necessary traction and cushioning.\n\nAll of the most common types of acro footwear provide both traction and cushioning. In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear must protect the bottom of the foot from skin abrasion. Abrasion protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of friction during dance turns and leaps. Traction is essential to prevent lateral slipping that could result in dangerous falls to the hard floor. Cushioning serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high velocity. Cushioning is especially important when a Marley floor is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no cushioning whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.\n\nAcro dancers most often wear jazz dance shoes, which are commonly referred to as \"acro shoes\" by acro dancers. Acro shoes are called \"jazz boots\", \"jazz ankle boots\", \"jazz booties\" and other names, by their various manufacturers. They are typically laceless, slip-on shoes, with tight-fitting leather uppers that are designed to prevent the dancer's feet from shifting inside the shoes. Because of their thin, pliable leather uppers and split soles, acro shoes have excellent flexibility, thus enabling dancers to attain both good dance form and acrobatic control. The sole is made of soft, composite rubber so as to provide both high traction and cushioning, and it provides excellent protection from skin abrasion as it covers the entire bottom of the foot.\n\nLess commonly, acro dancers may wear \"foot thongs\", which are variously called \"Dance Paws\" and \"FootUndeez\", depending on the manufacturer. Foot thongs—which are slip-on, partial foot covers that protect only the ball of the foot—are sometimes preferred over acro shoes for aesthetic reasons. In particular, flesh colored foot thongs endow the wearer with the appearance of having bare feet, while retaining some degree of the traction, cushioning, and abrasion protection provided by acro shoes.\n\nAcro dancers commonly wear flexible, form-fitting clothing for both safety and aesthetic reasons. Form-fitting clothing is preferred over loose clothing because the latter does not move synchronously with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control. This is especially important when a dancer is performing tricks, as loss of control can lead to serious injury. Aside from the safety aspect, form-fitting clothing also helps to expose a dancer's body lines, which can add significantly to the visual impact of an acro dance performance.\n\nCompetitive acro dancers frequently wear costumes when performing at dance competitions. Acro costumes often have loose fabric pieces such as short skirts, but the sizes and locations of these pieces are carefully calculated to ensure that they pose no safety risks. As an extra safety measure, skirts are sometimes pinned or stitched at the back below the waistline so that they will not hang at full length when the dancer is inverted, as in hand walking; this prevents the skirt—which might otherwise become entangled in the dancer's hair or costume headpiece—from contacting the dancer's head.\n\nAcro dance is not uniformly defined within the competitive dance industry. Some dance competition companies require an acro routine to have a minimum of four or five tricks with at most fifty percent acrobatic content. Other companies require an acro routine to have exactly, or more than, fifty percent acrobatic content. Also, at some competitions an acro dance may fit into an explicitly defined \"acro dance\" performance category, while at others it may fall into a similar category such as \"acro/gym,\" or an alternative category such as \"open.\" Because of these differences, it may be necessary to enter a specific acro routine into different performance categories at different competitions.\n"}

Analogue terrestrial television broadcasts have ceased everywhere in the UK with Northern Ireland being the last region to have ceased broadcasting analogue terrestrial television broadcasts. Northern Ireland switched off the last analogue television signals, making all of the United Kingdom only capable of receiving digital television, in the early hours of 24 October 2012. It has been completely replaced by digital terrestrial television and other non-terrestrial means as of the end of 2012.\n\nThe following channels, all of which are free-to-air, were available on a national basis and continue to be available via digital terrestrial television:\n\n\nPrior to the cessation of analogue services, the first four services were available to 99% of households, with the more recent Channel 5 available to around 70%. There were additionally a number a smaller local channels available in particular areas, such as Channel M, which was available in Manchester and Six TV available in Oxford, Southampton, Reading and Portsmouth.\n\nITV, BBC One and BBC Two carried regional programmes, such as the local news, and continue to do so digitally. The ITV Network is made up of a number of regional operators, though a series of consolidation has resulted in most owned by ITV plc.\n\nAll channels carried at least one teletext service. This included subtitles for many programmes.\n\nThe terrestrial analogue services themselves were in most cases unique when compared to most non-analogue broadcast services (such as those available via digital satellite), in that they are much older, contain a much more diverse range of programming, rather than centring on a specific genre (all five major stations carry news bulletins, for example) and all hold some form of public service requirement in terms of their output.\n\nThe BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) began a regular television service, one of the first in the world, in 1936 as the BBC Television Service, funded to this day by a yearly mandatory licence fee. Since 1964 the BBC have provided two analogue television services, BBC One and BBC Two. Both services carried a wide variety of content as well as regional variations in programming and sometimes continuity. Latterly the BBC Two variations have been limited to England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For many years, BBC One in Wales was effectively a separate service, BBC Wales, though many programmes were common to both it and BBC One proper.\n\nITV (Independent Television) was established in 1954, providing the first commercial alternative to the BBC. Programmes would be funded through the 'selling' of air-time for the playing of advertisements; the broadcasters, the first of which began broadcasting in 1955, would be privately owned.\n\nAn Independent Television Authority (ITA), (superseded by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), Independent Television Commission (ITC) and latterly Ofcom) would choose the companies licensed to broadcast on a periodic basis. Each company would be (and nominally still is) afforded a 'franchise' to broadcast to a specific coverage area of the UK, with larger areas sometimes having two broadcasters 'time-sharing' a channel between weekdays and weekends. A separate nationwide 'breakfast' franchise also began in 1983.\n\nMost viewers would only receive one service (unless they happened to receive signals from two transmitters in different areas). Each regional 'franchisee' would broadcast a combination of unique regional programmes and shared 'networked' content aired nationwide; the latter practice becoming ever more commonplace throughout the network's history. Originally each company would broadcast with their own, unique station name, such as \"Yorkshire Television\" or \"Associated-Rediffusion\"; with separate continuity announcers and on-screen presentation. It was not until the late 1980s that popular use of the name \"ITV\" was used as a major on-screen brand, a practice which did not become universal in the ITV plc owned regions until the early 2000s.\n\nITV was established as a public service broadcaster with various requirements placed upon it affecting the nature of broadcast content, mandatory programming, daily limits on broadcast hours, strict controls on advertising practices and the process by which franchises were awarded.\n\nVarious relaxations on these requirements and restrictions were made throughout its history, with a substantial set of deregulation taking place upon the implementation of the Broadcasting Act 1990. Lifting of ownership restrictions resulting from this act and subsequent acts resulted in a single ITV plc owning and operating the majority of franchises by the early 2000s, with a common identity as 'ITV'. Three exceptions remain; STV Group plc, owns two franchises in Scotland broadcasting as STV whilst UTV broadcasts to Northern Ireland under that name.\n\nOther relaxations have substantially reduced the requirement for ITV to air particular types of programmes, though requirements such as local and national news provision remain.\n\nThe 1990 act formally introduced the legal title of 'Channel 3', though with limited exceptions this has never been used on-screen.\n\nFor many years, the ITA, IBA and the ITV companies campaigned for further frequencies on which to broadcast, though these goals were never wholly realised on analogue.\n\nAfter many decades of demand by the commercial broadcasters for a second commercial station or network of stations, Channel 4 and S4C were launched in 1982. Channel 4 was originally run as a uniform national service, by the IBA through a subsidiary, the Channel Four Broadcasting Company. Channel 4 does not make the programmes it broadcasts; content is commissioned from independent, private production companies such as the ITV companies and companies not related to ITV who had previously little space to broadcast in the UK. Channel 4 was originally funded by allowing each local ITV franchisee to sell adverts during the station's airtime in their area in exchange for a guaranteed income to be paid to the IBA. The station was established with the intention to provide programmes for minority groups and cater for specialist interests and has a remit that details these obligations.\n\nSince the abolition of the IBA, which took effect in 1993, Channel 4 has been run by the publicly owned, Channel Four Television Corporation and manages its own advertising.\n\nS4C (; \"Channel 4 Wales\") began broadcasts the day before Channel 4 after demands for a dedicated Welsh-language service for Wales. Previously ITV and the BBC were obliged to air Welsh language programmes, though these were often shown at off-peak times. S4C broadcast in place of Channel 4 which would never be available in Wales via analogue terrestrial; consequently some Channel 4 programmes were aired during off-peak times on S4C. Digital platforms in Wales provide both services; S4C's digital variant airing Welsh-language content only.\n\nS4C is operated by the S4C Authority, independent of the IBA and latterly Ofcom and is funded through advertising and direct government funding. The BBC also airs its Welsh language programmes on the service, funded by the licence fee. S4C ceased broadcasting on analogue at the end of March 2010, when the last analogue television transmissions in Wales ended.\n\nA fifth service was licensed during the 1990s and began broadcasts in 1997, called Channel 5, it has since been re-branded as Five and later back to Channel 5 in August 2010.\n\nThe Channel 5 licence has one single licensee and provides a nationwide service. Compared to the other analogue broadcasters, it has relatively few public-service obligations, provision of news programming being one exception. Limited space within the analogue television bands meant Channel 5 had substantially reduced coverage compared to the other networks, at around 70% coverage.\n\nIn addition to the five national networks, a limited number of local stations were broadcast to various towns and cities under what was known as a Restricted Service Licence. These occupied channels unused by the other broadcasters that could be used without causing interference in other regions, and were frequently broadcast at a lower power than the major channels. Their output was mainly local, and each contract for an RSL lasted four years until 2004 when media regulator Ofcom stated that each licence will be renewed up until digital switchover.\n\nTelevision broadcasting began on an experimental basis by the BBC in London in 1936 on VHF Band I. Initially the service was operated using two competing systems:\n\nThe earliest television broadcasts used the 240-line Baird system and the 405-line Marconi-EMI system on alternate weeks. However, the Baird system proved too cumbersome and by early 1937 had been dropped and the Marconi-EMI system became the standard. This system was later codified by the ITU's CCIR (now ITU-R) on an international conference in Stockholm in 1961 as System A.\n\nDifferent broadcast stations across the country were broadcast on different channels to avoid interference and allow for regional variations.\n\nBroadcast was suspended during the Second World War but resumed in 1946. The BBC was joined on this system in 1955 with the launch of commercial television in the form of the regional Independent Television (ITV) network, managed by the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which also saw the use of VHF Band III.\n\nThis was the sole system in existence until the preparations for the introduction of 625-line transmission in 1964 and was put out of use at the start of 1985.\n\n1964 saw the launch of a third television service, known as BBC2, and with it the introduction of the 625 line service on UHF Bands IV and V. Whilst the extra lines theoretically offered better resolution and picture clarity, the fledgling network of new transmitters required to provide the service offered far inferior coverage compared with the existing VHF services and was prone to increased interference often resulting in poor picture quality. Furthermore, few people had the new sets required to receive the new service or the different type of aerial required to pick up the UHF signal.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, when the decision to introduce colour television was first seriously mooted, the then two main systems for consideration were the French SECAM and American NTSC systems, the latter generally considered superior and expected to be adopted. Throughout the 1960s a third competing system, PAL, became available and was eventually adopted by the GPO for use on the 625 line service, to be known as System I or PAL-I.\n\nBroadcast on this system officially commenced in 1967 with BBC2's (and the UK's) launch of colour television programming, though previous years had seen many unofficial colour test films outside of official broadcasting hours, including some which trialled NTSC and SECAM. BBC2 was joined in 1969 by BBC1 and the main ITV franchises (the rest following in stages into the 1970s). Both BBC1 and ITV continued to broadcast simultaneously on the VHF system A until 1985\n\nWithout affecting the definition of the \"PAL-I\" system, the UK also used a digital stereo companding system on analogue terrestrial television called NICAM. Standing for Near Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex and used for digital stereo TV broadcasts to the public, it used the NICAM digital audio system used since the early 1970s for transmitting the audio carrier signal of a broadcast between two or more regional broadcasters and sometimes to the transmitters, where it was converted back to an analogue FM audio carrier 6 MHz above the video carrier signal.\n\nReception of the NICAM signal provided the user had a VCR or a TV capable of decoding the NICAM signal, which was broadcast on a carrier 6.552 MHz above the video carrier, and thus just 0.552 MHz above the FM mono audio carrier. The first UK NICAM stereo broadcast was made in May 1986 on BBC2, NICAM slowly being rolled out across the UK and across the broadcaster's programme schedules over the next 5 years, culminating in the official launch of NICAM on the BBC in 1991, ITV and Channel 4 having begun broadcasting NICAM in 1989 and 1990 respectively.\n\nThe service was sometimes referred to by its full, official, name, NICAM-728 – the 728 denoting the datarate of the digital stereo information – the datarate was 728kbit/s, non-PCM.\n\nThe 625 line system divided the spectrum into 44 channels, 21–34 and 39–68 (Bands IV and V). These channels were allocated, by the GPO, to the broadcasters to allow for four networks to operate with eventual maximum coverage and minimum cross-network interference. The two BBC channels and the ITV network were catered for, as well as space for a future fourth network, at the time expected to be a second network for the ITA. The fourth network didn't come into being until the Broadcasting Act 1980 created Channel 4 and S4C. This early provision meant that near complete coverage was afforded to both networks at launch, in 1982.\n\nWhen Channel 5 launched in 1997 it was allocated UHF channels which were in use by many domestic VCRs, requiring a massive equipment retuning exercise to be undertaken at the broadcaster's expense. Additionally, lack of compatibility with older antennas, plus existing use of the channels by stations in France, meant that Channel 5 never acquired the level of analogue coverage enjoyed by the other broadcasters.\n\nThe government was committed to switching terrestrial television broadcasting to fully digital by 2012. The digital network features six multiplexes at each of the 80 main nodes, at other nodes there is only three multiplexes because fewer broadcasters were interested in the less densely populated regions. A company called Digital UK was set up to handle the change. The switch was on a region by region basis using the ITV regions as a basis. The schedule was announced by Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell on 15 September 2005\n\nSome concern had been raised that the London region would be switched shortly before the city hosts the Olympic Games. Jowell said \"I can assure you that I did not slog for two years to bring the games here just to see Londoners reduced to huddling round the wireless to find out who won the hundred metres, I am completely confident that our timetable is a sensible one which will ensure that digital services are delivered with no disruption to the viewing public during the Games themselves.\"\n\nIt was also announced that a support scheme would be put in place to ensure that no one is left behind in the switch. It provided help with equipment and installation and follow-up support for people aged 75 years and over and people with significant disabilities. The scheme was funded by the BBC through the licence fee.\n\nThe final region to switch off was Northern Ireland, on 23 October 2012. To dedicate the permanent switching-off of analogue in Northern Ireland, and, by extension, the United Kingdom, BBC Northern Ireland and UTV together aired \"The Magic Box\", a programme dedicated to analogue TV: it became the last programme broadcast in analogue in the United Kingdom.\n"}

Inspired by ghost stories she heard as a child from both her extended Aboriginal and Irish Australian families, Tracey Moffatt has constructed a sublime trilogy in which characters are haunted by the past and bewitched by memories. All three stories are set in Moffatt’s highly stylized, hyper-real, hyper-imaginary Australian landscape. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"Mr. Chuck\" is the first of the three-part series featured in \"BeDevil\". It tells the story of a young indigenous boy haunted by the ghost of an American GI who drowned in the swamp around which much of this segment takes place. Various nonlinear events of the boy’s childhood are presented through the perspectives of two narrators: the boy as an older man reflecting on his youth and a white woman whose family took part in the colonization of this area of Australia. The film follows the young boy as he observes and interacts with white settlers who are building a cinema on top of the swamp, while simultaneously holding a caretaker position to his two younger siblings, experiencing abuse at the hands of adults in his family, and having episodic interactions with the ghost of the American GI. These clips of memory are framed by the two narrators’ alternating recounting of them, presented in the style of a documentary interview.\n\nIn the desolate plains of outback Queensland, Ruby (played by Moffatt herself) and her family are haunted by invisible trains which run on a track beside their house. The ghost of a young girl killed by a train drives Ruby and her family away. After many years Ruby returns to experience the ghostly presence yet again.\n\nImelda’s people are Torres Strait Islanders. When her son Bebe and his love, Minnie, leave their community to escape opposition to their marriage, Imelda follows them to a small town in north Queensland. Tragedy strikes - Bebe and Minnie die, but the doomed couple never find peace. The spirits of Minnie and Bebe dance on a condemned warehouse and refuse to leave.\n\nStorytelling is a central concern of \"beDevil\". Creating and sharing stories is a way to make sense of the world, and both encourages and reflects connections between the past and the present, and people and places. Through the process of telling us their stories, each of the narrators in \"beDevil\" recount shared tales, a sort of modern folklore. While this brings to mind the importance of storytelling to Indigenous traditions, Moffatt explicitly states that these stories “come from both sides of my background – my white relatives as well as my black relatives.” Yet she also insists that “I don’t think you can call the stories particularly white or Aboriginal”. The hybrid nature of Moffatt’s work reflects the way that she perceives the multicultural make-up of Australian society, and she explains that “it is completely natural for me to represent that mixing of races”. \"beDevil\" is very much about \"her\" stories, weaving together “a personal mythology”, and presenting images that are “so personal that a lot of the time they embarrass me”.\n\n\nTracey Moffatt approached Tony Buckley to produce as she was impressed by the films he had made, especially \"The Night, the Prowler\" (1978). \"Bedevil\" was filmed on location in Charleville and Bribie Island, Queensland.\n\n\"Bedevil\" grossed at the box office in Australia.\n\n\n"}

The major difference is that bizarre magic uses storytelling and word play to a much greater degree, and less emphasis is placed on the manual dexterity of the performer or the complexity of his equipment. The experience is intended to be more akin to small, intimate theater than a conventional magic show.\n\nBizarre Magicians often use authentic antique or simulated artifacts to enhance their presentations. Storytelling is also employed for a greater sense of theatrical authenticity. Techniques such as these distinguish Bizarre from other types of magic performance. Max Maven has said of Bizarre Magic that it \"references a larger magical world beyond the boundaries of the performance.\"\n\nBizarre magic often uses horror and supernatural imagery in addition to the standard commercial magic approaches of comedy and wonder. Bizarre magic deliberately utilizes discomfort for theatrical effect. Another methodology employed in performance is the integration of storytelling enhanced by magic. Bizarre Magic is often performed as close-up magic, for a few people at a time, but it can also be performed as a club show or even as a stage act, depending on the routine, the props, and the performer.\n\nThe movement of the art of Bizarre Magic began in the late 1960s with Charles Cameron and Tony \"Doc\" Shiels. Some of the significant artists since that time have been Tony Andruzzi (aka Maskelyn ye Mage), Eugene Burger, Christian Chelman, Robert Neale, and Jeff McBride.\n\nMost of the material on the subject is published privately within the Bizarre Magic community and is not readily available through normal distribution. And many of the important works were either hand-made or published on a very limited basis. So despite being relatively recent publications, many have significant collectible value.\n\nContemporary British practitioners include Todd Landman, Iain Jay, Michael Murray, Nick Brunger, Stuart Burrell, Ashton Carter, Steve Drury and Dale Shrimpton.\n\nThere are a few annual events focused on Bizarre Magic. The first event was the now defunct \"Invocational\" which started a tradition of annual gatherings in honor of the Bizarre. In Edinburgh, Scotland the annual Charles Cameron Gathering is held in October. Also in October is the Magic and Meaning Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. England's most popular convention for bizarre magicians is \"Doomsday\" - being held in Dracula's favourite seaside town, Whitby. It moves to a new location in 2019 after being held for the final time there in May 2018. Since 2015, The East Coast Spirit Sessions is held in January in Myrtle Beach,SC. In 2018, the first annual Mid-Atlantic Bizarre Hauntings Conference was held.\n"}

This group was established in 1996 as part of the “new circus” movement and travels frequently around the world. \n\nThe circus is one of the most active Finnish group touring abroad, having appeared in theaters and in cultural festivals in about thirty countries. Circo Aereo has been called “a sparkling tribute to the circus” (Le Figaro, France), “half circus, half cabaret” (Le Monde, France) and “a treasure chest full of the things of which circus is made, filled with beautiful sights, meticulous joint efforts and inventive surprises” (Helsingin Sanomat, Finland) . Circo Aereo also has held workshops for schools and circus performers, along with other educational projects.\n\nIn order to develop the concept of the traditional circus, Circo Aereo incorporates other art forms into its shows, such as elements of theatre and dance, with audience interaction playing an important part. Super 8 was created in 2004, which combined traditional magic tricks, super 8 films and elements of video games. Trippo was also created in 2004 and geared for children, playing mostly in Scandinavian countries and France.\n\nIn 2005, Circo Aereo created two musically dominant shows. The first was called the Louisiana Circus, co produced with the UMO Jazz Orchestra and in collaboration with Fritt Fall Rinne Radio, a Finnish electro-jazz band. This production consisted of six artists and twenty musicians, combining circus with a cabaret atmosphere.\n\nIn 2007, an air show called “Piece for Two Ropes” opened, choreographed by Sanna Silvernnoinen and another show called FUR! by Maksim Komaro, both with the aim of combining contemporary circus and contemporary dance. In the latter production, artists from various countries, traditions and specialties created their own variations of traditional movements. Circo Aereo has worked with Sirque, pole circus Nexon in Limousin since 2007.\n\nCirco Aereo’s most recent production is called “Espresso,” which is performed along with French juggling group Les Objets Volants. The show features four artists who create scenes and stories, on the ground and in the air, with juggling, dance and aerials, but no words. According to director Maksim Komaro, Espresso is a journey through the history of circus, following Komaros own circus experience from the traditional to cabaret and the contemporary circus of Europe. Espresso is one of Circo Aereo's biggest successes. Helsingin Sanomat called the work “a treasure chest filled with beautiful sights, meticulous efforts and inventive surprises,” while Le Monde said, “intelligence and virtuosity are embedded in the magical vignettes.”\n\nThe show was created in 2006, touring for three years in and around Europe especially in the Parc de la Villette in Paris, at the Théâtre de Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland and the Damascus Opera House, Syria. In 2009, the show and the circus itself made its North American debut, performing eight eastern U.S. states. This tour was considered important to opening up the North American circus market to less-traditional shows. In 2011, Espresso and Circo Aereo returned to the continent to perform at Wabash College in Indiana, Brigham Young University in Utah and the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Guanajuato, Mexico .\n"}

The sweeping provisions under the aforementioned act ask channels not to offend good taste, decency or attack religions or communities. Nor should they carry anything that is likely to encourage or incite violence or anything that goes against the maintenance of law and order. Specifically, the code says programmes should not telecast anything amounting to contempt of court; They should contain aspersions on the integrity of the President and the judiciary, criticise, malign, or slander any individual in person or certain groups,segments of social, public and moral life of the country. This is the code that the EMMC follows as it looks for transgressions and airtime to ministers. \nAccording to sources, \"It is the tracking of ministers that consumes all the time, and prevents a proper monitoring of channels\" It is here that officials watch out for television channels, about 600 of them, tripping on the programme code, drawn up by the government, offering the I&B ministry reasons to serve show cause notices on the channels. The EMMC monitors 'around 600' TV channels on a day-to-day basis. The penalties vary, depending on the degree of violation. On 2 March 2015, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, the Minister of State for the Information and Broadcasting Ministry in a query stated that there were at least three instances in 2015 against channels over violations of the Programming and Advertising Code: While in one case, an order was issued to take a channel off air for seven days, in another case, a warning was issued. In another instance, a show cause notice was issued. According to Arun Jaitley, over 20 channels were banned for flouting of rules over the last 20 years. In January 2015, an amount of Rs.20 krore was allocated in the financial year 2014-15 for facilitating augmentation of the monitoring capacity of the EMMC. By 2017, the Government hopes to increase the capacity of the EMMC to about 1500 channels.\n"}

He was owner of the Lambert Puppet Theatre in Monkstown, County Dublin. He was noted for co-starring as O'Brien in the RTÉ television series \"Wanderly Wagon\". Lambert's Puppet Theatre also produced the iconic children's television character Bosco. He died in 2010 at the age of 81.\n\nLambert was born and raised in County Sligo. His father was the county librarian, but died at the age of 35. His mother took on his father's old job and Lambert was raised in a bookish home. He made his first puppet aged 8 and was a proficient ventriloquist by the time he reached his early teens.\n\nLambert was long a stalwart of the Irish vaudeville scene, particularly in Dublin, although he also toured the country frequently with his wife Mai. His most common acts were with Finnegan, a mischievous storyteller, and Judge, a pensive dog. With the rise of television in the 1960s, the Lambert puppet theatre became a fixture in Irish broadcasting. In the early 1960s, Lambert devised a puppet series for children entitled \"Murphy agus a Chairde\" (\"Murphy and His Friends\"). Murphy was a giant who lived in a magical kingdom. Its king, \"An Rí\", only had one problem - constant mischief from two witches, Feemy and Babóg. RTÉ was the only station most people in Ireland could then access and Murphy's adventures were soon an important part of most children's viewing. Murphy himself appeared as the in-vision continuity announcer all through one of RTÉ's Christmas Day broadcasts.\n\nIn November 1963, Lambert drew international attention after he successfully acquired a driver's license for his puppet Finnegan. Lambert reported that he did so simply to show how easy it was for anybody in Ireland to obtain a license.\n\nHe later co-starred in the children's television series \"Wanderly Wagon\" as the mischievous and greedy O'Brien, known for his childlike curiosity and cowardice in the face of magical events. Lambert and his family provided many regular (puppet) characters — Judge the dog, Mr Crow (who lived in a cuckoo clock), the mysterious Foxy Loxy, and the untrustworthy Ssneaky Ssnake. The series also featured Irish actor Frank Kelly who played Dr Astro in the series, who later appeared as Fr. Jack Hackett in \"Father Ted\".\n\nAnother series created by Eugene Lambert was adapted from a children's book by Patricia Lynch, \"Brógeen Follows The Magic Tune.\" Brógeen was a leprechaun who teamed up with a fiddler who had heard a piece of music created by the fairies - and they wanted it back. The series was a great success and won several awards internationally. Some years later, when Lambert enquired about the 2\" master video tapes, RTÉ admitted to having re-used them. \"Brogeen\" (and most of \"Wanderly Wagon\") was gone forever, although a dubbed version of \"Brogeen\" still exists in the archives of NRK.\n\nThe Lambert Puppet Theatre was established in 1972. Eugene Lambert founder and Director of the Lambert Puppet Theatre had an interest in puppetry from a very early age, making his own ventriloquist dummy Charley, which later developed into Finnegan the ventriloquist act. In the early years with Finnegan, Eugene toured UK and Ireland extensively and in later years he promoted Ireland for Irish Tourist Board, touring USA, Japan and Australia.\n\nLambert's Puppet Theatre was responsible for producing the popular 1980s children's television character Bosco who was an ever-present fixture on the Irish national station.\n\nEugene and Mai Lambert had ten children two of whom predeceased him. Lambert supplemented his day job as refrigeration engineer with his \"Punch and Judy\", appearing in private houses and night time was taken up with appearing with his vent act Finnegan at Gala concerts and Dinners. The Lambert family participated in Jury’s Irish Cabaret for 7 years bringing topical puppet acts to the American audience.\n\nEugene and his wife Mai visited The Harlequin Puppet Theatre in Colwyn Bay, Wales and an International Puppet Festival in Prague. Inspired, they decided to open a puppet theatre of their own, \"The Lambert Puppet Theatre\".\n\nLambert died at his home in Monkstown, County Dublin on Monday 22 February 2010, aged 82. His funeral on 26 February 2010 was attended by entertainers and politicians, with Liam Ó Maonlaí and Sinéad O'Connor singing at his Mass and a miniature Wanderly Wagon featuring in the ceremony.\n\n"}

As a comedian of slapstick he is credited with popularizing the custard-pie-in-the-face gag. During the 1890s, in order to circumvent stage censorship, Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue.\n\nCheeky authority-defying playlets such as \"Jail Mum\" (1896) in which prisoners play tricks on warders and \"Early Birds\" (1903), where a small man defeats a large ruffian in London's East End, can be seen as precursors of movie silent comedy. Film producer Hal Roach stated: \"Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him.\"\n\nAmong the music hall comedians who worked for him were Charlie Chaplin and his understudy, Arthur Jefferson, who later adopted the name of Stan Laurel. These were part of what was known as \"Fred Karno's Army\", a phrase still occasionally used in the UK to refer to a chaotic group or organisation. The phrase was also adapted by British soldiers into a trench song in the First World War, as a parody of, or rather to the tune of, the hymn \"The Church's One Foundation\". In the Second World War it was adapted as the Anthem of the Guinea Pig Club, the first line becoming \"We are McIndoe's Army ...\".\n\nKarno was born in Exeter, Devon, England, in 1866. He worked as a cabinet maker with a workshop in Waterbeer Street. He married Edith and in 1896 his son, Fred Karno Jr. was born. In 1904 he visited Tagg's Island on London's River Thames and in 1912 he bought the island and the existing hotel. He demolished the original hotel and hired architect Frank Matcham to build The Karsino. With the advent of cinema, the music hall's popularity declined. As a result of this decline, Karno went bankrupt in 1925.\n\nOn 24 May 1927 his wife Edith, from whom he had been separated since 1904, died in her sleep of diabetes. Three weeks later, Karno married his second wife, his long-time partner, Marie Moore. Karno went to the US in 1929, and was hired by the Hal Roach Studios as a writer-director, and was reunited with one of his former protégés, Stan Laurel. However, his stay at the studio was brief and unsuccessful as Hal Roach found out Karno's main abilities were as a producer, and he departed in February 1930. On his return to Britain, Karno helped to write and produce several short films and in 1936 returned to the theatre with a show called \"Real Life\".\n\nKarno spent his last years in southwest England in the village of Lilliput, Dorset, as a part-owner of an off-licence bought with financial help from Charlie Chaplin, and died there in 1941 from diabetes, aged 75.\n\nHis houseboat, the \"Astoria\", on the River Thames at Hampton, Middlesex, is now used as a recording studio by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.\n\nOn 30 September 2012, the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America unveiled a commemorative blue plaque to Karno at his former studios at 38 Southwell Road, Camberwell, in south London.\n\n"}

She attended a private school in Newburgh, New York, but eschewed additional education to become an actress. She became a dedicated student of the art of pantomime. She stood 5'7\" tall, weighed 142 pounds, and had dark brown hair and eyes.\n\nKane performed at the Lyceum Theatre in \"Heap Game Watch\" in January 1914. She had a significant role in \"Seven Keys To Baldpate Astor\", which was staged at the Gaiety Theatre, London, in May 1914. The comedy was brought to the stage by George M. Cohan. She paired with George Nash in \"The Miracle Man\" at the Astor Theatre. The play was produced on Broadway in the fall of 1914.\nKane acted in a presentation of \"The Hyphen Knickerbocker\" in April 1915. She returned to the stage at the Broadhurst Theatre in July 1920. She was paired with Earle Fox, another actor who had been spending much of his time in movies. They appeared in the comedy \"Come Seven\". The production was an adaptation by Octavus Roy Cohen of stories he had contributed to \"The Saturday Evening Post\". The play was the first ever featuring an entirely caucasian cast in black face.\n\n\"Lawful Larceny\" (1922) was a comedy adapted from the writing of Samuel Shipman. It was presented at the Republic Theater, built by Oscar Hammerstein in 1900, at 42nd Street. The players included Kane, Margaret Lawrence, Ida Waterman, and Lowell Sherman.\n\n\"The Breaking Point\" by Mary Roberts Rinehart was staged at the Klaw Theatre, West 45th Street, New York City, in August 1923. The plot concerned amnesia with the setting (fiction) moving from New York to Wyoming and back. Kane, Regina Wallace, Reginald Barlow, and McKay Morris were the principal actors in the drama.\n\nShe played Ellen Halpin in the 1925 comedy \"Loggerheads\" at the Cherry Lane Theatre. The Booth Theatre produced \"Paid\", written by Sam Forrest, in November 1925. Kane portrayed \"Mrs John Ramsey\" in a play which endured for twenty-one performances.\n\nKane was arrested following a performance of \"The Captive\" at the Empire Theater on Broadway in February 1927. The production was considered indecent and a violation of Section 1140A of the New York City Criminal Code, although the play had been tried and acquitted of immorality a short time earlier by a citizen's play jury. It was in its fifth month of production.\n\nForty-one arrests were made in total. Two other productions were raided on the same night. They were \"Sex\", playing at Daly's 63rd St. Theater, and \"The Virgin Man\", which was being performed before an audience at the Princess Theater. Among the actors taken to Night Court were Basil Rathbone, Helen Menken, Ann Trevor, Winifred Fraser, John Miltern, and Arthur Lewis. Menken was comforted by Kane as she made her exit after becoming agitated by the glares and explosions of cameras snapping as she stepped out on the sidewalk. \"Please make them stop,\" Menken reportedly exclaimed. Also arrested was Mae West, the star of \"Sex\", and twenty others among a cast of fifty. Authorities promised to repeat the arrests if the plays were not withdrawn or modified to comply with the criminal code.\n\nKane's movie career spanned much of the silent era, beginning with a role as \"Bonita Canby\", in \"Arizona\" (1913). In the western she had the third lead, portraying the unfaithful wife of a U.S. Cavalry officer. She co-starred as Jurgis Rudkus's (played by George Nash) wife Ona Lukoszaite in the film adaptation of Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" (1914). She starred in \"Via Wireless\" (1915) which was adapted from a play by Winchell Smith and Paul Armstrong. The story describes the competition between two men in the invention of a new naval gun. A wealthy man becomes the rival of one of the inventors for the affection of the daughter of an ironmaster. As \"Frances Durant\", Kane is finally given a part worthy of her skill as an actress. One critic described her as \"a diamond set in brass\" in her previous films. \nKane was employed by the Mutual Film Corporation of Santa Barbara, California when she made \"The Upper Crust\" (1917). Produced by Mutual-American, Edward Pell is cast as Kane's leading man in a comedy replete with humor. Kane is a young Irish woman named \"Molly O'Toole\". She impersonates a wealthy dowager and succeeds in her ruse long enough to enjoy herself and eventually marry the dowager's son.\n\nIn July 1917 Kane joined an effort organized by William A. Brady, President of the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry, and D.W. Griffith. Their task was to utilize film as a tool of information regarding the \"plans and purposes\" of the United States in World War I. Brady was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to mobilize the motion-picture industry. Kane was assigned to the Food Commission. In addition to Mutual she was associated with Metro Pictures, Pathé, and World. Kane filed a suit against Mutual in 1918, asking $33,500 for alleged breach of contract. \n\n\"The Scarlet Oath\" (1917) was a challenging movie for Kane who played the dual role of two women. \"A Game of Wits\" (1917) is a five-reel comedy with Kane portraying \"Jeannette Browning\" in a unique love story.\n\nShe continued to act in motion pictures for another decade. Among her later movies are \"Love's Law\" (1918), \"The Daredevil\" (1918), \"Someone Must Pay\" (1919), \"Romeo's Dad\" (1919), \"Empty Arms\" (1920), \"Idle Hands\" (1921), \"The White Sister\" (1923), and \"Convoy\" (1927).\n\nKane's husband, Henry Iden Ottman, died in January 1939. Ottman was born in New York City in 1880, the son of William Ottman and Christine Iden. Ottman moved to Augusta, Maine in 1921. Kane and Ottman had a son, William Kane Ottman.\n\nShe owned a collection of scarab beetles considered to be one of the finest in America in 1917. The most valuable of the Scarabaeus sacer is said to have been removed from the tomb of an Egyptian princess of the 2nd Ptolemaic dynasty. Archaeologists believe it to be one of a number issued to illustrate the doctrine of the resurrection. Kane was given her first scarab by Howard Estabrook, who played \"Adhemar de Gratignan\" in \"Divorcons\" (1913). Presented at the New York Playhouse, Kane portrayed \"Mme. de Brionne\" in the play written by the French dramatist Victorien Sardou. Estabrook purchased the scarab in India while he was touring. \n\nShe collected bathing suits. Kane possessed one of the most attractive collections of one-piece, two-piece, and \"fluffy ruffles seashore outfits\" in Chicago, Illinois by 1917. Each bathing suit was also designed by her.\n\nGail Kane died in Augusta, Maine in 1966, aged 80.\n\n\n\n"}

Coes (1828 – March 16, 1897) was an American minstrel music performer. He appeared in numerous minstrel shows in California and throughout the Northeastern United States.\n\nCoes was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1828.\n\nMinstrelsy was America's first original contribution to the theater arts. It was popular from just before the American Civil War to the end of the 19th Century. Today, minstrelsy and its attendant blackface is viewed as racist and anachronistic; however, it was the preeminent entertainment in the United States during the life of George H. Coes, and he was one of the most well-known and successful performers.\n\nCoes went to California in 1852 and was associated with a number of minstrel acts, principally in San Francisco before returning East and opening with Woods and Christy's Minstrels in New York City in 1857. In 1858, Coes returned to California and joined with Sam Wells to form Coes and Wells' Minstrels. That partnership did not last and Coes returned to performing in other companies. In 1867, after years of performing in the minstrel companies of others, Coes joined with S.S. Purdy and Frank Converse to form Coes, Purdy and Converse's Party which opened in Harlem on March 19, 1867.\n\nCoes joined with his old friend Luke Schoolcraft in 1874 and they formed \"one of the most famous minstrel tandems in history.\" Schoolcraft & Coes appeared with a number of leading companies including Emerson's Megatherian Minstrels and Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West. By 1880, the two settled with their families in Cambridge, Massachusetts and continued to tour throughout the country performing their minstrel act in a variety of shows and venues.\n\nWhen Coes was unable to continue his career due to poor health in 1889, the partnership dissolved. Coes was stricken with paralysis in 1891 and died at his home at 205 Hampshire Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts on March 16, 1897.\n\nGeorge H. Coes produced a book of music in 1877, entitled George Coes' Album of Music which included a number of hits, including:\n\n\n"}

In 2010 the center hosted over 900 events with attendance in excess of 263,600 participants. The center includes two theatres and is home to two dance companies, Kolben and Vertigo.\n\nFormerly known as Beit Ha'Am, in 1961 the newly opened site was the venue for the trial of Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann, who sat in a specially-made bulletproof glass booth during the proceedings. After the trial, the building reverted to its use as a cultural center, but in 1983 the complex was upgraded to an arts centre by the Jerusalem Foundation with funding from Eliezer and Lucie Behar of France, who renamed the center in memory of their son, Gerard, a victim of the Nazis during World War II. In 1987 the Gerard Behar Center was incorporated into the newly named Jacob & Hilda Blaustein Civic Center, which encompasses the two theatres, a dance studio, a municipal library, an adult education program, and an ulpan.\n\nBeit Ha'Am (, literally, \"People's House\") was a public cultural program operating in various cities in Israel; it was underway in Jerusalem by 1904. It provided public lectures, cultural evenings, a reading library, and a venue in which people could meet and discuss the issues of the day. Lacking a permanent home, the program moved from place to place in the vicinity of Street of the Prophets, with one of its better-known locations being on Isaiah Street, to the rear of the Histadrut building on Straus Street. In the 1930s and 1940s, Beit Ha'Am convened in various downtown theatres, including the Zion Cinema, the Eden Theater, the Orion Theater, and the Edison Theater, the latter of which had seating for over 2,000. After the establishment of the State of Israel, Beit Ha'Am occupied the Perlstein building at 70 Jaffa Road.\n\nJewish historian and ethnographer Raphael Patai was a frequent speaker for the popular lecture series; in his book, \"Journeyman in Jerusalem: Memories and Letters, 1933–1947\", he recalls his well-attended lecture at a commemorative evening for Theodor Herzl in 1937, a lecture on Josephus which was not received as well, and a lecture on \"Jewish sea battles\". In 1944 Patai introduced a Jewish folklore studies component to Beit Ha'Am and was the scientific director for that segment.\n\nIn 1950 the cornerstone was laid for a permanent building for Beit Ha'Am on Bezalel Street in the Nachlaot neighborhood. The land had been purchased by the Jewish National Fund for this purpose, and architect A. Hoffman designed the building. While construction commenced before the declaration of the state of Israel, the project was abandoned with the onset of the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. In 1955 the project was taken over by the Jerusalem Municipality, which hired architect David Reznik to complete the plans. The building was finally completed in 1961.\n\nWith the capture of the Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires and the decision by the Israeli government to try him for crimes against humanity, the newly opened Beit Ha'Am was chosen as the site for the trial, in part due to its ability to accommodate the many journalists and media correspondents expected to attend. The building was enclosed by a high security fence and a holding cell for Eichmann was established on-site for the duration of the trial.\n\nThe four-month trial, which began on April 11, 1961, was highly publicized and covered by radio, newspaper, and television journalists from around the world. Of the 756 seats made available in the theatre, 474 were designated for members of the press; journalists also viewed the proceedings via closed-circuit television in an adjacent press room. Another 570 viewers watched on a closed-circuit screen in the nearby Ratisbonne Monastery. Videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day. A bulletproof glass wall was erected between the stage where the judges sat and the spectator seating, and Eichmann sat inside his own bulletproof glass booth with armed guards at his side. The trial concluded on August 14, 1961; on December 13 the court found Eichmann guilty of crimes against humanity. The death penalty was issued on December 15. Eichmann's attorneys appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, but the court upheld the verdict on May 29, 1962. After a last-minute appeal for clemency to Israeli president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi was also refused, Eichmann was executed shortly after midnight on June 1, 1962.\n\nFollowing the Eichmann trial, Beit Ha'Am reverted to its function as a cultural center. In the early 1980s the Jerusalem Foundation undertook the creation of a major arts centre on the site and found a donor in Eliezer and Lucie Behar of France. The renovation, designed by David Reznik and completed in 1983, upgraded the theatre in which the Eichmann trial had taken place into a 650-seat performance venue for theatre, music, and dance, and added a second, 200-seat theatre to the complex. Both theatres are handicapped accessible. The theatre complex was renamed the Gerard Behar Center in memory of the donors' son, who had been murdered by the Nazis. A circular plaza fronting the entrance was also created in 1983.\n\nThe Gerard Behar Center hosts theatre, music, and dance performances; folk dancing; ethnic shows; Russian-, French-, and Arabic-language shows; plays; comedy shows; and children's performances. From time to time it works with other bodies to stage independent productions, such as a \"Hot Jazz Series\" which brings together the \"best musicians\" from Israel and abroad to perform \"jazz, salsa, classical, Latin, African and Jewish music\". The all-female Theatre Company Jerusalem has staged the world premiere of several works at the Center, including the 1992 Israeli-Palestinian play \"The Jasmine Bush\" and the 2000 play \"Sota\". The Center is the home of two dance companies, Vertigo and Kolben.\n\nThe Center is the site for events held in conjunction with the Israel Festival, the Jerusalem Arts Festival, and Holocaust Remembrance Day. On the latter holiday, a free \"Singing and Remembering\" event combines performances by singers and songwriters with audience participation, as attendees are encouraged to \"share stories about their personal connection to the Holocaust\". The Center is also the venue for the annual Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach Memorial Concert, the Machol Shalem (Whole Dance) Festival, and the Hullegeb Israeli Ethiopian Arts Festival.\n\nTens of thousands of K–12 students visit the Gerard Behar Center each school year as part of the government's \"Cultural Basket\" program (, \"Omanut La'Am\"), which mandates student attendance at \"performances, art films and/or art exhibitions five or six times a year as part of their curriculum\"; these activities are subsidized and transportation is provided. The Israel Broadcasting Authority sponsors an annual Competition for Young Artists in which musicians aged 18 to 30 compete for scholarships and the Gerard Behar Grand Prize.\n\nThe Center hosts workshops by artists from the United States and England, and exhibitions of art and photography primarily by local artists. Lectures, seminars, conferences, and gatherings of organizations, institutions, and government offices round out the annual calendar of events.\n\nAccording to the 2006 Jerusalem Foundation report, both theatres in the Gerard Behar Center \"are nearly always filled to capacity for events\". In calendar year 2010, there were approximately 63,300 attendees at theatrical performances, 31,800 attendees at dance and musical performances, and 36,100 children attending \"Cultural Basket\" events. The Center hosted over 900 events in 2010, with attendance in excess of 263,600 participants.\n\nNotwithstanding its prominence, the Center has a permanent staff of only four: a director-general, a secretary, a technician, and a ticket sales manager. Outside staff is brought in to produce large events.\n\nThe seven-story building adjoining the Gerard Behar Center contains an adult and youth reading library, an adult education program known as the Popular University, and Ulpan Beit Ha'Am, the largest and oldest Hebrew-language ulpan (language immersion course) in Jerusalem. The ulpan, operated by the Jerusalem Municipality, offers courses for new immigrants, tourists, and retirees, and conducts field trips to acquaint new immigrants with Israel. A dance/exercise studio is on the ground floor of the building. In 1987 the Jerusalem Foundation incorporated the Gerard Behar theatre complex, the Beit Ha'Am educational and library facilities, and the dance studio into a larger public complex known as the Jacob & Hilda Blaustein Civic Center.\n\nThe northern façade of the Gerard Behar Center, facing Bezalel Street, features a mural titled \"Around the World in 92 Days\". The triptych painting is a large-scale reproduction of a 1976 painting by Jerusalem artist Gabriel Cohen; the original is housed in the Israel Museum. Painted in naïve art style, the painting depicts world landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Walls of Jerusalem and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the pyramids of Egypt, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, bridges in London, and sights in India, with people and animals of all kinds walking along the streets and bridges below. The mural was produced by Cité de la Creation, which painted five \"trompe-l'œil\" murals in downtown Jerusalem. On the sidewalk across the street from the mural stand five small pillars topped with engraved metal plates describing the work in Hebrew and English, and depicting reproductions of different parts of the painting for visually-handicapped persons, with explanations in Braille.\n\n"}

{"id": "2997846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2997846", "title": "Go equipment", "text": "Go equipment\n\nGo equipment consists of the objects that are necessary in order to play the game of Go which originated in China. Although the equipment is simple, there is a varying degree of quality and material used in making the equipment, from the economical to the extremely valuable.\n\nThe oldest known surviving Go equipment is a board carved from rock that dates from the Han Dynasty in China. Other examples of ancient equipment can be found in museums in Japan and Korea.\n\nThe Go board, called the \"goban\" in Japanese, is the playing surface on which to place the stones. The standard board is marked with a 19×19 grid. Smaller boards include a 13×13 grid and a 9×9 grid used for shorter games that are often used to teach beginners. Some 19×19 boards have a 13×13 grid on the reverse side. 17×17 was used in historical times. Chinese boards are generally square; Japanese and Korean boards are slightly longer than wide, so that they appear square when viewed from a normal playing position. In Asian go parlors, the tables are slightly lower than the typical game table so that the players can clearly see the positions of the stones.\n\nTraditional Japanese \"goban\" usually follow the dimensions:\n\nGo boards fall into several types or styles.\n\nMaintaining wooden boards requires that they be properly stored in a humidity and temperature controlled environment to prevent discoloration, warping, cracking, woodworm, mold and other serious wear. Prolonged exposure to sunlight can bleach the board. Boards transported between climates with significantly differing humidity levels may be subjected to warping or cracking due to rapidly changing moisture content in the wood.\n\nGo stones, or \"go-ishi\" , are round objects placed on the board. They are colored either black or white, for each player, and normally number 181 for black and 180 for white (or sometimes 180 for each).\n\nThere are two styles or shapes of stones depending on where a player obtains them from:\n\nThe material varies. Some stones are made out of plastic, glass, porcelain or marble, but the traditional Japanese and Korean stones are made out of slate for black and clamshell for white. Chinese style stones can be made of glass, but to be considered true yunzi they must be sintered. The exact method of creation is a well-kept secret and was in fact lost for a time in the early 20th century due to instability within the country.\n\nStone thickness can also vary, from as low as 4 millimeters or as high as 12.8 millimeters, with most between 7.0 mm and 10.1 mm for biconvex and 5–7 mm for single convex. Thick slate and shell stones can last for generations, slowly becoming thinner from handling, and gradually acquiring an ivory-like patina. The diameter of the stones is standardized to around 22 mm ±1 mm, which can fit almost all Go boards. Black stones are slightly larger in diameter to compensate for optical illusion of the white stones appearing larger when placed with black stones of the same diameter. This mostly applies to Korean and Japanese stones – Chinese stones tend to be sometimes larger in diameter, but they do come in different standard sizes. A Chinese \"large\" size is about 23 mm in diameter while \"medium\" is about 22 mm. Chinese board dimensions are also accordingly larger to accommodate them. See also some comparative measurements of various go stone sets.\n\nFor the most expensive clamshell and slate Go stones, stone thickness is carefully controlled and ranked according to size. Typical stone sizes are size 25 (7.0 mm thick) to size 37 (10.4 mm), and even thicker stones are available for a correspondingly much higher price. Commonly used shell and slate Go stone thicknesses are size 32 (8.8 mm) and size 33 (9.2 mm) for most individuals and size 36 (10.1 mm) for professionals. Stones thicker than 10.1 mm are difficult to place on the board, while many Go players prefer stones that are 8.8 and 9.2 mm thick, considering these the optimum thickness for aesthetic and practical reasons.\n\nGenerally, these are the cheapest stones available. They range from flat, counter shaped to the typical lens shape. Price ranges from around $5–$30.\n\nOne specific type of plastic stone is called the Ing stone, manufactured by the Ing Chang-ki Wei-chi Education Foundation. These are the official stones of the Ing Foundation and have some extra weight to them due to metal inserted in the middle of the stone. They are 10 mm thick and sometimes come in an Ing Bowl, which is specially designed to count them (Ing rules require each player to start with exactly 180 stones).\n\nStones can also be made from Melamine resin. This is a stable compound used in making countertops and other kitchenware and is considered safe.\n\nPorcelain stones are the least common material for stones.\n\nThe most widely used and most economical. They range from thinner flat-bottomed style, to a symmetrical lens shape. Glass stones have the correct weight and can be grasped with ease. White stones are polished and black ones are buffed to a matte finish, giving a feel somewhat like slate and clam stones. Price ranges from US$15 to $80 for glass stones with bowls. Glass 'gems' at an arts and crafts store are an inexpensive alternative.\n\nThese are usually the most expensive stones one can get, since each stone is handmade using mechanical grinding and polishing equipment. The black stones are made of slate, while the white stones are made from clamshells. Due to a single clam shell yielding only a limited number of stones (around three), white stones are expensive to produce. The clamshells used to make the white stones used to be farmed from Japan, but since the supply is dwindling, most clamshells are harvested from Baja California in Mexico. These stones have three grades, depending on the stripe or grain pattern of the white stones. All grades use the same uniform black slate stones. Shell stones may also rarely be made out of the giant clam (shako in Japanese) shell, as well as a clam shell that has a slight purple tint. Clamshell stones are cut as cylinders using a diamond coring drill, then professionally ground, sanded, shaped, and polished into the final product. Shell and slate stones are natural products that provide the ultimate in Go stone aesthetics, and even the lowest grade are far more expensive than the common plastic, glass, and ceramic stones. The price for a set of shell and slate stones ranges from US$200 to over $5,000 according to grade, thicker stones by large costing progressively more within each grade, especially within the Yuki grade.\n\nYunzi is a style of stone first produced in the Tang Dynasty in China by sintering a trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds including agate (resulting in the slightly yellow-green hue of traditional yunzi stones). The term \"yunzi\" traditionally applies to stones made of this material, but can refer to any single-convex stone of average Chinese dimensions (slightly larger than a Japanese stone). The process of making Yunzi was lost in the 1920s when the Chinese Civil War spread to Yunnan province, but in the late 1960s it was rediscovered by the now state-managed Yunzi Company. The Yunzi company claims their stones have an advantage of a pleasant sound when placed on the board. Yunzi are delicately made with a jade-like luster yet are neither brittle nor slippery. The black and white pieces each have their special qualities. The white pieces are opaque with a tint of yellow or green. The black pieces are dark, and when held to the light a translucent green hue. With new technology, Yunzi stones can now be made pure white without any discolorations.\n\nWhen not making a move, one should leave one's stones in the bowl. During the opponent's turn, it is considered rude for players to rattle stones in the bowl. It is also considered improper to hold a handful of stones. The \"correct\" procedure is to decide upon one's move, then remove one stone from the bowl and place it on the board. This produces the minimal amount of distraction for one's opponent.\n\nWhen removing a stone from its bowl to make a move, place a flat hand on the edge of the bowl, with the fingers gently entering the bowl. Pick up a stone chopstick-style with the index and middle fingers, holding the stone between the index fingernail and the middle fingertip. The fingers extend almost straight, and the thumb is not tucked in.\n\nWhen placing the stone, take care that long sleeves are brushed up to avoid knocking stones already played. To place the stone on the board, as soon as the fingertip of index finger is about to reach the surface of the board, it slips to the side, allowing the middle finger to aim the stone down towards the surface and connect (the other fingers and thumb naturally spread outwards). With a little practice a stone can be placed gracefully and forcefully and with a big click. The keys to a loud click are the force of the middle finger and the late release of the stone. Once the stone has been placed, the middle finger and hand slowly lifts off the stone (trying to avoid wobbling the stone) and gently retreats back to the player.\n\nAlthough it is permissible to place one's stone at times with a loud, satisfying \"thwack\", one who does so with every move would be considered crude or vulgar. For instance, when submitting to an opponent's threat, a quiet placement is more in keeping with circumstances; probing moves or clever responses may be slid slyly into place. The ability to express oneself in the manner of making a move explains why one of the names for the game is \"hand talk\" (\"\"shudan\" in Japanese, \"shoutan\"\" in Chinese).\n\nNew stones (of any variety except slate and clamshell) should be washed in warm (soapy) water to remove any oils or chalk by-products of their manufacture or storage protection, then dried thoroughly. Do not use soap when cleaning clamshell stones; new clamshell stones should not need cleaning. New slate stones should be cleaned of excess mineral oil with a cotton cloth. When using stones, one should not slap the stones down too hard. When finished, they should be either kept in their bowls or original packaging and stored away from sunlight and heat. Placing a soft cloth in the bottom of the bowl can help to minimize chipping of stones.\n\nGo bowls, or \"go-ke\" are the containers for the stones. Although not strictly needed to play Go, bowls nevertheless play an important role in storing the stones, and captured stones can be placed on the lids. Bowls are identical, with one holding the white stones and one holding the black stones.\n\nA bowl's lid is usually rather loose and not tightly fit. A player traditionally places the lid upside down next to the open bowl and keeps stones there that they have captured from the opponent. The lid is placed so it's easily visible by the opponent, so each player knows how many prisoners the opponent has that are physically removed from the playing board.\n\nThe Go bowl can be made of several different materials.\n\nNot all bowls can fit a full set of stones. Most can only hold stones with a thickness of up to 10 mm. Larger and more expensive bowls hold stones of thickness of up to 12 mm since one would buy thicker and more expensive stones to match the quality of the bowl.\n\nThe bowls of highest quality and price are traditionally used only for the best shell and slate stones, of Yuki (snow-grade) quality. Lesser quality wood bowls likewise are used for Jitsuyo (standard-grade) and Tsuki (moon-grade) shell and slate stones, and glass stones are traditionally stored in the least expensive wood bowls or in plastic bowls. A list of woods used in Japanese Go bowls with photographs is available.\n\n\n"}

A point was scored when one player touched the ground with his back, hip or shoulder, or conceding defeat due to a submission-hold or was forced out of the wrestling-area. Three points had to be scored to win the match.\n\nOne particularly important position in this form of wrestling was one where one of the contestants was lying on his abdomen with the other on his back trying to strangle him. The athlete on the bottom would try to grasp an arm of the one on top and turn him over onto his back while the athlete on top would try to complete the choke without being rolled.\n\nWrestling was the first competition to be added to the Olympic Games that was not a footrace. It was added in 708 B.C. (Miller, 46). The competitions were held in elimination-tournament style until one wrestler was crowned the victor. The wrestling area was one square plethron or stremma. This event was also part of the pentathlon. Wrestling was regarded as the best expression of strength out of all of the competitions and was represented in Greek mythology by Heracles.\n\nMilo of Croton was one of the most famous wrestlers from this ancient time period. At one set of games, no one challenged him, but as he walked to the \"skamma\" he slipped and fell and was harassed by the crowd as they claimed he shouldn't be crowned because he fell. He contested that he should be crowned because he had only fallen once, two short of the required at least three times (Martin, 50). Leontiskos of Messene was also a noted champion. He was not known for his good wrestling skills, but for his superior finger bending skills. He was able to bend right up to the point of disqualification and won two championships with this technique (Martin, 50).\n\nThese are the rules of the ancient sport Palé:\n\n\n\n"}

Produced and distributed by V. Ravichandran under his production company, Aascar Films, the film features Vikram, Amy Jackson and Suresh Gopi in lead roles while Upen Patel, Santhanam and Ramkumar Ganesan portray pivotal roles. The film tells the story of a body builder turned supermodel, played by Vikram, who after being deformed, exacts revenge upon those who were responsible for his predicament. The soundtrack and film score were composed by A. R. Rahman.\n\nProduction design was handled by T. Muthuraj. P. C. Sreeram was the film's cinematographer and editing was done by Anthony. The visual effects were designed by V. Srinivas Mohan through Rising Sun Pictures. Weta Workshop had worked on the digital and prosthetic make-up and background arts for the film. Principal photography commenced on 15 July 2012. The filming lasted for two years and eight months, during which shooting was done extensively in China. Further schedules were filmed in locations in Chennai, Bangkok, Jodhpur, Kodaikanal, Pollachi, Bangalore and Mysore. The climax train fight scene was shot in the railway stations of Chengalpattu, Odisha and Vishakhapatnam. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu and Hindi along with the Tamil version.\n\n\"I\" was released on 14 January 2015; Critics praised Vikram's performance, the technical aspects of the film - especially the costume design and makeup, and A.R. Rahman's soundtrack and score but criticised the 'wafer-thin' writing and screenplay and the film's 188 minute running time. However, the film was a commercial success, grossing worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest grossing Tamil film and Vikram's highest-grossing film at the time. Vikram won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for the movie.\n\nLingesan (Vikram) is a bodybuilder from Chennai, whose main ambition is to become Mr. India. He wins the title of Mr. Tamil Nadu, which gives him direct entry to the Mr. India pageant. He is infatuated with Diya (Amy Jackson), a leading supermodel. Diya is soon blacklisted, with all her advertisement film contracts cancelled by John (Upen Patel), her co-star in all her advertisements, after she constantly rejected his sexual advances. To save her career, Diya decides to replace John with Lingesan, whom she had earlier met at one of her shoots, as her co-star for her next advertisement. The shooting is to take place in China at the same time when the Mr. India paegant is to take place, but Lingesan agrees, sacrificing his Mr. India ambitions in the process.\n\nLingesan is given a makeover by Diya's stylist, a transgender woman Osma Jasmine (Ojas Rajani). The shoot initially does not go well as Lingesan is shy and awkward around Diya. On her director's advice, Diya pretends to fall in love with Lingesan so that he would loosen up and perform better during the shoot. The plan proves successful but Diya soon tells Lingesan the truth. Hurt, he focouses on modelling instead of her. They both gradually excel in the modelling industry as the lead pair. As time passes, Diya reciprocates Lingesan's love for her and they soon get engaged.\n\nIn his journey from a bodybuilder to a top model, Lingesan makes many enemies, including John, whose modelling career was ruined due to Lingesan's rising popularity, forcing him to appear in local advertisements to stay afloat; Osma, who was infatuated with Lingesan and revealed her feelings to him, only to be rejected; industrialist Indrakumar (Ramkumar Ganesan), whose company suffered losses when Lingesan refused to endorse their soft drink as it was reported to contain pesticides; and another bodybuilder Ravi (M. Kamaraj), who also competed for the Mr. Tamil Nadu title but lost to Lingesan. These four people conspire to take revenge on Lingesan and destroy his fame and modelling career.\n\nTwo days before his wedding, Lingesan slowly starts to experience hair and teeth loss and a skin disorder. He consults his friend Vasudevan (Suresh Gopi), a doctor who is also the guardian of Diya's family. Vasudevan claims that he is suffering from a rare and incurable genetic disease which results in premature ageing. Lingesan's condition worsens, with his face and body deforming, and eventually he becomes a hunchback. In his current condition, Lingesan decides to disappear from public eye and also from Diya's life by faking his death in a car accident. Only his friend Babu (Santhanam) and Vasudevan know that he is alive. Lingesan asks Vasudevan to marry Diya as he is the only person who will be able to understand Diya's past and present situation. Vasudevan agrees and the wedding is fixed.\n\nOn the eve of Diya's wedding, another doctor named Thiruvengadam reveals to Lingesan that, contrary to Vasudevan's claims, he is actually suffering from H4N2 influenza, caused by the \"I\" virus, which can only be transmitted by injection. He discovers that John, Osma, Indrakumar, Ravi and, to his horror, even Vasudevan, are responsible for injecting the virus into his body. Vasudevan had an insatiable lust for Diya since she was ten years old and was enraged when she chose Lingesan over him. Therefore, he sided with Lingesan's enemies and planned the entire operation to have Lingesan injected with the virus. Enraged and betrayed, Lingesan abducts Diya on her wedding day and keeps her safely in an old house without revealing his identity to her.\n\nAided by Babu, Lingesan starts taking revenge on those who had deformed him. He first immolates Ravi, who suffers severe burns. He then prepares a paste which Osma unknowingly applies on her body, causing her body to sprout huge growths of hair. Next, he subjects Indrakumar to bee stings all over his body. He fights John over a moving train and gets him electrocuted. Finally, he gets Vasudevan to unwittingly inject a virus into himself, causing his whole body to swell up. After achieving his revenge, Lingesan reveals his condition to Diya, who, though initially taken aback, still loves him despite his deformity. They decide to live a secluded life together. Lingesan undergoes ayurvedic treatment, yoga and physiotherapy for his condition and soon returns to normal.\n\n\nIn an interview with the Tamil channel Sun TV, held shortly after the release of \"Enthiran\" in October 2010, the film's lead actor Rajinikanth revealed that Shankar, in 1996, following the release of his \"Indian\", had approached and pitched three storylines for him to consider for his next venture. Rajinikanth was impressed with two of the scripts and agreed to star in the films, which became \"Sivaji\" (2007) and \"Enthiran\" (2010). The third script narrated by Shankar was centered on an aspiring bodybuilder who would later turn into a deformed hunchback following a freak accident. Rajinikanth was sceptical of it and refused it. Following the release of \"Nanban\" (2012), Shankar revived the project with Vikram in the lead.\n\nShankar collaborated with writers Suresh and Balakrishnan, to work on the script of his next film. Music director A. R. Rahman was signed in to compose the soundtrack album and background score for the film, collaborating with Shankar for the tenth time. P. C. Sreeram was confirmed to do the film's cinematography, collaborating with Shankar for the first time. Action choreographer Peter Hein had to back out of the project due to commitments with S. S. Rajamouli's film \"\" (2015). As a result, Martial arts choereographer Yuen Woo-ping was selected for handling the stunt sequences. Additional stunt direction and supervision was done by Anl Arasu. VFX company Rising Sun Pictures under visual effects designer V. Srinivas Mohan was selected to provide the special effects in motion filming. Indian film production designer T. Muthuraj was confirmed as the film's art director. In May 2012, Shankar visited New Zealand and met filmmaker Peter Jackson and Richard Taylor's special effects and prop company Weta Workshop.\nSean Foot and Davina Lamont provided the prosthetic makeup for Vikram's beast get-up in the film and additional prosthetic makeup was done by Christien Tinsley and Dominie Till. The film was earlier reported to be titled as either \"Thendral\" or \"Therdal\", but it was later confirmed that the project would be titled \"I\". Gavin Miguel and Mary E. Vogt were in charge of the costume designing of the film's cast. According to Shankar, \"Azhagan\" and \"Aanazhagan\" were the alternate titles that were kept in mind, but since they were already used, he decided that a single alphabet would be the film's title. Since 'I' also meant beauty and explained the character of the protagonist, the alphabet was finalised to be the film's title.\n\nIn September 2014, producer and distributor Aascar V Ravichandran, stated the project would cost about , however by October 2014, he and director Shankar was widely quoted as stating the budget would be less than .\n\nAccording to \"The Times of India\", Shankar opted for the title \"I\" as he thought it \"explains all the characteristics of the protagonist\"; the word has a variety of meanings, which include \"king, beauty, astonishment, guru, vulnerability, owner and arrow\".\n\nIn April 2012, Vikram was selected to feature in the lead role. Priyanka Chopra was initially reported to be in talks for the female lead. Later, Asin's name was suggested along with Chopra. It was reported that Deepika Padukone was also approached. Padukone denied her involvement in the film. More than a week after the film's release, model-turned-actress Evelyn Sharma claimed that she auditioned for the role and eventually landed the role but opted out of it due to language barrier. Samantha Ruth Prabhu was then signed on, but was forced to opt out citing date issues and health problem as the reasons. The role finally went to Amy Jackson, who was paid for acting in the film. Santhanam, Upen Patel, Srinivasan and Suresh Gopi were selected to play the principal supporting characters in the film. Ramkumar Ganesan, a leading film producer and the elder son of the late Tamil thespian Sivaji Ganesan, was also added to the cast to play a pivotal role in the film. Jiiva was considered for portraying the antagonist, but was unable to accept the offer due to his prior commitments. Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger was reported to play an award presenter for a brief scene. Ravichandran, however, denied the news, but said that he would appear in the audio launch of the film. To prepare for his role in \"I\", Vikram took some weight loss and gain tips from Arnold as well. Make-up artiste Ojas M. Rajani was reported to play the role of a transgender make-up artiste in the film. Mr. Asia 2014 Syed Siddiq appeared in the action sequences featuring Vikram.\n\nIn the film, Vikram plays the character called 'Lingesan', who considers Arnold Schwarzenegger as a role model and aspires to win the Mr. Tamil Nadu title. Shankar had crafted the hair style of Vikram by taking the front curl look of the younger Arnold Schwarzenegger as a reference. As per director Shankar, among all get-ups in the film, the hunchbacked man character was the most difficult one to sketch. Vikram was confirmed to sport his hunchbacked get-up in most parts of the film. The bubbles observed on the character's face were reported to be designed by Weta. Amy Jackson plays a model in the film. On casting and re-defining her looks Shankar was quoted saying, \"I wanted someone who could authentically look like a model and then fixed Amy Jackson\". Vikram also went bald for the film to change his looks in the film easier. Santhanam was also asked to lose some weight for his character. Peter Ming used actual cyclists in China for a cycle fight scene that was shot there.\n\nPrincipal photography officially commenced on 15 July 2012 accompanying a poster photo shoot that featured Vikram and Jackson. The first schedule of filming was completed in Chennai by early September 2012. The main cast and crew were off to China for a 50-day schedule to shoot certain stunt scenes while some song sequences were also filmed at locales in the northern part of the Hunan province. The schedule in China was wrapped up by late November 2012. In an interview with \"The Times of India\", one of the film's line producer, Bill Chang was quoted saying, \"We worked closely with S. Shankar for nearly fifty days in 2012, during which his film was shot in nine different locations. The range of locations available in China is simply mind-boggling. No other country in the world has such variety of locales ranging from colored mountains to futuristic city landscapes.\" Scenes in the song \"Pookkalae Sattru Oyivedungal\" were shot in Red Seabeach in Panjin and on Li river in Guilin. In January 2013, a fight scene was filmed at an abandoned, 20-year-old factory in Chennai. Sixty percent of the shooting was completed by the end of the same month. By March 2013, four songs and three major action sequences were shot around China, Bangkok, Jodhpur, Kodaikanal, Pollachi and Chennai. In June 2013, a three-week filming schedule was completed in Bangalore, Mysore and Chennai, and 75% of the shooting was completed by July 2013. Filming was almost wrapped up by March 2014, with just one song sequence and patch-work for the film remaining. Shankar confirmed that the song would be shot after the film's audio launch. As per reports, a song of 5 minutes duration was shot for 40 days. For filming one of the songs, Vikram had gained a lot of weight of about 110 kg as he had to wear bulky costumes for the number. The remaining song sequence was filmed at Prasad labs in Vadapalani, Chennai where a set was erected by Muthuraj. On 24 September 2014, Jackson confirmed that the shooting of the film was completed.\n\nIn February 2014, Vikram started dubbing for the first half of the film. In March 2014, Vikram had completed his dubbing portions for the first half of the film. On 3 April 2014, film critic and journalist Sreedhar Pillai stated that the film's trailer was in stages of editing. Patchwork and dubbing for the film was completed on 11 September 2014.\n\nA. R. Rahman composed the soundtrack album and background score for the film. The music of the Tamil version was launched at the Nehru Indoor Stadium in Chennai on 15 September 2014. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the Chief Guest. The Hindi and Telugu versions of the soundtrack album were released on 29 and 30 December 2014, respectively.\n\nRavichandran earlier had stated that the film would be releasing on 23 October 2014 but the date was later pushed due to extensive post-production and dubbing works. The film is scheduled to release on 14 January 2015. It is stated that the film would be released in 3000 screens worldwide. The film was planned to be released in Hindi, Chinese and English along with the Tamil and the dubbed Telugu versions.

Stills featuring the lead pair were released in March 2014. The official motion poster teaser of the film was released on YouTube on 11 September 2014. The motion poster crossed 1 million views by the third day of its release. Two posters released on 12 September 2014, with J. Hurtado of \"Twitch Film\" labelling them as \"out of this world\".\n\nThe producer screened a sneak preview of the teaser and the song \"Ennodu Nee Irundhaal\" for the critics in late August 2014. The teaser carried a dummy music score that was not composed by A. R. Rahman.\n\nThe complete teaser trailer of the film was leaked on the internet on 2 September 2014. Although the leaked teaser lacked decipherability, the person who had leaked the teaser openly informed the team about it and challenged them to take action against him. After further inquiries, it was revealed that the culprit broke into producer Ravichandran's office during the night and had copied the teaser. However, Ravichandran refused to make changes to the leaked teaser, and planned to release it as per the original schedule.\n\nThe teaser was unveiled at the audio launch of the film. Hurtado in his teaser review wrote, \"We see Vikram taking on multiple characters including a Quasimodo-type, kicking monstrous amounts of ass in various action sequences, running across water, riding a cyborg motorcycle, and dancing up a storm in some absurdly colorful backgrounds.\" and concluded by saying \"Shankar is nothing if not a visual stylist, and it looks like he's pulling out all the stops for this one.\" Prajakta Hebbar of \"IBNLive\" wrote, \"When we heard that Tamil filmmaker Shankar was making a new film, we fully expected it to be larger-than-life, with a funky storyline and starring popular actors. But what we didn't expect was that feeling of thrill and intrigue.\", asserting that \"Vikram and Shankar have us hooked with the teaser.\". Nivedita Mishra of the \"Hindustan Times\" elaborated in her teaser review, \"Without doubt, the film's special effects are great by any standards. Now, whether or not, they have been indigenously put together or have been outsourced from the West, the producers alone will know, but just the desire to make a film that gets its production value right yet doesn't overdo it, is good enough. Here's hoping it will ignite a desire among Indians to go for the skies.\" and praised the spectacular landscapes, edgy camera angles, action sequences before concluding that \"Shankar has put in a lot of effort to make this magnum opus worth a watch if teasers are to go by.\" \"Behindwoods\" wrote, \"Anyone who sees this remarkably impactful teaser would keep rewinding what he / she saw, to relive the experience over and over again.\" The teaser crossed 1 million views in just 12 hours of its release, making it the first Indian film to do so, beating the record set by the teaser of the Bollywood film, \"Bang Bang!\" (2014), which crossed 1 million views in 13 hours. It reached 7 million views in 2 weeks after its release, becoming the only Tamil film to cross the mark till date.\n\nThe film was promoted by Vikram on Bigg Boss 8.\n\nThe media rights of the film were purchased by Jaya TV for . The media rights included satellite rights and ringtones.\n\n\"I\" received positive reviews from film critics who praised Vikram's and Amy Jackson's performances and technical aspects but criticised the script. Subhash K. Jha gave 4 stars out of 5 describing \"I\" as the \"most exceptional\" film from Shankar and wrote that it \"takes us beyond the imaginable and the conceivable, fusing with fabulous flamboyance the fantasy element with a level of heightened reality that's commercial cinema's forte\". Filmfare also gave it 4 stars out of 5, stating that \"Shankar balances a social critique along with technical gimmickry and here the message centres about our obsession with physical perfection and beauty.\" Komal Nahta felt that Shankar's direction was \"first rate\" and wrote \"His vision is unique and the translation of his vision on to the celluloid is brilliant. He has kept the narration so interesting that the viewer's eyes remain glued to the screen. He has given the film a huge canvas and has made it an audio-visual treat. Rajeev Masand from \"IBN Live\" gave 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"\"I\" from visionary Tamil director Shankar is a work of staggering ambition, somewhat weighed down by the filmmaker's own indulgence...(it) may be far from perfect, but for the most part it's pretty entertaining stuff\". \"The Times of India\" gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Shot mesmerisingly by PC Sreeram on virgin locales in China and India, with world class CG work, this spectacle works because at the core, it's a romantic-thriller told simplistically...This is pure escapist fare but will resonate with those who read fairy tales at bedtime\". \"Rediff\" gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"The narrative lacks the pace; we usually associate with a Shankar's film. But he does tell a beautiful tale of love sullied by jealousies, greed and anger. The intriguing screenplay as the director alternates between the light-hearted past and the thrilling present keeps you engrossed\". \"Behindwoods.com\" rated the film 3 out of 5 and stated, \"though the story is predictable beyond a point, it's an amalgamation of 'Masters' at play which works to a larger extent because of their huge efforts\". \"India Today\" rated the film 3 out of and wrote \"It's not everyday you will get to watch a visually rich movie like this\".\n\n\"The Hindu\" stated, \"Vikram's terrific performance is let down by an uninspired, exhausting movie\". \"Daily News & Analysis\" gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, too, calling it a \"great looking film but with shoddy writing and poorly sketched characters\". Haricharan Pudipeddi, writing for \"IANS\", rated the film 2 out of 5 and said, \"All that's big may not necessarily be great. Hope Shankar realises that much better films can be made on a smaller canvas and much lower budget.\" \"Sify\" wrote, \"\"I\" is definitely not the best of Shankar and he has to take the blame for poor writing. His story is predictable and there are no twists or scenes which keeps you engaged. Barring few eye-popping stunt scenes, a slew of beautiful unseen locations, breathtaking camera by PC Sreeram and few hummable songs by AR Rahman, \"I\" is very ordinary\". \"Deccan Chronicle\" gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and said, \"While the movie and the effort is good technically, its content is just average\". \"Oneindia\" also rated the film 2.5 out of 5 saying, \"For a movie which had so much of anticipation, \"I\" doesn't feed its audience enough to fulfill their expectations. The story is plain and doesn't look like a normal Shankar movie which would otherwise have interesting twists and turns.\" Gautaman Bhaskaran, writing for \"The Hindustan Times\", rated the film two and a half stars, stating that Vikram's performance was the film's \"only high point\"; he noted that the film had similarities to the novel \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" (1831) and the fairy tale \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1756), \"without infusing any novelty into these age-old yarns.\" Deepanjana Pal from \"Firstpost\" wrote, \"\"I\" is too long, too stupid and too regressive to be entertaining\" and also called it \"superficial and the least fun Shankar film ever\".\n\n\"Variety\" magazine's Ronnie Scheib wrote, \"Shankar's visual ingenuity keeps things zippy for much of the hefty 188-minute running time, and star Chiyaan Vikram delivers a knockout three-pronged performance, but this cinematic bravura is offset by underdeveloped scripting, flatly one-dimensional villains and overdone lone-hero-vs.-swarms-of-murderous-attackers setpieces\". Rachel Saltz from \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"\"I\" is exuberant and unselfconscious but too cartoonish to engage your emotions. The onslaught of images and music will engage your senses, though, even as you're left giggling at the too-muchness of it all\". J Hurtado from \"Twitch Film\" wrote, \"\"I\" strains the boundaries of self-indulgence and modern tolerance in a way that has become something of a plague among Indian blockbusters. The film is amazing to look at, features a number of amazing set pieces, and some appropriately over the top action sequences, but even with everything including a few kitchen sinks thrown in, it may go on a bit too long for its own good\".\n\nAccording to Box Office India, \"I\" earned around nett in South India on its first day, setting records in Kerala and Telangana/AP. The film grossed over worldwide on its opening day. The film went on to collect nett in India in three days from all its versions.\n\nIn its extended five-day weekend, the film earned nett in India from all three versions, with the Hindi version netting .\n\nThe film grossed around worldwide from all versions twelve days after its release.\n\nAccording to Andhra Box Office, the film had collected worldwide and eventually became a commercial success. The final domestic net(India net) collections were 1.36 billion. In crores final domestic net collections were 136, domestic gross 150 and worldwide 240 crores.\n\n\"I\" grossed US$697,346 in Tamil version and US$10,373 in dubbed Hindi version in USA in its first weekend. \"I\"(Tamil) grossed US$201,207 and \"I\"(Hindi) grossed US$4,009 in Canada in its first weekend. \"I\"(Tamil) grossed US$258,764 in UK-Ireland in first weekend. \"I\"(Tamil) grossed MYR 2,162,742 in Malaysia in first weekend.

After Roger Waters departed Pink Floyd in 1985, he continued to use the pig as a show element during his solo live performances.\n\nRoger Waters used inflatable pigs at many shows on his 2006–2007 tour \"The Dark Side of the Moon Live\", specifically, when he performed the song \"Sheep\", concluding the first part of the show. The pigs used on tour were decorated with slogans and pieces of song lyrics, and with various drawings. During select performances at open-air venues the pig was released to \"fly\" away, a reference to the idiom \"Pigs might fly\".\n\nThe pig was released again at the Shoreline Amphitheatre show in Mountain View the following week, on 10 October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 July 2007: Roger Waters played in the New York leg of Live Earth. When he began singing \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\" / \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\" the pig came out again. It had a more cartoonish look, and part of its body appeared as that of the wall. It had the words \"Together we stand, divided we fall\" (the last lines of \"Hey You\") on one side and \"SOS\" on the other. Unlike the SOS logo for Live Earth (which stood for \"Save Our Selves\"), the one on the pig said \"Save Our Sausages\" instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInflatable pigs were special decorations which have been used by Roger Waters in his concert when the singer took part in Desert Trip show on Sunday, October, 9 2016. They were decorated by images and phrases. \nSpectators of the concert could see pigs floating above Empire Polo Field where the event took place. Totally the singer used 3 different pigs in his performance which was watched live by over 75 thousand viewers. In order to control oversized animals the remote control was used. \n\nInflatable pigs appeared when Roger Waters performed his song “Pigs (Three Different Ones)”. At this time there was a message for spectators on the huge screen behind the artist. It displayed a number of anti-Trump pictures. And the pig became floating up in the air. It was possible to see a phrase “F…k Trump and his wall”. Roger Waters condemned a candidate from Republican party for presidential elections in the USA Donald Trump for his statements about other nations, his racist and sexist comments. On the other side of inflatable pig it could see the phrase “Arrogant, lying, racist, sexist”. On other pig it was written “Together We Stand / Divided We Fall”. Viewers saw on a screen Trump wore Ku Klux Klan hood and there could be possible to read word Charade. If someone didn’t understand meaning for the first time, it was enough to watch at the screen once again and to see the phrase “Trump is a pig”.\n\n"}

{"id": "1168455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1168455", "title": "Jayan", "text": "Jayan\n\nKrishnan Nair (25 July 1939 – 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name Jayan, was an Indian film actor, naval officer, stunt performer and cultural icon of the 1970s. He starred in over 120 Malayalam films. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his macho image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing stunts of a dangerous nature on his own. By the late 1970s, he became the most popular lead actor and bankable star of Malayalam cinema and has been acclaimed as the first action hero of Malayalam cinema.\n\nJayan was a Master Chief Petty Officer in the Indian Navy, before he came to films and rose to fame as an actor in a very short time, appearing as an action hero in numerous films during the 1970s. He died at the age of 41, at the peak of his popularity, as a result of an accident while filming a dangerous stunt involving a flying helicopter that crashed while he was hanging on to it. He has since then become a legendary symbol of daredevilry and masculinity with numerous inspirations, imitations, his unfading popularity being widely used to promote new-age movies, actors and brands and an ever-growing fan-base spanning generations.\n\nHis superhuman image has also transformed him into an iconic figure of popular culture among Malayalis around the world, with widespread impersonations on stage and television programs based on his screen persona. It was accompanied by a cartoon, email and SMS phenomenon in the early 2000s, portraying him as a comic superhero with unique quotes of superhuman strength attributed to the action star becoming widespread. These movements were fuelled by a renewed fascination with his style of dialogue delivery and his machismo image. These were claimed to honour his memories, but were also criticised for parodying the legendary actor years after his death.\n\nJayan was born in Quilon, Travancore as the first child of his father Thevalli, Kottaram Veetil Madhavan Pillai and mother Bharathiyamma. His birth name was Krishnan Nair. He had a younger brother named Soman Nair. Malayalam actress Jayabharathi, who was his first cousin introduced him to the film industry. Jayan's formal education ended at the 10th grade at Kollam Govt. Boys High School when he joined the Indian Navy. The first accolades for his acting skills reached him when he was a naval sailor. He used to act in plays at various functions such as anniversaries. The encouragement from his friends and colleagues in the Navy gave him the desire to act in films. Jayan served in the Indian Navy for 16 years, culminating in the rank of Master CPO. By the end of his navy days, he had begun efforts to start small businesses at Ernakulam and became a regular inhabitant of the Cochin Tourist Home. During his life at Ernakulam, he would meet some of his lifelong friends. It was such a chance meeting while on leave, with Rajan Prakash who is the veteran Malayalam actor Jose Prakash's son, who owned a dry cleaning shop in Cochin, that eventually landed him a role in the movie \"Shapa Moksham\". A year later, he left the Indian Navy and started trying his hand at various civilian jobs, working for companies in Cochin for a few years till his acting career began to succeed. an.\n\nJayan did make a few random uncredited appearances in some movies of the early 1970s, the first of which was in \"Postmane Kanmanilla\". These minor appearances were before he attained the screen name Jayan. According to his nephew, he had the role of a vampire-like character in an unnamed project costarred by Vidhubala, which was never released. His first appearance with the name \"Jayan\" was in the movie \"Shapa Moksham\", which is usually credited as his first film.\n\nThe name \"Jayan\" (English: \"The Victor\") was given to him by veteran Malayalam actor Jose Prakash on the sets of Shapa Moksham. Jayan started his career by acting in minor roles starting with \"Shapa Moksham\" (1974). Jayan got his first major break appearing as a villain in \"Panchami\" (1976), playing the role of a forest ranger. Jayan's performance in this film was appreciated in the industry and his physical appearance was also noticed for the first time. His next notable role was in \"Thacholi Ambu\" (1978), in which he appeared in a supporting role. In the same year, he acted as a sage in the Sreekumaran Thampi film \"Etho Oru Swapnam\", which was well received by critics. But what made Jayan a superstar was his antihero role in \"Sharapancharam\" (1979, \"Bed of Arrows\"). He catapulted to fame riding on machismo roles that endeared him to the masses, and he established himself as one of the most popular Malayalam film actors of his time. He is generally regarded as the first action hero in Malayalam cinema.\n\n\"Sharapancharam\" broke all box-office records set in the Malayalam movie industry till it's time and became the highest grossing movie of 1979.\nIt's box-office records were broken by another Jayan film, \"Angadi\" (Market) in the following year, which cemented his popularity among the masses. In films such as \"Manushya Mrugam\", \"Aavesham\" etc. he played double roles. During his career, he received only a few critically appreciated roles perhaps partly due to his commercial hero image and partly due to the lack of films that garnered critical appreciation at the time. The focus was always on his unmatched drawing power as an action star and by 1980, at the peak of his career, he had attained a genuine superhero image. Movies exploited Jayan's masculine physique and he appeared bare-chested in numerous scenes. His on-screen attire (most famously his Elvis bellbottoms), his masculine image and later the nature of his death transformed him into a legend in Kerala. Jayan was also known for his unique method of dialogue delivery and he has contributed many memorable lines to the Malayalam film history.\n\nJayan acted in several multistar movies, mostly with Prem Nazir. The duo acted in films such as \"Nayattu, Love in Singapore, Chandrahasam, Thacholi Ambu, Kannappanunni, Palattu Kunjikkannan, Mamangam, Prabhu\" etc. all of which were top grossing movies at the box office. He also acted with other popular actors of the time, such as Soman, Sukumaran and Madhu in many films. In early films before 1979 (e.g. \"Thacholi Ambu\" and \"Panchami\"), he had negative or supporting roles. But later films in the beginning of 1980 relied heavily on Jayan's drawing power as an action hero and placed him as the central character. In 1980, the duo Jayan and Prem Nazir were cast in \"Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam\" by P. Venu, that showcased the famous fight scene in Malayalam cinema. Prem Nazir agreed to play a supporting role in \"Nayattu\", which was very unlikely for a superstar of those times. He had agreed to do this as a token of friendship with Jayan and the director Sreekumaran Thamby. The duo had many actions films together such as \"Irumbazhikal\", \"Love in Singapore\" etc. where the box office draw was huge.\n\nOn 16 November 1980, Jayan was killed in an accident on the set of the movie \"Kolilakkam\" (English: \"Shockwave\"). The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in Sholavaram, near Madras, Tamil Nadu. Jayan always performed his own stunts, and for this movie he was performing a particularly dangerous stunt that involved him boarding an airborne helicopter from a moving motorbike. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; altogether three shots were filmed.\n\nAccording to the film's production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries.\nAfter his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie \"Deepam\", which was running in packed houses, informing his death to the viewers who witnessed it with absolute shock and disbelief. A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran out of the buildings, while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for an ingenious promotion for some upcoming project.\n\nJayan's body was taken to Trivandrum via aeroplane and later it was taken to his home in Quilon, where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the late actor, and the police had to take huge measures to deal with the crowds. His mother Bharathiyamma became bedridden after this incident, and she too died two years later.\n\nSome conspiracy theories emerged regarding the circumstances of his death, primarily because the pilot and his co-star Balan K. Nair, who was in the helicopter, survived with minor or no injuries. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed as a genuine accident.\n\nAfter Jayan's death, several films were released claiming to be his last film, including the genuine one, \"Kolilakkam\". In all these films, Jayan's voice was dubbed by Aleppey Ashraf, a popular mimicry artist of the time. Many projects meant for him were recast, such as \"Thusharam\" by I.V. Sasi, P.G. Vishwambaran's \"Sphodanam,\" and Sasi Kumar's \"Dhruva Sangamam\". Numerous other projects were cancelled entirely. One stunt scene and two songs were already shot with Jayan for C.V. Hariharans \"Garjanam\", but after his death, it was recast with Rajinikanth, becoming his second film in Malayalam released in 1981.\n\nDue to his unrivalled popularity that continued many years after his death, random bit scenes were added to numerous films that showed random gestures or shots of him walking by the side during fight scenes. Attempts were made to bring in impostors who tried to imitate his style and mannerisms, enabling several artists from the field of mimicry to show up on the big screen. But these experiments failed miserably, and proved especially ineffective in fight and stunt scenes. Then, directors and producers started a search for new actors to replace him. This movement led to debuts of actors who resembled Jayan in physical appearance (e.g. Ratheesh), those with stage names sounding similar to his (for example, his own brother who appeared as Ajayan), and those with similar mannerisms and style (e.g. Bheeman Raghu). One of them, Mammootty, who started with the stage name Sajin, would later go on to become one of the popular future stars in the industry.\n\nHowever, all these attempts to replace Jayan with a new star with a similar image yielded disappointing results. It is now one of the most popular quotes in Malayalam cinema \"Jayan's throne remains vacant and will forever be so\".\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan's screen persona in Kerala and his old movie scenes came to prominence again. It was owed mostly to programs by popular mimicry stage artists in the State, whose imitations of the star's mannerisms caught on and soon became commonplace in college stage events, television programs and mimicry stage shows along with quotes of superhuman strength known as Jayan quotes. However, it has been pointed out that many grotesquely imitated screen dialogues of Jayan are not actually his, but that of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for many of his characters after his death.\n\nThe \"comeback\" of Jayan and his renewed popularity lately may be taken as an affirmation that Jayan has not been replaced even nearly three decades after his death. Today, Jayan is best remembered as the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, so far, besides his trademark colourful attire, risky stunts, machismo mannerisms and unique speaking style. He has rightly won immortality in the hearts of the Malayalam film fans as a martyr in his yearning to thrill and entertain them even by putting his life at stake. Madhu, a famous actor prominent in the 1960s, once stated in an interview: \"Jayan will forever be young and alive. No one can ever visualise him as an old man.\"\n\nA film titled \"Avatharam\" presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies. A documentary on Jayan's life and death \"Jayan – The Man behind the Legend\" is nearing completion for release in the near future.\n\nJayan is perhaps the only actor thus far in the history of Malayalam film industry who remains a marketable superstar decades after his demise, to this day. In the state of Kerala, he is a true icon of popular culture, whose life and image has made him a legend over time.\n\nMurali Jayan has claimed to be actor Jayan's son and has been legally asking for a DNA test.\nThrough his machismo roles and staggering stunt feats, Jayan had attained a real life Superhero image amongst the fans, masses and colleagues alike. His colourful attire and unique bass voice also helped him capture the imagination of the average viewer as the manly action hero. Along with these, his trademark styles and mannerisms made him a campus hero and youth idol of his time. Summing up, Jayan's image among the masses was that of a daring superhuman who would perform seemingly impossible deeds and accomplish extraordinary feats.\n\nJayan is the most commercially successful superstar till date in the Malayalam industry with a near 90% success rate. The years 1979, 1980 and 1981 became known as \"Jayan years\" in the industry due to the widespread release and success of his movies. His films \"Sharapancharam\" and \"Angadi\", released in 1979 and 1980 respectively, were record breakers and became the highest grossers of their respective years. His final film, \"Kolilakkam\" was the highest grosser in 1981. The noteworthy point is that a large percentage of films released during his peak years lacked a strong plot and were mostly cheap low budget remakes of successful movies from other language sectors of Indian cinema. Many of these films came out astoundingly successful due to his sheer presence and some avoided failures due to his small cameo appearances. Thousands of fans used to visit theatres repeatedly just to see his fascinating stunts and fight scenes.\n\nJayan was a high risk taker and throughout his career, he was popular for stellar performances in fight and stunt sequences. Dangerous and thrilling stunts were often featured in action films with Jayan in the lead. These were usually highlighted during fight scenes as added promotions to his machismo image and daredevilry. Numerous movies in which he has acted have one or more notable stunt performances.\n\nA few prominent examples may be \"Puthiya Velicham\" (\"New Light\", 1979) in which he performs train stunts jumping onto and from a fast running goods train, \"Aavesham\" (\"Inspiration\", 1979) which shows the actor swimming through the dangerous waters of Hogenakkal Falls, through a major part of the climax sequence without using any kind of safety measures. Movies like \"Thadavara\" (\"Prison\", 1981) and \"Sharapancharam\" (1979) demonstrate his brilliant horse riding skills performing almost effortlessly on horseback, while films like \"Mamangam\" involved dangerous fights with wild animals. In a film called \"Moorkhan\" (\"Cobra\", 1981) he broke through a brick wall riding on a motor bike (a Royal Enfield Bullet) and it also featured sequences that had the actor sliding along ropes tied at high elevations. Perhaps the most famous movie stunt featuring Jayan came in \"Chandrahasam\" (\"Moonsword\", 1980) in which he held on to the UV clamp of a massive ship crane and was elevated to a height of around 200 feet before jumping off to the top of the vessel. In one of his final stunt scenes, in \"Ariyappedatha Rahasyam\" (\"Secret never known\", 1981) he was involved in a fight scene with an elephant.\n\nThe meteoric rise of Jayan had literally a texture changing impact on the Malayalam film industry. It changed forever the hero concept that existed previously for many years and gave rise to a new genre of film characters with more manly characteristics.\n\nMost critics often consider Jayan's main hero role in \"Sharapancharam\", \"Angadi\", \"Venalil Oru Mazha\" and \"Puthiya Velicham\" to be his best. His most popular character may be the educated labourer in \"Angadi\". The sage's role played by him in \"Etho Oru Swapnam\" was well appreciated by critics and would easily feature among his most memorable roles. The supporting role in \"Kannappanunni\", Thacholi Ambu, the villainous ranger in \"Panchami\" and the rapist in \"Kanthavalayam\" are also critically acclaimed characters. Some other popular roles were in films like \"Ithikkara Pakki\", \"Mamangam\", \"Puthiya Velicham\", \"Karimpana\", \"Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam\", \"Chaakara\" and \"Kazhukan\". While acknowledging his undisputed popularity as a commercial superstar that has never faded over time, general critical opinion on his skills as an actor is divided. While there are criticisms from some corners that he depended more on his features such as his catching physique, bass voice, personal charisma, unique style and mannerisms to garner attention, many others rate him as a great actor who developed his own unique style to leave a lasting impression on every single role he took up. The fact that his peak time as an actor lasted only a few years is often pointed out in reply to criticisms, and considering the short period of his active film career, he may have delivered more critically appreciated performances than most of his contemporaries. But these were always under the shadow of a large majority of films that were able to achieve commercial success capitalising on his drawing power, but had weak plots and less critical acclaim. Some believe that if he'd had a longer career, he would have eventually transformed into a great character actor over time who could excel in commercial and parallel streams alike, after a period of decline in Malayalam films that followed Sathyan's demise. His most popular films like \"Sharapancharam\" and \"Angadi\" were both critical and commercial successes. Though he is remembered as an icon of commercial cinema, due to the short span of his career and the generic nature of commercial hero roles of the time, his actual acting talents may have been largely underutilised.\n\nFilm songs are an integral part of Indian cinema and the same is true for Malayalam films. Jayan has acted in several memorable song sequences which bring about nostalgic memories about the actor. Song sequences in Jayan films also helped shape the future film song sector in commercial cinema. The song \"Kannum Kannum\" in the film \"Angadi\" presents one of the most popular song sequences in Malayalam cinema involving Jayan and Seema. Its success led to the teaming together of this pair in numerous movies. Another popular song involving the Jayan-Seema pair is \"Kasthuri Manmizhi\" from the movie \"Manushya Mrugam\". A song that hit tremendous popularity was \"Cham Chacha Chum Chacha\" in \"Love in Singapore\" and Kombil Kilukkam ketti in \"Karimpana\". The mass popularity of this song sequence later inspired a whole new category of film songs with lyrics that lack any particular meaning, but with a fast beat and dance appeal that came to be known as \"Adipoli\" songs. There is a song in the film \"Etho Oru Swapnam\" called \"Oru Mugham Mathram Kannil\", which became popular due to its melodious and nostalgic nature.\n\"Ezham Malika Mele\" from Sarppam, directed by Baby was a superhit song paired by Jayan and Seema. Another hit from this team was \"Pournami Penne: in Arifa hassan's \"Benz Vasu\" and it was hummed by the youth of that time.\n\nThere is a Jayan memorial Arts & Sports club functioning at Thevally near the actor's hometown. The residential area at his birthplace has been renamed \"Olayil Jayan Nagar\" in his honour.\n\n\"Jayan Samskarika Vethi\" or Jayan Cultural Forum has been established recently, which consists of his fans and well wishers. It is headed by the actor's nephew Kannan Nair, and aims at uniting his diverse fan base consisting of young and old people from several generations under a single platform. Activities include organising anniversary functions and memorial programs, facilitating his coworkers, maintaining the actor's website and official profiles and charity work.\n\nIn 2009, an 8 ft high statue of the actor was erected in front of his house at Olayil, Kollam which is now a nursing home. Efforts are being made to construct a permanent memorial at Mulankadakam where he was cremated, and also to open a library and museum near his home.\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2010, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his death, it was announced that a new movie with Jayan in the lead is in the works, using advanced animation and graphics technologies. The movie, titled \"Avatharam\" (Incarnation), will be directed by Vijeesh Mani and scripted by T. A. Shahid. The project is inspired by the star's posthumous popularity as an action legend. It was announced that the actor would be brought back to the big screen by twelve top technicians from Hollywood.\n\nRecently a man appeared in front of media claiming Jayan's son. His name is Murali Jayan. He says Jayan married his mother Thankamma and his relatives threw Thankamma out of family when Jayan became popular. After Jayan's death Murali filed a case for proving his paternity. The case is rejected since Jayan was no longer alive.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16267", "title": "Joke", "text": "Joke\n\nA joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is not meant to be taken seriously. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense, or other means. Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition:\n\nIt is generally held that jokes benefit from brevity, containing no more detail than is needed to set the scene for the punchline at the end. In the case of riddle jokes or one-liners the setting is implicitly understood, leaving only the dialogue and punchline to be verbalised. However, subverting these and other common guidelines can also be a source of humor—the shaggy dog story is in a class of its own as an anti-joke; although presenting as a joke, it contains a long drawn-out narrative of time, place and character, rambles through many pointless inclusions and finally fails to deliver a punchline. Jokes are a form of humour, but not all humour is a joke. Some humorous forms which are \"not\" verbal jokes are: involuntary humour, situational humour, practical jokes, slapstick and anecdotes.\n\nIdentified as one of the simple forms of oral literature by the Dutch linguist , jokes are passed along anonymously. They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of jokes is told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. Jokes are also passed along in written form or, more recently, through the internet.\n\nStand-up comics, comedians and slapstick work with comic timing, precision and rhythm in their performance, relying as much on actions as on the verbal punchline to evoke laughter. This distinction has been formulated in the popular saying \"A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny\".\n\nAny joke documented from the past has been saved through happenstance rather than design. Jokes do not belong to refined culture, but rather to the entertainment and leisure of all classes. As such, any printed versions were considered ephemera, i.e., temporary documents created for a specific purpose and intended to be thrown away. Many of these early jokes deal with scatological and sexual topics, entertaining to all social classes but not to be valued and saved.\n\nVarious kinds of jokes have been identified in ancient pre-classical texts. The oldest identified joke is an ancient Sumerian proverb from 1900 BC containing toilet humour: \"Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband’s lap.\" Its records were dated to the Old Babylonian period and the joke may go as far back as 2300 BC. The second oldest joke found, discovered on the Westcar Papyrus and believed to be about Sneferu, was from Ancient Egypt circa 1600 BC: \"How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish.\" The tale of the three ox drivers from Adab completes the three known oldest jokes in the world. This is a comic triple dating back to 1200 BC Adab.\n\nThe earliest extant joke book is the \"Philogelos\" (Greek for \"The Laughter-Lover\"), a collection of 265 jokes written in crude ancient Greek dating to the fourth or fifth century AD. The author of the collection is obscure and a number of different authors are attributed to it, including \"Hierokles and Philagros the \"grammatikos\"\", just \"Hierokles\", or, in the \"Suda\", \"Philistion\". British classicist Mary Beard states that the \"Philogelos\" may have been intended as a jokester's handbook of quips to say on the fly, rather than a book meant to be read straight through. Many of the jokes in this collection are surprisingly familiar, even though the typical protagonists are less recognisable to contemporary readers: the absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad breath. The \"Philogelos\" even contains a joke similar to Monty Python's \"Dead Parrot Sketch\".\n\nDuring the 15th century, the printing revolution spread across Europe following the development of the movable type printing press. This was coupled with the growth of literacy in all social classes. Printers turned out Jestbooks along with Bibles to meet both lowbrow and highbrow interests of the populace. One early anthology of jokes was the Facetiae by the Italian Poggio Bracciolini, first published in 1470. The popularity of this jest book can be measured on the twenty editions of the book documented alone for the 15th century. Another popular form was a collection of jests, jokes and funny situations attributed to a single character in a more connected, narrative form of the picaresque novel. Examples of this are the characters of Rabelais in France, Till Eulenspiegel in Germany, Lazarillo de Tormes in Spain and Master Skelton in England. There is also a jest book ascribed to William Shakespeare, the contents of which appear to both inform and borrow from his plays. All of these early jestbooks corroborate both the rise in the literacy of the European populations and the general quest for leisure activities during the Renaissance in Europe.\n\nThe practice of printers to use jokes and cartoons as page fillers was also widely used in the broadsides and chapbooks of the 19th century and earlier. With the increase in literacy in the general population and the growth of the printing industry, these publications were the most common forms of printed material between the 16th and 19th centuries throughout Europe and North America. Along with reports of events, executions, ballads and verse, they also contained jokes. Only one of many broadsides archived in the Harvard library is described as \"1706. Grinning made easy; or, Funny Dick's unrivalled collection of curious, comical, odd, droll, humorous, witty, whimsical, laughable, and eccentric jests, jokes, bulls, epigrams, &c. With many other descriptions of wit and humour.\" These cheap publications, ephemera intended for mass distribution, were read alone, read aloud, posted and discarded.\n\nThere are many types of joke books in print today; a search on the internet provides a plethora of titles available for purchase. They can be read alone for solitary entertainment, or used to stock up on new jokes to entertain friends. Some people try to find a deeper meaning in jokes, as in \"Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar... Understanding Philosophy Through Jokes\". However a deeper meaning is not necessary to appreciate their inherent entertainment value. Magazines frequently use jokes and cartoons as filler for the printed page. \"Reader's Digest\" closes out many articles with an (unrelated) joke at the bottom of the article. \"The New Yorker\" was first published in 1925 with the stated goal of being a \"sophisticated humour magazine\" and is still known for its cartoons.\n\nTelling a joke is a cooperative effort; it requires that the teller and the audience mutually agree in one form or another to understand the narrative which follows as a joke. In a study of conversation analysis, the sociologist Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling a single joke. \"This telling is composed, as for stories, of three serially ordered and adjacently placed types of sequences … the preface [framing], the telling, and the response sequences.\" Folklorists expand this to include the context of the joking. Who is telling what jokes to whom? And why is he telling them when? The context of the joke telling in turn leads into a study of joking relationships, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who engage in institutionalised banter and joking.\n\nFraming is done with a (frequently formulaic) expression which keys the audience in to expect a joke. \"Have you heard the one…\", \"Reminds me of a joke I heard…\", \"So, a lawyer and a doctor…\"; these conversational markers are just a few examples of linguistic frames used to start a joke. Regardless of the frame used, it creates a social space and clear boundaries around the narrative which follows. Audience response to this initial frame can be acknowledgement and anticipation of the joke to follow. It can also be a dismissal, as in \"this is no joking matter\" or \"this is no time for jokes\".\n\nWithin its performance frame, joke-telling is labelled as a culturally marked form of communication. Both the performer and audience understand it to be set apart from the \"real\" world. \"An elephant walks into a bar…\"; a native English speaker automatically understands that this is the start of a joke, and the story that follows is not meant to be taken at face value (i.e. it is non-bona-fide communication). The framing itself invokes a play mode; if the audience is unable or unwilling to move into play, then nothing will seem funny.\n\nFollowing its linguistic framing the joke, in the form of a story, can be told. It is not required to be verbatim text like other forms of oral literature such as riddles and proverbs. The teller can and does modify the text of the joke, depending both on memory and the present audience. The important characteristic is that the narrative is succinct, containing only those details which lead directly to an understanding and decoding of the punchline. This requires that it support the same (or similar) divergent scripts which are to be embodied in the punchline.\n\nThe narrative always contains a protagonist who becomes the \"butt\" or target of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes within the culture. It also enables researchers to group and analyse the creation, persistence and interpretation of joke cycles around a certain character. Some people are naturally better performers than others, however anyone can tell a joke because the comic trigger is contained in the narrative text and punchline. A joke poorly told is still funny unless the punchline gets mangled.\n\nThe punchline is intended to make the audience laugh. A linguistic interpretation of this punchline / response is elucidated by Victor Raskin in his Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour. Humour is evoked when a trigger contained in the punchline causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. \"The punchline is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text.\" To produce the humour in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text AND opposite or incompatible with each other. Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin's linguistic theory to include \"two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution.\" He explains that \"… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity.\" Resolution generates laughter.\n\nThis is the point at which the field of neurolinguistics offers some insight into the cognitive processing involved in this abrupt laughter at the punchline. Studies by the cognitive science researchers Coulson and Kutas directly address the theory of script switching articulated by Raskin in their work. The article \"Getting it: Human event-related brain response to jokes in good and poor comprehenders\" measures brain activity in response to reading jokes. Additional studies by others in the field support more generally the theory of two-stage processing of humour, as evidenced in the longer processing time they require. In the related field of neuroscience, it has been shown that the expression of laughter is caused by two partially independent neuronal pathways: an \"involuntary\" or \"emotionally driven\" system and a \"voluntary\" system. This study adds credence to the common experience when exposed to an off-colour joke; a laugh is followed in the next breath by a disclaimer: \"Oh, that's bad…\" Here the multiple steps in cognition are clearly evident in the stepped response, the perception being processed just a breath faster than the resolution of the moral / ethical content in the joke.\n\nExpected response to a joke is laughter. The joke teller hopes the audience \"gets it\" and is entertained. This leads to the premise that a joke is actually an \"understanding test\" between individuals and groups. If the listeners do not get the joke, they are not understanding the two scripts which are contained in the narrative as they were intended. Or they do \"get it\" and don't laugh; it might be too obscene, too gross or too dumb for the current audience. A woman might respond differently to a joke told by a male colleague around the water cooler than she would to the same joke overheard in a women's lavatory. A joke involving toilet humour may be funnier told on the playground at elementary school than on a college campus. The same joke will elicit different responses in different settings. The punchline in the joke remains the same, however it is more or less appropriate depending on the current context.\n\nThe context explores the specific social situation in which joking occurs. The narrator automatically modifies the text of the joke to be acceptable to different audiences, while at the same time supporting the same divergent scripts in the punchline. The vocabulary used in telling the same joke at a university fraternity party and to one's grandmother might well vary. In each situation it is important to identify both the narrator and the audience as well as their relationship with each other. This varies to reflect the complexities of a matrix of different social factors: age, sex, race, ethnicity, kinship, political views, religion, power relationship, etc. When all the potential combinations of such factors between the narrator and the audience are considered, then a single joke can take on infinite shades of meaning for each unique social setting.\n\nThe context, however, should not be confused with the function of the joking. \"Function is essentially an abstraction made on the basis of a number of contexts\". In one long-term observation of men coming off the late shift at a local café, joking with the waitresses was used to ascertain sexual availability for the evening. Different types of jokes, going from general to topical into explicitly sexual humour signalled openness on the part of the waitress for a connection. This study describes how jokes and joking are used to communicate much more than just good humour. That is a single example of the function of joking in a social setting, but there are others. Sometimes jokes are used simply to get to know someone better. What makes them laugh, what do they find funny? Jokes concerning politics, religion or sexual topics can be used effectively to gage the attitude of the audience to any one of these topics. They can also be used as a marker of group identity, signalling either inclusion or exclusion for the group. Among pre-adolescents, \"dirty\" jokes allow them to share information about their changing bodies. And sometimes joking is just simple entertainment for a group of friends.\n\nThe context of joking in turn leads into a study of joking relationships, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who take part in institutionalised banter and joking. These relationships can be either one-way or a mutual back and forth between partners. \"The joking relationship is defined as a peculiar combination of friendliness and antagonism. The behaviour is such that in any other social context it would express and arouse hostility; but it is not meant seriously and must not be taken seriously. There is a pretence of hostility along with a real friendliness. To put it in another way, the relationship is one of permitted disrespect.\" Joking relationships were first described by anthropologists within kinship groups in Africa. But they have since been identified in cultures around the world, where jokes and joking are used to mark and re-inforce appropriate boundaries of a relationship.\n\nThe advent of electronic communications at the end of the 20th century introduced new traditions into jokes. A verbal joke or cartoon is emailed to a friend or posted on a bulletin board; reactions include a replied email with a :-) or LOL, or a forward on to further recipients. Interaction is limited to the computer screen and for the most part solitary. While preserving the text of a joke, both context and variants are lost in internet joking; for the most part emailed jokes are passed along verbatim. The framing of the joke frequently occurs in the subject line: \"RE: laugh for the day\" or something similar. The forward of an email joke can increase the number of recipients exponentially.\n\nInternet joking forces a re-evaluation of social spaces and social groups. They are no longer only defined by physical presence and locality, they also exist in the connectivity in cyberspace. \"The computer networks appear to make possible communities that, although physically dispersed, display attributes of the direct, unconstrained, unofficial exchanges folklorists typically concern themselves with\". This is particularly evident in the spread of topical jokes, \"that genre of lore in which whole crops of jokes spring up seemingly overnight around some sensational event … flourish briefly and then disappear, as the mass media move on to fresh maimings and new collective tragedies\". This correlates with the new understanding of the internet as an \"active folkloric space\" with evolving social and cultural forces and clearly identifiable performers and audiences.\n\nA study by the folklorist Bill Ellis documented how an evolving cycle was circulated over the internet. By accessing message boards that specialised in humour immediately following the 9/11 disaster, Ellis was able to observe in real time both the topical jokes being posted electronically and responses to the jokes. \"Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists' attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful\". Access to archived message boards also enables us to track the development of a single joke thread in the context of a more complicated virtual conversation.\n\nA joke cycle is a collection of jokes about a single target or situation which displays consistent narrative structure and type of humour. Some well-known cycles are elephant jokes using nonsense humour, dead baby jokes incorporating black humour and light bulb jokes, which describe all kinds of operational stupidity. Joke cycles can centre on ethnic groups, professions (viola jokes), catastrophes, settings (…walks into a bar), absurd characters (wind-up dolls), or logical mechanisms which generate the humour (knock-knock jokes). A joke can be reused in different joke cycles; an example of this is the same Head & Shoulders joke refitted to the tragedies of Vic Morrow, Admiral Mountbatten and the crew of the Challenger space shuttle. These cycles seem to appear spontaneously, spread rapidly across countries and borders only to dissipate after some time. Folklorists and others have studied individual joke cycles in an attempt to understand their function and significance within the culture.\nJoke cycles circulated in the recent past include:\nAs with the 9/11 disaster discussed above, cycles attach themselves to celebrities or national catastrophes such as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the death of Michael Jackson, and the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. These cycles arise regularly as a response to terrible unexpected events which command the national news. An in-depth analysis of the Challenger joke cycle documents a change in the type of humour circulated following the disaster, from February to March 1986. \"It shows that the jokes appeared in distinct 'waves', the first responding to the disaster with clever wordplay and the second playing with grim and troubling images associated with the event…The primary social function of disaster jokes appears to be to provide closure to an event that provoked communal grieving, by signaling that it was time to move on and pay attention to more immediate concerns\".\n\nThe sociologist Christie Davies has written extensively on ethnic jokes told in countries around the world. In ethnic jokes he finds that the \"stupid\" ethnic target in the joke is no stranger to the culture, but rather a peripheral social group (geographic, economic, cultural, linguistic) well known to the joke tellers. So Americans tell jokes about Polacks and Italians, Germans tell jokes about Ostfriesens, and the English tell jokes about the Irish. In a review of Davies' theories it is said that \"For Davies, [ethnic] jokes are more about how joke tellers imagine themselves than about how they imagine those others who serve as their putative targets…The jokes thus serve to center one in the world – to remind people of their place and to reassure them that they are in it.\"\n\nA third category of joke cycles identifies absurd characters as the butt: for example the grape, the dead baby or the elephant. Beginning in the 1960s, social and cultural interpretations of these joke cycles, spearheaded by the folklorist Alan Dundes, began to appear in academic journals. Dead baby jokes are posited to reflect societal changes and guilt caused by widespread use of contraception and abortion beginning in the 1960s. Elephant jokes have been interpreted variously as stand-ins for American blacks during the Civil Rights Era or as an \"image of something large and wild abroad in the land captur[ing] the sense of counterculture\" of the sixties. These interpretations strive for a cultural understanding of the themes of these jokes which go beyond the simple collection and documentation undertaken previously by folklorists and ethnologists.\n\nAs folktales and other types of oral literature became collectibles throughout Europe in the 19th century (Brothers Grimm et al.), folklorists and anthropologists of the time needed a system to organise these items. The Aarne–Thompson classification system was first published in 1910 by Antti Aarne, and later expanded by Stith Thompson to become the most renowned classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. Its final section addresses anecdotes and jokes, listing traditional humorous tales ordered by their protagonist; \"This section of the Index is essentially a classification of the older European jests, or merry tales – humorous stories characterized by short, fairly simple plots. …\" Due to its focus on older tale types and obsolete actors (e.g., numbskull), the Aarne–Thompson Index does not provide much help in identifying and classifying the modern joke.\n\nA more granular classification system used widely by folklorists and cultural anthropologists is the Thompson Motif Index, which separates tales into their individual story elements. This system enables jokes to be classified according to individual motifs included in the narrative: actors, items and incidents. It does not provide a system to classify the text by more than one element at a time while at the same time making it theoretically possible to classify the same text under multiple motifs.\n\nThe Thompson Motif Index has spawned further specialised motif indices, each of which focuses on a single aspect of one subset of jokes. A sampling of just a few of these specialised indices have been listed under other motif indices. Here one can select an index for medieval Spanish folk narratives, another index for linguistic verbal jokes, and a third one for sexual humour. To assist the researcher with this increasingly confusing situation, there are also multiple bibliographies of indices as well as a how-to guide on creating your own index.\n\nSeveral difficulties have been identified with these systems of identifying oral narratives according to either tale types or story elements. A first major problem is their hierarchical organisation; one element of the narrative is selected as the major element, while all other parts are arrayed subordinate to this. A second problem with these systems is that the listed motifs are not qualitatively equal; actors, items and incidents are all considered side-by-side. And because incidents will always have at least one actor and usually have an item, most narratives can be ordered under multiple headings. This leads to confusion about both where to order an item and where to find it. A third significant problem is that the \"excessive prudery\" common in the middle of the 20th century means that obscene, sexual and scatological elements were regularly ignored in many of the indices.\n\nThe folklorist Robert Georges has summed up the concerns with these existing classification systems: It has proven difficult to organise all different elements of a joke into a multi-dimensional classification system which could be of real value in the study and evaluation of this (primarily oral) complex narrative form.\n\nThe General Theory of Verbal Humour or GTVH, developed by the linguists Victor Raskin and Salvatore Attardo, attempts to do exactly this. This classification system was developed specifically for jokes and later expanded to include longer types of humorous narratives. Six different aspects of the narrative, labelled Knowledge Resources or KRs, can be evaluated largely independently of each other, and then combined into a concatenated classification label. These six KRs of the joke structure include: \n\nAs development of the GTVH progressed, a hierarchy of the KRs was established to partially restrict the options for lower level KRs depending on the KRs defined above them. For example, a lightbulb joke (SI) will always be in the form of a riddle (NS). Outside of these restrictions, the KRs can create a multitude of combinations, enabling a researcher to select jokes for analysis which contain only one or two defined KRs. It also allows for an evaluation of the similarity or dissimilarity of jokes depending on the similarity of their labels. \"The GTVH presents itself as a mechanism … of generating [or describing] an infinite number of jokes by combining the various values that each parameter can take. … Descriptively, to analyze a joke in the GTVH consists of listing the values of the 6 KRs (with the caveat that TA and LM may be empty).\" This classification system provides a functional multi-dimensional label for any joke, and indeed any verbal humour.\n\nMany academic disciplines lay claim to the study of jokes (and other forms of humour) as within their purview. Fortunately there are enough jokes, good, bad and worse, to go around. Unfortunately the studies of jokes from each of the interested disciplines brings to mind the tale of the blind men and an elephant where the observations, although accurate reflections of their own competent methodological inquiry, frequently fail to grasp the beast in its entirety. This attests to the joke as a traditional narrative form which is indeed complex, concise and complete in and of itself. It requires a \"multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary field of inquiry\" to truly appreciate these nuggets of cultural insight.\n\nSigmund Freud was one of the first modern scholars to recognise jokes as an important object of investigation. In his 1905 study \"Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious\" Freud describes the social nature of humour and illustrates his text with many examples of contemporary Viennese jokes. His work is particularly noteworthy in this context because Freud distinguishes in his writings between jokes, humour and the comic. These are distinctions which become easily blurred in many subsequent studies where everything funny tends to be gathered under the umbrella term of \"humour\", making for a much more diffuse discussion.\n\nSince the publication of Freud's study, psychologists have continued to explore humour and jokes in their quest to explain, predict and control an individual's \"sense of humour\". Why do people laugh? Why do people find something funny? Can jokes predict character, or vice versa, can character predict the jokes an individual laughs at? What is a \"sense of humour\"? A current review of the popular magazine \"Psychology Today\" lists over 200 articles discussing various aspects of humour; in psychospeak the subject area has become both an emotion to measure and a tool to use in diagnostics and treatment. A new psychological assessment tool, the Values in Action Inventory developed by the American psychologists Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman includes humour (and playfulness) as one of the core character strengths of an individual. As such, it could be a good predictor of life satisfaction. For psychologists, it would be useful to measure both how much of this strength an individual has and how it can be measurably increased.\n\nA 2007 survey of existing tools to measure humour identified more than 60 psychological measurement instruments. These measurement tools use many different approaches to quantify humour along with its related states and traits. There are tools to measure an individual's physical response by their smile; the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is one of several tools used to identify any one of multiple types of smiles. Or the laugh can be measured to calculate the funniness response of an individual; multiple types of laughter have been identified. It must be stressed here that both smiles and laughter are not always a response to something funny. In trying to develop a measurement tool, most systems use \"jokes and cartoons\" as their test materials. However, because no two tools use the same jokes, and across languages this would not be feasible, how does one determine that the assessment objects are comparable? Moving on, whom does one ask to rate the sense of humour of an individual? Does one ask the person themselves, an impartial observer, or their family, friends and colleagues? Furthermore, has the current mood of the test subjects been considered; someone with a recent death in the family might not be much prone to laughter. Given the plethora of variants revealed by even a superficial glance at the problem, it becomes evident that these paths of scientific inquiry are mined with problematic pitfalls and questionable solutions.\n\nThe psychologist has been very active in the research of humour. He has collaborated with the linguists Raskin and Attardo on their General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) classification system. Their goal is to empirically test both the six autonomous classification types (KRs) and the hierarchical ordering of these KRs. Advancement in this direction would be a win-win for both fields of study; linguistics would have empirical verification of this multi-dimensional classification system for jokes, and psychology would have a standardised joke classification with which they could develop verifiably comparable measurement tools.\n\n\"The linguistics of humor has made gigantic strides forward in the last decade and a half and replaced the psychology of humor as the most advanced theoretical approach to the study of this important and universal human faculty.\" This recent statement by one noted linguist and humour researcher describes, from his perspective, contemporary linguistic humour research. Linguists study words, how words are strung together to build sentences, how sentences create meaning which can be communicated from one individual to another, how our interaction with each other using words creates discourse. Jokes have been defined above as oral narrative in which words and sentences are engineered to build toward a punchline. The linguist's question is: what exactly makes the punchline funny? This question focuses on how the words used in the punchline create humour, in contrast to the psychologist's concern (see above) with the audience response to the punchline. The assessment of humour by psychologists \"is made from the individual's perspective; e.g. the phenomenon associated with responding to or creating humor and not a description of humor itself.\" Linguistics, on the other hand, endeavours to provide a precise description of what makes a text funny.\n\nTwo major new linguistic theories have been developed and tested within the last decades. The first was advanced by Victor Raskin in \"Semantic Mechanisms of Humor\", published 1985. While being a variant on the more general concepts of the incongruity theory of humour, it is the first theory to identify its approach as exclusively linguistic. The Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour (SSTH) begins by identifying two linguistic conditions which make a text funny. It then goes on to identify the mechanisms involved in creating the punchline. This theory established the semantic/pragmatic foundation of humour as well as the humour competence of speakers.\n\nSeveral years later the SSTH was incorporated into a more expansive theory of jokes put forth by Raskin and his colleague Salvatore Attardo. In the General Theory of Verbal Humour, the SSTH was relabelled as a Logical Mechanism (LM) (referring to the mechanism which connects the different linguistic scripts in the joke) and added to five other independent Knowledge Resources (KR). Together these six KRs could now function as a multi-dimensional descriptive label for any piece of humorous text.\n\nLinguistics has developed further methodological tools which can be applied to jokes: discourse analysis and conversation analysis of joking. Both of these subspecialties within the field focus on \"naturally occurring\" language use, i.e. the analysis of real (usually recorded) conversations. One of these studies has already been discussed above, where Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling a single joke. Discourse analysis emphasises the entire context of social joking, the social interaction which cradles the words.\n\nFolklore and cultural anthropology have perhaps the strongest claims on jokes as belonging to their bailiwick. Jokes remain one of the few remaining forms of traditional folk literature transmitted orally in western cultures. Identified as one of the \"simple forms\" of oral literature by in 1930, they have been collected and studied since there were folklorists and anthropologists abroad in the lands. As a genre they were important enough at the beginning of the 20th century to be included under their own heading in the Aarne–Thompson index first published in 1910: Anecdotes and jokes.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, cultural researchers began to expand their role from collectors and archivists of \"folk ideas\" to a more active role of interpreters of cultural artefacts. One of the foremost scholars active during this transitional time was the folklorist Alan Dundes. He started asking questions of tradition and transmission with the key observation that \"No piece of folklore continues to be transmitted unless it means something, even if neither the speaker nor the audience can articulate what that meaning might be.\" In the context of jokes, this then becomes the basis for further research. Why is the joke told right now? Only in this expanded perspective is an understanding of its meaning to the participants possible.\n\nThis questioning resulted in a blossoming of monographs to explore the significance of many joke cycles. What is so funny about absurd nonsense elephant jokes? Why make light of dead babies? In an article on contemporary German jokes about Auschwitz and the Holocaust, Dundes justifies this research: \"Whether one finds Auschwitz jokes funny or not is not an issue. This material exists and should be recorded. Jokes are always an important barometer of the attitudes of a group. The jokes exist and they obviously must fill some psychic need for those individuals who tell them and those who listen to them.\" A stimulating generation of new humour theories flourishes like mushrooms in the undergrowth: Elliott Oring's theoretical discussions on \"appropriate ambiguity\" and Amy Carrell's hypothesis of an \"audience-based theory of verbal humor (1993)\" to name just a few.\n\nIn his book \"Humor and Laughter: An Anthropological Approach\", the anthropologist Mahadev Apte presents a solid case for his own academic perspective. \"Two axioms underlie my discussion, namely, that humor is by and large culture based and that humor can be a major conceptual and methodological tool for gaining insights into cultural systems.\" Apte goes on to call for legitimising the field of humour research as \"humorology\"; this would be a field of study incorporating an interdisciplinary character of humour studies.\n\nWhile the label \"humorology\" has yet to become a household word, great strides are being made in the international recognition of this interdisciplinary field of research. The International Society for Humor Studies was founded in 1989 with the stated purpose to \"promote, stimulate and encourage the interdisciplinary study of humour; to support and cooperate with local, national, and international organizations having similar purposes; to organize and arrange meetings; and to issue and encourage publications concerning the purpose of the society.\" It also publishes \"\" and holds yearly conferences to promote and inform its speciality.\n\nComputational humour is a new field of study which uses computers to model humour; it bridges the disciplines of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. A primary ambition of this field is to develop computer programs which can both generate a joke and recognise a text snippet as a joke. Early programming attempts have dealt almost exclusively with punning because this lends itself to simple straightforward rules. These primitive programs display no intelligence; instead they work off a template with a finite set of pre-defined punning options upon which to build.\n\nMore sophisticated computer joke programs have yet to be developed. Based on our understanding of the SSTH / GTVH humour theories, it is easy to see why. The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in these theories include, for any given word, a \"large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it [...] a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker\". These scripts extend much further than the lexical definition of a word; they contain the speaker's complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. As insentient machines, computers lack the encyclopaedic scripts which humans gain through life experience. They also lack the ability to gather the experiences needed to build wide-ranging semantic scripts and understand language in a broader context, a context that any child picks up in daily interaction with his environment.\n\nFurther development in this field must wait until computational linguists have succeeded in programming a computer with an ontological semantic natural language processing system. It is only \"the most complex linguistic structures [which] can serve any formal and/or computational treatment of humor well\". Toy systems (i.e. dummy punning programs) are completely inadequate to the task. Despite the fact that the field of computational humour is small and underdeveloped, it is encouraging to note the many interdisciplinary efforts which are currently underway. As this field grows in both understanding and methodology, it provides an ideal testbed for humour theories; the rules must firstly be cleanly defined in order to write a computer program around a theory.\n\nIn 1872, Charles Darwin published one of the first \"comprehensive and in many ways remarkably accurate description of laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action and gesture and posture\" (Laughter). In this early study Darwin raises further questions about who laughs and why they laugh; the myriad responses since then illustrates the complexities of this behaviour. To understand laughter in humans and other primates, the science of gelotology (from the Greek \"\", meaning laughter) has been established; it is the study of laughter and its effects on the body from both a psychological and physiological perspective. While jokes can provoke laughter, laughter cannot be used as a one-to-one marker of jokes because there are multiple stimuli to laugher, humour being just one of them. The other six causes of laughter listed are: social context, ignorance, anxiety, derision, acting apology, and tickling. As such, the study of laughter is a secondary albeit entertaining perspective in an understanding of jokes.\n\n"}

It premiered its first six episodes on August 25, 2015 through its official website, and released subsequent episodes intermittently through September 2016. Set in Powell's home, and inspired by his real life, the show follows Keith through a series of visits with his friends and family while he recuperates from an unknown accident that left his right leg broken. Most guest actors who appear in the show play a parody version of themselves, including Aubrey Plaza, Fiona Gubelmann, Malcolm Barrett, Leonard Robinson, and Alexandra Krosney. Powell writes, directs, and produces all episodes in addition to starring.\n\nUpon its release, the show received much publicity due to Powell blogging for \"The Huffington Post\", which highlighted each episode of the show. The blogs discussed race, politics, relationships, friendship, marriage, and other current events as it relates to specific moments in the web series. Particularly, his blog post highlighting the \"You Talk White\" phenomenon (promoting the episode \"Baller\") received widespread attention on \"NPR\", \"HuffPost Live\", and various international news blogs.\n\nThe series is a semi-autobiographical comedy about \"30 Rock\" star Keith Powell's self-discovery when he is suddenly stripped of his ability to be mobile. After an accident, Keith is forced to see the world in a new way when his wife, his friends, and especially his agent don’t make life easy for the incapacitated. What results is a series of visits with the floura and fauna of the Hollywood comedy world, with most of the actors playing parodies of themselves. The style of the show is slower-paced and more observational than traditional comedies, with elements of drama, surrealism, and philosophy throughout. Powell has described the show as contemplative with \"earned\" jokes.\n\n\nAll actors play parodies of themselves unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first six episodes of Volume 1 were released through Vimeo and www.GetBroken.com on August 25, 2015. Two more episodes were released on November 12, 2015, with the last two episodes of the season released on February 12, 2016. Mailing list subscribers got to watch the episodes prior to the official release dates, and TV Insider released two episodes a week prior to the world premiere of the series.\n\nThe series had advance showings at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Los Angeles prior to its August 25 release, with 30 Rock co-star Jack McBrayer conducting a Q&A afterwards.\n\nPowell self-funded the first season, citing the personal nature of the project and his reluctance to initially crowdfund. He wrote an article on IndieWire detailing his process.\n\nThe series is filmed on location in Los Angeles, California in Powell's real life home. Additionally, the home was featured on HGTV's \"House Hunters Renovation\" and \"House Hunters Where Are They Now?\"\n\nThe color palette of the show is highly saturated, highlighting the colors blue and red. Powell has stated that the entire production time took longer than usual due to the low budget of the series. In addition, Powell employed the use of drone cameras to take the place of cranes and dollies, and the series was shot exclusively on DSLR cameras.\n\nThe theme song is composed by 30 Rock co-composer Giancarlo Vulcano, inspired by the Motown sound of the 1960s. Vulcano also collaborated with Powell for the score of \"My Name Is David\".\n\nAfter the release of the first six episodes, Tubefilter called the series a \"sleek, well shot, reasonably funny web series\" and concluded \"it's a nice way to spend an hour.\" TV Insider stated \"For seven seasons, Keith Powell was 30 Rock’s uptight and under-appreciated “Toofer” Spurlock, but now, the man who battled Frank Rossitano for the right to wear Harvard gear and battled Tracy Jordan over a certain word is stepping, with the help of crutches, into his own spotlight.\" Review & Roast pointed out that Powell and Knox \"played well off each other and it was obvious they had real chemistry.\" Reviewing the show at the Raindance Film Festival, Vodzilla noted the show's dry pace, stating, \"That mundane approach makes for a relatable series which lacks in laugh-out-loud moments but builds up to them with a restraint and gentle tone that makes them more satisfying... there’s surprising substance here.\" \n\nIn 2016, Powell won the Best Actor (Comedy) award at the New York Television Festival.\n\nThe series was nominated for seven 2016 Indie Series Awards, winning two, including Best Web Series – Comedy. In 2017, it was nominated for an additional six Indie Series Awards.\n"}

The film is the fourth entry in the \"Kickboxer\" franchise. This was the last film to star Sasha Mitchell, who reprises his role as David Sloane.\n\nThe film opens with a recap of earlier events in the series as David Sloane writes a letter to his wife, Vicky. After being framed for murder by Tong Po, Sloane has spent the last two years in prison, while his wife has become the sexual captive of his old nemesis, who has since become one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico. \n\nAfter receiving explicit photos from Po of his kidnapped wife, Sloane takes his frustrations out on a fellow prisoner before meeting with a DEA official, Casey Ford (Nicholas Guest), who briefs Sloane about their situation. He reveals that the agency has been unable to apprehend Po by their own means and that Po intends to host a martial arts tournament at his private compound, with the winner earning a match against Po and a $1,000,000 cash prize. Knowing the history between them, Casey offers to release Sloane if he will enter the tournament and eliminate Po himself. Sloane eagerly accepts, using the alias \"Jack Jones\" to conceal his identity. His first stop is a street fight, where he easily dispatches two street fighters earning him a necessary invitation from a man named Brubaker, who scouts fighters and invites them to Po's tournament. \n\nOn his way to the border, Sloane enters a roadside bar and stumbles upon a group of thugs harassing a young woman named Megan Laurence. Sloane defeats them with ease and saves the woman, who is ungrateful for his help and reveals that she is entering the tournament as well. Sloane arrives at the compound and is greeted by Darcy Cove, one of Po's many female sex slaves, who tells him that he must compete in the qualifying matches. Sloane witnesses Thomas, a brutal fighter, take out another young fighter. Then, Sloane is chosen to face Laurence. Reluctant to harm the young woman despite her taunting, Sloane peacefully subdues her. He also meets up with an old acquaintance named Lando Smith, a talented fighter who turns out to be his backup on the mission. \n\nAt the party of the tournament's seventh anniversary, Bill, Po's right hand man, introduces Tong Po to the crowd. Sloane leaves the party soon after to search for his wife, but finds the entire compound to be heavily guarded. Meanwhile, Po offers Laurence a second opportunity to compete, but places a bounty on her head inciting all the other fighters to attack her at once. Laurence holds her own until Po attacks her, prompting Lando to intervene. After a brief standoff with Po, Lando escorts Laurence back to her room.\n\nThat night, Sloane searches the compound and manages to locate his wife, but is unable to free her before the alarm sounds. On Po's orders, the guards try to apprehend him, but they fail and Sloane escapes. The next morning, Sloane befriends Laurence and offers his help for the upcoming tournament. \n\nThe tournament begins with several matches taking place. Sloane witnesses Thomas incapacitate a female judoka fighter (Dana Dru Evenson), while Lando and Laurence both win their respective matches. When Sloane (as \"Jack Jones\") is called up to fight, Lando approaches Darcy to divert Po's attention away from him. Sloane wins his fight quickly and escapes Po's notice. \n\nIn an effort to gain more intelligence about Sloane's wife, Lando enters a romance with Darcy and presses her for information while offering to help her escape from Po. Darcy provides him with the necessary intel which he passes on to Sloane before being caught by Bill and his guards. Po tortures Lando to learn why he has come to the tournament, but unable to get a satisfactory answer, he brings forth Darcy and tortures her in front of Lando forcing him to admit that he is a DEA agent. Lando pleads for Darcy's life, but Po tortures her to death. \n\nMeanwhile, Sloane seeks to free his wife, but is unable to find her since Po had her moved from her original cell as a result of his previous intrusion. Sloane is then captured by Po, who is surprised to see his old rival. On the final day of the tournament, Po declares that all fights will be to the death and dismisses several fighters who are unwilling to risk their lives, but shoots them all dead as they depart. The tournament proceeds with even more fighters killed at the hands of their opponents, until both Lando and Sloane are dragged into the arena. \n\nPo announces that the tournament is a memorial to his late wife, Sian, who was killed five years prior when the DEA invaded his home. He blames Sloane for her death and offers a $500,000 bonus to whoever is able to defeat Sloane. Thomas accepts the challenge, but Sloane is able to defeat him. Po calls for more challengers, and the other two remaining fighters step forward. One after the other, Sloane proves to be more than a match for them. In frustration, Po orders Laurence to fight him, but she refuses, calling him a coward. Po threatens to kill them all if she does not fight, but Laurence asserts her belief that there was never any prize money and that Po intends to kill them all regardless, her words prompting the other fighters to rally against him. As one, the men rise up to fight for their lives against Po's armed guards. \n\nThe fighters seem to have a strong advantage, until Po himself enters the fray and begins to subdue them. Though he fights bravely, Lando is easily bested by the Muay Thai master. In the end, only Sloane and Po are left standing. After a brutal confrontation, Sloane conquers his rival once again, but Bill takes Vicky at gunpoint giving Po the opportunity to escape. Sloane dispatches Bill with a well-aimed knife throw before he and Vicky exit the compound along with Lando and Laurence.\n\n\n\"TV Guide\" rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \"\"Kickboxer 4\" does proud by the franchise that gave the world Jean-Claude Van Damme.\" Adam Arseneau of DVD Verdict called it an improvement over the third film but still bad.

{"id": "12799134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12799134", "title": "Louis Conradt", "text": "Louis Conradt\n\nLouis William \"Bill\" Conradt Jr. (January 30, 1950 – November 5, 2006) was an assistant district attorney from Texas. He was inextricably linked to \"Dateline NBC's\" \"To Catch a Predator\", a TV series that conducted sting operations against suspected sexual predators who target children online. Local law enforcement conducted a sting operation that identified Conradt as a suspect, and \"Dateline\" cameras recorded the events that followed. Conradt fatally shot himself upon encountering SWAT team members that were serving an arrest warrant at his home.\n\nLouis Conradt was born January 30, 1950, in Terrell, Texas. Conradt graduated from the University of Texas at Austin and received his law degree at Texas Tech University School of Law. He was the Kaufman County, Texas, district attorney for more than two decades before giving up his seat to make a failed run in 2002 to be the 86th State District Judge. Afterward, he became Rockwall County's chief felony assistant district attorney. Conradt lived in Terrell, about an hour southeast of Murphy, where Perverted-Justice, working in conjunction with \"Dateline\", had set up shop to conduct its predator stings. Records show that Conradt was single and lived alone.\n\nAccording to Perverted-Justice's logs, Conradt, posing as a 19-year-old university student, engaged in sexually charged online chats with a person using the alias of a fictional 13-year-old named Luke. Conradt solicited pictures of \"Luke's\" penis and sent him photos purporting to be of himself. After two weeks of these exchanges Perverted-Justice and NBC brought in an actor to play Luke over the phone. For reasons that are still not known, Conradt stopped responding to phone calls and instant messages. It was then that police decided to bring the operation to Conradt's home in Terrell.\n\nAccording to Perverted-Justice members, content from Conradt's MySpace page began to disappear, leading them to believe that Conradt was covering up his tracks. This played a part in the decision of the authorities to pursue a warrant for Conradt's arrest. Chris Hansen mentioned the disappearing page on his blog and on air. \"Esquire\" writer Luke Dittrich implies that the disappearing page pushed the participants to make an imminent move as, under Texas law, individuals may be charged with committing a crime if they participate in sexually explicit chats with persons identifying themselves as children. Later investigation by \"Esquire\" revealed that Conradt's page had not been touched for months before the sting. Perverted-Justice members claimed that Conradt had other MySpace pages but never produced the evidence to prove the allegation. Hansen later admitted to \"Esquire\" that he did not remember actually seeing the page.\n\nAccording to the \"Esquire\" article, members from Perverted-Justice faxed the Collin County District Attorney's office requesting support for an upcoming sting. District attorney John Roach was surprised the request came from a civilian group rather than the police. Roach told \"Esquire\" he warned Murphy Police Chief Myrick to not deal with \"Dateline\" or Perverted-Justice and that the DA's office \"will take no part in the planning or execution of the sting operation\". Conradt's sister, Patricia, represented by attorney Bruce Baron, filed a federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe official participants in the sting included Murphy police and the Terrell Police Department, including Terrell's SWAT team. According to raw footage obtained by \"Esquire\", at least one \"Dateline\" cameraman had hidden himself near the Conradt residence door. Chris Hansen and \"Dateline\" denied that crew members were on the private property (such an act is illegal). \n\nAlso in that footage is Frag, a member of Perverted-Justice, who is seen advising police on what to do next. Chris Hansen denied that Perverted-Justice was present but recanted when \"Esquire\" was able to describe what Frag looked like.\n\nThe warrants were signed shortly after 2 p.m. By this time, police and \"Dateline\" had been on the scene for hours. In fact, \"Dateline\" had shown up as long as five hours earlier, and later records showed that neighbors had phoned in suspicious persons reports.\n\nAccording to the \"Esquire\" account (again, contested by \"Dateline\") \"Dateline\" crewmembers notified police that they observed that a Sunday newspaper on Conradt's doorstep had disappeared, indicating that Conradt was actually home. Later, in an interview with \"Esquire\", Hansen would claim that he did not remember the incident, nor would he characterize anything \"Dateline\" did as surveillance for the police.\n\nUsing the tip given to them by \"Dateline\", the police made a decision to call in a SWAT team and perform a tactical entry. They feared that Conradt was aware of their presence and was now destroying evidence. The police broke the door's lock and swept through the house. They encountered Conradt in a hallway. According to the officers' account, Conradt said a variation of \"I'm not going to hurt anyone\". He then shot himself in the head with a Browning .380 handgun.\n\nIn most cases, \"To Catch a Predator\" lured suspected sex offenders with an actor or actress pretending to be a child, into a home that was wired with cameras and surrounded by police.\n\nConradt's death prompted increased criticism of the show, which was already being criticized by some, in the legal and journalistic profession. A year after the incident, \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Esquire\" published articles denouncing \"To Catch a Predator\". \"Esquire\" obtained raw footage of the incident that contradicted \"Dateline\"'s and host Chris Hansen's previous denials of the show's alleged collusion with law enforcement officials.\n\nHansen did not respond to the \"Esquire\" article when \"The Houston Chronicle\" asked for comment but deferred to his spokeswoman, who called the idea that Hansen would dictate police action \"preposterous\".\n\nPerverted-Justice founder Xavier von Erck called the \"Esquire\" article fiction. He did not respond to the \"Esquire\" story's allegation or supporting evidence that \"Dateline\" and Perverted-Justice directed police actions in the Conradt case; rather, he reiterated his disgust for Conradt's behavior. In an email response to \"The Houston Chronicle\", he wrote:\n\n\"The idea that anything led to the suicide of Conradt other than his want to avoid potential penalties for soliciting a 13-year-old boy sexually is outlandish. We encourage all interested to read the Conradt chat-logs and verification call recordings. Once you do that, you then immediately know why Conradt shot himself rather than face the criminal justice system.\"\n\nFacts from the aired February 20, 2007, episode of \"To Catch a Predator\" were used as part of a $100 million lawsuit by Conradt's sister, Patricia Conradt, against NBC Universal. In March 2008, Judge Chin agreed to allow her infliction of emotional distress and civil rights claims to be heard by a jury.\n\nABC News later did an investigation of the incident on its own news show, \"20/20\" (see \"To Catch a Predator\" for more information).\n\nOn June 24, 2008, the lawsuit brought against NBC Universal by Patricia Conradt was \"amicably resolved\" out of court.\n"}

{"id": "1902832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1902832", "title": "Mother May I?", "text": "Mother May I?\n\nMother May I? is a children's game, also known as \"Captain May I?\" and \"Father May I?\".\n\nOne player plays the \"mother\", \"father\" or \"captain\". The other players are the \"children\" or \"crewmembers\". To begin the game, the mother or father stands at one end of a room and turns around facing away, while all the children line up at the other end. The children take turns asking \"Mother/Father, may I ____?\" and makes a movement suggestion. For example, one might ask, \"Mother/Father, may I take five steps forward?\" The mother/father either replies \"Yes, you may\" or \"No, you may not do that, but you may _____ instead\" and inserts his/her own suggestion. The players usually move closer to the mother/father but are sometimes led farther away. Even if the mother/father makes an unfavorable suggestion, the child must still perform it. The first of the children to reach the location of the mother/father wins the game. That child then becomes the mother/father himself, the original mother/father becomes a child, and a new round begins.\n\nSome suggestions that fill in the \"Mother/Father/Captain, may I ____?\" blank include:\n\nIf the \"children\" are reaching the \"mother\" or \"father\" too quickly, the \"mother\"/\"father\" may reject the child's suggestion by replacing it with \"No, you may not do that, but you may ____ instead.\" They may reduce the child's original suggestion (for example, reducing five giant steps to three giant steps), or make a different suggestion, such as:\n\nA common alternative gameplay is for \"mother\" or \"father\" (who can be facing the children) to begin each child's turn by issuing the instruction to be carried out. The child must reply, \"Mother/Father, may I?\" before carrying out the order, to which Mother/Father always consents. However, if the child omits to ask permission he or she is required to go back to the start. Children who have advanced a long way towards the goal are thus brought to ruin; instructions to go backwards must also be asked for lest a worse fate awaits. The art to being a good mother or father is to bring everyone as equally as possible.\n\nOther variations of this kind of crossing-over game are \"What's the Time, Mr Wolf?\" (sometimes called \"Old Mrs. Fox, What Time is It?\", although this version is slightly different), \"Grandmother's Footsteps\" and \"Bulldog\", played in Britain. In the first of these, gameplay is similar: Mr Wolf faces away from the children (or Mrs. Fox faces the children), the children together chant in a well-known fashion \"What's the time, Mr Wolf?\" (or \"Old Mrs. Fox, what time is it?\"), and if he or she replies with 9 o'clock, the children move 9 steps forward. Should anyone reach Mr Wolf, he or she becomes the new Mr Wolf. Alternatively, however, should Mr Wolf reply to the question by saying \"Dinner Time!\" (or in the Mrs. Fox version, \"Midnight!\") he turns and chases the children back towards the start. If he catches one before he or she reaches safety, that child is the new Mr Wolf.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "631080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=631080", "title": "Production assistant", "text": "Production assistant\n\nA Production Assistant, also known as a PA, is a member of the film crew and is a job title used in filmmaking and television for a person responsible for various aspects of a production. The job of a PA can vary greatly depending on the budget and specific requirements of a production as well as whether the production is unionized.\n\nProduction Assistants on films are sometimes attached to individual actors or filmmakers.\n\nIn the United States, Production Assistants in union and non-union workplaces face various tasks on the movie set of a filmmaking project. Most union PAs are asked to complete tasks with a certain focus. Union PAs only are asked to do a few tasks that may be related to one another and they normally receive tasks concentrated on the actual making of the movie. For example, union Production Assistants may be asked to evaluate a movie's daily rushes for a film director or help the film editor decipher ways to alter a scene. Those who are non-union Production Assistants are usually asked to complete a variety of tasks by a department head on a film set. The tasks of a non-union PA can match those of a union PA. These tasks asked to be completed by either a union or non-union PA are requirements that are related to the movie's production, such as setting up props on set and negotiating with the director on how a scene should be shot. However, non-union PAs commonly may be asked to complete a wider array of tasks since these tasks may not necessarily be associated with the film. For example, non-union PAs may be asked to input data in a computer, wash dishes, sort letters in the mail room, and buy coffee for department heads. Basic duties of non-union PAs can be classified as running errands for any person in the production department.\n\nMost PAs work with many people since their job requires them to complete generic obligations. Therefore, PAs must be proficient with their communication skills. Traditionally, PAs communicate with department heads by walkie-talkies on and around the films set. However, PAs can be asked by any member of the film crew to complete a job via interpersonal communication (talking to each other in person) or across technological devices such as a cell phone. Aspiring PAs must also expect to be attentive on set since they may be asked to complete any job for anyone at any time through any medium of communication. Former Production Assistant Caleb Clark recommends that people who want to be PAs must avoid sitting down, remaining alert at all times. Clark elucidates that PAs must be vigilant because they could be asked for help by any other person at any time of the day. In addition to their improving their skills pertaining to communication and readiness, PAs must adapt to their film set environment. Many movie sets that Production Assistants work on may vary in terms of luxuries. Since movie sets are given different amounts of amenities, not all of them may have the properties and resources that a Production Assistant will need to complete certain assignments. Therefore, PAs should be able to familiarize themselves with the movie set in order to increase their success rate. PAs also must be aware that they may need to bring their own form of transportation on the set. Due to the little resources some sets may have, PAs should consider bringing their own cars or trucks to the set so that more of their long-distance tasks can be completed. The people that normally ask PAs for help are usually superior to them within the film crew. Those that ask a Production Assistant for help typically include people at the top of the film crew's structure, such as the production coordinator, screenwriter, producer, and especially the film's director.\n\nIn unionized television and feature film, production assistants are usually divided into different categories: \"Set PA\", \"Truck PA\", \"Locations PA\", \"Office PA\", or \"Set Runner\" and \"Extra PA or Daily\" - Variations exist depending on a show's structure or region of the United States or Canada.\n\n\"Office PAs\" usually spend most hours in the respective show's production office handling such tasks as phones, deliveries, script copies, lunch pick-ups, and related tasks in coordination with the production manager and production coordinator.\n\n\"Set PAs\" work on the physical set of the production, whether on location or on a sound stage. They report to the assistant director (AD) department and key set PA if one is so designated. Duties include echoing (calling out) \"rolls\" and \"cuts\", locking up (making sure nothing interferes with a take), wrangling talent (actors) and background, facilitating communication between departments, distributing paperwork and radios, and related tasks as mandated by the ADs. Set PAs usually work 12- to 16-hour days with the possibility at the end of a shoot to work more than 20 hours a single day and are regularly the \"first to arrive and the last to leave\".\n\nCommercial Set PAs share the same responsibilities as their Television and Feature Film counterparts (see \"Set PAs\" above), but also inherit additional responsibilities traditionally encompassed by other departments in the television and feature film structure. These responsibilities range from providing both critical and mundane production support equipment such as dollies, cranes, director's chairs and pop-up tents to standing in for talent and even filling in for other departments who might be shortstaffed. It is not atypical for a commercial set PA to be seen handling trash one minute, and the next minute assisting the electricians or grips with a set-up. A select group of commercial set PAs are given the responsibility of driving and managing the production and camera cube trucks. This responsibility is often given to the more senior PAs because it provides several extra days of pay.\n\nSet PAs in commercials are more commonly hired by the production coordinator and/or production manager as opposed to an AD or key set PA. However, many commercial ADs will.\n\nStandard rate for a commercial PA in the Los Angeles area is a flat rate of $200 per day. On February 1, 2008, benefits for qualifying freelance PAs became available through the Producer's Health Benefits Plan.\n\nIn North America, no union currently exists for production assistants, but the affiliation of a production with a union (or \"unions\") can affect the job responsibilities of a PA. Less unionized film productions have more positions that can be serviced by non-union personnel; consequently, PAs on such productions may take on a greater variety of non-traditional duties. Examples of this would be a PA setting a light bounce (grip department) or driving a passenger van (teamster/transportation department). PAs on a union production generally have less variety in their job duties whereas a non-union PA can be asked to perform any kind of task by a department head.\n\nIn British Columbia, which has the third largest film and television production sector in North America, PAs are represented by the Director's Guild of Canada. Production Assistants represented by the DGC work in the Locations Department and work both on and off set with duties including locking up the set, traffic control, echoing rolls, firewatching, and liaising with the public and location owners. The Key-PA is in charge of all the PAs and is the 1st ADs' right-hand man when it comes to do with the on set aspects regarding a location. From this position DGC PA's can move up through the Locations Department or the Assistant Direction (AD) Department as either a Training Locations Manager (TAL) or a Training Assistant Director (TAD), respectively. Office Production Assistants work in the production office as an Office PA and they work for the Production Manager, Production Coordinator, Assistant Production Coordinator, and / or other office staff in maintaining the work-flow in the office. From this position, Office PAs can work their way up through the office by becoming an Assistant Production Coordinator (APOC), which is unionized under IATSE 891. Pay for PAs according to the DGC Collective Agreement in BC is $205.00 (non-members) to $215.00 (members) for a 15-hour day. An 8-hour day is approximately $118.00.\n\nIn Quebec, the Set PA is part of what is called the \"Unit Department\" or \"Régie\". Usually, there is a Unit Manager, Assistant Unit Manager, Set PA, Truck PA, Set Runner, and the \"dailies\" as needed for street blocking and extra set ups. In other states and provinces these duties are often taken care of by the AD Department, Locations or Transport. The Unit Manager and his/her team are the ones who deal with the daily logistics of shooting on location and/or in studio.\n\nThere are two film unions in Quebec: IATSE 514 and AQTIS: L’Alliance québécoise des techniciens de l’image et du son. In both cases the PA's are unionized.\n\nProduction assistants are also present in fields other than film and television, as publication businesses also have a need for PAs to regulate the production process of making professional written pieces such as articles, books, records or any other kind of production involving the preparation of written words.\n\nThe tasks taken on by a PA will depend on the type of educational and/or publishing company that employs them. If the assistant works at a textbook or publishing company, they may oversee the art and composition of written works. P.A.s at educational companies may also oversee work in proofreading departments, as well as for freelance copy editors and authors. When looking at documents and other materials uploaded by the author the production assistant has to make sure everything falls within the requirements of the company they work for. This includes items such as the format, correct file types, positioning, captions and obtaining copyright forms from authors.\n\nIf the assistant is part of a publications department for a scientific or professional organization, they have daily jobs that which involve keeping records that are important for their company. They may take care of editing, sending or reading information in databases or manuscripts. Production assistants may also team up with Information Technology workers to help streamline the tasks of the publications departments since it involves keeping track of large amounts of data and information. Working with an I.T. department to create a specific sorting program can improve the speed at which documents are proofed and organized.\n\nIn entertainment companies, production assignments may have to do technical work such as typesetting, printing and binding. They must also be good communicators and be good with deadlines. When working for magazines or newspapers, production assistants may need to keep track of things like individual teams and the cost of producing a physical product. Clients and stakeholders may be involved in a magazine, so P.A.'s have to be professional. There may also be journalists who are on deadlines or need extensions. There are also creative processes that a production assistant can be involved with. They can work with book designers or magazines to ensure a client's specifications are followed properly and may then have to send a copy of the draft for approval to clients. This can last until the final piece has been completed. When printing a piece of work, production assistants may deal with is how files are supposed to be submitted to printers, along with publication dates, and any printing or copy issues. Even after a final piece is complete, the PA may need to ask a client their thoughts on final product.\n\n"}
{"id": "68761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68761", "title": "Publishing", "text": "Publishing\n\nPublishing is the dissemination of literature, music, or information—the activity of making information available to the general public. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers, meaning originators and developers of content also provide media to deliver and display the content for the same. Also, the word publisher can refer to the individual who leads a publishing company or an imprint or to a person who owns/heads a magazine.\n\nTraditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as books (the \"book trade\") and newspapers. With the advent of digital information systems and the Internet, the scope of publishing has expanded to include electronic resources such as the electronic versions of books and periodicals, as well as micropublishing, websites, blogs, video game publishers, and the like.\n\nPublishing includes the following stages of development: acquisition, copy editing, production, printing (and its electronic equivalents), marketing and distribution.\n\nPublication is also important as a legal concept:\n\nThere are two basic business models in book publishing:\n\nPublishing became possible with the invention of writing, and became more practical upon the introduction of printing. Prior to printing, distributed works were copied manually, by scribes. Due to printing, publishing progressed hand-in-hand with the development of books.\n\nThe Chinese inventor Bi Sheng made movable type of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.\n\nEarly printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as incunables or \"incunabula\". \"A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.\"\n\nEventually, printing enabled other forms of publishing besides books. The history of modern newspaper publishing started in Germany in 1609, with publishing of magazines following in 1663.\n\nHistorically, publishing has been handled by publishers, with the history of self-publishing progressing slowly until the advent of computers brought us electronic publishing, which has been made evermore ubiquitous from the moment the world went online with the Internet. The establishment of the World Wide Web in 1989 soon propelled the website into a dominant medium of publishing, as websites are easily created by almost anyone with Internet access. The history of wikis started shortly thereafter, followed closely by the history of blogging. Commercial publishing also progressed, as previously printed forms developed into online forms of publishing, distributing online books, online newspapers, and online magazines.\n\nSince its start, the World Wide Web has been facilitating the technological convergence of commercial and self-published content, as well as the convergence of publishing and producing into online production through the development of multimedia content.\n\nBook and magazine publishers spend a lot of their time buying or commissioning copy; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire their staff to produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called stringers. At a small press, it is possible to survive by relying entirely on commissioned material. But as activity increases, the need for works may outstrip the publisher's established circle of writers.\n\nFor works written independently of the publisher, writers often first submit a query letter or proposal directly to a literary agent or to a publisher. Submissions sent directly to a publisher are referred to as unsolicited submissions, and the majority come from previously unpublished authors. If the publisher accepts unsolicited manuscripts, then the manuscript is placed in the slush pile, which publisher's readers sift through to identify manuscripts of sufficient quality or revenue potential to be referred to acquisitions editors for review. The acquisitions editors send their choices to the editorial staff. The time and number of people involved in the process are dependent on the size of the publishing company, with larger companies having more degrees of assessment between unsolicited submission and publication. Unsolicited submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some sources estimating that publishers ultimately choose about three out of every ten thousand unsolicited manuscripts they receive.\n\nMany book publishers around the world maintain a strict \"no unsolicited submissions\" policy and will only accept submissions via a literary agent. This policy shifts the burden of assessing and developing writers out of the publisher and onto the literary agents. At these publishers, unsolicited manuscripts are thrown out, or sometimes returned, if the author has provided pre-paid postage.\n\nEstablished authors may be represented by a literary agent to market their work to publishers and negotiate contracts. Literary agents take a percentage of author earnings (varying between 10 and 15 percent) to pay for their services.\n\nSome writers follow a non-standard route to publication. For example, this may include bloggers who have attracted large readerships producing a book based on their websites, books based on Internet memes, instant \"celebrities\" such as Joe the Plumber, retiring sports figures and in general anyone a publisher feels could produce a marketable book. Such books often employ the services of a ghostwriter.\n\nFor a submission to reach publication, it must be championed by an editor or publisher who must work to convince other staff of the need to publish a particular title. An editor who discovers or champions a book that subsequently becomes a best-seller may find their reputation enhanced as a result of their success.\n\nOnce a work is accepted, commissioning editors negotiate the purchase of intellectual property rights and agree on royalty rates.\n\nThe authors of traditional printed materials typically sell exclusive territorial intellectual property rights that match the list of countries in which distribution is proposed (i.e. the rights match the legal systems under which copyright protections can be enforced). In the case of books, the publisher and writer must also agree on the intended formats of publication —mass-market paperback, \"trade\" paperback and hardback are the most common options.\n\nThe situation is slightly more complex if electronic formatting is to be used. Where distribution is to be by CD-ROM or other physical media, there is no reason to treat this form differently from a paper format, and national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the European Union is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read French.\n\nHaving agreed on the scope of the publication and the formats, the parties in a book agreement must then agree on royalty rates, the percentage of the gross retail price that will be paid to the author, and the advance payment. The publisher must estimate the potential sales in each market and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties usually range between 10–12% of recommended retail price. An advance is usually 1/3 of the first print run total royalties. For example, if a book has a print run of 5000 copies and will be sold at $14.95 and the author is to receive 10% royalties, the total sum payable to the author if all copies are sold is $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000). The advance in this instance would roughly be $2490. Advances vary greatly between books, with established authors commanding larger advances.\n\nAlthough listed as distinct stages, parts of these occur concurrently. As editing of text progresses, front cover design and initial layout takes place, and sales and marketing of the book begins.\n\nA decision is taken to publish a work, and the technical legal issues resolved, the author may be asked to improve the quality of the work through rewriting or smaller changes and the staff will edit the work. Publishers may maintain a house style, and staff will copy edit to ensure that the work matches the style and grammatical requirements of each market. Editors often choose or refine titles and headlines. Editing may also involve structural changes and requests for more information. Some publishers employ fact checkers, particularly regarding non-fiction works.\n\nWhen a final text is agreed upon, the next phase is design. This may include artwork being commissioned or confirmation of layout. In publishing, the word \"art\" also indicates photographs. Depending on the number of photographs required by the work, photographs may also be licensed from photo libraries. For those works that are particularly rich in illustrations, the publisher may contract a picture researcher to find and license the photographs required for the work. The design process prepares the work for printing through processes such as typesetting, dust jacket composition, specification of paper quality, binding method and casing.\n\nThe type of book being produced determines the amount of design required. For standard fiction titles, the design is usually restricted to typography and cover design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters begin and end, colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters, catalogue images, and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration of the reader experience.\n\nThe activities of typesetting, page layout, the production of negatives, plates from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine legend and Imprint are now all computerized. Prepress computerization evolved mainly in about the last twenty years of the 20th century. If the work is to be distributed electronically, the final files are saved in formats appropriate to the target operating systems of the hardware used for reading. These may include PDF files.\n\nThe sales and marketing stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced, or chapters are edited, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting of the book and the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.\n\nAfter the end of editing and design work, the printing phase begins. The first step involves the production of a pre-press proof, which the printers send for final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book precisely as it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity for the publisher to find and correct any errors. Some printing companies use electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once the publisher has approved the proofs, printing – the physical production of the printed work – begins.\n\nRecently new printing process have emerged, such as printing on demand (POD) and web-to-print. The book is written, edited, and designed as usual, but it is not printed until the publisher receives an order for the book from a customer. This procedure ensures low costs for storage and reduces the likelihood of printing more books than will be sold. Web-to-print enables a more streamlined way of connecting customers to printing through an online medium.\n\nIn the case of books, binding follows upon the printing process. It involves folding the printed sheets, \"securing them together, affixing boards or sides to it, and covering the whole with leather or other materials\".\n\nThe final stage in publication involves making the product available to the public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors frequently also acted as their own editor, printer, and bookseller, but these functions have become separated. Once a book, newspaper, or another publication is printed, the publisher may use a variety of channels to distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through booksellers and through other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance directly by the publisher to subscribers, and then distributed either through the postal system or by newspaper carriers. Periodicals are also frequently sold through newsagents and vending machines.\n\nWithin the book industry, printers often fly some copies of the finished book to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea freight. Accordingly, the delay between the approval of the pre-press proof and the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, can take some months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for children's films), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.\n\nDerided in the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" as \"a purely commercial affair\" that cared more about profits than about literary quality, publishing is fundamentally a business, with a need for the expenses of creating, producing, and distributing a book or other publication not to exceed the income derived from its sale. Publishing is now a major industry with the largest companies Reed Elsevier and Pearson PLC having global publishing operations.\n\nThe publisher usually controls the advertising and other marketing tasks, but may subcontract various aspects of the process to specialist publisher marketing agencies. In many companies, editing, proofreading, layout, design, and other aspects of the production process are done by freelancers.\n\nDedicated in-house salespeople are sometimes replaced by companies who specialize in sales to bookshops, wholesalers, and chain stores for a fee. This trend is accelerating as retail book chains and supermarkets have centralized their buying.\n\nIf the entire process up to the stage of printing is handled by an outside company or individuals, and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as \"book packaging\". This is a common strategy between smaller publishers in different territorial markets where the company that first buys the intellectual property rights then sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity efficiency on the print run for all.\n\nSome businesses maximize their profit margins through vertical integration; book publishing is not one of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a distributor who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.\n\nThe advent of the Internet has provided the electronic way of book distribution without the need of physical printing, physical delivery and storage of books. This, therefore, poses an interesting question that challenges publishers, distributors, and retailers. The question pertains to the role and importance the publishing houses have in the overall publishing process. It is a common practice that the author, the original creator of the work, signs the contract awarding him or her only around 10% of the proceeds of the book. Such contract leaves 90% of the book proceeds to the publishing houses, distribution companies, marketers, and retailers. One example (rearranged) of the distribution of proceeds from the sale of a book was given as follows:\n\nThere is a common misconception that publishing houses make large profits and that authors are the lowest paid in the publishing chain. However, most publishers make little profit from individual titles, with 75% of books not breaking even. Approximately 80% of the cost of a book is taken up by the expenses of preparing, distributing, and printing (with printing being one of the lowest costs of all). On successful titles, publishing companies will usually make around 10% profit, with the author(s) receiving 8–15% of the retail price. However, given that authors are usually individuals, are often paid advances irrespective of whether the book turns a profit and do not normally have to split profits with others, it makes them the highest paid individuals in the publishing process.\n\nWithin the electronic book path, the publishing house's role remains almost identical. The process of preparing a book for e-book publication is exactly the same as print publication, with only minor variations in the process to account for the different mediums of publishing. While some costs, such as the discount given to retailers (normally around 45%) are eliminated, additional costs connected to ebooks apply (especially in the conversion process), raising the production costs to a similar level.\n\nPrint on demand is rapidly becoming an established alternative to traditional publishing. In 2005, Amazon.com announced its purchase of Booksurge and selfsanepublishing, a major \"print on demand\" operation. CreateSpace is the Amazon subsidiary that facilitates publishing by small presses and individual authors. Books published via CreateSpace are sold on Amazon and other outlets, with Amazon extracting a very high percentage of the sales proceeds for the services of publishing. printing and distributing. One of the largest bookseller chains, Barnes & Noble, already runs its successful imprint with both new titles and classics — hardback editions of out-of-print former best sellers. Similarly, Ingram Industries, the parent company of Ingram Book Group (a leading US book wholesaler), now includes its print-on-demand division called Lightning Source. In 2013, Ingram launched a small press and self-publishing arm called Ingram Spark. Payment terms are much closer to those of Amazon and less favorable than those they offer to more established publishers via Lightning Source. Among publishers, Simon & Schuster recently announced that it will start selling its backlist titles directly to consumers through its website.\n\nBook clubs are almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche publishers pursue a mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets — their output is insignificant to the major booksellers, so lost revenue poses no threat to the traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing, publishing, distribution, and retail.\n\nNewspapers are regularly scheduled publications that present recent news, typically on a type of inexpensive paper called newsprint. Most newspapers are primarily sold to subscribers, through retail newsstands or are distributed as advertising-supported free newspapers. About one-third of publishers in the United States are newspaper publishers.\n\nNominally, periodical publishing involves publications that appear in a new edition on a regular schedule. Newspapers and magazines are both periodicals, but within the industry, the periodical publishing is frequently considered a separate branch that includes magazines and even academic journals, but not newspapers. About one-third of publishers in the United States publish periodicals (not including newspapers).\n\nThe global book publishing industry accounts for over $100 billion of annual revenue, or about 15% of the total media industry.\n\nBook publishers represent less than a sixth of the publishers in the United States. Most books are published by a small number of very large book publishers, but thousands of smaller book publishers exist. Many small- and medium-sized book publishers specialize in a specific area. Additionally, thousands of authors have created publishing companies and self-published their own works.\n\nWithin the book publishing, the publisher of record for a book is the entity in whose name the book's ISBN is registered. The publisher of record may or may not be the actual publisher.\n\nApproximately 60% of English-language books are produced through the \"Big Five\" publishing houses: Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan. (See also: List of English-language book publishing companies.)\n\nDirectory publishing is a specialized genre within the publishing industry. These publishers produce mailing lists, telephone books, and other types of directories. With the advent of the Internet, many of these directories are now online.\n\nAcademic publishers are typically either book or periodical publishers that have specialized in academic subjects. Some, like university presses, are owned by scholarly institutions. Others are commercial businesses that focus on academic subjects.\n\nThe development of the printing press represented a revolution for communicating the latest hypotheses and research results to the academic community and supplemented what a scholar could do personally. But this improvement in the efficiency of communication created a challenge for libraries, which have had to accommodate the weight and volume of literature.\n\nOne of the key functions that academic publishers provide is to manage the process of peer review. Their role is to facilitate the impartial assessment of research and this vital role is not one that has yet been usurped, even with the advent of social networking and online document sharing.\n\nToday, publishing academic journals and textbooks is a large part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is non-profit publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a university press, or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is open access, the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are BioMed Central and the Public Library of Science (PLoS). Many commercial publishers are experimenting with hybrid models where certain articles or government funded articles are made free due to authors' payment of processing charges, and other articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.\n\nTechnically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games, computer hardware and mobile telephony publish information to their audiences. Indeed, the marketing of a major film often includes a novelization, a graphic novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless promotional publications.\n\nSome of the major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single franchise, e.g. Ballantine Del Rey Lucasbooks has the exclusive rights to \"Star Wars\" in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The game industry self-publishes through BL Publishing/Black Library (Warhammer) and Wizards of the Coast (Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, etc.). The BBC has its publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as Doctor Who. These multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively and sales frequently outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of corporate interest.\n\nWriters in a specialized field or with a narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market in the form of small presses and self-publishing. More recently, these options include print on demand and ebook format. These publishing alternatives provide an avenue for authors who believe that mainstream publishing will not meet their needs or who are in a position to make more money from direct sales than they could from bookstore sales, such as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.\n\nThe 21st century has brought some new technological changes to the publishing industry. These changes include e-books, print on demand, and accessible publishing. E-books have been quickly growing in availability in major publishing markets such as the USA and the UK since 2005. Google, Amazon.com, and Sony have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries to digitize books. As of early 2011, Amazon's Kindle reading device is a significant force in the market, along with the Apple iPad and the Nook from Barnes & Noble. Along with the growing popularity of e-books, some companies like Oyster and Scribd have pursued the subscription model, providing members unlimited access to a content library on a variety of digital reading devices.\n\nThe ability to quickly and cost-effectively print on demand has meant that publishers no longer have to store books at warehouses, if the book is in low or unknown demand. This is a huge advantage to small publishers who can now operate without large overheads and large publishers who can now cost-effectively sell their backlisted items.\n\nAccessible publishing uses the digitization of books to mark up books into XML and then produces multiple formats from this to sell to consumers, often targeting those with difficulty reading. Formats include a variety larger print sizes, specialized print formats for dyslexia, eye tracking problems and macular degeneration, as well as Braille, DAISY, audiobooks and e-books.\n\nGreen publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimise environmental impact. One example of this is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time basis.\n\nA further development is the growth of on-line publishing where no physical books are produced. The ebook is created by the author and uploaded to a website from where it can be downloaded and read by anyone.\n\nAn increasing number of authors are using niche marketing online to sell more books by engaging with their readers online. These authors can use free services such as Smashwords or Amazon's CreateSpace to have their book available for worldwide sale. There is an obvious attraction for first time authors who have been repeatedly rejected by the existing agent/publisher model to explore this opportunity. However, a consequence of this change in the mechanics of book distribution is that there is now no mandatory check on author skill or even their ability to spell, and any person with an internet connection can publish whatever they choose, regardless of the literary merit or even basic readability of their writing.\n\nRefer to the ISO divisions of ICS 01.140.40 and 35.240.30 for further information.\n\nPublication is the distribution of copies or content to the public. The Berne Convention requires that this can only be done with the consent of the copyright holder, which is initially always the author. In the Universal Copyright Convention, \"publication\" is defined in article VI as \"the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived.\"\n\nIn providing a work to the general public, the publisher takes responsibility for the publication in a way that a mere printer or a shopkeeper does not. For example, publishers may face charges of defamation, if they produce and distribute libelous material to the public, even if the libel was written by another person.\n\nPrivishing (\"priv\"ate publ\"ishing\") is a modern term for publishing a book in such a small amount, or with such lack of marketing, advertising or sales support from the publisher, that the book effectively does not reach the public. The book, while nominally published, is almost impossible to obtain through normal channels such as bookshops, often cannot be special-ordered and will have a notable lack of support from its publisher, including refusals to reprint the title. A book that is privished may be referred to as \"killed\". Depending on the motivation, privishing may constitute breach of contract, censorship, or good business practice (e.g., not printing more books than the publisher believes will sell in a reasonable length of time).\nGeneral:\n\nPublishing on specific contexts:\nPublishing tools:\n\n"}

{"id": "26253831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26253831", "title": "Rodolphe Salis", "text": "Rodolphe Salis\n\nLouis Rodolphe Salis ( – ) was the creator, host and owner of the Le Chat Noir (\"The Black Cat\") cabaret (known briefly in 1881 at its beginning as \"Cabaret Artistique.\") With this establishment Salis is remembered as the creator of the modern cabaret: a nightclub where the patrons could sit at tables with alcoholic drinks and enjoy variety acts on a stage, introduced by a master of ceremonies who interacted with the audience.\n\nThe son of a distiller in Châtellerault, Salis came to Paris in 1872, after leaving the regiment in which he had undertaken military service. He moved into the Hotel de Rome on Rue de Seine, in the Latin Quarter.\n\nHe founded \"L'école vibrante\" (The Vibrant School), soon renamed the \"L'école iriso-subversive de Chicago\" (The Chicago Iriso-Subversive School) in order to draw attention to his artistic group. In fact he was earning a living by making stations of the cross and other religious objects, that he and his friends painted.\n\n\"In fact, it [The School] had the overall intended, but not admitted, immediate aim of making a series of Stations of the Cross to sell at eight and fourteen francs each, in a shop selling religious articles in the Saint Sulpice. The very tedious work was divided between the four \"students\" according to their different natures. Rene Gilbert painted heads; Wagner hands; Antonio de La Gandara draperies; Salis, finally, backgrounds and landscapes ...\"\n\nIn order to combine art and alcoholic beverage, Salis had the idea of creating a café in \"the purest style of Louis XII ... with a chandelier of wrought iron from the Byzantine period, and where the gentry, the burghers and peasants are now invited to drink absinthe after the usual manner of Victor Hugo and Garibaldi, and hypocras in golden bowls. In reality, the first tavern called The Black Cat (Le Chat Noir), opened in November 1881 in a two-room building at 84 Boulevard Rochechouart (a site now commemorated by a plaque), began by serving bad wine and with a rather inferior decor. But from the first, at the door, guests were greeted by a Swiss guard, splendidly bedecked and covered with gold from head to foot, supposedly responsible for bringing in the painters and poets who arrived, while barring the \"infamous priests and the military.\" Salis' tongue-in-cheek admirational piece was on a high marble fireplace: \"The skull of Louis XIII as a child\".\n\nThe first site's success was assured with the wholesale arrival of a group of radical young writers and artists called \"Les Hydropathes\" (“those who are afraid of water”), led by the journalist Emile Goudeau. The group claimed to be averse to water, preferring wine and beer. Goudeau’s club first met in his house on the Rive Gauche (left bank), but had become so popular that it outgrew its meeting place. Salis, on meeting Goudeau, convinced him to transfer the club across the river Seine to 84 Boulevard Rochechouart.\nLe Chat Noir also soon outgrew its first site. On 10 June 1885, with great fanfare, Salis moved to new premises located 12 Rue Victor-Masse (which before 1885 had been Rue de Laval 12). Very quickly, poets and singers who performed at The Black Cat found the best practice for their craft to be had in Paris. Le Chat Noir eventually closed down in 1896. (After the death of Salis, a third Le Chat Noir was opened at 68, Boulevard de Clichy in 1907.)\n\nSalis acted as impresario and (along with cabaret singer Aristide Bruant) as emcee, MC, or \"conférencier\". The greetings from Salis rang out often at the expense of customers. Those who left early were insulted, and those who arrived late were banished to a corner. Salis would arrest a customer with a \"Well, you're finally out of prison?\" or comment \"What have you done with your chick from yesterday?\" to a new client obviously accompanied by his wife. One evening, the future King Edward VII was addressed by Salis: \"Well, look here: it looks like the Prince of Wales all pissed!\"\n\nEvery Friday, luncheon was an opportunity to prepare for performances and the editing of a humorous magazine. With legendary stinginess, Salis found every excuse for not paying his staff, suppliers and artists. With some success he even asked to be paid by those whom he hosted at The Black Cat. But his patter to the guests and his organizational skills and personality attracted exceptional artists of all kinds, and a large crowd. The combination of a bar with entertainment (now the standard cabaret theme), was novel. In addition, Salis had the idea of playing music in his tavern by installing a piano, at that time an innovation which was soon banned for newer establishments, and which thereafter allowed him to gain an advantage over the competition.\n\n\"Male, square-shouldered, red hair dyed vermilion,\" Salis was described by Lawrence Tailhade, \"ageless, though stout, his face channelled by many wrinkles, his chest in a romantic doublet whose floral satin contrasted with the sobriety of a dark coat. Intact, his tawny hair was consistent with his coppery beard and gave him the air of a Flemish trooper ... [He had] a bronze baritone, emphatic, biting and sarcastic, whose thunders cynically put down the Philistines ... [He had] a prodigiously charlatan nature.\"\n\nIn the 1890s, Salis took his The Black Cat entertainment company touring through France, hiring theatres and venues, a practice that was not current at that time. He often refused, under various pretexts, to pay the venue hire charge.\n\nHe died in Naintré in 1897.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1234897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1234897", "title": "Ryūkōka", "text": "Ryūkōka\n\nMany composers and singers of \"ryūkōka\" went on to earn official distinctions; Ichiro Fujiyama and composers Masao Koga and Ryoichi Hattori received the People's Honour Award in later years.\n\nAlthough \"enka\" branched off from \"ryūkōka\", many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, Noriko Awaya said \"Whenever I hear \"enka\", I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting.\"\n\nIn 1914, Sumako Matsui's song \"Katyusha's song\", composed by Shinpei Nakayama, was used as a theme of the rendition \"Resurrection\" in Japan. The record of the song sold 20,000 copies. One theory holds that this was the first \"ryūkōka\" song, which was made by Hogetsu Shimamura's order: \"the tune between Japanese popular folk music and Western music\". However, street performers called had been popular until record labels such as the Victor Company of Japan began to produce songs in the early Shōwa period.\n\nAlthough Matsui committed suicide after Shimamura's death, Nakayama continued to develop his music. During his career, he composed about 3,000 songs such as the 1921 song \"Teru teru bozu\". Nakayama transferred Japanese traditional music to staff-style by main force. His 1921 song was later covered by various singers, but was at first best known for being covered by violin enka-shi featuring Orchestra. The pentatonic scale used in this song was \"Minor scale without forth and seventh degree\". However, the music based on the scale had difficult in presenting chord and harmony because traditional Japanese music didn't adopt equal temperament.\n\nNakayama's songs were based on Japanese folk music called \"min'yō\", but also adopted Western musical style. Therefore, his music was called .\n\nIn the early Showa period, the microphone was introduced into the popular music of Japan. Teiichi Futamura released his cover version of in 1928. The song was originally composed by Fred Fisher. Chiyako Sato's 1928 song , composed by Nakayama, sold 100,000 copies. The song was also sung by singer Yoshie Fujiwara. Chiyako Sato's 1929 song \"Tokyo March\" sold more than 300,000 copies.\n\nSome of the country's first major stars were singer Ichiro Fujiyama and composer Masao Koga. Koga attempted to initiate fusion of Western jazz and Japanese dodoitsu. Fujiyama's 1931 song , composed by Koga, became a major hit in Japan. This song created a fusion of Fujiyama's crooning and Koga's guitar play. Using the vocal technic \"Mezza Voce\" with a microphone, Fujiyama sang the song by the deep voice of not Opera's G minor but D minor. Fujiyama's song sold 600,000 copies. However, Fujiyama was an elite student, who specialized Western classical music in the Tokyo Music School. \"Ryūkōka\" songs often dealt with the \"Ero Guro Nansensu\" things. Since his school regarded \"ryūkōka\" as bad form at that time, Fujiyama was once suspended from the school, though Fujiyama was not dismissed from the school because Klaus Pringsheim, Sr., a professor of the school, opposed the proposal of Fujiyama's expulsion.\n\nThis period also saw the popularity of \"geisha\" singers such as Ichimaru and Katsutaro Kouta. Katsutaro became famous when Fujiyama was turned out of \"ryūkōka\". Her song sold 600,000 copies. Katsutaro and Issei Mishima recorded duet song \"Tokyo Ondo\". The song was composed by Shinpei Nakayama and was released in 1933. The single \"Tokyo Ondo\" sold 1,200,000 copies.\n\nWhen Fujiyama sang Western classic lied songs, those songs were called \"kayōkyoku\", but the term \"kayōkyoku\" went on to be used as another name of \"ryūkōka\" in NHK. At first, Koga was a good co-worker for Fujiyama but they moved apart from each other because Koga sought \"Japanese\" music. On the other hand, Yoshie Fujiwara drew a clear line between him and \"ryūkōka\" and established the Fujiwara Opera in 1934, launching the establishment of Japanese Opera. Baritone singer Taro Shoji's 1934 song also became popular, though he did not know Kunisada Chūji, the theme of the song.\n\nSoprano singer Noriko Awaya also sang \"ryūkōka\", but the Toyo Music School once annulled her graduation. However, her song became a hit in 1937. The song was composed by jazz composer Ryoichi Hattori. She was called \"Queen of Blues\", though term \"blues\" was just a song title.\n\nIn 1936, NHK started radio program to compete with \"ryūkōka\", which was under the influence of \"Ero Guro Nansensu\", but it soon began to air war songs around July 1937. The program was renamed to in 1941 and then in 1942. The songs during the war were called . During the war, many musicians were forced to write war songs. Yuji Koseki composed many war songs and was later criticised as a war collaborator, though he seemed to be touched with remorse. Koseki composed released in 1937. Although the song was a B-side song, it sold 600,000 copies. The 1937 song sold 1,000,000 copies. However, Japanese jazz musicians such as Ryoichi Hattori seemed to be vigorless to compose war songs. His son Katsuhisa Hattori claimed that he was not an antinationalist and he technically were hardly not able to compose war songs even if they wanted to make those because Japanese war songs were musically \"enka\".\nOn the other hand, former enka-shi Haruo Oka's debut song was released in 1939. Yoshio Tabata also mede his debut with song in 1939. \"Rōkyoku\" (\"naniwa-bushi\") was used for enhancing the national prestige.\nAlthough many war songs were made after the beginning of the Pacific War, , sung by Noboru Kirishima and Akiko Futaba, became popular as a lyrical song. When the war was nearing an end, the theme included frightful spectacles such as the Battle of Attu, Guadalcanal Campaign and Marshall Islands Campaign. Oka went to Ambon Island, but fell ill and soon returned to Japan. Bin Uehara, who used \"kobushi\" of \"naniwa-bushi\" for singing, was killed in the New Guinea campaign and Fujiyama was taken prisoner in Indonesia.\nAfter the war, the songs during the war have been regarded as a taboo even in Japan despite those historical importance. One of war songs, , composed by Isao Hayashi, went on to become a theme of Japanese right-wing groups called \"uyoku dantai\". Li Xianglan's \"Suzhou Nocturne\", composed by Hattori, has remained controversial in China, though it was a non-propaganda song. After the war, Taro Shoji, who heard the Gyokuon-hōsō in Nagano Prefecture, was once banned from singing many of his songs because those were regarded as nationalistic. \"Rōkyoku\" faded into the wallpaper with the spread of television in the postwar period. In 1946, NHK revived their music program as \"Radio Kayō\" and it was later reformed as \"Minna no Uta\", but NHK was disinclined to mention its former history.\n\nMichiko Namiki's song sung by Michiko Namiki and Noboru Kirishima, airing in 1945 movie \"Soyokaze\", became popular. Haruo Oka also released hit songs such as his 1946 song and his 1948 song . Ichiro Fujiyama, who was falsely reported to have been killed in battle, returned to Japan in 1946.\nRyoichi Hattori, who moved to Shanghai in 1944, contributed to advancing Japanese \"poppusu\" music after the war. Shizuko Kasagi's 1947 song \"Tokyo Boogie-Woogie\", composed by Hattori, became popular. Hattori also composed Ichimaru's 1949 song \"Shamisen Boogie-Woogie\". Around that time, Hibari Misora became known as an impersonator of Kasagi. She made her debut with song \"Kappa Boogie-Woogie\" in 1949. Hattori's composed song , which was sung by Ichiro Fujiyama and Mitsue Nara, became a major hit in the early post-war years in Japan.\n\nYuji Koseki composed and . \"Nagasaki no Kane\", based on Takashi Nagai's book \"The Bells of Nagasaki\", was sung by Fujiyama in 1949. Fujiyama became the final singer of all singers at the 1st Kōhaku Uta Gassen with \"Nagasaki no Kane\" in 1951. Chiemi Eri debuted in 1952 and Izumi Yukimura debuted in 1953. Fujiyama moved to NHK in 1954 and returned to his original style―classical music. He went on to become a conductor for \"Hotaru no Hikari\" at the Kōhaku Uta Gassen.\n\nNew singers such as Hibari Misora, Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Chiyoko Shimakura became popular when old singers became unpopular. The period between around 1955 and 1964 saw the popularity of \"kayōkyoku\". Around that time, Japanese composers went on to establish their own genres such as Toru Funamura and Minoru Endo's \"Enka\", Tadashi Yoshida's \"Mood Kayō\", and Hachidai Nakamura and Hiroshi Miyagawa's \"Jazz\". Masao Koga renounced his pre-war musical style, approaching Hibari Misora.\n\nThe song \"Otomisan\" was made for being sung by Haruo Oka, but was eventually sung by Hachiro Kasuga and became a major hit in Japan in 1954. The single sold over one million copies. The song was composed by Masanobu Tokuchi, who came from the Ryukyu Islands. Kasuga's 1955 song \"Wakare no Ipponsugi\", composed by Funamura, also became a hit song. Funamura also composed Michiya Mihashi's 1955 song \"Anoko Ga Naiteru Hatoba\". \"Ryōkyōku\" singers such as Haruo Minami and Hideo Murata joined Japanese popular music. Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Hideo Murata went on to form their genre later called \"enka\".\nFrank Nagai's 1957 song \"Yūrakuchō de Aimashō\", composed by Yoshida, also became popular. Around that time, however, Japanese rock and roll movement began and the Nichigeki Western Carnival was opened in 1958. The concerts were taken part in by future popular singers such as Mickey Curtis and Kyu Sakamoto. Against Japanese rock and roll movement, Yukio Hashi shocked Japanese popular music as a young \"enka\" singer because singers of the genre were elderly singers such as Hachiro Kasuga and Michiya Mihashi.\n\nJapanese singers such as Kyu Sakamoto, The Peanuts and Mieko Hirota covered American songs at first, but they began to sing their own song. Sakamoto's 1961 single \"Ue o muite arukō\", composed by Nakamura, became a major hit in Japan. On the other hand, Hideo Murata's 1961 single , composed by Toru Funamura, sold over one million copies in Japan. On June 5, 1962, Saburō Kitajima made his debut with the single \"Bungacha Bushi.\" Funamura composed Kitajima's 1962 hit song . Hiroshi Miyagawa composed The Peanuts' 1962 song \"Furimukanaide.\" The Peanuts also sang \"Mothra's Song\". The song was composed by Yuji Koseki.\n\nIn 1963, the era of former popular singers such as Hibari Misora, Chiemi Eri, Izumi Yukimura, Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Frank Nagai seemed to end and Sakamoto released a Japanese hit song titled \"Miagete Goran Yoru no Hoshi o\". In June 1963, Sakamoto's \"Ue o muite arukō\" reached the number-one position in the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 under its alternative title \"Sukiyaki\". In 1963, Kitajima's song and Kazuo Funaki's song also became popular. Both songs were composed by Minoru Endo. Hashi and Funaki became singers for youth music, making a new genre called .\n\nOn September 6, 1963, record label Nippon Crown became independent from the Nippon Columbia. Saburō Kitajima was its member. Hibari Misora presented a song titled \"Kanto Harusame Kasa\" when the record label was established. Kitajima took part in the Kōhaku Uta Gassen for the first time on December 31, 1963. The audience share of the 14th Kōhaku Uta Gassen reached 81.4% in 1963. In 1964, Haruo Minami released his cover version of song , composed by Masao Koga. In 1965, Kitajima released a string of hits such as , and . \"Kaerokana\" was composed by Hachidai Nakamura. Koga composed Hibari's song \"Yawara\", which won the grand prix award at the Japan Record Award in 1965. Koga was also an original composer of Hibari's 1966 cover song . His music, called \"Koga melody\", became a base of modern \"enka\" and he became known as \"the father of modern \"enka\"\".\n\nOn the other hand, Hachidai Nakamura also composed the Johnnys' 1964 debut single \"Wakai Namida.\" Japanese guitarist Yūzō Kayama also produced his 1965 hit song \"Kimi to Itsumademo\" as a singer. British rock band The Beatles visited Japan and had a concert at the Nippon Budokan in 1966. With the aim of breaking the traditional style, Group Sounds band The Blue Comets' 1966 song , originally released as an English song, was released as a Japanese song. In 1966, folk singer Ryoko Moriyama, a daughter of jazz musician Hisashi Moriyama, also released hit song . The Blue Comets' song \"Blue Chateau\" won the grand prix award at the Japan Record Award in 1967. The Folk Crusaders' 1967 song \"I Only Live Twice\" also had a big impact on Japanese popular music. New musical movement called also a string of hits such as Ayumi Ishida's 1968 song \"Blue Light Yokohama\", composed by Kyohei Tsutsumi.\n\nGroup Sounds became unpopular in the late 1960s in Japan. Then, Group Sounds was displaced by \"New Rock\" in Japanese underground rock music around 1970. Japanese-language rock band Happy End became one of prototypes of modern J-pop. Mickey Curtis formed rock band \"Samurai\" in 1969 in U.K. and later scouted the Japanese band \"Carol\" in which leader was Eikichi Yazawa.\n\nA part of Ryoichi Hattori's Western-style music during that period remained in Western-style classical music of Japan and was transvalued in 2000s. His tribute album was released on October 17, 2007. Various musicians such as Hideaki Tokunaga (for \"Wakare no Blues\"), Kazumasa Oda (for \"Suzhou Nocturne\"), Masaharu Fukuyama (for \"Tokyo Boogie-woogie\") and Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra (for \"Aoi Sanmyaku\") took part in the album. The tribute album debuted at the number-ten position on the Japanese Oricon weekly album charts.\n\n"}

India has recently hosted the 2017 FIBA Women's Asia Cup, the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, the 2017 ISSF World Cup and will host the 2018 Men's Hockey World Cup. \nIndia has some premier domestic leagues in different sports which are very popular in the country. Indian Premier League (IPL) is a premier Twenty20 & the most popular cricket league in the world held every year since 2008. The I-League and Indian Super League are premier football league tournaments held since 2007 and 2014 respectively, the Pro Kabaddi league is the most popular indigenous league in the country held since 2014, the Hockey India League is the premier hockey league held since 2013, the Premier Badminton League is the badminton premier league held since 2013, the Pro Wrestling League premier Wrestling league held since 2015 and Ultimate Table Tennis league held since 2017.\n\nMajor international sporting events annually held in India include the Chennai Open in tennis, the Indian Masters in golf, \nthe India Open since 2008 and Royal Indian Open since 2001 in badminton. From 2011 to 2013, India hosted the Indian Grand Prix Formula 1 race at the Buddh International Circuit, Greater Noida.\n\nThe National Games of India is a national domestic sports event which has been held in the country since 1924 and for developing multi-sports culture in India Khelo India School Games, an event for under-17 school kids, had been started from 2018 as its first edition.\n\nThe geography of sports in India dates back to the Vedic era. Physical culture in ancient India was fuelled by religious rights. The mantra in the Atharvaveda, says, \"Duty is in my right hand and the fruits of victory in my left.\" In terms of an ideal, these words hold the same sentiments as the traditional Olympic Oath: \"For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport.\" Badminton probably originated in India as a grownup's version of a very old children's game known in England as battledore and shuttlecock, the battledore being a paddle and the shuttlecock a small feathered cork, now usually called a \"bird.\" Games like chess (chaturanga), Snooker snakes and ladders, playing cards, originated in India, and it was from here that these games were transmitted to foreign countries, where they were further modernised.\n\nIndia hosted the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1951 and 1982. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports was initially set up as the Department of Sports in 1982 at the time of organisation of the IX Asian Games in New Delhi. Its name was changed to the Department of Youth Affairs & Sports during celebration of the International Youth Year in 1985. India has also hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events, including the 1987 and 1996 Cricket World Cup, the 2003 Afro-Asian Games, the 2010 Hockey World Cup, and the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Major international sporting events annually held in India include the Chennai Open, Mumbai Marathon, Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The country co-hosted the 1987, 1996, 2011 Cricket World Cup and the first Indian Grand Prix in 2011.\n\nPolitical responsibility for sport in India is with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, which is headed by a cabinet minister and managed by National Sport Federations. The only major exception is the BCCI which is the administrative body of Cricket, is not a NSF. Presently there are more than 70 recognised national sports federations (NSF), of which 38 have politicians at the helm.\n\nSports Authority of India, the field arm of the Ministry, supports and nurtures talent in youth, and provides them with requisite infrastructure, equipment, coaching facilities and competition exposure. Dorabji Tata, with the support of Dr. A.G. Noehren, then director of YMCA, established the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) in 1927. IOA is responsible for the Indian continent's participation in the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games (outdoor, indoor and beach), and South Asian Games. Each Olympic and non-Olympic sport has a federation at the national level.\n\nThe selection of the national teams is done by the respective national federations and then recommend to IOA for official sponsorship for participation in the games conducted under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee, Olympic Council of Asia, Commonwealth Games Federation, and SAG. A special feature of the Indian Olympic Association is that the National Federations and the State Olympic Associations are affiliated with and recognised by it. The main task of the State Olympic Associations is to promote the Olympic sport and to ensure co-ordination among the State Sports Associations. In 2010–11, the total budget for sports and physical education schemes is . Hockey, in which India has an impressive record with eight Olympic gold medals, is said to be the national sport. The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and the Arjuna Award are India's highest awards for achievement in sports, while the Dronacharya Award is awarded for excellence in coaching.\n\nIndia has been criticised for neglecting women in sports, as depicted in the film \"Chak De! India\", where women's sports associations are under-sponsored and out of funds.\n\nFollowing is a list of international sports events held in India:\n\nA single athlete, Norman Pritchard, represented India in the 1900 Olympics, winning two silver medals. India sent its first national team to the Olympics in 1920, and has participated in every Summer Olympic Games ever since. India has also competed at several Winter Olympic Games since 1964.\n\nIndia has won a total of 26 Olympic medals. India won its first gold medal in men's field hockey in the 1928 Olympic Games. Abhinav Bindra became the first Indian to win an individual gold medal at the Olympic Games, and India's first gold medal since 1980, when the men's field hockey team won the gold.\n\nIndia has won very few Olympic medals, despite a population exceeding one billion, around half of them under the age of 25. Numerous explanations have been offered for the dearth, including poverty, malnutrition, neglected infrastructure, the lack of sponsorship, the theft of money and equipment, political corruption, institutional disorganisation, social immobility, the predominance of cricket, and other cultural factors.\n\nAccording to several informal statistics, India is the country with the lowest number of total Olympic medals per capita (out of those countries which have won at least one medal). In the Winter Olympic Games, India has seen four consecutive representations–Nagano (Japan, 1998), Salt Lake City (Utah, USA, 2002), Turin (Italy, 2006), and Vancouver (British Columbia, Canada, 2010). Shiva Keshavan, Asian Champion in luge represented India in all four winter games.\n\nIndia has competed in fourteen of the eighteen previous Commonwealth Games; starting at the second Games in 1934 hosted the games one time. India hosted the Games in 2010, at Delhi. India is the fourth most successful country with a total of 436 medals including 156 gold medals.\n\nIndia hosted the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982 at New Delhi. India is the 4th most successful country winning 602 medals including 139 gold. India has won the gold medal in Kabbadi ever since its inception except in 2018.\n\nThe National Games of India is a sporting event held in India. It comprises various disciplines in which sportsmen from the different states of India participate against each other. The country's first few Olympic Games, now christened as National Games.\n\nShooting is an important Olympic sport in India. Of India's 26 Olympic medals, 4 have come from Shooting including a Gold by Abhinav Bindra in the 2008 Olympics. Indian shooters who have excelled at the world stage include Abhinav Bindra, Jitu Rai, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Vijay Kumar, Gagan Narang, Apurvi Chandela, Ronjan Sodhi and Anjali Bhagwat.\n\nThe Indian shooting contingent for the 2012 London was one of the largest to date. There were a total of 11 shooters including 4 female shooters. India's first medal in the 2012 Olympics was when Gagan Narang won the bronze in the 10m Air Rifle event. This was the same event in which Abhinav Bindra won India's first individual gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics Beijing. The second medal came from the unheralded army man Vijay Kumar when he won the silver in the 25m rapid fire pistol event after finishing 4th in the qualification rounds. He had to fend off some tough competition from the third-placed Chinese Ding Feng.\n\nA notable performance was made by Joydeep Karmakar who finished 4th in the 50m rifle prone event. A strong medal prospect Ronjan Sodhi who is an Asian Games gold medallist, however, crashed out in the qualification rounds of the Double trap event.\n\nField Hockey is a popular sport in India. Until the mid-1970s, India men's team dominated international field hockey, winning 7 Olympic gold medals and won the 1975 Men's Hockey World Cup. Since then, barring a gold medal at the 1980 Olympics, India's performance in field hockey has been dismal, with other hockey-playing nations such as Australia, Netherlands and Germany improving their standards and catching up with India. Its decline is also due to the change in rules of the game, introduction of artificial turf, and internal politics in Indian field hockey bodies. The popularity of field hockey has also declined massively parallel to the decline of the Indian hockey team. In recent years, the standard of Indian hockey has gone from bad to worse, with the Men's team not qualifying for the 2008 Olympics and finishing last in the 2012 Olympics. Since 2014, the men's team is trying to regain its lost glory little by little as they become runners up at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, then winning a much needed 2014 Asian Games gold and 2017 Men's Hockey Asia Cup to finally establishing the Asian dominance after long time but before that India lost to Belgium in the quarter final of 2016 Rio Olympics. India men's hockey team is eyeing for gold at the 2018 Men's Hockey World Cup as its going to hold in India, as support of home crowds which is a must need to defeat the aura of the Australians who constantly dominating the Indian team in the recent years in various finals such as the 2014 & 2018 Hockey Champions Trophy. Currently, the Indian men's team is 5th in the rankings of the Fédération Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH, English:International Hockey Federation), the international governing body of field hockey and indoor field hockey.\n\nThe Women's team came of age in 1980 when they first participated at the Summer Olympics and achieved the 4th place. The first golden moment for the team was in 1982 at the Asian Games. Since then not much of happening moments in the team history, though in 2016 after 34 years, its a little hope when Indian women's team qualified for the Summer Olympics and they went on to win the 2017 Women's Hockey Asia Cup claiming the Asian dominance after 2004. India Women's team failed to win any medal in the Women's Hockey World Cup. The present team is ranked 10th by the Fédération Internationale de Hockey. \n\nIndia has hosted two Men's Hockey World Cups–one in 1982 in Mumbai, and another in 2010 in Delhi, where they finished fifth and eighth respectively. India also hosted the annual Hockey Champions Trophy in 1996, 2005 and 2014. Until 2008, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) was the apex body for hockey in the country. However, following revelations of corruption and other scandals in the IHF, the federation was dissolved and de-recognised, and a new apex body for Indian hockey called Hockey India (HI) was formed on 20 May 2009, with support from the IOA and former hockey players. HI, recognised by the International Hockey Federation (FIH), has the sole mandate to govern and conduct all activities for both men's and women's field hockey in India. Although the IHF was reinstated in 2010, it is not recognised by the FIH. The IHF conducts a franchise-based tournament called World Series Hockey (WSH), with its first season conducted in 2012. However, it is not approved by HI or the FIH.\n\nHI also conducts a franchise-based tournament called the Hockey India League (HIL). Its first season was in 2013 and is inspired from the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI's) highly successful Indian Premier League. The tournament is recognised by the FIH, which has also decided to provide a 30-day window for the forthcoming seasons so that all top players can participate.\n\nFootball was introduced to India during the British colonial period. Although India has never been represented in any FIFA World Cup, it did qualify in 1950, though it did not take part, as they were not allowed to play barefoot. India was an Asian powerhouse in football in the 1950s and 1960s. During this golden era, India created history as the first Asian team to reach semi-finals in an Olympic football tournament in 1956 Summer Olympics at Melbourne and Neville D'Souza became the first Asian and Indian to score a hat-trick (record remains unbeaten) in an Olympic match. India also finished as runners-up in the 1964 AFC Asian Cup. But later on, the standard of football started to decline due to lack of professionalism and fitness culture. India currently ranks 97th in the FIFA rankings as of 10 August 2017.\n\nFootball is, nevertheless, widely popular both as a spectator sport, and as a participation sport in some parts of the country such as Kerala, West Bengal, Goa and the Northeast. The India national football team represents India in all FIFA tournaments. The Yuva Bharati Krirangan of Kolkata was the second largest non-auto racing stadium in the world.\n\nIn June 1937, at the Army Headquarters, Shimla, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) was formed at a meeting of the representatives of football associations of six regions where the game was very popular in those days. It is the governing body for football in India. Domestic competitions for men's football include the Indian Super League, I-League, I-League 2nd Division in the Indian League System and the annual knock-out style Federation Cup. For women's football the India women's football championship. However, it is European football, such as the English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, and the UEFA Champions League, which are very popular among Indian football fans, especially in metropolitan cities.\n\nThe 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup will be the 17th tournament of the FIFA U-17 World Cup. FIFA revealed on 5 December 2013 (as part of their Executive Committee meets in Salvador, Brazil), that India will be the host. This will be the first time India will host an international football competition at world level. To help increase interest in youth football in advance of the 2017 U-17 World Cup, India has launched the Mission XI Million programme.\n\nTennis is a sport among Indians in urban areas. Tennis has gained popularity after the exploits of Vijay Amritraj. India's fortunes in Grand Slam singles have been unimpressive, although Leander Paes won a singles bronze medal at the 1996 Olympics. Since the late 1990s India has had impressive results in Grand Slam doubles, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have won many men's doubles and mixed doubles Grand Slam titles. Sania Mirza is the most notable Indian woman tennis player, having won a WTA title and breaking into the Top 30 WTA rankings, also winning three Grand Slam doubles events, the first at Wimbledon in 2015. On the men's side, young Somdev Devvarman and Yuki Bhambri are flying India's flag on the ATP Tour. Yuki was the Australian Open junior singles champion in 2009. Rohan Bopanna has won two mixed doubles titles.\n\nBadminton is played widely in India and it is one of the most popular sports in India. Badminton is a fast growing sport in India. Badminton's popularity has grown in recent years. Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal, K. Srikanth and P.V. Sindhu are ranked amongst top-10 in current BWF ranking. Prakash Padukone was the first player from India to achieve world no.1 spot in the game and after him K. Srikanth made it to the top spot as male player for second time in April 2018 and Saina Nehwal is the first female player from India to achieve World no.1 spot in April 2015. The most successful doubles player from India is Jwala Gutta, who is the only Indian to have been ranked in the top-10 of two categories.

Other successful players include Aparna Popat, Pullela Gopichand, Syed Modi, Chetan Anand, Parupalli Kashyap, Prannoy Kumar, Ashwini Ponnappa, Chirag Shetty, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and N. Sikki Reddy.\n\nPadukone and Gopichand, both won the All England Open in 1980 and 2001 respectively making them the only Indians to ever win the prestigious title. At the 2012 London Olympic Games, Nehwal won the bronze medal in the individual women's competition, the first for the country in badminton and in the next edition at Rio 2016 P.V.Sindhu won silver in Women's singles, 2nd medal in badminton for India.

India has both men's and women's national basketball teams. Both teams have hired head coaches who have worked extensively with NBA players and now aim to popularise the game in India. Satnam Singh Bhamara officially marks the first player from India to be selected in the NBA by being taken by the Dallas Mavericks as the 52nd pick of the 2015 NBA draft, as well as the first player to be drafted straight out of high school as a postgraduate.\n\nThe \"Young Cagers\", as the national team is nicknamed, made one Olympic appearance in basketball, and appeared 20 times in the Asian Championship. India is currently ranked 58th in the world in basketball. The Indian national team had its best result at the 1975 Asian Championship, when the team finished ahead of teams including the Philippines, one of Asia's basketball strongholds. Internationally, one of the most recognised Indian basketball players has been Sozhasingarayer Robinson. Affiliated into the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) since 1936, India has one of Asia's longest basketball traditions.\n\nIndia's women had their best result at the recent 2011 FIBA Asia Championship for Women when they finished 6th. The team has several internationally known players including Geethu Anna Jose, who was invited to tryouts for the WNBA in 2011.\n\nTable tennis is a popular indoor recreation sport in India, which has caught on in states including West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.

India, which is ranked 30th in the world, has produced a single player ranked in the top 50, Sharat Kamal.\n\nGolf is a growing sport in India. It is especially popular among the wealthier classes, but has not yet caught on with others due the expenses involved in playing.\n\nThe most successful Indian golfers are Jeev Milkha Singh and Anirban Lahiri. Singh won three titles on the European Tour, four on the Japan Golf Tour, and six on the Asian Tour. His highest world ranking was 28th in March 2009.

Lakra, and Dinesh Kumar each won a bronze medal at the 2008 World Championship. India's lone women boxer, M.C. Mary Kom, won the bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympic Games.\n\nConsidered one of the most ancient and oldest sports in the world, wrestling in India has a glorious past. The sport of wrestling began its journey in India several centuries ago, during the Middle Ages. Wrestling is among the most prestigious and oldest events in the Olympic Games. It was included in the Olympics in 708 BC. In ancient times, wrestling in India was mainly used as a way to stay physically fit. It was also used as a military exercise without any weapons. Wrestling in India is also known as \"dangal,\" and it is the basic form of a wrestling tournament.\n\nIn India, wrestling is mostly known as \"Malla-Yuddha\". There are mentions of wrestling in the ancient times, found in the Sanskrit epic of Indian history, \"Mahabharata\". One of the premier characters in Mahabharata, Bhima, was considered to be a great wrestler. Other great wrestlers included Jarasandha, Duryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana, also mentions wrestling in India, describing Hanuman as one of the greatest wrestlers of that time. The 13th-century \"Malla Purana\" references a group of Gujarati Brahmin wrestlers known as Jyesthimallas.\n\nKarnam Malleswari won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, making her the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal. The headquarters of the Indian Weightlifting Federation is in New Delhi. The federation is affiliated with the Indian Olympic Association (Delhi), and is also a member of the Asian Weightlifting Federation (Tehran) and International Weightlifting Federation (IWF, Budapest). The International Weightlifting Federation banned the Indian Weightlifting Federation from participating in all international competitions for one year when three Indian women weightlifters were accused of doping offences in various international competitions in a single year.\n\nThe game of archery has historical significance, as royals in the ancient days used to practice archery. Modern-day archery in India began in the early 1970s, before its introduction as an Olympic event in 1972, and it was formalised in 1973 when the Archery Association of India (AAI) came into existence. Since its inception, AAI has been promoting an organisation for the sport. India has been producing some world class players who are the medal hopefuls in international events of archery.\n\nVolleyball is a popular recreation sport played all over India, both in rural and urban areas. India is ranked fifth in Asia, and 27th in the world. In the youth and junior levels, India came in second in the 2003 World Youth Championships. The Indian senior men's team is ranked 46th in the world. A major problem for the sport is the lack of sponsors.\n\nHandball is a popular sport in India, played at the local level, but hasn't yet made an impact at the domestic level. India's handball team began on 27 April 1989, although it hasn't yet made an impact on the world stage, at the international level or the World Cup.

Surendra Bhandari won a bronze medal in taekwondo at the 2002 Asian Games. Taekwondo is widely practised in India, with actors Neetu Chandra, Akshay Kumar and Isha Koppikar holding black belts.\n\nRugby union is a minor, but fast-growing, sport in India. Some Indian sporting clubs are beginning to embrace the game, and it is the second most popular winter sport after football in India, which itself trails in popularity after cricket and field hockey.\n\nThe history of cycling in India dates back to 1938, and the Cycling Federation of India governs the sport. Though cycling is unknown as a professional sport in India, it is popular as a common recreational sport and a way to keep fit.\n\n\nMountain biking is becoming a popular sport in India. For the last six years, Mtb himachal, a hardcore endurance event, has been organised regularly by Himalayan Adventure Sports & Tourism Promotion Association (HASTPA), a non-governmental organisation (NGO). A number of national and international riders participate, including Indian Army, Indian Air Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and a number of young and energetic mountain biking individual riders from cities including Pune, Bangalore, Delhi and Chandigarh. Last year, the government of Sikkim (Department of Tourism) introduced its own mountain biking race, with Southeast Asia's biggest prize money. The second edition saw 48 professional participants from around the globe.\n\n\nThe Tour of Nilgiris is a major non-competitive & non-commercial touring event in South Asia that covers 1,000 kilometres in under 10 days. The Tour of Nilgiris (TfN), India's first Day Touring Cycle Ride, was born in December 2008 with the twin objectives of promoting bicycling as an activity and spreading awareness about the bio-diversity, flora and fauna of the Nilgiris.\n\nIt soon grew into something a lot more, with an eclectic riding community in 2008 wanting to take part in. The community soon got together, chalked out plans, figured out a route and realised they would need a framework to support such a large group of people, got sponsors on board to mitigate costs as well as popularise the Tour and the Cause of popularising Cycling as a viable and sustainable means of travel. Ever since its first edition, the TfN has stayed true to the Community of Cyclists in India by being a Tour for the Community, Of the Community and By the Community. It has grown in size, stature and visibility. From 40 riders in the first edition, its grown to 100 cyclists in 2013.\n\nThe tour has grown bigger & the routes tougher, allowing cyclists to test their endurance, enjoy the biodiversity of the Nilgiris covering 3 southern states in India (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu & Kerala). For the racing aficionado's, there are racing segments on the tour with colour coded jerseys, recognition and prizes. TfN as its lovingly called is pushing cycling to new frontiers with more and more interested cyclists, applying for the tour. The tour has acquired quite a name, and currently about 25% of registrations are selected for the tour by the organisers.\n\nIndia has a wide following in various equestrian sports, including show jumping, eventing, dressage, endurance riding and tent pegging. Supported by the Equestrian Federation of India, eventing is the most popular of the five, with teams representing the country at most Asian Games, winning a bronze medal in the 2002 and 2006 games. India has been represented at the Olympics twice, by Wing Commander I.J. Lamba, and Imtiaz Anees.\n\nIndian flat water kayakers are an emerging powerhouse on the Asian circuit. Outside of professional flat water kayaking, there is very limited recreational kayaking. The potential to generate interest in flat water kayaking is held by leisure resorts located near the sea or other water bodies. Indian tourists tend to consider kayaking a one-time activity, rather than a sport to be pursued.\n\nEnthusiasts of whitewater kayaking are concentrated in the north towards the Himalayas, with some in the south in Bangalore in Karnataka. Most of these enthusiasts are or were whitewater raft guides who took to the sport of whitewater kayaking. Some of the prominent whitewater kayakers include Abhinav Kala, Shalabh Gahlaut, and John Pollard. Many of them have notched first descents (similar to climbing ascents) on rivers in India and Nepal.\n\n\"Bangalore Kayakers\" or \"Southern River Runners\" are India's first amateur group of white water kayakers. Based out of Bangalore, they explore rivers around Western Ghats. The lure for most of these participants is adventure. Whitewater kayaking in India allows for exploration of places where, literally, no human has been before.\n\nGear availability is a problem that plagues kayakers. While the global designs for whitewater boats and paddles change annually, Indian kayakers have to pay high fees if they want to import any kind of gear, or they have to buy used gear in Nepal. More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp, Piroutte or Dancer designs, while the kayakers from abroad ride the river in their new design, planing hull, centred volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha, or Wave Sport.\n\nKayaking India groups on Facebook are good resources for kayakers in India.\n\nIndia is unfortunately not affluent in the field of athletics and track events. There are very few athletes who won any medal in any global or major events. But the scenario is changing in the 20th century, when people started taking interest in athletics and facility are providing to improve the meager situation of athletics. Anju Bobby George made history when she won the bronze medal in Women's long jump at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris. With this achievement, she became the first Indian athlete ever to win a medal in a World Championships in Athletics jumping 6.70 m. Till 2010 Milkha Singh was the only athlete to win an individual gold medal at a Commonwealth Games but at 2010 Commonwealth Games, Krishna Punia created history by winning the Women's discus throw gold medal for India after 52 years and as first woman to win a gold in athletics at Commonwealth Games. In the same edition of Commonwealth games Manjeet Kaur, Sini Jose, Ashwini Akkunji & Mandeep Kaur won the Women's 4 × 400 m (Relay) gold medal. At 2014 Commonwealth Games Vikas Gowda won the Men's Discus Throw gold medal. \n\nHima Das is only Indian track athlete to win a medal at any IAAF global event. She won the gold medal in Women's 400 metres at 2018 IAAF World U20 Championships at Tampere, Finland, on 12 July 2018, clocking a time of 51.46 seconds.She is second gold medalist in athletics at IAAF World U20 Championships after Neeraj Chopra who won Men's javelin throw gold at 2016 IAAF World U20 Championships by setting world junior record with a throw of 86.48 m. Later Neeraj went on to win the Men's javelin throw gold at 2018 Commonwealth Games. Performances at Olympics Games are not satisfactory, till now no Indian athlete won any medal at the Olympics. At 2016 Summer Olympics Lalita Babar becomes the first Indian athlete since 1984 to reach Olympics finale in the event of Women's 3000 metres steeplechase, before her, P.T. Usha reach the finale of Women's 400 metres hurdles at 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\nP.T. Usha won multiple gold medals in different editions of Asian Games and Asian Athletics Championships. Lavy Pinto was the first Indian to win a gold medal in the Asian Games which he won in the first Asian Games held at New Delhi in 1951 in 100 and 200-meter categories. Christine Brown, Stephie D'Souza, Violet Peters, Mary D'Souza gave India its first women athletics gold medal when they won 4 × 100 m relay in 1954 Asian Games but current Asian record is held by Priyanka Pawar,Tintu Luka, Mandeep Kaur, Machettira Raju Poovamma when they won Women's 4 × 400 metres relay at 2014 Asian Games clocking 3:28:68. Kamaljeet Sandhu was the first Indian female athlete to win individual gold medal at any Asian games by winning 400m track event at 1970 Asian Games. Sunita Rani holds the current Asian record in 1500 m track event winning at Busan 2002 Asian Games clocking 4:06:03.\n\nMadhurjya Borah, an Indian triathlete holds silver medal at South Asian Triathlon Championship\n\nAnu Vaidyanathan, an Indian triathlete, is the first Asian to compete in Ultraman.\n\nIn May 2016, Arunaabh Shah from Delhi became the 1st Indian male and the youngest Indian to finish Ultraman, at Ultraman Australia.\n\nGymnastics came of age in India, when at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Ashish Kumar won the first-ever medal in gymnastics for India in the form of bronze. However, soon after the win, the president of the Gymnastics Federation of India, controversially asked Kumar's chief coach from the Soviet Union, Vladimir Chertkov, \"Is this all that you can deliver, a bronze?\" The comment was widely reported in the press. Later, the coach revealed that, \"In August 2009, we had no equipment. Ashish trained on hard floor till February 2010, and then we got equipment around 20 years old.\" The federation announced that no Indian team would travel to Rotterdam for the World Championships in October, which would mean that Indian gymnasts would not have the opportunity to qualify as a team for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Ashish also won a silver medal in the Men's vault at 2010 Commonwealth Games.\n\nIt was Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, from where India's glorious path in gymnastics started taking shape slowly, when Dipa Karmakar from Tripura, a small state of India, went on to win bronze medal in the Women's vault finale. But it was not her medal that stuns the world, but its her 2nd vault, the most difficult vault with a D-score of 7, the Produnova vault, named after famous Yelena Produnova of Russia, also known as the vault of death due to its difficulty and likelihood of injury, which she executed with a score of 15.1 (D-7, Ex- 8.1) which help her to get the precious bronze. With this attempt she became 5th gymnast to ever execute the Produnova just after legendary gymnast Oksana Chusovitina who executed multiples times.In October 2015, Karmakar became the first Indian gymnast to qualify for a final stage at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Later in 2016 when she qualified for Rio Olympics, she became first Indian gymnast to do so and also hours after her qualification at 2016 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event she clinched gold medal in Women's vault event stunning Oksana Chusovitina with her prudunova again who came second to her. On 6 July 2016, FIG honored Dipa by naming her World Class Gymnast. At Rio Olympics she achieved 4th place in vaults. After a long break due to injury when she ran for vaults and landed with a gold at World Challenge Cup series. Her medal is second to first ever medal won by any Indian, was won by Aruna Reddy at FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Melbourne, where she secured the bronze medal in the individual vaults.\n\nIndia has been a force in world billiards competitions. Champions including Wilson Jones, Michael Ferreira, Geet Sethi and now the domination of Pankaj Advani have underlined the powerhouse status of the country. The Snooker Federation of India, the apex body, plays a proactive role in popularising the game. Many efforts have been made by the Billiards and Snooker Federation of India in the recent past to enhance the popularity of the game in the country. Several training camps for developing budding talent and providing them with regional and state sponsorship have been organised by the Billiards and Snooker Federation in various parts of the country.\n\nChess has risen in popularity in India over the last few decades, primarily due to its star player Viswanathan Anand. He is a multiple World Champion. The game may have originated from India as a successor to Chaturanga or Shatranj. The All India Chess Federation is the governing body for chess in India.\n\nCricket has a long history in India, having been introduced in the country during the British rule. It is the most popular sport by a wide margin in India . Cricket is played on local, national, and international levels, and enjoys consistent support from people in most parts of India. Its development has been closely tied in with the history of the country, mirroring many of the political and cultural developments around issues such as caste, gender, religion, and nationality. The Indian national cricket team played its first official match (a Test) in 1932 against England, and the team's performance since then has generally been mixed, sometimes enjoying stupendous success and sometimes suffering outright failure. The highest profile rival of the Indian cricket team is the Pakistani cricket team, though, in recent times, it has gained other rivals, including Australia, South Africa and England.\nAlthough cricket is the most popular sport in India, it is not the nation's official national sport as India does not have a national sport. The governing body for cricket in India, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), was formed in December 1928 and is based in Mumbai. Today, BCCI is the richest sporting body in the world.\n\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted a large number of multi-nation major international cricket tournaments, including the 1987 Cricket World Cup (co-hosted with Pakistan), the 1996 Cricket World Cup (co-hosted with Pakistan and Sri Lanka), the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2011 Cricket World Cup (co-hosted with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh). The India national cricket team has won major tournaments, including the 1983 Cricket World Cup in England, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, the 2011 Cricket World Cup (which they won by beating Sri Lanka in the final at home), and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and has shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka. It had also briefly held the position of the No. 1 team in Tests. The domestic competitions include the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy, and the Challenger Series, all of which are not widely followed, despite cricket's popularity in the country. This parallels the global situation in cricket, where the international game is more widely followed than the domestic game in all major cricketing countries. In addition, the BCCI conducts the Indian Premier League, a domestic franchise-based Twenty20 competition, during March–April every year and is extremely popular.\n\nKabaddi is a popular national sport in India, played mainly among people in villages. It is regarded as a team-contact sport and as a recreational form of combat training.\n\nTwo teams occupy opposite halves of a small field and take turns sending a raider into the other half to win points by tagging and wrestling members of the opposing team. The raider then attempts to return to his own half while holding his breath and chanting \"kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi\" during the whole raid.\n\nIndia has won gold in all the Asian Games in kabaddi excepting 2018 Asian games where they got bronze. The four forms of kabaddi recognised by Kabaddi federation in India are Amar, Sanjeevni, Gaminee and Punjabi rules Kabaddi. India won the Kabaddi World Championship in 2007, beating Iran 29–19.\n\nMotorsport is a popular spectator sport in India, although there are relatively few competitors compared to other sports, due to the high costs of competing. Coimbatore is often referred to as the \"Motor sports Capital of India\" and the \"Backyard of Indian Motorsports\". S.Karivardhan, spearheaded motor racing, making Coimbatore the country's motor racing hub when he designed and built entry level race cars. Before Buddh International Circuit was constructed, the country's only two permanent race ways were the Kari Motor Speedway, Coimbatore and Madras Motor Racing Track, Chennai. MRF built the first Formula 3 car in 1997. MRF in collaboration with Maruti established the Formula Maruti racing, a single-seater, open wheel class motorsport racing event for race cars made in India. MRF Challenge is a Formula 2000 open-wheel motorsport formula based series organised by Madras Motor Sports Club in association with MRF. Narain Karthikeyan and Karun Chandhok are the only drivers from to represent India in Formula 1.\nOn 1 February 2005, Narain Karthikeyan became India's first Formula One racing driver. On March 2007, he also became the first-ever Indian-born driver to compete in a NASCAR Series. He debuted in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series in the Kroger 250. Force India F1 is a Formula One motor racing team. The team was formed in October 2007, when a consortium led by Indian businessmen Vijay Mallya and Michiel Mol bought the Spyker F1 team for €88 million. After competing in 29 races without a point, Force India won their first Formula One World Championship points and podium place when Giancarlo Fisichella finished second in the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix. New Delhi hosted the Indian Grand Prix in 2011 at Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida, 50 km from New Delhi. Karun Chandhok was the test driver for Team Lotus & Narain Karthikeyan raced for HRT during the first half of the 2011 Formula One season. Karun Chandhok participated in Friday's practice session and Karthikeyan (stepping in for Daniel Ricciardo) raced at the 2011 Indian Grand Prix; it was the first time two Indian drivers associated with the same Formula One Grand Prix directly.\n\nTeam MRF's Gaurav Gill the first Indian rally driver to win FIA Asia-Pacific Rally Championship in 2013.\n\nKorfball, a mixed-gender ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball, is played by over 50 countries in the world.

The 2015 Commonwealth Karate Games were held in Delhi, India.\n\nFloorball, an indoor team sport, a type of floor hockey, is gaining popularity in India. The Floorball Federation of India was started in 2001 and, since then, it has expanded rapidly. There have been four national floorball championships held, with Uttar Pradesh becoming the champions. Women's floorball has also expanded, and Mumbai is the first national floorball champion of India. India is a provisional member of the International Floorball Federation. India has participated in many international friendlies and steps are being taken to make India an ordinary member of floorball.\n\nNetball, derived from early versions of basketball, is a popular sport in India, especially among Indian women. India's national team is ranked 25th in the world and has played only a few matches. The team has failed to qualify for any of the World Netball Championships. They played 18 matches in total. In the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, netball was included as a medal sport. However, the Indian team failed to win a medal.\n\nThrowball, a non-contact competitive ball sport played across a net between two teams of seven players on a rectangular court, is gaining popularity in India. Indian authorities of the game were instrumental in organising an Asian level and, later, a world level association for the sport. Throwball is played in gym class, colleges, and clubs throughout Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, China, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. The sport is also slowly gaining in popularity in other countries including France, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United Kingdom. India's junior throwball team visited Sri Lanka in 1982. Vijay Dahiya from Haryana was captain of the team. The Indian team won the test series.\n\nLacrosse is a relatively new sport in India, introduced in 2006.

Their first league play was to commence in 2012, and feature teams from eight different Indian cities, including Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, and Jaipur.\n\nIndia is considered the cradle of modern polo. Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire in the 15th century, firmly established its popularity. The period between the decline of the Mughal dynasty and the upsurgence of the British Imperial rule, polo almost vanished from mainland India. Fortunately, the game survived in a few remote mountainous enclaves of the subcontinent, notably Gilgit, Chitral, Ladakh, and Manipur.\n\nIn India, the popularity of polo has waned and risen many times. However, it has never lost its regal status. In the last few decades, the emergence of privately owned teams has ensured a renaissance in Indian polo. Today, polo is not just restricted to the royalty and the Indian Army.\n\nBaseball has recently begun to show up in India. Softball is played in school and at the university level. Two Indian pitchers were selected by the \"Million Dollar Arm\" competition to play in the United States. A talent hunt-style competition conducted by Major League Baseball to find baseball talent in India found the teenagers Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, who were taken to the US and received professional coaching. These two players were selected to play for Pittsburgh Pirates minor league organisations. Rinku Singh played for the Canberra Cavalry of the Australian Baseball League for the competition's inaugural 2010–11 season.\n\nRock climbing has been around in India for a long time. Presumably, the mountaineers headed for Himalayan ascents had to train somewhere, and would have imparted some of the initial technical climbing culture. Documented evidence of rock climbing is associated with bouldering and climbing around Bangalore's famous Ramanagara crags and Turahalli boulders, around Western Ghats closer to Mumbai and Pune. The Deccan Plateau and south of the Vindhya Range are considered the prime locations for rock climbing in India. There is an established climbing tradition associated with Mumbai, Pune, and Bangalore. For example, Hampi is considered the bouldering capital of India. Climbers congregate here during New Year's Eve and climb through the weeks preceding and after. Badami is popular for its free and sport routes (numbering over 200).\n\nSepak takraw, though not very well known in India, was a demonstration sport at the Delhi Asian Games in 1982. The Sepak Takraw Federation, with its headquarters in Nagpur, Maharashtra, was founded on 10 September 1982. It is recognised by the Indian Olympic Association and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports since 2000. So far, the federation has conducted 14 senior, seven junior, and six sub-junior national championships in different cities, and is conducting Federation Cup Tournaments and zonal National Championships.\n\nThe game is very popular in the northeastern state of Manipur, and some of the best players came from there.

Skiing, snow rugby, snow cycling, and snow football are some of the common winter sports played in India. Skiing is more popular, although India has taken part in luge in Winter Olympics since 1998. Shiva Keshavan is the only Indian to have won medals in international meets in winter sports (Asian Gold 2011, Asian Silver 2009, Asian Bronze 2008, Asian Silver (doubles) 2005, Asian Bronze (singles) 2005), and to have participated in four Olympic Games. He is the Asian speed record holder at 134.4 km/h, making him the fastest man in Asia on ice. Luge is practised in a big way by the mountain residents in an improvised form called \"reri\".\n\nIndia has a national bandy team. The Bandy Federation of India governs bandy in India. Its headquarters are in Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. Bandy, a team winter sport played on ice, in which skaters use sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal, is generally played in northern India, where there is snow and ice. India is one of seven countries in Asia and out of a total of 28 to be a member of Federation of International Bandy. BFI planned to send a team to the 2011 Asian Winter Games in Astana-Almaty, but ultimately did not.\n\nIce hockey is played in the colder parts of India, including Kashmir, Ladakh, and parts of Himachal Pradesh.\n\nSeval Sandai or Seval Porr (cockfighting) is a popular rural sport.

{"id": "41179586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41179586", "title": "Still Open All Hours", "text": "Still Open All Hours\n\nStill Open All Hours is a British sitcom created by Roy Clarke for the BBC set in Balby, Doncaster, starring David Jason. It is the sequel to the sitcom \"Open All Hours\", which both Clarke and Jason worked on throughout its 26 episode run from 1973 to 1985, following a 40th Anniversary Special in December 2013 commemorating the original series. Like the original series, the story focuses on the life of Granville as he continues to run his uncle Arkwright's shop, with the assistance of his son Leroy, while seeking to be with his love interest. Unlike the original series, the cast includes a more regular group of characters and additional side-plots concerning them, and features the return of Lynda Baron, Stephanie Cole, and Maggie Ollerenshaw as their respective characters in \"Open All Hours\".\n\nFollowing the 2013 special, the show has run five full-length series, with the first of them premiering on 26 December 2014.\n\nSet within the same small grocer's shop in Balby, a suburb of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, the show focuses on the life of Granville (David Jason), now much older and the owner of Arkwright's shop since his uncle's death. Despite his youth's lacklustre social life, Granville has since grown into the same person as his uncle, having been taught by him over how to sell to customers. To assist him with the running of his shop is Leroy (James Baxter), Granville's son from one of his previous girlfriends, who maintains a rather robust love life with several girls but struggles to cope with the work and sales approach of his father.\n\nLike his uncle, Granville maintains a love life with Mavis (Maggie Ollerenshaw), an absent-minded but sweet woman who loves him in return, but who lives across the road alongside her sister Madge (Brigit Forsyth), a miserable woman who does not like men and chooses to keep Mavis from following a relationship with Granville. Both are regulars to the shop, alongside others from the neighbourhood whom Granville tries to offload products onto, which he has bought and had little success to sell on.\n\nSince \"Open All Hours\", having lived his youth as a nice, yet shy and awkward man who struggled with shop life, Granville has changed into a more toned-down version of his uncle Arkwright, who thanks to his uncle's training, now exhibits a similar manner of selling goods at inflated prices, fabricating stories to sell useless and/or unsalable items to hapless customers, and keeping a close watch on the money he spends, often through employing the use of a special money belt that cause slight issues and embarrassment at times. During his uncle's training, Granville engaged in relationships with several girlfriends, in which a fling in Blackpool resulted in the procreation of his son Leroy, whom he was left in charge of by his mother. Following his uncle's death, Granville inherited his shop, which he runs alongside Leroy, often teasing his son over the identity of his mother, secretly concealing the fact he knows who it is, while subjecting him to practical jokes and teaching him some of the tricks that his uncle taught him. In \"Still Open All Hours\", he maintains a belief that his uncle lives on through the shop's till, often referring to it as Arkwright in later episodes, due to the nature of it opening up or closing shut suddenly at times for various reasons, such as when there is mention of spending considerable money on something.\n\nLike his uncle, Granville has a love interest of his own within Mavis, a woman he met during his youth and whom he still fondly loves. Unlike his uncle, Granville struggles to be with Mavis since the end of her previous marriage, due to her sister Madge desiring to keep them apart. To try to keep Madge distracted and hopefully remove her as an obstacle, Granville spends his time grooming one of his regulars, Gastric, into becoming Madge's love interest. In later episodes, he also finds himself trying to stop the advances of widower Delphine Featherstone, one of his uncle's customers whom he accidentally sent a love note to that was meant for Mavis, by convincing a fellow widower, Wilburn Newbold, into entering a relationship with her and maintaining it, despite Mrs Featherstone's presence unnerving him.\n\nLeroy was born to a mother whom his father met during a fling in Blackpool, but whom he does not know about, despite Granville secretly knowing who she is; although his mother is talked about during the first series, including a visit by her to see Leroy, references about her become rare and non-existent in later episodes. Left into his father's care by his mother at a young age, Leroy suffers similar issues like Granville did in his youth, such as having to be up early to open the shop and thus being on the receiving end of his father's practical jokes, and handling the deliveries of purchases to customers. Unlike his father, Leroy maintains an active social life with many young women, most having boyfriends that they don't mind ignoring to spend time with him, much to his father's dismay, while displaying a firm dislike of his father's practices for unloading products he buys cheaply but cannot sell. By the fourth series, Leroy becomes committed to winning the affection of a local librarian, despite her values and her lifestyle as a vegan.\n\nthirty-three episodes of \"Still Open All Hours\", all written by Roy Clarke, have been produced for the BBC.

Ben Lawrence of \"The Telegraph\" said it \"felt like a relic of another era\" criticising the jokes and Jason's performance. Jacob Mason, writing on the Radio Times website, described the show as \"warmly nostalgic\", whilst others noted it as \"a fitting tribute to Ronnie Barker\".

{"id": "33331503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33331503", "title": "The Last of the Greats", "text": "The Last of the Greats\n\nThe Last of the Greats is a comic book limited series created by writer Joshua Hale Fialkov and artist Brent Peeples. It was published by Image Comics from October 5, 2011 through February 2012. A sequel, \"Return of the Greats\", is forthcoming.\n\nIt takes place in a world where seven alien super powered beings known as the \"Greats\" have eliminated disease, poverty, and social inequality. At the start of the story humanity found a way to kill all of the Greats save one, who kept himself hidden, never bothering to try to help Earth like his siblings did. Now humanity must plead with the last of the Greats to stop an alien invasion that threatens the entire world.\n\nThere are several startling revelations that take place during the first 5 issues of this tale. We find out that though the Greats seemingly died, they are beings of energy and therefore have been absorbed by their remaining brother, who is now extorting the human race into complete subjugation for his help. Next, we find out that when the Last Great seeks to engage the alien ships, he actually goes aboard one of them and seems to be in charge of the fleet, which he then orders 2/3s of the earth's population to be destroyed. In flashbacks we see that the Last Great's sister actually sired a child with her adviser and the child has abilities like the other Greats, but she is being kept hidden from the Last Great for her own protection.\n\nLater in the story, the Last Great is attacked by his \"niece\", and during the battle, the reader is given a glimpse of the other Greats in a big field under a tree that represents them being part of the Last Great's subconscious, mingling and talking with each other. Due to the Last Great's niece fighting with him, the internal struggle with the other Greats causes them to attempt to release themselves from his body. All of the Greats do this, except for one woman. We then find out that the Last Great and this woman have plotted to have the others release themselves and float around as formless energy so that they can enact a master plan that they have been planning for some time.\n\nThe first series was collected into a trade paperback:\n\nJamil Scalese of Comics Bulletin called the story \"page-turning, jaw-dropping\" and stated \"The Last of the Greats sets itself up to be one the best mindfuck comics to hit shelves recently.\" He praised the artwork as well. IGN felt the series had a \"neat concept\" but complained about the lack of character development in the first issue.\n\n\n"}
