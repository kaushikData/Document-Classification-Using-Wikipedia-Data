{"id": "335255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335255", "title": "All Grown Up!", "text": "All Grown Up!\n\nAll Grown Up! is an American animated television series airing from 2003 to 2008 created by Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó for Nickelodeon. It is a spinoff of \"Rugrats\" and takes place about ten years after the original series where the characters are now tweens (10-12).\n\nAfter the success of \"All Growed Up,\" the \"Rugrats\" 10th anniversary special, Nickelodeon commissioned \"All Grown Up!\" as a spin-off series based on the episode. The series ran from 2003 to 2008 with a total of five seasons and 55 episodes.\n\nTommy, Dil, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Kimi, Angelica, and Susie now have to deal with preteen and teenage issues and situations.\n\n\nThe idea originated in \"All Growed Up\", a special which aired in 2001 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of \"Rugrats\". Nickelodeon was so impressed by the high ratings it achieved, with more than 12 million viewers tuning into the special, that it commissioned an entire series revolving around the teenage main characters. Production for the series later began in September 2002, under the pilot's name; however, Nickelodeon insisted that the program go with the more grammatically correct title \"All Grown Up\" instead, especially since the characters in the special used more grammatically correct words. During summer 2003, teasers for \"All Grown Up\" aired. However, the scenes shown were not clips from actual episodes of the show.\n\nAt the time, this was not the only spinoff of \"Rugrats\" under consideration .\n\nIn 2002, Nickelodeon aired the episode \"Pre-School Daze\", the proposed pilot to a series in which characters Angelica and Susie attend pre-school (the program ultimately aired in the UK in 2005, and then made its North American debut, long after the original series had been cancelled, in 2008).\n\nAnother proposed spinoff was a series featuring Susie and the Carmichael family, who would've moved from California to Atlanta, Georgia, in the new series; it was first proposed for the 1999–2000 television season, but with Nick and Klasky-Csupo deciding to concentrate on all the original-aged Rugrats, all together, that concept was shelved. The \"Kwanzaa\" special, which aired in 2001, had served as a pilot for this new series, but some felt that the (ultimately rejected) series would have been contradictory to established continuity .\n\nThe show premiered on April 12, 2003, as a preview before starting its regular run in late November 2003. When the series did start its regular run, more than 5.2 million viewers tuned in, enough to put it into the 2nd place slot for the week (behind an NFL game on ESPN) and making it the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history at the time. (The April sneak peek did not make the top 15 cable programs for that week, due to the ongoing war in Iraq.) The show aired in reruns on \"Nick on CBS\" for six months from March 13, 2004, to September 4, 2004. The original titles for this series were \"All Growed Up!\" and \"Rugrats: All Growed Up!\".\n\nIn addition, in its first season, \"All Grown Up!\" had its first of two celebrity guest stars: Lil Romeo as \"Lil Q\" (Cupid) in episode 11, \"It's Cupid, Stupid\".\n\nIn early 2007, \"All Grown Up!\" was removed from the Nickelodeon schedule in the United States. Although it later returned to air the remaining episodes in 2008.\n\nNickelodeon US aired most of the final season of \"All Grown Up!\" from June 15, 2008 through August 17, 2008. Since the series' cancellation, Nicktoons continued to air reruns until October 28, 2013.\n\nA total of twelve \"All Grown Up!\" DVDs have been released:\n\nThere are a range of \"All Grown Up!\" books published:\n\n"}

The firm was innovative in that it offered radios in varying colours compared with the standard wood stains offered by other companies.\n\nDuring 1933, Astor produced the first of its “Mickey Mouse” series of radios, and in 1936 introduced its first Bakelite Mickey Mouse radio, with a cartoon of the famous rodent on the dial. Early brochures featured a picture of Walt Disney and the mouse giving their \"seal of approval\". However, that was not done with permission from the Walt Disney Company and Astor became involved in a long-running court battle with Disney over the use of the Mickey Mouse name. The result was that Astor was forbidden to use the name \"Mickey Mouse\" for its radios, but it continued to produce the “Astor Mickey\" radio for the next 16 years.\n\nAstor bought its competitors, Eclipse and Essanay. However, it was itself bought by the English electronics company Pye Ltd in the 1960s, and Pye was later taken over by the giant Philips electronics company.\n\nThe Astor radio corporation was a major manufacturer of early monochrome television sets in Australia, commencing production in 1956 in anticipation of services in Melbourne and Sydney. \n\nSome early Astor television sets featured a rotary dial that located the available channels adjacent to each other, rather than in numerical order, especially for the capital cities which were allocated channels 2, 7 and 9. \n\nChannel 0 was not included, possibly because the tuner mechanism could only accommodate 12 places. As a result, in Melbourne 1964 (and later in Brisbane), service technicians were required to convert the place marker for either channel 10 or 8 to receive Channel 0, which is evidence of the significant problems that ATV0 had at its commencement. Channel 10 could not be used in Melbourne at the time because that would have resulted in interference with the regional station (GLV10). Brisbane had a similar problem a year later with a nearby regional station in Toowoomba DDQ10. That was not a problem in Sydney or Adelaide, where the channel 10 frequency was used by the 0/10 Network. \n\nThe company sponsored an early Australian television series, \"The Astor Show\", which aired in Melbourne during 1958, and also sponsored a Sydney television series, \"Astor Showcase\", from 1957 to 1959.\n"}

The catalogue is for internal use by the BBC although for a time a beta online version was available to the public. \"The catalogue is not a complete record of every BBC programme\" since certain categories of programme were not catalogued or no longer exist.\n\nThe catalogue does not include entries for programmes where no copies of the programme are known to still exist. Nor does it include entries for sport because the BBC does not necessarily own the rights. However every individual news item is separately catalogued since these had a high re-use value (e.g. use of archive footage of historical news items within present-day news programmes or documentaries).\n\nInfax was the BBC's programme database, containing 966,244 BBC programmes dating back to 1938, this is not every programme ever broadcast. Since 1992, Infax has only been used as a stock control system. Infax catalogued all TV and selected radio until 2008 but was only used to catalogue news up until 1994. The Star catalogue was used to catalogue news from 1994-2008. In 2004, the Sports Library database took over cataloguing sport until 2008 when sport was taken over by the Digital Library database. \n\nIt was reported that Infax was due to be switched off in March 2014 but due to technical issues with Fabric it remains operational at a cost of £780,000 a year to maintain.\n\nSince 1992 the BBC Northern Ireland Archive used Strix to catalogue factual, sport, current affairs, entertainment programmes and news output until March 2009. As of April 2009 all news was catalogued and stored using the Cinegy database. The Cinegy database allows for video material to be viewed on a BBC desktop computer.\n\nIn 2012 a new programme archive database was introduced to replace Infax at a cost of £3m a year. In 2013 Fabric failed a number of times and the BBC has identified key limitations with the database. Again in 2014 the BBC internal Ariel newspaper reported that Fabric has had a series of fixes but the feedback was mixed and Infax will continue to operate. In an interview for the BBC internal Ariel newspaper - Maggie Lydon (Head of Media Management) insists that only 'a very small amount' of information has not been transferred from Infax to Fabric.\n\nA web version of this database was made available to access to the public in April 2006. It ceased operation in December 2007. The front page of the website is still available to see via the Internet Archive. After it ceased, a message on the website said that it would be incorporating the information into individual programme pages. Although in 2009 an email reply from the BBC showed the reason for its removal was due to a data protection concern. \n\nInfax was also incorporated into the BBC Motion Gallery website (now Getty Images). In mid 2014 a data protection issue was flagged and public access was disabled.\n\nIn October 2012, a version of the BBC programme catalogue is available to view exclusively in British Library in the St Pancras (London) and Boston Spa (Yorkshire) reading rooms. 2.2 million searchable catalogue records and 225,000 programmes up to June 2012 are available to view.\n\nBBC Genome Project is a digitised online searchable database of back issues of the Radio Times from 1923-2009.

He had childhood experiences with the Ringling Brothers Circus and in his family's famous circus.\n\nHe moved to the United Kingdom when he was 12 so his family could appear at the London Palladium. He spent several years performing in music halls. When war broke out in 1939, he began entertaining troops in Britain and was not called up for either nation's military forces.\n\nColleano's first important role came with the popular wartime drama, \"The Way to the Stars\" (also known as \"Johnny in the Clouds\", 1945), playing an American soldier.\n\nHe played American servicemen in \"Wanted for Murder\" (1946), \"A Matter of Life and Death\" (1946), and \"While the Sun Shines\" (1947).\n\nColleano played an Italian in \"One Night with You\" (1948), and was in \"Good-Time Girl\" (1948) and \"Sleeping Car to Trieste\" (1948). He worked regularly in radio, appearing in a revue \"Navy Mixture\", and had a lead part in \"Once a Jolly Swagman\" (1949).\n\nColleano's reputation shot up when cast in the role of Stanley Kowalski in the original English stage production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1949) at the Aldwych Theatre, London, directed by Laurence Olivier and co-starring with Vivien Leigh.\n\nHis film parts got better. \"Give Us This Day\" (1949) was set in the U.S. but shot in England. He was a romantic lead in \"Dance Hall\" (1950).\n\nIt led to lead roles in films starting with \"Pool of London\" (1951) and \"A Tale of Five Cities\" (1952). He went to the US and starred in a Hollywood production, Stanley Kramer's \"Eight Iron Men\" (1952).\n\nHe went back to Britain to play the lead in \"Is Your Honeymoon Really Necessary?\" (1953), a comedy with Diana Dors, and in \"Escape by Night\" (1953).\n\nColleano had another Hollywood role, a support, in \"Flame and the Flesh\" (1954), shot in England and Italy.\n\nHe went back to support parts in British films with \"Time Is My Enemy\" (1954) and \"The Sea Shall Not Have Them\" (1955).\n\nColleano had good support roles in the oddball Shakespeare derivation \"Joe MacBeth\" (1955) and \"Stars in Your Eyes\" (1956).\n\nWarwick Productions used him in \"Zarak\" (1956). They liked his work and kept him on for \"Interpol\" (1957), \"Fire Down Below\" (1957), \"No Time to Die\" (1958) and \"The Man Inside\" (1958). He was also in \"Death Over My Shoulder\" (1958).\n\nHe was from a well known Australian circus family and was a nephew of Con Colleano, the first tightrope walker to perform a forward somersault on the wire. In 1946, he married actress Tamara Lees, but the couple divorced in 1951. His second wife was actress Susan Shaw, who descended into alcoholism after his death. Their son Mark Colleano is also an actor. In 1950, while living in the U.K., he fathered future Average White Band drummer, Robbie McIntosh. Colleano was not married to McIntosh's mother.\n\nColleano died in 1958 at the age of 34, when he crashed his sports car (a Jaguar XK140) in Birkenhead shortly after leaving the Queensway Tunnel. He was driving back from Liverpool's New Shakespeare Theatre, where he had been appearing in a stage production of \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\". His passenger, fellow actor and friend Michael Balfour, required 98 stitches, but eventually recovered.\n\nIn the lyrics of Ian Dury and the Blockheads' 1979 song \"Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3\", Colleano was included in the list of reasons to be cheerful.\n\n"}
{"id": "534617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534617", "title": "Care Bears", "text": "Care Bears\n\nThe Care Bears are a fictional group of multi-colored bear characters originally painted in 1981 by artist Elena Kucharik to be used on greeting cards from American Greetings, but later used for toys, in TV programs, and in films. There are 218 Care Bears to date. \n\nThe original development was through American Greetings' \"Those Characters From Cleveland\" research and development division, In 1983, Kenner turned the Care Bears into plush teddy bears. The Care Bears appeared in TV specials called \"The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings\" (1983) and \"The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine\" (1984). They then had a television series from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: \"The Care Bears Movie\" (1985), \"\" (1986) and \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\" (1987).\n\nEach Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its personality. The movie \"\" named them \"belly badges\". Adding to the Care Bear family are the \"Care Bear Cousins\", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, dog, cat, and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears.\n\nIn 2002, the bears were reintroduced with new toys. Made by Play-Along Toys, the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch, aerobic bears, and glow-in-the-dark bears. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in two computer-animated movies: \"\" (2004), \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" (2005) and \"The Care Bears' Rise Up Of Kingdom\" (2006). In 2007, the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary; another relaunch took place, as well as the release of \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\".\n\nIn mid-2011, American Greetings announced a revival TV animated series titled \"\". The premiere of the series utilizes \"30 years of caring\". It premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012. Though Welcome to Care-a-Lot lasted one season, a continuation of the series, \"Care Bears and Cousins\", was commissioned by Netflix and premiered November 6, 2015. The cast of characters and animation style of Welcome to Care-a-Lot remains for Care Bears and Cousins. Toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figures & blind bag collectibles) based on the Welcome to Care-a-Lot characters and style guide in Spring 2015. Just Play continued their range of product for Care Bears and Cousins in 2016.\n\nThe Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. Jack Chojnacki, the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to six businessmen—three from American Greeting Cards, and three from the toy company Kenner—in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: \"It had a high aaaaaah factor.\"\n\nMuriel Fahrion, the artist who helped create Strawberry Shortcake's look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists. Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Muriel designed the first six bears, creating the best-selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage children's book illustrator Elena Kucharik became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and a myriad of licensed products. TCFC's creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line, which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of General Mills).\n\nAs they had done with Strawberry Shortcake, once titled \"Project I\", American Greeting Cards called the Care Bears development \"Project II\" as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, Care Bears was already established as its working title.\n\nOn September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts. Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss, and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland: Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal. Eventually, the characters were announced as a toyline for production by Parker Brothers and Kenner the following spring, as well as pre-licensed characters and media stars. At that time, American Greetings touted their debut as \"the biggest character launch in the history of retailing\". On a US$5–6 million advertising budget and a wholesale commitment worth US$122.5 million, American Greetings introduced the characters to the general public in February 1983, with an appearance at New York City's Toy Fair; 26 licensees were involved upon launch. Among them was General Mills, a food company which owned the board game manufacturer Parker Brothers. In early 1983, Parker Brothers released six books featuring the Care Bears as part of its publishing division's first offerings. On television, the original ten Bears starred in their first syndicated special, Atkinson Film-Arts' \"The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings\"; Kenner produced and sponsored it.\n\nIn December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as \"Message Bears\". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the \"heart-shaped 'touché tags'\" used to identify the Care Bears.\n\nIn 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins; another syndicated special, \"The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine\", came out that same year. A miniseries based on the toys was distributed by Lexington Broadcast Services Company. A year later, the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film, \"The Care Bears Movie\", produced by Nelvana Limited and released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. It became the highest-grossing animated film made outside the Disney market at the time of its release. Later that autumn, DIC Entertainment released an 11-episode television series in syndication.\n\nIn 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie, \"\". Released by Columbia Pictures, the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.\n\nLater that year, a TV series titled \"The Care Bears Family\" (also from Nelvana) premiered on the U.S. ABC network and Canada's Global. Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard No Heart and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece Shreeky was introduced.\n\nThe Care Bears' third film, \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\", debuted in 1987. A TV special, \"Care Bears Nutcracker Suite\", premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.\n\nOver 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70 million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2 billion during the 1980s.\n\nIn early 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the belly symbol of a heart-shaped American flag. The publishing company Random House released two tie-in books: \"The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup\" (1991) by Bobbi Katz, and \"The Care Bears and the Whale Tale\" (1992) by Peggy Kahn.\n\nIn 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by Jay Foreman, the president of Fort Lauderdale-based Play Along Toys, for less than $1 million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake. Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colours were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.\n\nIn the midst of this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, Toys \"R\" Us, Target, KB Toys, and Mervyns. The new merchandise included the Bears doing aerobics; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs. Over 70 million plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch. In addition, Lionsgate Home Entertainment and subsidiary FHE Pictures, in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" in 2004 and \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" in 2005. Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced.\n\nNew versions of the various cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13 inch plushes in the 2000s, and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.\n\nIn 2007, American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again, first with a series of dolls, then a new movie, \"\" and immediately before with a new TV series \"\". The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned belly symbols, which are now called belly badges. Also, instead of Nelvana, the film and the animated series are produced by SD Entertainment.\n\nAs part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in \"\"). Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Oopsy Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear and Share Bear. The other bears include Wish Bear, True Heart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Harmony Bear, Amigo Bear, Surprise Bear, Superstar Bear, Do Your Best Bear, Best Friend Bear, Play-A-Lot Bear, Heartsong Bear, Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear, although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys.\n\nTheir new theme song is performed by former Letters to Cleo member, Kay Hanley, and the music video premiered on Fox and Nickelodeon. In August 2007, they appeared in the film \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\". This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment, \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\". The series premiered on CBS' \"KEWLopolis\" block on September 15, 2007.\n\nThe Care Bears franchise was rebooted upon the 2007 relaunch. Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles, Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper, and even Care-a-lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series. In its place is the gathering tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (\"Grizzle-ly Adventures\"), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February 2007 article in the \"Wall Street Journal\" states that in the new version, \"they live in a village, centered on a big tree; with no castle in sight\".\n\nHowever, the Caring Meter made its return in \"Grizzle-y Adventures\", and the second direct-to-DVD release of the franchise, \"Ups and Downs\", included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. In addition, Care-a-lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, \"Play Day\".\n\nOn July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with \"Strawberry Shortcake\") would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008. By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise. The deadline for Cookie Jar's acquisition was April 30, and MoonScoop's attempt June 7. In mid-August 2009, MoonScoop sued American Greetings, claiming the latter backed out of the planned US$95 million deal; AGC and Cookie Jar sued each other in the process as well. In late April 2010, the Cleveland company \"won summary judgment on MoonScoop SAS' contract\", as well as \"promissory estoppel claims\" in the case; MoonScoop filed for an appeal the following month. At the end of November 2012, the US District Court in Cleveland ruled in favor of American Greetings over MoonScoop.\n\nIn late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re-imagined with the launch of a new series, \"Care Power Team\". This re-imagining re-used the \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\" designs, has the bears sport \"enhanced belly badges\", and sees the bears taking on emergencies. Soon after, a trio of new films appeared: \"\", \"\" and \"Care Bears: To the Rescue\". In the same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears have changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro, in a deal that also involved Strawberry Shortcake. However, it was only in mid-2013 that the first Care Bear toys from Hasbro appeared. There has been no word on what caused the delay.\n\nIn July 2011, the card company announced that a new television series, the franchise's first in CGI, is in development. Entitled \"\", it premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012.\n\nIn December 2013, AG Properties and Mindworks Entertainment announced they will collaborate with Sanrio for a co-branding with the character franchise \"Little Twin Stars\". An expanded rollout is expected in March 2014.\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro has lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company called \"Just Play\". It is widely thought that the reason for the change is due to American Greetings being unhappy with how long it took Hasbro to release a toyline from the time it acquired the rights to make the toys.\n\nIn October 2014, When The Hub changed over to Discovery Family, it was revealed that Welcome to Care-A-Lot has been cancelled and that there won't be further work on the show.\n\nIn January 15, 2015, it was revealed that Netflix had commissioned a new series called \"Care Bears and Cousins\" after The Hub cancelled \"Welcome to Care-a-Lot\". The show was originally expected to premiere sometime in 2016, but the release was eventually pushed back to November 2015 and it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes.\n\nIn September 2018, a new television series, titled \"Care Bears: Unlock the Magic\", was announced. The series is to premiere on the Boomerang premium streaming service. The series order includes 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts. The series will introduce a new character named Dibble, who will serve as \"the team\"s newest pet and companion\". \n\nThe franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (home to the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" referred to them as \"the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents of what we used to know as guardian angels: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen. Running against a Care Bear is like, well, running against the Easter Bunny.\"\n\nAccompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot. He only appeared in some of the franchise's early publications and on the DiC-produced TV episodes.\n\nThe ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.\n\nFor the new 2007 TV series, \"\", five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the movie, Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.\n\nSome elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of King Arthur. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary Camelot castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the Round Table used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, Sir Lancelot's name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.\n\nThroughout the movies and series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC television series, they battled against Professor Coldheart, his assistant Frostbite, and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced Wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant Beastly and his ill-tempered niece Shreeky, and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the movies, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in \"The Care Bears Movie\", Dark Heart in \"\", The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim & Dumb in \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\", and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in \"Care Bears Nutcracker Suite\". Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\", while \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\" introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persists into the new TV series, \"\".\n\nThe Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the \"Care Bear Stare\" (a.k.a. \"Belly Magic\"), in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective belly symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the belly being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and/or Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The movies \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" and \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" do not feature the Care Bear stare, but it does return in \"Oopsy Does It!\". In the new series, \"Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot\", the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates, but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol.\n\nIn the original animated specials and the DiC series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears...prepare to stare!\" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears Countdown!\"\n\nDuring the movies and the DiC series, the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the \"Care Bear Cousin Call\". In the DiC series, the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call. In the first movie, the Cousins, excluding Swift Heart Rabbit, simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any belly symbols; those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie. In the second movie, the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their belly symbols. By the start of the Nelvana series, the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.\n\nAlthough commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\", when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode \"Tell-Tale belly\".\n\nIn addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their belly symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.\n\nShown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\", the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on \"caring missions\" to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as thunderstorms, buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring \"anywhere\"), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.\n\nInitially, no mention was made of the Caring Meter in \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\" and the first season of \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\". With the release of \"Grizzle-y Adventures\", the franchise's first direct-to-DVD release, the Caring Meter has returned, and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again.\n\nApart from toys, books, greeting cards and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in merchandising as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods. During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and Spencer Gifts.\n\nWhen the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.\n\nIn his 1986 essay, \"The Shortcake Strategy\", Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as \"highly specialized\" toys. \"So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality\", he stated. \"Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.\"\n\nMany children's books have been based on, and have featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include \"Meet the Care Bear Cousins\" (based on the first movie), \"Sweet Dreams for Sally\", \"The Witch Down the Street\", \"The Trouble with Timothy\", and \"A Sister for Sam\". All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s. As of 2006, Scholastic Press has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past.\n\nIn \"Playing by Different Rules\", a 1988 book chronicling the Parker Brothers/General Mills merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) \"were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?\"\n\nBetween November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by Marvel's Star Comics; the books were drawn by DC Comics artist Howard Post. The November 13, 1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, the Madballs.\n\nDuring the same period, over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series.\n\nAt the height of the '80s Care Bears craze, Kid Stuff Records released several LPs based on the franchise. These included \"Introducing the Care Bears\", \"The Care Bears Care For You\", \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\", \"The Care Bears' Birthday Party\", and \"The Care Bears' Christmas\" (all from 1983), and 1986's \"Friends Make Everything Better\" (released as a promotion with Trianimic). They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during their prime.\n\nAll of the albums from 1983 (except for \"Birthday Party\") featured writing, production, and performance credits from Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (who were the lead singers of The Turtles, also known as Flo & Eddie; former Mothers of Invention from Frank Zappa's 1970–1972 period). The soundtrack album from The Care Bears Movie featured songs by Carole King and John Sebastian, who sang lead for The Lovin' Spoonful.\n\nIn the midst of the 2002 revival, Madacy Kids released brand new Care Bear CDs. In 2004, \"Meet the Care Bears\", \"Care Bears Holiday Hugs\", \"Care Bears Christmas Eve\", and the \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" soundtrack album came out, as well as \"Care Bears Nighty-Night\" the following year.\n\nThe cover of both \"Care Bears Holiday Hugs\" and \"Care Bears Nighty-Night\" advertises another two CDs, called \"Care Bears Share A Smile\" and \"Care Bears Let's Be Friends\". As of April 2008, Both Share A Smile and Let's Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www.Amazon.com and www.Walmart.com, however it is at this date not available as a physical CD. This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon.com and Walmart.com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America.\n\nApproximately 50 seconds into the music video for the breakout single \"I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer\" from Swedish rock band The Cardigans' sixth studio album \"Super Extra Gravity\", there is a brief appearance of Bedtime Bear. He is shown again for the last time at the 76th second, lying on a bed in close proximity to the featured dog.\n\nA Care Bears game was planned for the Atari 2600 in 1983. It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was canceled before testing could begin. The beta prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early alpha of the game. No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period.\n\nIn 2004, the Bears starred in their first official game, \"Care-a-lot Jamboree\" for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, \"Let's Have a Ball!\" was released. In the same year they were featured in \"Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring\" for the V.Smile educational game console.\n\nIn 2005, they appeared in \"Catch a Star\" (also for the PC) and \"Care Bears: Care Quest\" (for the Game Boy Advance).\n\nLike the movies, no game for any systems was produced in 2006, and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch. However, in August 2008, a new game, \"Care Bears Play Day\", was released for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front.\n\nthem, \"Care Bears Share-A-Story\", was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a Teddy Ruxpin. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears, Jack and the Beanstalk and the Three Little Pigs. A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays. The toy ships with the story \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", and additional story cartridges and books are to be purchased separately. Also, apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy.\n\nAdditionally, Care Bears Sing-along pals were also introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group (the effective wireless coverage being three feet, although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength). While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.\n\nAnother Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check-up. The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment. The interactive plush has soft-touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment.\n\nLastly, there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner. The line, called \"Hide 'N Seek Care Bears\", comes in two designs: Secret Bear and Surprise Bear. Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece. To play the toy, a third party, usually the parent, must partake in the game by hiding the bear. The child then has to find the bear, with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions.\n\nThe Care Bears appeared in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985. With the redesign of the characters on the heels of their 25th anniversary, the Care Bears returned to the parade for the holiday in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Also in those latter two years, they appeared at the Macy's Flower Show in the flagship New York store.\n\nIn 1984 and 1985, the Care Bears appeared at the San Diego Zoo in California, performing in a stage show at the amphitheater.\n\nTenderheart Bear, Funshine Bear and Cheer Bear appeared in a live-action 1985 TV special produced by ABC station WLS-TV in Chicago called \"Be A Safe Kid\", teaching kids how to be safe from strangers.\n\nIn the Summer and Fall of 1986 and 1987, the ABC television network toured shopping malls across the country with their stage show \"The ABC Family Fun Fair\" promoting their Saturday morning cartoon lineup for those years. With \"The Care Bears Family\" series as part of that block, some of the cast were part of the show...Funshine Bear, Cheer Bear and Braveheart Lion in the 1986 edition and Cheer Bear with Tenderheart Bear in the 1987 tour.\n\nDuring the Summers from 1988 through 1992, the Care Bears were the official characters in residence at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom near Allentown PA. On the park's Center Stage, they performed in \"The Care Bear Song & Dance Revue\" and also did many walkabout meets & greets with guests around the amusement park. Dorney Park also had the animatronic \"Care-A-Lot Castle\" show created by Sally Industries.\n\nTenderheart Bear appeared at the Teddy Bear Rally in Amherst, MA from 1996 to 2005.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, the Care Bears have appeared in the DooDah Parade in Ocean City, NJ.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the Care Bears starred in their own stage show, called \"Care Bears Live\", organized by VEE Corporation.\n\nThe Care Bears appeared in the 2007 St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, where, as grand marshal, Good Luck Bear ceremoneously dyed the Chicago River green from a motorboat.\n\nThe Care Bears have been appearing in the annual Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, BC, Canada since 2008.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday season, the Care Bears have done shows and appearances in Singapore at the Downtown East shopping mall and entertainment district from 2008 through 2010.\n\nDuring the 2010s, Tenderheart Bear has appeared in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in New York City.\n\nFunshine Bear and Share Bear appear in America's Children's Holiday Parade taking place in Oakland, CA early during the Christmas season.\n\nFunshine and Share have also been appearing in the Indy 500 Festival Parade in Indianapolis, IN over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nAs part of the Care Bears' 30th Anniversary, Share Bear appeared at the Noodlecat restaurant in San Diego, CA as part of The Hub's presence at Comicon 2012.\n\nAlso in connection with their 30th anniversary, Cheer Bear appeared at The Toonseum in Pittsburgh, PA during a 2012 exhibit about the Care Bears' animated television series, and also at the Pittsburgh Comic Arts Festival sponsored by them.\n\nOn the weekend in the middle of June 2013, Funshine Bear, Cheer Bear, Share Bear and Grumpy Bear appeared onstage for \"A Care Bears Dance Party\" at Sesame Place in Langhorne, PA.\n\nIn July 2013, Funshine Bear and Love-A-Lot Bear appeared at Anthrocon, a convention for the furry fandom in Pittsburgh, PA, which took place in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nIn April 2015, Cheer Bear appeared in the Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45223626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45223626", "title": "Cinema of Bhutan", "text": "Cinema of Bhutan\n\nThe cinema of Bhutan is a small but emerging industry, having started in the mid-1990s. It has since been supported by government officials and different businesses.\n\nBhutan's film industry is highly influenced by neighboring India's Bollywood, with most Bhutanese films being adaptations of Indian ones or based on the Bollywood format. Recently, there have been calls by local filmmakers for a tilt towards originality in Bhutanese cinema. Many films have started to blend Indian cinema with local Buddhist teachings and traditions, and Bollywood films are now rarely seen in Bhutanese cinema halls after more than a decade of domination. Storytelling based on Buddhist oral history and supernatural beliefs are increasingly influencing Bhutanese cinematic structure.\n\nIn 2003, \"Travellers and Magicians\" was the first feature film to be entirely shot within Bhutan. , Bhutan's film industry produces an average of thirty films a year.\n\nBy 2012, Thimpu had six cinema halls.\n\nBhutan's film industry is expected to grow and present innovative concepts and new types of internet and social media communication in this highly competitive market.\n\nConventional film made a fast beginning after a blend of a few systems by the Lumière brothers in France. After first open screening of movie on December 28, 1895 in Paris, film went far and wide. The Lumière siblings are said to have gone travelling with their alleged \"cinématographe\" in 1896, visiting Bombay, London, New York City and Buenos Aires. These days the digitization of accumulations and media and the ascent and development of new advancements for smaller buyer related applications summon central inquiries to the position of media partners and the customary ideal models.\n\nLittle and forthcoming country states and additionally generally prevailing \"silver screen\" nations such as Germany, France and the United States consider their silver screen, film and media industries as an remarkable chance to create aesthetic and business disclosure. There is a developing enthusiasm for up and coming country states and new film businesses grasping new media to draw in and increase, new markets, groups of onlookers (between) national fame and to build up a national personality.\n\nThe BBS narrative \"The Cost of Climate Change\" (2009) won the United Nations Correspondents Affiliation (UNVA) worldwide prize for Climate change. Dorji Wangchuk won a universal grant in 2003 for his film \"School Among Glaciers\" (Bhutan 2003). From that point forward this title has won 15 national and universal honors in radio and TV. The holder, a short film, coordinated by Jamyang Dorji, debuted at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and was screened in Brussels together with \"Original Photocopy of Joy\" by Dechen Roder. The Bhutan Beskop film celebration (2010, 2011) opens ways to elective expressions movies, and is viewed with extraordinary enthusiasm by outside media.\n\nThe business film industry is the fundamental generator of film preparations. Financial specialists and sometimes banks fund business preparations that are screened in one of Bhutan's seven cinemas, of which the Lugar lobby with 880 seats is the biggest.\n\nToday's Bhutan film industry creates a great (low spending plan) generation level and has all the earmarks of being a utilization industry, with included esteem from business and imaginative viewpoints. A sum of 152 Bhutanese movies were created in the main decade of the 21st century. Bhutan has two distribution houses. Business movies are periodically in light of an \"affection\" subject, here and there joined with a social issue (HIV, urbanization) taking after a customary script with exchanges, tunes, dances, complicated relations and a battle. Spending plans change from $15,000 to $50,000. Compensations for performers and vocalists have gone up from $1,000 (2006) to $10,000 per film for top on-screen characters in 2011. Real uses for film preparations are coordinations, gear and compensations.\n\nThe brut income for a well known film (up to 90,000 onlookers) may reach up to $140,000, while less well known movies may raise half of it and unpopular movies hazard shortages.\n\nMarket: the market of film buyers may develop, so will the enthusiasm for outside preparations increment when current, agreeable and sumptuous films will show up in huge urban communities. The greater part of the present low spending creations may do well in shoddy lodging; buyers with a higher buy power may lean toward global top creations from the SAARC district and past. Silver screen proprietors may get to be master dynamic software engineers and concentrate on chose customer gatherings to improve their benefits. Advertising powers may after some time dissuade the making of minimal cost residential productions.\n\nProduction: Bhutan's film industry has a couple of creation houses, leasing film gear; a couple travel operators encouraged outside movie producers shooting a narrative then again highlight film in Bhutan. A couple sound studios have showed up in Thimphu. A completely prepared film studio that incorporates into entryway shooting potential outcomes with cutting edge gear does not exist in Bhutan.\n\nQuality: Bhutanese group of onlookers incline toward local preparations to Indian (Bollywood) and American (Hollywood) movies, right now. For the most part since the theaters were appearing obsolete (shoddy) global movies. Local business movies are made with a low financial plan, taking after an arrangement increased in value by the present mass film purchasers. Developments happen in the non-business part. Upgrades are required on the whole parts of generation: script-writing, acting, method, sound, light, and stories.\n\nDissemination: Films are being circulated by the makers venturing to every part of the nation with the ace tape, a screen and DVD player to demonstrate the film in semi urban and provincial ranges in schools, metropolitan lobbies or the outside. Proficient merchants don't exist in Bhutan. Fear for robbery of new discharges and need for the makers to keep grasp on wages reject merchants coming in.\n\nRobbery: Piracy has been a worldwide issue and influences the Bhutan film industry. DVDs are effortlessly duplicated in Nepal/India and retailed through shops in the urban areas. Against theft control and security of aesthetic property are not powerful to date. Makers are hesitant to share their movies on DVD or with media (BBS, nearby TV stations). Elective deals strategies, as Web deals, pay by view, or deal through daily papers (purchase a paper, get a DVD) are not yet practiced.\n\nThe Bhutan film industry and its residential market offer sufficient chances to form into an expert and gainful industry. The expansion of procurement power furthermore, the interest for class stimulation will urge popular silver cinemas to come to Bhutan. Bhutan is increasing global intrigue and ubiquity on account of its image (exclusive, authentic, GNH), area/landscapes, stories and skilled performing artists. Pulling in outside preparations with best in class offices (studio, hardware, staff, coordinations) may create motivation and pay for both the film business and the Royal Government of Bhutan.\n\nMaking up for lost time with the Western multi media outlet (books, magazines, web, DVD/CD, web shops, appears, celebrations) opens ways to coordinate movies into an expansive supply of excitement for a developing purchaser showcase in Bhutan and beyond.The non-business segment is going to desert its underground status and may before long be prepared to get a relentless stage at global film celebrations.\n\nBhutan film industry requires a typical vision on grasping, executing and utilizing new instruments (TV, web, boisterous processing) of cutting edge film and Bhutan's forthcoming film industry. Bhutan's film industry requires pertinent guidelines and controls to oversee (between )national advancements and ventures. Issues like audit (restriction), theft, copyrights and standards and controls with respect to the parts of umbrella associations what's more, experts are to be managed by the media partners.\n\n"}

In 1994, she was featured on \"9th Wonder (Blakitolism)\", the first single from \"Blowout Comb\", the second album from Grammy winning rap group Digable Planets. Not only were her DJ cuts prominent on the hook and the outro, but Joyce also exchanged several ad libbed lines at the end of the song's third verse with group member Ladybug Mecca and she was acknowledged by name throughout the track, although she is referred to as Sweet Lime Pie, a name she used as an online persona, rather than by her own name.\n\nShe was a contestant on the first season of DJ reality show, \"Master of the Mix\", which aired on two cable networks: BET and Centric.\n\n"}
{"id": "2819454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2819454", "title": "Dreambox", "text": "Dreambox\n\nDreambox is a series of Linux-powered DVB satellite, terrestrial and cable digital television receivers (set-top boxes), produced by German multimedia vendor Dream Multimedia.\n\nThe Linux-based production software originally used by Dreambox was originally developed for DBox2, by the Tuxbox project. The Dbox2 was a proprietary design distributed by KirchMedia for their pay TV services. The bankruptcy of KirchMedia flooded the market with unsold boxes available for Linux enthusiasts. The Dreambox shares the basic design of the DBox2, including the Ethernet port and the PowerPC processor.\n\nIts firmware is officially user-upgradable, since it is a Linux-based computer, as opposed to third-party \"patching\" of alternate receivers. All units support Dream's own DreamCrypt conditional access (CA) system, with software-emulated CA Modules (CAMs) available for many alternate CA systems. The built-in Ethernet interface allows networked computers to access the recordings on the internal hard disks on some Dreambox models. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of DVB MPEG transport streams on distributed file systems or broadcast the streams as IPTV to VideoLAN and XBMC Media Center clients. Unlike many PC based PVR systems that use free-to-air type of DVB receiver cards, the built-in conditional access allows receiving and storing encrypted content.\n\nIn 2007, Dream Multimedia also introduced a non-Linux based Dreambox receiver, the DM100, their sole to date, still featuring an Ethernet port. It has a USB-B port for service instead of the RS232 or mini-USB connectors found on other models. Unlike all other Dreamboxes, it features an STMicroelectronics CPU instead of PowerPC or MIPS.\n\nThere are a number of different models of Dreambox available. The numbers are suffixed with -S for Satellite, -T for Terrestrial and -C for Cable:\n\n\nThe DM 7000 is based around the IBM STB04500 controller, featuring a PowerPC processor subsystem and hardware MPEG decoding, has 64 MiB of RAM, 8 MiB of NOR flash memory (directly executable), a Common Interface slot, a dual smart card reader, a CompactFlash card reader, a USB 1.1 port, and an IDE (also known as PATA) interface for attaching an internal 3.5 in hard disk drive to convert the unit into a digital video recorder. Accepts only 230 V AC power.\n\nBecause the boot loader resides in flash memory, this model may require the use of a JTAG in case of bad flashing which destroyed the boot loader. However, a bad flash will occur under rare scenarios, and rarely, almost never, will you need a JTAG.\n\nThere was a DM 5600 and also a DM 5620 model. The only difference being that the DM 5620 included an Ethernet port.\nOtherwise, the DM 56X0 models were a cut down version of the DM 7000 without an IDE interface. They did, however, include an RF modulator allowing them to be used with older TVs that lack a SCART connector.\n\nThe DM500 is the successor to the DM5620 and is the smallest and cheapest Dreambox. It is based around an IBM STBx25xx Digital Set-Top Box Integrated Controller, featuring notably a 252 MHz PowerPC processor subsystem, hardware MPEG-2 video and audio decoding and smart card interfaces. The DM500 features 32 MB of RAM and 8 MB of NOR flash memory, of which 5 MB are used for read-only firmware (cramfs and squashfs filesystems), 256 kB by the boot loader and the rest by a writable jffs2 filesystem.\n\nIt has the standard features of a free-to-air (FTA) satellite receiver, plus extensive Fast Ethernet networking connectivity and a single smart card reader. It does not feature a 7-segment LED display, normally found in other FTA decoders.\n\nAlso has the ability to be used on Digital satellite, cable and terrestrial broadcasts (also known as DVB-S, DVB-C, DVB-T).\n\nThe DM500+ model has 96 MB of RAM instead of 32, and 32 MB of NAND flash instead of 8 MB of NOR flash. This makes it similar to the DM600 PVR model. It is only available in DVB-S versions.\n\nThe new DM500HD was announced in Cologne on May 26, 2009. The price will be between and .\n\nThe DM 7020 is essentially an updated DM 7000 with 96 MiB of RAM, 32 MiB of NAND flash (disk-like) and an RF modulator. Changes were also made on the software side, utilizing Open Embedded for the base Linux operating system.\n\nBecause the flash memory of this model is not directly executable, the primary boot loader resides in ROM and can recover corrupted secondary boot loader in flash by loading from the serial port.\n\nThere are some Enigma 2 (beta) images already available for this model.\n\nThe DM 7025 is similar to the DM7020 but with the ability to add a second \"snap-in\" tuner that makes it possible to watch one program while recording another. It is possible to change the tuner module, selecting between any two of Satellite, Terrestrial or Cable versions.\n\nInternally, it features a Xilleon 226 system-on-a-chip from ATI, integrating a 300 MHz MIPS CPU core instead of the traditional PowerPC found in other models, and has 128 MiB of RAM. It uses Enigma 2, this is a complete rewrite of the original Enigma GUI, and is still going through growing pains as features that were present in Enigma are added to Enigma2. Enigma2 is Python-based instead of C code.\n\nThe DM 7025 has the ability to decode MPEG-2 HD as well. Unfortunately, it must downconvert this to 480i or 576i to display it.\nThe DM 7025+ model features an Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of an LCD one, an eject button on the Common Interface slot and improved power supply.\n\nThe DM 600 PVR is the same small size as the DM 500 but includes an IDE interface allowing to add an internal 2.5 in laptop-type hard disk drive, the box will only recognise 5600rpm drives. On the outside it adds an S-Video output connector and an analog modem port. It is built around the same IBM STBx25xx integrated controller, but features 32 MiB of flash and 96 MiB of RAM, of which 64 MiB are user-accessible. It is possible to change the tuner module, selecting between Satellite, Terrestrial and Cable versions. There is still just one SCART connector and no 7-segment LED display, just 2 status LEDs. The provided remote control unit is the same one supplied with the 7000, 7020 and 7025 and allows one to control the TV set as well.\n\nThis is essentially a high definition version of the DM 600 PVR, featuring a single pluggable DVB tuner (S/S2, C or T), a 300 MHz MIPS processor, 64 MiB of Flash memory, 256 MiB of RAM and room for an internal SATA 2.5 in disk. It also features one DVI to HDMi Cable, two USB 2.0, one eSATA and one 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet interfaces. It has an OLED display.\n\nDM 800HD se was introduced in late 2010. The main differences of the DM800HD se compared to the DM 800HD are a 400 MHz MIPS processor, a HDMI connector and a color OLED display. Another difference is the improved system chip in DM800se providing native DIVX support among other improvements.\n\nThis is the high definition PVR. Like the DM-7025, it supports pluggable tuner modules. In addition to High Definition, it has an upgrade for a DVD drive (slot in). And it has USB 2.0. Physically on the box it has one DVI-port, but with the supplied DVI to HDMi Cable you get HDMI video.\n\nOriginally announced to become available in the beginning of 2007, its release date was pushed back.\nThe product then began shipping on 12.12.2008. The planned features were revised as well. Originally, this model was supposed to have 128 MiB of RAM (now 256), 32 MiB of flash (now 256 MiB) and a 300 MHz processor (now 400 MHz Broadcom 7400). Other Linux-based HD receivers became available in the meantime.\n\nIn June 2012, Dream Multimedia announced the discontinuation of the DM 8000 HD PVR because several electronic components are no longer available. It was also announced, that no direct successor will be developed since Dream Multimedia is already working at \"Project Goliath\".\n\n\"Project Goliath\", announced in June 2012, is supposed to be a possible successor of several Dreambox models. According to Dream Multimedia, it is a \"totally new hardware and software product, combining all the features of the successful Dreambox series, and indeed will go beyond that\".\n\nThe factory-installed distribution on the Dreambox is mostly available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and uses standard Linux API's, including \"Linux DVB API\" and \"Linux Infrared Remote Control\" (LIRC). Several models (7025, 800 and 8000) use GStreamer as a multimedia framework. This configuration encourages enthusiasts to modify its functions, particularly in the form of so-called images.\n\nThere are also many third party addons and plugins available that will extend the functionality of the Dreambox. Some plugins are model specific, while others run on all boxes. Plugins such as Jukebox and SHOUTcast playback, also external XMLTV guides, a web browser are available, and a VLC media player interface for on demand streaming media. Games are also abundant like Pac-Man and Tetris.\n\nIn addition, unofficial third-party conditional access software modules (CAMs or emulators) are widely circulated on the Internet that emulate the CA systems developed by NDS (VideoGuard), Irdeto, Conax, Nagravision, Viaccess and other proprietary vendors. Some Dreambox owners use these \"softcams\" in conjunction with card sharing software to access pay TV services without a subscription card inserted in every connected box. This practice may be illegal in some jurisdictions and third-party software for this purpose is neither officially endorsed nor supported by Dream Multimedia and voids the official warranty.\n\nClones of the DM500-S are wide spread.\nAs a result, Dream Multimedia introduced the DM500+, with changes to try to prevent further counterfeiting.\n\nClones also exist of DM500, DM800, DM800se and DM800se V2 built around the same commodity IBM SoC chip and hence having identical or slightly superior features they are also sold without the Dreambox brand name (e.g., the Envision 500S, with 48 megabytes of RAM instead of 32, also available in a 500C cable version, the Eagle box or the Linbox 5558, or Sunray DM800se). They have a retail price approaching that of non-Linux receivers, generally a fraction of the Dreambox 500 price. Since they contain a copy of the copyrighted original DM500 bootloader program, the legality of these devices is questionable.\n\nIn April 2008, Dream Multimedia allegedly introduced a time bomb into their latest flash to disable the boot loader on counterfeit models. An unofficial firmware group called Gemini who used the latest flash drivers in their firmware, found that flash corruption would be caused on clone DM500-S receivers. Other developers of unofficial firmware groups would find boxes to be affected by this if they use the latest drivers, providing another time bomb is to be introduced.\n\n\n"}

The first two seasons aired in first-run syndication; Seasons 3 and 4 aired on the PAX network.\n\nThe series was set in a town named Bal Harbor that was supposed to be in the Florida Keys region. (There is an actual town in Florida with a similar name, Bal Harbour, Florida just north of the City of Miami Beach.) However, it was largely filmed in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Three episodes during the first season, including the pilot, were filmed in Pigeon Key, Florida and at the Dolphin Research Center in Grassy Key, Florida.\n\nThe series is unrelated to the 1996 film of the same title which was also a remake of the 1960s TV series and films.\n\nSeason 1 opens with the adult Dr. Keith \"Bud\" Ricks (Brian Wimmer) from the original 1964 \"Flipper\" series leading dolphin research at the Bal Harbour Marine Institute in the Florida Keys. Dr. Pam Blondell (Colleen Flynn) is a naval officer, relocated to the Florida Keys to join Dr. Ricks at the institute to perform dolphin research. Dr. Blondell is accompanied by her son Mike (Payton Haas), a rebellious teen. Mike is unhappy about the move until he meets Maya Graham (Jessica Alba), a free-spirited 14-year-old girl who has a special connection with Flipper and the ocean.\n\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Dr. Ricks, Dr. Blondell, and her son Mike are written out of the series by leaving Bal Harbour. Dr. Jennifer Daulton takes over as the institute's director. Maya becomes an intern at the institute, while two new interns, Dean Gregson (Scott Michaelson) and Holly Myers (Anja Coleby), are introduced. Next door to the institute, a new substation for Air Sea Rescue opens, introducing Deputies Tom Hampton (Whip Hubley) and Quinn Garnett (Wren T. Brown). The deputies are responsible for rescuing people in trouble at sea, and perform numerous rescues through the season. Hampton and Dr. Daulton have an on-and-off romance during the season. Edward \"Cap\" Daulton (Gus Mercurio), Dr. Daulton's estranged father, also moves to Bal Harbour to try and re-establish a relationship with his daughter. Cap is a charter boat captain and owns his own boat, the Maria D, named after his late wife.\n\nIn Season 3, Dr. Daulton and Maya are written out of the series by leaving Bal Harbour to perform research in the Red Sea and San Diego. Lt. Alex Parker (Tiffany Lamb), a navy marine, becomes the institute's director, and marries Tom Hampton. Hampton and Parker, along with her two kids, Chris (Craig Marriott) and Jackie (Laura Donaldson), set up housekeeping, and the series begins to focus more on their family. Deputy Mark Delaney (Darrin Klimek) also replaces Garnett as Hampton's partner at the substation. At the marine institute, Holly remains an intern, but Dean leaves. Cap still appears throughout Seasons 3 and 4 but is noticeably absent from many episodes.\n\nIn Season 4, Tom's niece Courtney Gordon (Skye Patch), moves in with the Hampton/Parker family after being unhappy living with her mother in Washington D.C. Season 4 is essentially a continuation of Season 3 with no major changes. Most episodes are self-contained and there is very little in the way of serialized storylines between episodes.\nThe series ends on a shockingly tragic note as Flipper accidentally becomes beached on a sand dune and is unable to free himself. Upon learning what has happened, the entire cast rushes to the scene but arrives too late; Flipper's heart stops as they are trying to save him. The final scene of the series shows Jackie mourning Flipper's loss, then he's shown to be alive and the show ends with them playing in the water and she says \"Everything's gonna be just fine\".\n\n\nSince \"Flipper\" was filmed in Australia, producers had to rely heavily on Australian talent. Several regular cast members and most guest stars spoke their dialogue using non-native American accents. During Seasons 3 and 4, Whip Hubley and Gus Mercurio were the only American actors in the main cast. All other main characters were portrayed by Australian actors.\n\n\"Flipper\" had many notable guest stars, including Alan Dale, Dwight Schultz, Nicholas Hammond, Jane Badler, Robert Coleby (father of Anja Coleby), and Season Hubley (real life sister of Whip Hubley). In fact, many of these guest stars made more than one appearance, portraying different characters each time. Seasons 3 and 4 regular cast member Darrin Klimek also appeared briefly as a different character in the Season 1 episode \"Treasure Hunt\".\n\nMGM Home Entertainment released the first season of \"Flipper—The New Adventures\" on DVD on June 3, 2010 via Amazon.com's CreateSpace program. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Amazon.com.\n\nOn April 2, 2013, TGG Direct released seasons 2–4 on Region 1 DVD.\n\nThe primary setting for \"Flipper\" was The Bal Harbor Research Institute, a fictional dolphin research facility funded by the fictional Bal Harbor University.\n\nBetween Seasons 1 and 2, The Air Sea Rescue Substation was built next door to the Research Institute when the series began focusing less on ocean and dolphin research based plots. The Air Sea Rescue was located directly on the beach and had access to its own helicopter and hovercraft for rescues. A speedboat was also added in Season 3.\n\nThe Shipwreck was a restaurant located between the marine institute and the substation. The restaurant opened in Season 2 and was featured until the end of the series. During Season 1, the Shipwreck's building was the residence of Dr. Keith Ricks.\n\nAt the start of Season 3, Tom Hampton married Alex Parker and they moved into a house with Alex's children, Chris and Jackie. The house contained an in-ground swimming pool and large dock.\n\nInitial production on \"Flipper\" began in the Florida Keys with the pilot and two other episodes filmed there in Season 1. Three locations were used for the \"Bal Harbor Research Institute\" including Pigeon Key and the Dolphin Research Center on Grassy Key, with a third location used for the beach where Maya first meets Mike. A fourth location, just east of Conch Key adjacent to Overseas Highway 1, was used when Maya meets Keith in a Jeep to inform him Mike is in trouble. This is the same location used in the movie \"True Lies\".\n\nThree different filming locations were used to portray the Research Institute. The pool area of the institute was filmed at Sea World, Gold Coast. The two-story building was notable for being the only set used for the entire run of the series, although it did not appear in every episode. The same set was re-used with little modification for other film and television productions such as Sabrina Down Under. After filming on Flipper wrapped, the building was demolished in order to accommodate Sea World's Imagine Dolphin Show attraction located nearby. Although the area is unrecognizable today, an aerial shot in the Season 1 episode \"F. Scott\" shows the original configuration of the building at Sea World.\n\nDuring the first two seasons only, indoor office space for the institute also appears. It is believed that this was filmed on a soundstage at either Sea World or Warner Bros. Movie World.\n\nThe exterior façade of the institute's building along the waterfront was filmed in park space abutting the Gold Coast Broadwater located in Southport, Queensland (a suburb of Gold Coast) near Ephraim Island. The Ephraim Island road bridge is visible in many waterfront shots in the latter half of the series. The same location was used for the Air Sea Rescue Substation and The Shipwreck. All three buildings along the beachfront and park space were demolished in the early 2000s to make way for apartment buildings and a small harbour.\n\nThe Hampton/Parker family home was filmed at an actual house (now known as McKinnon House) located at 1 Howard St. in the Gold Coast suburb of Runaway Bay. The house was located just south of the research institute, substation, and shipwreck filming locations. The exterior of the house today is relatively unchanged since filming of Flipper wrapped in 2000.\n\nNumerous scenes were filmed in and under the water. Many scenes above water were filmed in the channels and islands of the Gold Coast Broadwater while some diving scenes were filmed in giant water tanks located at Warner Bros. Movie World.\n\nDaytime Emmy Awards\n\n\n"}

Following the introduction of commercial VCR Beta recorders in 1975 (and the VHS format in 1976), VCR production in Japan went from one million units in 1978 to 44 million by 1985 fueled largely by the number of movies (including pornography) available on VHS. By November 1984, the company had expanded enough to move to new headquarters in the fashionable Harajuku district of Tokyo.\n\nThe company originally used the \"Penguin\" () label for its videos but in April 1986, JHV founded Alice Japan (アリスJAPAN) as a label for their adult videos (AV). The company subsequently expanded into softcore movies, anime productions, computer games and, in 1996, the satellite broadcasting business. In February 2000, JHV acquired a building in the Jinbocho area of Tokyo and transferred its headquarters there. A further move brought the Production Center to their own building in Tokyo's Nakano City in March 2005 which also became the company headquarters in April 2007.\n\nFor the 2007 fiscal year, the corporation had sales of 2.25 billion yen (about $22.5 million) and a capital of 27 million yen (about $227,000). The company employed 34 people and had its headquarters in the JHV Building () in Nakano, Tokyo.\n\nThe company is involved in the production and distribution of film, video products, music and TV programs.\n\nJHV has produced and/or distributed a number of theatrical movies, including several in the science fiction or horror genre and often with erotic overtones. Some notable film productions include the 1989 cult horror movie \"\" directed by Shinya Tsukamoto and the Yakuza zombie flic \"Junk: Shiryô-gari\" from 2000. Also in the horror genre were \"Evil Dead Trap\" or \"Shiryo no wana\" directed by Toshiharu Ikeda and featuring AV actress Hitomi Kobayashi which was released in 1988 and the sequel \"Evil Dead Trap 2: Hideki\" (死霊の罠2ヒデキ) from 1992. \"Evil Dead Trap\" was later released by JHV on DVD.\n\nJHV also produced the first three live-action videos of the manga based superheroine series \"Kekko Kamen\", the 1991 \"Kekko Kamen\", \"Kekko Kamen 2\" from 1992, and \"Kekko Kamen 3\", released in 1993.\n\nMore recent productions were the 2004 drama which won awards at the 2005 Yokohama Film Festival for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best New Director and the 2004 comedy \"eiko\" (エイコ).\n\nJHV's \"Cinemadict Collection\" () is a series of remastered worldwide classic movies with Japanese subtitles released on DVD. The collection includes the hard-to-find Alfred Hitchcock silent film \"Downhill\".\n\nIn the area of erotica, JHV makes softcore V-Cinema videos under the V Muvii () label or the SEN Planning label. Some popular series are the soft S&M \"Escape Confinement\" (), \"Keep Masked\" () and \"Pink Curtain\" ().

{"id": "5387123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5387123", "title": "Korean horror", "text": "Korean horror\n\nKorean horror (K-horror) films have been around since the early years of Korean cinema, however, it was not until the late 1990s that the genre began to experience a renewal. Many of the Korean horror films tend to focus on the suffering and the anguish of characters rather than focus on the explicit \"blood and guts\" aspect of horror. Korean horror features many of the same motifs, themes, and imagery as Japanese horror.\n\nModern South Korean horror films are typically distinguished by stylish directing, themes of social commentary, and genre blending . The horror and thriller genres are cited as gaining international attention to South Korean Cinema.\n\nAmerican Hollywood has adapted several Korean horror films such as Oldboy (2003 film), Into the Mirror (2003), and A Tale of Two Sisters (2003). Train to Busan (2016) and The Wailing (film) (2016) are rumored to currently have remakes in talks for production. \n\nThe expression, \"When a woman is full of resentment, she will bring frost in May and June\" may offer some explanation for the popularity of the female ghost that is often featured in Korean horror films. Her deep feeling of resentment is cold enough to freeze the hot air that occurs during those months. The woman's vengeance is a thing to be feared, thus becoming the object of horror. In the past women have been oppressed and ignored for so long that the horrific rage and vengeance we see in the films have been brought upon by the many years of repression. Another belief is that when a female dies before she gets to enjoy the pleasures of marriage and having children, she will not be able to move on to the \"other side\". Instead she becomes trapped between the two worlds and causes horrific phenomena.\n\nSouth Korean cinema is known for violent thrillers with themes of revenge like Bedevilled (2010 film), I Saw the Devil (2010), and The Vengeance Trilogy. The desire to create and see films about revenge is often explained as a result of social anger built up in a populace by South Korea's turbulent history. Park Chan-wook director of The Vengeance Trilogy has said that his revenge motivated movies serve as a reaction to Korean culture's traditional value of peace making and Forgiveness. \n\nThe 2010 Korean Horror Film Festival was held in Mandaluyong City in the Philippines at the Shangri-La Plaza Mall from October 27–31 and through November 2–4. It worked together with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, The Korean-Philippine Foundation, Inc. and Shangri-La Plaza. With free admission attendees were treated to some of the best and highly successful Korean horror films. Films such as \"Arang\", \"The Red Shoes\", \"M\", \"Hansel and Gretel\", \"Ghost\", \"Paradise Murdered\", and \"Epitaph\" were among the films showcased.\n\n\"Whispering Corridors\" (1998) is seen as the film to have sparked the explosion of the Korean horror genre. It centers on the theme of school girls and the mysterious \"other side\", but also offered criticism of the Korean school system. Four more distinct horror films set in all girls schools were made as part of Whispering Corridors (film series).\n\n\"A Tale of Two Sisters\" (2003) is the highest grossing Korean horror film so far and the first to be screened in America. It was remade in America in 2009 as \"The Uninvited\". Based on a folk tale titled \"Janghwa Hongreyon-jon\", it tells the story of two sisters dealing with a controlling stepmother and a passive father.\n\nSave the Green Planet! (2003) demonstrates Korean cinema's ability to blend genre in non-traditional ways. The film follows an unstable man who kidnaps and tortures an executive he believes to be an alien. It combines slapstick comedy, psychological thriller and sci fi horror.\n\nTrain to Busan (2016) is an action horror take on the Zombie apocalypse. The film is one of the most internationally successful films from South Korea and broke domestic box office records.\n\nfilms such as \"\" (2018) have brought Korean horror films even more international attention.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2966245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2966245", "title": "Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude", "text": "Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude\n\nLeisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude is a 2004 video game, part of the \"Leisure Suit Larry\" series. The game introduces a new main character, Larry Lovage, as Larry Laffer's nephew.\n\nLike many other current games, \"Magna Cum Laude\" has a free exploration mode where Larry can walk about campus and interact with students and personnel on the premises. In this mode, Larry can search for hidden money or tokens, strike poses to impress girls, and take photos which can later be sold to collectors. At several locations on campus a minigame can be entered, usually by \"activating\" an object or a person (starting a conversation). The player must win most of the minigames in order to advance. Minigames started by a conversation usually increase the affection of one of the girls; other minigames can provide money or increase \"confidence\".\n\nThe game originally received an \"Adults Only\" rating from the ESRB and was subsequently edited to receive a more commercial \"Mature\" rating in the United States and Canada. In Europe, the game was released unedited on all three systems and featured a disclaimer on the packaging highlighting that it was \"uncut\". The unedited version was eventually released in North America under the title \"Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude—Uncut and Uncensored!\". The major difference between the two North American releases is that the uncut and uncensored version contains full frontal nudity and sex scenes, although the latter contains very little and is mostly implied. Both versions were refused classification by the OFLC and effectively banned in Australia.\n\nThe main protagonist, Larry Lovage, is a student at Walnut Log Community College whose purpose is to get on a dating TV show called \"Swingles\". Uma Yasmine, the hostess of the show won't allow Larry on the show until he will prove his seductive wits by obtaining \"tokens of affection\". Sixteen college girls will conveniently be at his disposal. His aging uncle, Larry Laffer, from the original games, provides brief advice and appears at a local bar. Larry also must outsmart a sorority house and a fraternity house, known as Dio, where they recite lines that are actually modified lyrics of Black Sabbath songs.\n\nA brief subplot involves the college's arena football team going against a rival team known as the \"Maiming Maggots\". However, the college's team name is a running gag because it is obscured by objects, only revealing it as \"Flaming Fa-\". The final scene shows the team name is actually the \"Flaming Fantasticks\" after the Swingles van leaves the school.\n\nIn 2003, Sierra Entertainment announced that the \"Leisure Suit Larry\" franchise was being revived with an eighth game, called \"Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude\". This is the first game in which Al Lowe is not involved in any way, as this game was created by game developer High Voltage Software, Inc. On his website, Lowe talks about how he was in talk with Sierra about working with them on the game, but they stopped contacting him, as they went into downsizing. Later he received a letter from a writer on the game, where it is revealed that the game had long since been written by the time he entered discussions with Sierra.\n\nThe new Larry game does not star Larry Laffer, but a new character: his nephew, Larry Lovage. There are numerous homages to the earlier Larry games: Larry Laffer is the tutorial guide and giver of questionable advice for Larry Lovage; Larry's computer is playing \"\" (\"the best game of its time\"); and secret tokens featuring the likeness of the \"Where's Dildo?\" character from \"Larry 7\" can be collected. The loose storyline of the game is that Larry wants to appear on a dating TV show called \"Swingles\", but he must prove his worth before he is allowed on air.\n\nReviews of the game were mixed, with some praising the game for its humor but panning it for its gameplay. Many critics also took the game to task for its sexual content and humor being too direct and obvious, citing that much of the charm of the series has been in its more subtle handling of the dirty jokes and sexual situations, focusing more on double entendres than actual foul words and hints at nudity rather than full-on bare breasts. Al Lowe denounced \"Magna Cum Laude\" vigorously, emphasizing on his website that he took no part of its creation after being promised a role in its creation.\n\n"}
{"id": "13065182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13065182", "title": "Lip dub", "text": "Lip dub\n\nA lip dub is a type of music video that combines lip synching and audio dubbing to make a music video. It is made by filming individuals or a group of people lip synching while listening to a song or any recorded audio then dubbing over it in post editing with the original audio of the song. There is often some form of mobile audio device used such as an MP3 player. Often they look like simple music videos, although many involve a lot of preparation and production. Lip dubs are usually done in a single unedited shot that often travel through different rooms and situations within a building. They have become popular with the advent of mass participatory video content sites like YouTube.\n\nAlthough lip dubbing in music videos was not a new concept, Jake Lodwick, the co-founder of Vimeo, coined the term \"lip dubbing\" on December 14, 2006, in a video entitled \"Lip Dubbing: Endless Dream\". In the video's description, he wrote, \"I walked around with a song playing in my headphones, and recorded myself singing. When I got home I opened it in iMovie and added an MP3 of the actual song, and synchronized it with my video. Is there a name for this? If not, I suggest 'lip dubbing'.\" Lodwick subsequently directed the \"Flagpole Sitta\" \"office lip dub\" in April 2007 which \"The Washington Post\" covered.\n\nStudents in the Digital Media department at Hochschule Furtwangen produced the first university lip dub.\n\nSince then, dozens of lip dubs have been coordinated around the world by students. After L'Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) produced a lip dub to The Black Eyed Peas' \"I Gotta Feeling\" in 2009, the viral video phenomenon gained international acclaim.\n\nThe use of camera stabilization hardware is commonly used to provide an easy-to-watch and smooth final product.\n\nTom Johnson, a technical writer who blogs about Web 2.0's effect on communication, describes a good lip dub as having the characteristics, or at least the appearance, of spontaneity, authenticity, group participation and fun.\n\nIn September 2010, the season première of \"The Office\" (\"Nepotism\") begins with the workers of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company doing a lip dub of The Human Beinz's \"Nobody but Me\" through the office.\n\nThe record of most people participating at a lip dub is 9,300 on May 31, 2012 in Lindsay, Ontario. The Lindsay LipDub surpassed the previous record of 5,771, which was on October 24, 2010 in the town of Vic. The previous record was set to the rhythm of \"La Flama\" by the Valencian band Obrint Pas and is called Lipdub per la Independència de Catalunya \"Lipdub for the Independence of Catalonia\" The record is not recognised by Guinness.\n\nOn May 22, 2011, director Rob Bliss and producer Scott Erickson made a video called \"Grand Rapids Lip Dub\" in response to a Newsweek article that listed Grand Rapids, Michigan #10 on a list of \"America's Dying Cities.\" The video was labeled by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times as \"The greatest music video ever made.\" The nearly nine-minute video used 5,000 citizens of the city lip-synching to Don McLean's \"American Pie\". Released via YouTube on May 26, 2011, the video received over 2 million views in the first week and was the 9th most viewed YouTube video on May 28, 2011. Since its 2011 release, the video has been viewed over 5 million times.\n\nSimilarly, on May 31, 2012, Stratta Creative made a lip dub video called Lindsay LipDub with the goal of becoming Canada's first citywide lip dub, as well as a world record holder for most participants (with 9300 participants), in the community of Lindsay, Ontario. The City of Kawartha Lakes, of which Lindsay is a community, was listed as #188 of 190 cities in Canada by \"MoneySense\", and the community gathered to perform a lip dub, promoted by Rick Mercer, George Stroumboulopoulos, Craig Kielburger, Dan Kanter and Hedley (band).\n"}

{"id": "18033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18033", "title": "Little Nemo", "text": "Little Nemo\n\nLittle Nemo is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Winsor McCay. He originated in an early comic strip by McCay, \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\", before receiving his own spin-off series, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\". The full-page weekly strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel. The strip is considered McCay's masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail.\n\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" ran in the \"New York Herald\" from October 15, 1905, until July 23, 1911; the strip was renamed In the Land of Wonderful Dreams when McCay brought it to William Randolph Hearst's \"New York American\", where it ran from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914. When McCay returned to the \"Herald\" in 1924, he revived the strip, and it ran under its original title from Aug 3, 1924, until December 26, 1926, when McCay returned to Hearst.\n\nA weekly fantasy adventure, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" featured the young Nemo (\"No one\" in Latin) who dreamed himself into wondrous predicaments from which he awoke in bed in the last panel. The first episode begins with a command from King Morpheus of Slumberland to a minion to collect Nemo. Nemo was to be the playmate of Slumberland's Princess, but it took months of adventures before Nemo finally arrived; a green, cigar-chewing clown named Flip was determined to disturb Nemo's sleep with a top hat emblazoned with the words \"Wake Up.\" Nemo and Flip eventually become companions, and are joined by an African Imp whom Flip finds in the Candy Islands. The group travels far and wide, from shanty towns to Mars, to Jack Frost's palace, to the bizarre architecture and distorted funhouse-mirror illusions of Befuddle Hall.\n\nThe strip shows McCay's understanding of dream psychology, particularly of dream fears—falling, drowning, impalement. This dream world has its own moral code, perhaps difficult to understand. Breaking it has terrible consequences, as when Nemo ignores instructions not to touch Queen Crystalette, who inhabits a cave of glass. Overcome with his infatuation, he causes her and her followers to shatter, and awakens with \"the groans of the dying guardsmen still ringing in his ears\".\n\nAlthough the strip began October 15, 1905 with Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, making his first attempt to bring Little Nemo to his realm, Nemo did not get into Slumberland until March 4, 1906 and, due to Flip's interfering, did not get to see the Princess until July 8. His dream quest is always interrupted by either him falling out of bed, or his parents forcibly waking him up.\n\nOn July 12, 1908, McCay made a major change of direction: Flip visits Nemo and tells him that he has had his uncle destroy Slumberland. (Slumberland had been dissolved before, into day, but this time it appeared to be permanent.) After this, Nemo's dreams take place in his home town, though Flip—and a curious-looking boy named the Professor—accompany him. These adventures range from the down-to-earth to Rarebit-fiend type fantasy; one very commonplace dream had the Professor pelting people with snowballs. The famous \"walking bed\" story was in this period. Slumberland continued to make sporadic appearances until it returned for good on December 26, 1909.\n\nStory-arcs included Befuddle Hall, a voyage to Mars (with a well-realized Martian civilization), and a trip around the world (including a tour of New York City).\n\nMcCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, and architectural and other detail. From the second installment, McCay had the panel sizes and layouts conform to the action in the strip: as a forest of mushrooms grew, so did the panels, and the panels shrank as the mushrooms collapsed on Nemo. In an early Thanksgiving episode, the focal action of a giant turkey gobbling Nemo's house receives an enormous circular panel in the center of the page. McCay also accommodated a sense of proportion with panel size and shape, showing elephants and dragons at a scale the reader could feel in proportion to the regular characters. Narrative pacing McCay controlled through variation or repetition, as with equally-sized panels whose repeated layouts and minute differences in movement conveyed a feeling of buildup to some climactic action.\n\nIn his familiar Art Nouveau-influenced style McCay outlined his characters in heavy blacks. Slumberland's ornate architecture was reminiscent of the architecture designed by McKim, Mead & White for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, as well as Luna Park and Dreamland in Coney Island, and the Parisian Luxembourg Palace.\n\nMcCay made imaginative use of color, sometimes changing the backgrounds' or characters' colors from panel to panel in a psychedelic imitation of a dream experience. The colors were enhanced by the careful attention and advanced Ben Day lithographic process employed by the \"Herald\"s printing staff. McCay annotated the \"Nemo\" pages for the printers with the precise color schemes he wanted.\n\nFor the first five months the pages were accompanied with captions beneath them, and at first the captions were numbered. In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in the speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility, and \"disfigur otherwise flawless work\", according to critic R. C. Harvey. The level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering highlights what seems to be the little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition. They tend to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and showed that McCay's gift was in the visual and not the verbal.\n\nMcCay used traditional ethnic stereotypes prominently in \"Little Nemo\", as in the ill-tempered Irishman Flip, and the nearly-mute African Impie.\n\nWinsor McCay ( – 1934) had worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist in carnivals and dime museums before he began working for newspapers and magazines in 1898. In 1903, he joined the staff of the \"New York Herald\" family of newspapers, where he had success with comic strips such as \"Little Sammy Sneeze\" (1904–06) and \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" (1904–11)\n\nIn 1905, McCay got \"an idea from the \"Rarebit Fiend\" to please the little folk\". In That October, the full-page Sunday strip \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" debuted in the \"Herald\". Considered McCay's masterpiece, its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay's son Robert, had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel. McCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail. The \"Herald\" was considered to have the highest quality color printing of any newspaper at the time. Its printing staff used the Ben Day process for color.\n\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" debuted on the last page of the Sunday comics section of \"The New York Herald\" on October 15, 1905. The full-page, color comic strip ran until July 23, 1911. In spring 1911, McCay moved to William Randolph Hearst's \"New York American\" and took \"Little Nemo\"s characters with him. The \"Herald\" held the strip's copyright, but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters. In the \"American\", the strip ran under the title \"In the Land of Wonderful Dreams\". The \"Herald\" was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip.\n\nMcCay left Hearst in May 1924 and returned to the \"Herald Tribune\". He began \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" afresh that August 3. The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid. Nemo took a more passive role in the stories, and there was no continuity. The strip came to an end in December 1926, as it was not popular with readers. Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the \"American\", and succeeded in 1927. Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo's success, the \"Herald Tribune\" signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.\n\nIn 1937, McCay's son Robert attempted to carry on his father's legacy by reviving \"Little Nemo\". Comic book packager Harry \"A\" Chesler's syndicate announced a Sunday and daily \"Nemo\" strip, credited to \"Winsor McCay, Jr.\" Robert also drew a comic-book version for Chesler called \"Nemo in Adventureland\" featuring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original \"Nemo\" strip from McCay's original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last.\n\nIn 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many \"Little Nemo\" strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Bob had worked. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of \"Little Nemo\" strips in Italy. His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University.\n\nCollector Peter Maresca self-published a volume of \"Nemo\" Sundays as \"Little Nemo in Slumberland: So Many Splendid Sundays!\". The volume was large enough to reproduce the pages at the size they originally appeared in newspapers. Restoration work took Maresca five to twenty hours per page A second volume, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland: Many More Splendid Sundays!\", appeared in 2008.\n\nAs early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to put \"Little Nemo\" on stage. In summer 1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant \"Little Nemo\" show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. It starred dwarf Gabriel Weigel as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip. Reviews were positive, and it played to sold-out houses in New York. It went on the road for two seasons. McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where \"Little Nemo\" played. When a Keith circuit refused to let McCay perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise. In several cities, McCay brought his son, who sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo as publicity.\n\nAs part of an improvised story, Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a \"Whiffenpoof\". The word stuck with the public, and became the name of a and a singing group. One reviewer of the 1908 operetta gave a paragraph of praise to the comic hunting tales presented in a scene in which three hunters are trying to outdo each other with hunting stories about the \"montimanjack,\" the \"peninsula,\" and the \"whiffenpoof.\" He calls it \"one of the funniest yarns ever spun\" and compares it favorably to Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark. One source indicates that the dialogue in fact began as an ad lib by actor Joseph Cawthorn, covering for some kind of backstage problem during a performance. The Word is also referred in one of the Little Nemo comic strips published in 1909 (April 11). After being held down by nine policemen during a hysteria crisis, Nemo’s father tells the doctor: “Just keep those whiffenpoofs away. Will you?”.\n\nDespite the show's success, it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses, and came to an end in December 1910.\nIn mid-2012 Toronto-based theatre company Frolick performed an adaptation of the strip into \"Adventures in Slumberland\", a multimedia show featuring puppets large and small and a score that included as a refrain \"Wake Up Little Nemo\", set to the tune of The Everly Brothers' 1957 hit \"Wake Up Little Susie\". Talespinner Children's Theatre in Cleveland, OH produced a scaled-down, \"colorful and high-energy 45-minute\" adaptation in 2013, \"Adventures In Slumberland\" by David Hansen.\n\nIn March 2017, a short, one-act adaptation of the \"Little Nemo\" adventures was staged at Fordham University in New York City. The play, simply entitled \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\", was written by Aladdin Lee Grant Rutledge Collar, and directed by student Peter McNally. The six person cast, as well as creative team, consisted of students and alums at the university.\n\nMcCay played an important role in the early history of animation. In 1911 he completed his first film, \"Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics\" (also known as \"Little Nemo\"), first in theatres and then as part of his vaudeville act. McCay made the 4,000 rice-paper drawings for the animated portion of the film. The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film's total length. Photography was done at the Vitagraph Studios under the supervision of animation pioneer James Stuart Blackton. During the live-action portion of the film, McCay bets his colleagues he can make his drawings move. He wins the bet by animating his \"Little Nemo\" characters, who shapeshift and transform.\n\nIn 1984, Arnaud Sélignac produced and directed a film called \"Nemo\" or \"Dream One\", starring Jason Connery, Harvey Keitel and Carole Bouquet. It involves a little boy called Nemo, who wears pajamas and travels to a fantasy world, but otherwise the connection to McCay's strip is a loose one. The fantasy world is a dark and dismal beach, and Nemo encounters characters from other works of fiction rather than those from the original strip. Instead of Flip or the Princess, Nemo meets Zorro, Alice and Jules Verne's Nautilus (which was led by Captain Nemo).\n\nA joint American-Japanese feature-length film \"\" was released in 1989, with contributions by Ray Bradbury, Chris Columbus and Moebius, and music by the Sherman Brothers. The story tells of a quest by Nemo and friends to rescue King Morpheus from the Nightmare King. The Princess is given a name, Camille, and Nemo has a pet squirrel named Icarus.\n\nThe Sarasota Opera commissioned composer Daron Hagen and librettist J. D. McClatchy to create an opera based on \"Little Nemo\". Two casts of children alternated performances when it debuted in November 2012. The dreamlike nonlinear story told of Nemo, the Princess, and their comrades trying to prevent the Emperor of Sol and the Guardian of Dawn from bringing daylight to Slumberland. Special effects and shifting backgrounds were produced with projections onto a scaffolding of boxes. The work was first performed on November 10 and 11, 2012, by members of the Sarasota Opera, Sarasota Youth Opera, Sarasota Prep Chorus, The Sailor Circus and students from Booker High school.\n\nIn 1990, Capcom produced a video game for the NES, titled \"\" (known as \"Pajama Hero Nemo\" in Japan), a licensed game based on the 1989 film. The film would not see a US release until 1992, two years after the game's Japanese release, so the game is often thought to be a standalone adaptation of \"Little Nemo\", not related to the film. An arcade game called simply \"Nemo\" was also released in 1990.\n\nThroughout the years, various pieces of Little Nemo merchandise have been produced. In 1941, Rand, McNally & Co. published a Little Nemo children's storybook. \"Little Nemo in Slumberland in 3-D\" was released by Blackthorne Publishing in 1987; this reprinted Little Nemo issues with 3-D glasses. A set of 30 Little Nemo postcards was available through Stewart Tabori & Chang in 1996. In 1993, as promotion for the 1989 animated film, Hemdale produced a Collector's Set which includes a VHS movie, illustrated storybook, and cassette soundtrack. In 2001, Dark Horse Comics released a Little Nemo statue and tin lunchbox.\n\nLittle Nemo itself is influenced by children stories in general, and some French comic pages in particular.\nSince its publishing, \"Little Nemo\" has had an influence on other artists, including Peter Newell (\"The Naps of Polly Sleepyhead\"), Frank King (\"Bobby Make-Believe\"), Clare Briggs (\"Danny Dreamer\") or George McManus (\"Nibsy the Newsboy in Funny Fairyland\"). Through the Paris edition of the New York Herald, his influence reached France and other European countries.\n\nIn children's literature, Maurice Sendak has said that this strip inspired his book \"In the Night Kitchen\", and William Joyce included several elements from Little Nemo in his children's book \"Santa Calls\", including appearances by Flip and the walking bed.\n\nThe character and themes from the comic strip \"Little Nemo\" were used in a song \"Scenes from a Night's Dream\" written by Tony Banks and Phil Collins of the progressive rock group Genesis on their 1978 recording, \"...And Then There Were Three...\".\n\nAnother progressive rock group, from Germany, called Scara Brae also recorded a musical impression of the comic on their rare self-titled disc from 1981 (the track was actually recorded 2 years earlier). Their concept piece was revived on the second album by the Greek band Anger Department, oddly called 'The Strange Dreams of A Rarebit Fiend', again after a McCay-comic. Their 'Little Nemo' was chosen for a theatre play, which was suggested for the cultural program for the Olympic Games in 2004.\n\nIn 1984, Italian comic artist Vittorio Giardino started producing a number of stories under the title \"Little Ego\", a parodic adaptation of \"Little Nemo\", in the shape of adult-oriented erotic comics. Brian Bolland's early comic strip \"Little Nympho in Slumberland\" employed a similar technique.\n\nThe bar in \"Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\" is called 'Little Nemo's'.\n\nIt influenced Alan Moore, in \"Miracleman\" No. 4, when the Miracleman family end up in a palace called \"Sleepy Town\", which has imagery similar to Little Nemo's. In Moore (and J.H. Williams III)'s \"Promethea\", a more direct pastiche – \"Little Margie in Misty Magic Land\" – showed Moore's inspiration and debt to McCay's landmark 1905 strip. The Sandman series occasionally references \"Little Nemo\" as well. Examples include \"\", where an abused child escapes into dreams styled after McCay's comics and using a similar 'wake-up' mechanism, and \"\" (pub. 1996), which features George Alec Effinger's short \"Seven Nights in Slumberland\" (where Nemo interacts with Neil Gaiman's characters The Endless).\n\nIn 1989, teen comic book Power Pack ran an issue (#47) which paid direct homage to one of McCay's Nemo storylines, featuring a castle that was drawn sideways and Katie Power re-enacting a classic Nemo panel with a sideways-drawn hallway that served as a bottomless pit with the line \"Don't fall in, y'hear?\"\n\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" is also the inspiration for the video of the 1989 song \"Runnin' Down a Dream\" by Tom Petty.\n\nIn 1994-1995, French artist Moebius wrote the story to a sequel comic series \"Little Nemo\", drawn by Bruno Marchand in two albums, 2000-2002, Marchand continued the story with two additional albums.\n\nIn 2006, electronic artist Daedelus used Little Nemo artwork for his album \"Denies the Day's Demise\".\n\nThe comic strip \"Cul de Sac\" includes a strip-within-the-strip, \"Little Neuro\", a parody of Little Nemo. Neuro is a little boy who hardly ever leaves his bed.\n\nIn 2009, the Pittsburgh ToonSeum established its NEMO Award, given to notable individuals \"for excellence in the cartoon arts\". Recipients to date include veteran comic-book artist Ron Frenz, editorial and comic-strip artist Dick Locher, cartoonist and comics historian Trina Robbins, and comics artist, editorial cartoonist and artists' rights advocate Jerry Robinson.\n\nOn October 15, 2012, celebrating the 107th anniversary of the first \"Little Nemo\" story, Google displayed an interactive animated \"Google Doodle\" called \"Little Nemo in Google-land\" on its homepage. The doodle showed a typical Little Nemo adventure through a series of panels, each featuring a letter from the word \"Google\". The doodle also ends in the same way as the comic strips, with Nemo falling from his bed.\n\nAt Universal's Islands of Adventure, at the Toon Lagoon section, Little Nemo can be seen falling out of his bed near a shop.\n\nEric Shanower and Gabriel Rodriguez revived the characters in 2014 in an IDW comic book series entitled \"Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland\". That same year, Locust Moon Press released a new anthology and Taschen published the complete series (1905–1926).\n\nComics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay \"the first original genius of the comic strip medium\". Harvey claims that McCay's contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon. Cartoonist Robert Crumb called McCay a \"genius\" and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman's \"In the Shadow of No Towers\" (2004) appropriated some of McCay's imagery, and included a page of \"Little Nemo\" in its appendix. Federico Fellini read \"Little Nemo\" in the children's magazine \"Il corriere dei piccoli\", and the strip was a \"powerful influence\" on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella.\n\nMcCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection survived him, but much of it was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection into his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay's surviving artwork remained in family hands.\n\n"}

{"id": "44715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44715", "title": "Morality play", "text": "Morality play\n\nThe morality play is a genre of Medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as interludes, a broader term for dramas with or without a moral. Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. Hildegard von Bingen's \"Ordo Virtutum\" (English: \"Order of the Virtues\") composed c. 1151, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.\n\nMorality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents either humanity as a whole or a smaller social structure. Supporting characters are personifications of good and evil. This alignment of characters provides the play’s audience with moral guidance. Morality plays are the result of the dominant belief of the time period, that humans had a certain amount of control over their post-death fate while they were on earth.\n\nIn \"Everyman\", perhaps the archetypal morality play, the characters take on the common pattern, representing broader ideas. Some of the characters in \"Everyman\" are God, Death, Everyman, Good-Deeds, Angel, Knowledge, Beauty, Discretion, and Strength. The personified meanings of these characters are hardly hidden. The premise of \"Everyman\" is that God, believing that the people on earth are too focused on wealth and worldly possessions, sends Death to Everyman to remind him of God's power and the importance of upholding values. The emphasis put on morality, the seemingly vast difference between good and evil, and the strong presence of God makes \"Everyman\" one of the most concrete examples of a morality play. At the same time, most morality plays focus more on evil, while \"Everyman\" focuses more on good, highlighting sin in contrast.\n\nOther plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays, but are rarely given the title of \"morality play\" are \"Hickscorner\" and \"The Second Shepherds' Play.\" The characters in \"Hickscorner\" are Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. They blatantly represent moral ideals. In \"The Second Shepherds' Play\", the characters are less obviously representative of good and evil, being primarily a trio of shepherds. But other characters such as Mary, The Child Christ, and An Angel show a strong moral presence and the importance of God in the play.\n\nIn early English dramas Justice was personified as an entity which exercised “theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man”. However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see Justice begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge. The Justice in \"Respublica\" begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind. This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in \"Respublica\" is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”. An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice, he begins to don on the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.\n\nAnother change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; Equity replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice. This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, \"Liberality and Prodigality\", where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex. Virtue states,\n\nSo horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:\nTherefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently\nThe manner of this outrageous robbery:\nAnd as the same by examination shall appear,\nDue justice may be done in presence here. (\"Liberality and Prodigality\" 377)\nThe meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from “Justice” to “Equity” further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a “theological abstraction to a civil servant”, but he experienced a corporeal change as well.\n\nOne may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.\n\nAlthough the purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption, morality plays after the Protestant Reformation are of a distinctly different didacticism than the morality plays before the Reformation.\n\nMorality plays before the Reformation teach a Catholic approach to redemption, with an emphasis on works and the sacraments, a view originating with Tertullian (c. 155 – c. 240 AD) and Cyprian (d. 258). The emphasis on works can be seen in the final speech in one of the most well-known of medieval morality plays, Everyman, in which there is a clear statement about the necessity of good works for the one who desires heaven:\n<poem> \nDoctor: This moral men may have in mind;\nYe hearers, take it of worth, old and young,\nAnd forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,\nAnd remember Beauty, Five-wits, Strength, and Discretion,\nThey all at last do Everyman forsake,\nSave his Good-Deeds, there doth he take.\nBut beware, and they be small\nBefore God, he hath no help at all.\nNone excuse may be there for Everyman.\n</poem>\nThe importance of the sacraments is seen in the morality tale entitled Mankind (play). In this play, the sacrament of penance is emphasized when the allegorical character Mercy speaks to Mankind: “Come let us go to this cloister and incline your mind towards God. Don’t sin thinking that you are assured mercy, that itself is a sin. It’s not a good idea to take advantage of the Lord.”\nPre-Reformation plays emphasized the importance of the sacraments of the Catholic Church (such as partaking in mass and baptism), the church clergy, the church hierarchy, the church establishment in general, and the abstinence from the Seven Deadly Sins. Many of the morality tales were allegories and involved characters with names of Vices (e.g., Gluttony) and Virtues (e.g., Goodness). Their purpose was to direct the playgoers to pursue virtue and renounce vice.\n\nFrequently a character representing a Vice would state, upon his first appearance, that he was evil. For example, in The Castle of Perseverance, a character called Lust-Liking states:\n<poem>\nLo, me! here ready Lord, to fare and to flee\nTo seek thee a servant valued and dear!\nWhoso will by Folly ruled be, \nHe is worthy to be a servant here,\nWho slips into the Sins Seven.\n</poem>\nEven after this initial introduction, however, the Vice will continually reiterate to the audience that his nature is diabolic. Very often, the Vice presented will bring his character into criticism by the manner in which he presents himself to his audience, thus further demonstrating his wickedness. For example, the Vices in the earlier morality plays often spoke using vulgar language and by blasphemous swearing. Often, these curses were spoken in Latin, which being considered the holy language, made these curses even more offensive to the audience. Moreover, the Vices often made a mockery of religious practices sacred to the audience, thereby castigating themselves in the eyes of their audience. Deceit is another means by which the Vice exposes his wickedness to the audience and serves as an example to them of what to avoid in a righteous life. Furthermore, in the pre-Reformation play, the Vices denounce their own characters by acting violently toward each other, and toward the Virtues.\n\nWhereas the pre-Reformation morality plays sought to reinforce the establishment of the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine, the post-Reformation morality plays worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church. Although post-Reformation morality plays were like its predecessor in that it also was concerned with the salvation of its audience, it differed in that it believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual’s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of Protestantism which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature. The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.\n\nThe Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are almost always depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays would be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge. Oftentimes, the Vice in post-Reformation plays admits that Catholic theology is flawed, and that by being Catholic the Vice is committing treason. Moreover, Vices often appear ignorant and naive, especially when it comes to their biblical understanding and knowledge of the New Testament. Often, morality plays coming out the post-Reformation period ridicule ritualistic Catholic practices. Furthermore, these plays postulated that Catholics were opposed to moral behaviour and truthfulness, and that the Catholic Church warped the text of the Bible to justify sinning. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.\n\nBecause the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism from the outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs. Therefore, the Vice served as a central component to discrediting the Catholic Church in post-Reformation morality plays.\n\nThe role of the Virtues in post-Reformation morality plays was to preach a message of salvation based upon an individual’s faith and the grace of God. They promoted Protestant beliefs of original sin, the importance of bible reading and meditation, the marriage of clergymen, and the cleansing of sin only through Christ’s sacrifice; at the same time, they discredited the Catholic belief in transubstantiation.\n\n\n"}

The POC serves as the gatekeeper of company policy and is usually responsible for ensuring the rest of the production television crew follows the requirements of the Production Company or Studio.\n\nThe duties of a POC are often undefined and extremely varied ranging from office manager, to human resources, to controller, to accountant. The POC is one of the only positions with the IATSE (USA and Canada) which no longer has a scale or set wage. The IA bylaws simply state the POC’s wage is “subject to negotiation with the Producer”. Fringe benefits include inclusion with the (USA)industry’s Motion Picture Industry Pension & Health Plans. Currently the production company is required to contribute 60 pensions hours per week, which equates to about 35-percent of the weekly gross wage. Most all POCs are hired an \"on-call\" weekly status and are basically paid a flat rate per week, no matter how many or few hours they work.

Dubbed \"the poor little rich boy,\" Richie is the only child of fantastically wealthy parents and is the world's richest kid. He is so rich, his middle name is a dollar sign, $.\n\nDuring Harvey Comics' heyday (1950–1982), Richie was the publisher's most popular character, eventually starring in over fifty separate titles, including such long-running comics as \"Richie Rich\", \"Richie Rich Millions\", \"Richie Rich Dollars and Cents\", and \"Richie Rich Success Stories\".\n\nIn 2011 Ape Entertainment began publishing a new licensed Richie Rich comic book series, taking the character in a very different, action-oriented, direction.\n\nAlthough created in 1953, Richie didn't have his own title until 1960. Once he did, however, he quickly became Harvey's most popular character, eventually starring in over fifty separate titles. The flagship, \"Richie Rich\", ran 254 issues from 1960 to 1991 (with a hiatus from 1982–1986), followed by a second volume which ran an additional 28 issues from 1991–1994.

(Harvey ceased publishing in 1982, but started up again in 1986 under new ownership; this hiatus resulted in the cancellation of many titles.) Richie (along with many of the Harvey characters) has been published only sporadically since 1994.\n\nWriters for the Richie Rich comic books and syndicated comic strip included Sid Jacobson, Lennie Herman, Stan Kay, and Ralph Newman. Richie Rich's most famous illustrator is Warren Kremer. Other illustrators included Ernie Colón, Sid Couchey, Dom Sileo, Ben Brown, Steve Muffatti, and Joe Dennett.\n\nDespite any negative stereotypes associated with his incredible wealth, Richie Rich is portrayed as kind and charitable. (In fact, his moniker is \"the poor little rich boy.\") He lives in an expensive mansion and owns at least two of everything money can buy. Richie appears to be around seven to ten years old and wears a waistcoat, a white shirt with an Eton collar (which is obscured by a giant red bow tie), and blue shorts. He occasionally attends school in his hometown of Harveyville. Other times he's classmates with Little Dot and Little Lotta in Bonnie Dell.\n\nFor the Ape Entertainment comic book series debuting in 2011, the character was updated by emphasizing his altruistic side: \"A mix of James Bond and Indiana Jones with the bank account of Donald Trump, Richie Rich is an altruistic adventurer who travels the world helping the less fortunate!\" The new Richie was joined by updated versions of his robot maid Irona and his butler Cadbury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix debuted a 2015 half-hour comedy series titled \"Richie Rich\" with Jake Brennan starring as Richie Rich, along with Joshua Carlon, Jenna Ortega, Lauren Taylor, Kiff VandenHeuvel, and Brooke Wexler.

{"id": "866250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=866250", "title": "Scopophilia", "text": "Scopophilia\n\nScopophilia or scoptophilia (from , \"look to, examine\" and , \"tendency toward\"), is deriving pleasure from looking. As an expression of sexuality, it refers to sexual pleasure derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, pornography, naked bodies, etc.\n\nThe term was introduced to translate Freud's , or pleasure in looking. Freud considered pleasure in looking to be a regular partial instinct in childhood, which might be sublimated into interest in art, or alternatively become fixated into what the Rat Man called \"a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body\".\n\nFreud thought that inhibition of scopophilia might lead to actual disturbances of vision; other analysts have suggested that it might lead to a retreat from concrete objects into a world of abstractions.\n\nScopophilia was developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of Otto Fenichel, with special reference to identification. Fenichel maintained that \"a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'\". He also explored how looking could substitute for acting in those anxious to avoid guilt.\n\nJacques Lacan subsequently drew on Sartre's theory of the gaze to link scopophilia with the apprehension of the other: \"the gaze is this object lost and suddenly refound in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the other\". Lacan privileged scopophilia in his theory of how desire is captured by the imaginary image of the other; other French analysts have emphasised how the discovery of sexual difference in childhood, and the accompanying sense of not knowing subsequently fuels the scopophilic drive.\n\nVoyeurism plays a role in the films of Alfred Hitchcock, most notably in the 1960 film, \"Psycho\". In the film, Norman Bates is revealed to have a peephole to one of the hotel rooms. He uses this to spy on Marion Crane, while she is in a state of undress.\n\nScopophilia is mentioned by name in director Michael Powell's \"Peeping Tom\" (1960). The entire film is an exercise in voyeurism. Powell, and his screenwriter, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits. (I.M.D.B.)\n\nBuilding on Lacan's work, scopophilia was used by cinema psychoanalysts of the 1970s to describe pleasures (often considered pathological) and other unconscious processes occurring in spectators when they watch films. Voyeurism and the male gaze have been seen as central elements in such mainstream cinematic viewing, and are most famously discussed in Laura Mulvey's influential 1975 essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\".\n\nOthers, however, have objected to the element of scapegoating in such an analysis of the variegated pleasures of movie-viewing.\n\nCritical race theorists, such as bell hooks, David Marriott, and Shannon Winnubst, have also taken up scopophilia and the scopic drive as a mechanism to describe racial \"other-ing\" (c.f. scopophobia).\n\nIn their theories scopophilia is a question of fixing the appearance and identity of the other through the gaze. So cultural scopophilia restricts the visible representations of racial identity that it allows.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has a polygonal body marked with letters or numbers, which indicate the result of each spin.\n\nIn its earliest form the body was square (in some cases via a stick through a regular six-sided die ), marked on the four sides by the letters A (Lat. \"aufer\", take) indicating that the player takes one from the pool, D (Lat. \"depone\", put down) when a fine has to be paid, N (Lat. \"nihil\", nothing), and T (Lat. \"totum\", all), when the whole pool is to be taken.\n\nOther accounts give such letters as P, N, D (\"dimidium\", half), and H or T or other combinations of letters. Other combinations of letters that could be found were NG, ZS, TA, TG, NH, ND, SL and M, which included the Latin terms \"Zona Salve\" (\"save all\"), \"Tibi Adfer\" (\"take all\"), \"Nihil Habeas\" (\"nothing left\"), \"Solve L\" (\"save 50\") and \"Nihil Dabis\" (\"nothing happens\").\n\nJoseph Strutt, who was born in 1749, mentions the teetotum as used in games when he was a boy:\n\nWhen I was a boy, the tee-totum had only four sides, each of them marked with a letter; a T for take all; an H for half, that is of the stake; an N for nothing; and a P for put down, that is, a stake equal to that you put down at first. Toys of this kind are now made with many sides and letters.\n\nThe teetotum survives today as dreidel, a Jewish game played on Hanukkah and as the Perinola, a game played in many Latin American countries. Some modern teetotums have six or eight sides, and are used in commercial board games in place of dice. The original 1860 version of The Game of Life used a teetotum in order to avoid the die's association with gambling.\n\nA teetotum is mentioned by \"Martinus Scriblerus\", the pen name of a club of 18th-century satirical writers.\n\nThe 19th-century English poet William Ernest Henley wrote the \"Double Ballade on the Nothingness of Things\" which opened with the lines:\n<poem>\nThe big teetotum twirls,\nAnd epochs wax and wane\nAs chance subsides or swirls;\nBut of the loss and gain\nThe sum is always plain.\nRead on the mighty pall,\nThe weed of funeral\nThat covers praise and blame,\nThe -isms and the -anities,\nMagnificence and shame:--\n\"O Vanity of Vanities!\"\n</poem>\n\nIn Lewis Carroll's fantasy \"Through the Looking-Glass\", Alice's movements about the Old Sheep Shop provoke its proprietor (the White Queen transformed into a sheep) to ask, \"Are you a child, or a teetotum?\"\n\nIn Edgar Allan Poe's 1845 dark comedy short story \"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\", one of the patients of the asylum is described as believing he had been converted into a \"tee-totum\":\n\n\"And then,\" said the friend who had whispered, \"there was Boullard, the tee-totum. I call him the tee-totum because, in fact, he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet, that he had been converted into a tee-totum.

Despite its relatively short existence, it has devolved its own unique traditions and costumes that are distinguished from the nearby countries.\n\nAs the case for any country, there must be a few traditional sports that are passed down from a generation to the next and each country must preserve at any cost for it is\n\nOne of UAE's oldest tradition is falconry and it dates to past times. It is not known exactly when falconry emerged but some history mentions assume that it dates back to 2000 years. In the old times falconry started as a source for food, to hunt hares and houbara mostly. In addition to that it was considered a way of life for leaders of the tribe and the rest of the tribe, it was done in the broad of day light and then later on it was the topic around the evening get-togethers. Furthermore, there was another companion that went hand to hand with falcons, which was the saluki hunting dogs, but saluki in addition to assisting falcons; it was mainly for hunting down gazelles. \n\nA few might think that falconry is easy as it sounds, actually it is not. It requires a deal of patience, skill and courage to tame, capture and train a falcon. To protect this traditional sport and also to make sure that falcons were treated properly, a number of laws were laid down in sake of preserving this goal. The idea of placing trackers under each falcon skin with a unique identification numbers was established by Emirates Bird Society. This will help a great deal in tracking down the patterns of falcon’s migration and will open new possibilities of preserving this unique breed. A few years ago, an idea to issue passports to these birds was undertaken and was aimed at checking the illegal trade of falcons.\n\nToday, falconry is an endangered branch of Dubai’s rich cultural legacy. Rapid urbanization in the UAE over the last few years has adversely affected the natural habitat of the falcons. Moreover, new falconers do not respect the codes of practicing this sport and also indulge in over-hunting. This has posed a threat to these beautiful birds as well as to the cultural offshoot of the game itself.\n\nIn order to preserve this sport for posterity’s sake, the UAE government is working in collaboration with UNESCO for imbuing falconry with the status of a cultural heritage across the globe and attracting more Dubai holiday makers for this reason.\n\nIn the traditional boat racing, long-boat races, although the boats are not quite as long as in the past, create an impressive picture as their tightly-packed crews labor at their oars, propelling their svelte boats through calm inshore waters under the appreciative gaze of spectators.\n\nOne major sailing event is the Mubarraz Island marine sports festival, held in December and organized under the support of Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Maktoum as part of their efforts to promote the country's marine sports heritage. Eighty boats from all over the country participated in the Dh 6 million 1998 race held over a course. It was decided that as from 1998 the number of nationals in each boat would be 50 per cent, to be increased gradually to 100 per cent by 2001. In May 1999, 157 43-foot boats manned by 1,500 crew took part in the Al Dabb’iyya sailing race,Finishing at the Abu Dhabi Corniche break water.\n\nIn accordance with the traditional nature of the event, the race was preceded by the national anthem followed by folk dance and songs presented by local heritage troupes. Al Sarab owned by Dr H.H Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan came in first, winning a cash prize OF a gold model of a boat and a vehicle.\n\nThoroughbred Racing Camels are first put through their paces when they are about two years old. Initially the animals are trained to obey basic commands issued by the jockey. Then, a crucial two-kilometer gallop decides which have the ability for racing. To help build their stamina, the camels are made to run certain distances every day, which varies in proportion to their age. Recently jockeys were banned from racing and instead robots were used it their place according to human right laws.\n\nThere are two main breeds being raced, the Omani and Sudania which differ in color - the Omani being very light and the Sudania more of a tan color. Traditionally, a racing camel was fed on dates, honey, alfalfa, milk and seeds. They were never allowed to drink the day before a race and were prevented from feeding for the 12 hours prior to a race. With this type of saddle the jockey sits behind the camel's hump.\n\nCamel-racing, a traditional sport, is extremely popular in the Emirates. \nIt was originally staged in an informal setting, at weddings or special festivals, \nbut now customized tracks have been built throughout the country where race \nmeetings are held in the winter months from October to April, culminating in the \nannual camel race festival at Al Wathba which attracts entrants from all over the world.\n\nRacing camel’s top speed . Can run at for one hour or for up to 18 hours. In the Gold Cup that was recently run at NAD al-Shiba, the winning camel covered the 10 kilometers in 17 minutes and seven seconds (6.21 miles, averaging 21.76 mph). Because camels' humps store fat-not water- lean, streamlined racing camels have very small, almost vestigial, humps. Compared to an ordinary, run-of-the-desert camel, a racing camel looks like an enormous over-tall greyhound.\n\n"}

{"id": "39099845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39099845", "title": "Vinyl revival", "text": "Vinyl revival\n\nThe Vinyl revival is the renewed interest and increased sales of vinyl records, or gramophone records, that has been taking place in the Western world since about 2007.\n\nThe analogue format made of polyvinyl chloride had been the main vehicle for the commercial distribution of pop music from the 1950s until the 1980s and 1990s when they were largely replaced by the Compact Disc (CD). Since the turn of the millennium, CDs have been partially replaced by digital downloads. However, in 2007, vinyl sales made a sudden small increase, starting its comeback, and by the early 2010s it was growing at a very fast rate. In some territories, vinyl is now more popular than it has been since the late 1980s, though vinyl records still make up only a marginal percentage (<6%) of overall music sales.\n\nAlong with steadily increasing vinyl sales, the vinyl revival is also evident in the renewed interest in the record shop (as seen by the creation of the annual worldwide Record Store Day), the implementation of music charts dedicated solely to vinyl, and an increased output of films (largely independent) dedicated to the vinyl record and culture.\n\nThough many sales in vinyl are of modern artists with modern styles or genres of music, the revival has sometimes been considered to be a part of the greater revival of retro style, since many vinyl buyers are too young to remember vinyl being a primary music format.\n\nIn June 2017, Sony Music announced that by March 2018 it would be producing vinyl records in-house for the first time since ceasing its production in 1989. Reporting the decision, the BBC noted that, \"Sony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records\" but added that \"Sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records\".\n\nIn 1988, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles.\n\nFirst, the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.\nBut ever since 2007, the popularity of vinyl records has risen again. The largest online retailer of vinyl records in 2014 was Amazon with a 12.3% market share, while the largest physical retailer of vinyl records was Urban Outfitters with an 8.1% market share.\n\nIn its 'Shipment and Revenue Statistics' report for 2016, the Recording Industry Association of America noted that \"Shipments of vinyl albums were up 4% to $430 million, and comprised 26% of total physical shipments at retail value – their highest share since 1985\".\n\nSimilarly in the United Kingdom, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity in the late 1980s. This started a gradual decline in vinyl record sales throughout the 1990s. But also in the United Kingdom has the number of sold vinyl LP records increased every year between 2007 and 2014 In December 2011, BBC Radio 6 Music began an occasional \"Vinyl Revival\" series in which Peter Paphides met musicians who revealed, and played selections from, their personal vinyl record collections. In November 2014, it was reported that over one million vinyl records had been sold in the UK since the beginning of the year. Sales had not reached this level since 1996. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) predicted that Christmas sales would bring the total for the year to around 1.2 million. However, vinyl sales were still a very small proportion of total music sales. Pink Floyd’s \"The Endless River\" became the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 – and the fastest-selling since 1997 – despite selling only 6,000 copies. In 2016, 3.2 million vinyl records were sold in the UK, the best sale for a quarter of a century. \n\nAs of 2016, the revival continued. In January 2017, the BPI's 'Official UK recorded music market report for 2016', using Official Charts Company data, noted that \"Though still niche in terms of its size within the overall recorded music market, vinyl enjoyed another stellar year, with over 3.2 million LPs sold – a 53 per cent rise on last year\". The BPI also reported that \"The biggest-selling vinyl artist was David Bowie, with 5 albums posthumously featuring in the top-30 best-sellers, including his Mercury Prize shortlisted \"Blackstar\", which was 2016’s most popular vinyl recording ahead of Amy Winehouse’s \"Back To Black\", selling more than double the number of copies of 2015’s best seller on vinyl – Adele’s \"25\"\".\n\nBBC Radio 4's \"Front Row\" discussed the increase in coloured vinyl releases in October 2017 in the wake of recent albums in the format by Beck, Liam Gallagher, and St. Vincent.\n\nNOTE: Many citations below include CD sales, not just vinyl sales. This chart should be reviewed and revised for accuracy.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2012, British radio station BBC Radio 6 Music, solely broadcast music on the vinyl format, with records coming from the collections of presenters and DJs.\n\nRecord Store Day is an internationally celebrated day observed the third Saturday of April each year. Its purpose, as conceived by independent record store employee Chris Brown, is to celebrate the art of music. The day brings together fans, artists, and thousands of independent record stores across the world.\n\nRecord Store Day was officially founded in 2007 and is celebrated globally with hundreds of recording and other artists participating in the day by making special appearances, performances, meet and greets with their fans, the holding of art exhibits, and the issuing of special vinyl and CD releases along with other promotional products to mark the occasion.\n\nIn 2013, for the week of Record Store Day in the United Kingdom, 68,936 records were sold (an 86.5% rise from 36,957 in 2012). This can be broken down into 1,249 7\" albums, 25,100 12\" albums, 27,042 7\" singles and 15,545 12\" singles.\n\nThe Official Record Store Chart is a weekly music chart based on physical sales of albums in almost 100 independent record stores in the United Kingdom.

Other films based on the same play included \"The Bad Man\" directed by Edwin Carewe and starring Holbrook Blinn, and a 1930 film of the \"same title\" directed by Clarence Badger and starring Walter Huston. In 1941, M-G-M made a version entitled \"The Bad Man\", starring Wallace Beery and Ronald Reagan and directed by Richard Thorpe.\n\nOn a train bound for lawless northern China, businessman Gordon Creed (Ricardo Cortez) encounters acquaintance Myron Galt (Douglas Wood) and his attractive daughter Lola (Sheila Bromley). Galt is on his way to foreclose on a very promising oilfield built up by Jim Hallet (Gordon Oliver). Creed, on the other hand, wants to offer Hallet enough money to pay off his loan from Galt (for a tidy share of the oilfield).\n\nCreed is annoyed when his reserved compartment is appropriated by General Chow Fu-Shan (Vladimir Sokoloff). The general is on his way to deal with self-styled General Wu Yen Fang (Boris Karloff), a warlord who has taken control of a province. However, Chow Fu-Shan is assassinated on the train by one of Fang's men.\n\nAfter being questioned by military governor General Ma (Tetsu Komai), the three travel by horse to a remote town, where they find not only Hallet (Gordon Oliver), but Creed's estranged wife Jane (Beverly Roberts), who is working for missionary Dr. Abernathy (Gordon Hart). Then, Fang's subordinate, Captain Kung Nui (Chester Gan) and his men take over the town. When Kung Nui casts his eyes on Jane, Hallet impulsively punches him. Jane and Hallet have fallen in love, though she does not believe in divorce and has kept their relationship strictly platonic. Hallet is knocked out and imprisoned.\n\nWhen Fang arrives, he tries to persuade Jane to go with him, promising she would enjoy it (blithely explaining \"I am Fang\"). Hallet escapes with the help of an associate disguised as one of Fang's soldiers, and sends him to notify General Ma of Fang's whereabouts. Hallet then breaks in on Fang and Jane's private discussion. Fang remembers Hallet, who had once hid a coolie and dug three bullets out of his shoulder; that was Fang before his meteoric rise. The warlord decides to help his benefactor. Fang robs Creed of $50,000, uses it to pay Galt what Hallet owes, then takes the money and offers it to Dr. Abernathy.\n\nCreed bribes Captain Kung Nui to rebel against Fang. Kung Nui wants to regain face by having Hallet executed. Fang pretends to give in, but just before a firing squad shoots the oilman, Fang has his right-hand man, Mr. Cheng (Richard Loo), kill Kung Nui. Afterward, Fang personally shoots Creed to fix Hallet's romantic problem, but only manages to wound him.\n\nGovernment troops arrive and force their way into the town. In the confusion, Jane, accompanied by Hallet, goes to attend to her husband's wound. Creed produces a gun and announces that Hallet is going to have a fatal accident, but is killed by Fang.\n\nWith the battle lost, Fang decides to surrender rather than risk the lives of his captives by fighting to the end.

{"id": "44916461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44916461", "title": "Yakuza 0", "text": "Yakuza 0\n\nYakuza 0 is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Sega. It is a prequel to the \"Yakuza\" series. The game takes place in December 1988 in Kamurocho, a fictionalized recreation of Tokyo's Kabukicho, and Sotenbori, a fictionalized recreation of Osaka's Dotonbori. It was released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in Japan in March 2015, and in North America and Europe for PlayStation 4 in January 2017. It was released on Microsoft Windows on August 1, 2018.\n\nA free accompanying game application for PlayStation Vita, titled Ryū ga Gotoku 0: Free to Play Application for PlayStation Vita, was released in Japan in February 2015.\n\n\"Yakuza 0 \" is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The game takes place in December 1988, in Kamurocho and Sōtenbori, fictionalized recreations of Tokyo's Kabukichō and Osaka's Dōtonbori areas respectively. The player controls series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and recurring character Goro Majima, alternating between the two at predetermined points during the story.\n\nPlayers can freely walk around Kamurocho and Sotenbori, interacting with people they meet to trigger side-quests, battling enemies who attack them on the street, or playing one of several minigames, including fully playable versions of Sega arcade games such as \"Out Run\", \"Super Hang-On\", \"Space Harrier\" and \"Fantasy Zone\". Completing certain objectives, such as eating every dish at a restaurant or reaching a target score in a minigame, will also grant the player special Completion Point currency; this CP can be spent at a shrine to receive additional bonuses, such as special items or character upgrades.\n\nCharacter customization and growth is similar to the system from \"Isshin\", with abilities earned by buying them off of a skill tree that is gradually unlocked during the game. Instead of using experience to buy skills, the player uses money acquired from fights or via Kiryu and Majima's side businesses. Money is more liberally awarded in \"Yakuza 0\" than in previous entries, with every heavy attack causing enemies to drop cash. The player can lose their money if they encounter a special enemy called Mr. Shakedown, huge men who are far stronger than normal. If the player is beaten, they will lose all their cash, but can beat the enemy again to earn back their money and extra.\n\nKiryu and Majima also have side businesses that they run during the game to earn money: Kiryu invests real estate in Kamurocho, while Majima runs a cabaret club. Completing side-quests will often result in characters they meet offering to help with side businesses, allowing them to more easily and quickly progress. Progressing in side business sequences or training with specific masters will unlock additional abilities for purchase on the characters' skill trees.\n\nA major innovation of \"Yakuza 0\" is the addition of fighting styles for both Kiryu and Majima that can be switched in the middle of battle. Kiryu utilizes the balanced Brawler style, similar to that of previous entries; the powerful but slow Beast style, which allows him to use heavy weapons; and the fast boxing-based Rush style, which emphasizes mobility. Conversely, Majima uses the balanced Thug style; the weapons-oriented Slugger style, primarily focused around a baseball bat; and the tricky dance-based Breaker style. Completing Kiryu and Majima's side businesses will unlock an additional \"Legendary\" fighting style for the characters, the \"Dragon of Dojima\" and \"Mad Dog of Shimano\" styles, respectively.\n\nIn December, 1988, two unlikely figures from the Yakuza world, Kazuma Kiryu of the Kantō region and Goro Majima of the Kansai Region, have suddenly found themselves getting involved in the terrible events of the so-called \"Empty Lot\" dispute, which is the centerpiece of power struggle for all the dark organizations across Japan. In order to find out the truth behind such a power struggle, as well as maintain their own innocence and safety, they set out to investigate all the events surrounding the Empty Lot incident.\n\nIn Kamurocho, Tokyo, Kiryu is suspected of murder after the man that he has collected money from winds up dead in the Empty Lot. Kiryu's boss, Sohei Dojima, offers a promotion to second-in-command of the Dojima Family to whomever can find the deed to the land, and thus the most ruthless members go after Kiryu. Forced out of the family, Kiryu meets a man named Tetsu Tachibana, who owns a real estate company and promises to help Kiryu clear his name. Kiryu learns that Tachibana was hired by his then-incarcerated foster father, Shintaro Kazama, in order to assist him in preventing the Empty Lot from falling into Dojima's hands. While waiting for Tachibana to gather information about the lot's owner, Kiryu is hired by Tachibana as a real estate agent. Kiryu's involvement with Tachibana Real Estate causes him to be targeted by members of the Dojima Family, particularly his three lieutenants: Daisaku Kuze, Hiroki Awano and Keiji Shibusawa. Kiryu decides to sever ties with his associates, including his oath brother, Akira Nishikiyama, and Kazama Family's captain, Osamu Kashiwagi, in order to protect them from Dojima's wrath. After a brief showdown against Kuze on the streets of Kamurocho, Kiryu is rescued by Tachibana, who later reveals his true identity as a former Chinese mafia member. Tachibana later takes Kiryu to the Tojo Clan's headquarters, where they negotiate with the Acting Second Chairman, Takashi Nihara, and reach an agreement to protect Kiryu from the Dojima Family. Later on, Tachibana reveals to Kiryu the identity of the Empty Lot's owner: a psychologically-induced blind woman named Makoto Makimura, who resides in Sōtenbori, Osaka.\n\nIn Sōtenbori, Majima runs a cabaret club after being exiled from the Tojo Clan due to the botched Ueno-Seiwa hit years earlier, involving his oath brother, Taiga Saejima. Despite the success of his club, he realizes it's nothing more than a cage as he's under constant surveillance. One day, Majima's supervisor, Tsukasa Sagawa of the Omi Alliance, offers him a chance to rejoin the Shimano Family by assassinating a target named Makoto Makimura. Majima's search takes him to a chiropractic clinic, where he learns that Makoto is a receptionist and under the protection of the clinic's owner, Wen Hai Lee. Majima kidnaps Makoto, taking her to an abandoned warehouse, where he keeps her as he sets out to find answers as to why Makoto is being hunted. Lee suggests murdering a look-alike of Makoto and using the body to trick Majima's bosses, but he refuses to do it; however, a yakuza patriarch named Homare Nishitani carries out the deed in his place, forcing Majima to lie to Sagawa about Makoto's murder. Later on, Sagawa's men discover Majima's secret warehouse where he keeps Makoto, forcing both of them and Lee to flee. They make it back to Lee's clinic to take his car, but it is rigged to explode, killing Lee in the process. Sagawa attempts to kill Majima and Makoto, but is stopped by a mysterious assailant, who carries Makoto away. Sagawa and Majima work together to find the identity of Makoto's new captor. Majima visits Homare Nishitani of the Omi Alliance in prison, and learns from him that the man is Masaru Sera, president of the Nikkyo Consortium, a secret organization within the Tojo Clan. After Nishitani is betrayed and killed by one of the police officers in the station, Majima makes his escape and returns to Sagawa, and both of them head to the Consortium's headquarters. Majima storms through the base and confronts Sera, who reveals to him that Makoto had already been taken away by Tachibana Real Estate's men prior to Majima's arrival. Sera is then shot in the back by Sagawa, who pulls Kiryu's business card from Sera's pocket.\n\nEight hours before Majima's arrival at the Consortium HQ, Kiryu and Tachibana's right-hand man, Jun Oda, met with Sera and escorted Makoto back to Kamurocho. On the way back, they are pursued by Shibusawa and his men. They narrowly escape Shibusawa and hide at a construction site, but Oda attempts to betray them. Upon being subdued by Kiryu, Oda reveals that Makoto is Tachibana's biological sister, and that he was the person who sold Makoto to Korean mafia many years ago, when she moved from China to Sōtenbori in search of Tachibana. Kiryu and Makoto are forced to leave Oda behind as they return to Kamurocho, and Oda is killed by Shibusawa for failing to deliver Makoto to him as promised. Upon returning to Kamurocho, Kiryu meets up with Tachibana and prepares to take him to see Makoto, but is stopped by Dojima Family members, as well as Lao Gui, a Chinese assassin who was hired by Dojima to set up the Empty Lot murder and frame Kiryu. Tachibana willfully surrenders and goes with Lao Gui, in order to spare Kiryu. After recovering, Kiryu encounters Nishikiyama and reconciles with him. The two of them track down Tachibana, who is tortured by Kuze and his men in a basement. They successfully defeat Kuze, but Tachibana succumbs to his injuries and dies.\n\nMajima and Sagawa travel to Kamurocho, in search of Makoto. The two learn from the head of the Shimano Family, Futoshi Shimano, that he never intended to kill Makoto, and that he knew Majima wouldn't be able to follow the order; he hoped for Majima to be able to gain Makoto's trust, and convince her to give the Empty Lot's deed to Shimano himself without trouble. Majima later wanders Kamurocho in search of Kiryu, and battles against both Kashiwagi and Nishikiyama; he learns from the latter about Makoto's disappearance, and goes to the Empty Lot, where he finds Makoto. Majima learns that Makoto has partially regained her vision following Tachibana's death, and that she wishes to avenge her brother by demanding Dojima's three lieutenants' heads in exchange for the Empty Lot deed. In a moment, she escapes Majima's sight and goes to meet Dojima in an attempt to negotiate a deal. Dojima, however, refuses to accept the deal, and has Lao Gui shoot her instead, just as Majima arrives at the scene. After clearing out Dojima's men, Majima and Sera, who survived Sagawa's gunshot, rush Makoto to the hospital.\n\nShibusawa later learns of Makoto's survival and sets out to track her down at all costs, forcing Kiryu to attempt to stop him. He and Nishikiyama travel to the docks, where the Nikkyo have put Makoto on one of their ships. A fight breaks out between Shibusawa's men and the Nikkyo, as well as members of the Kazama Family, led by Kashiwagi. Kiryu confronts Shibusawa and duels against him, and emerges victorious. Nishikiyama, however, stops Kiryu from killing Shibusawa, not wanting him to cross the line. Meanwhile, Majima arrives at Dojima Family's headquarters, taking down every one of its members along the way, including Awano. Awano is killed while trying to defend Majima from Lao Gui. Dojima then commands the assassin to kill Majima, but the latter prevails and prepares to murder both of them. Sera arrives and stops Majima, announcing his new ownership of the Empty Lot, and convincing him to stand down. He instructs Majima to kill Shimano for betraying the Tojo Clan to the Omi Alliance, but Majima spares him instead, as he wants to learn the truth behind Saejima's fate. Shimano kills an Omi Alliance envoy in return to deny his involvement with them, and reinstates Majima into his family.\n\nA month following the incident, Sera is promoted to Third Chairman of the Tojo Clan for his acquisition of the Empty Lot. Kiryu sets out to find his own path as a yakuza by rejoining the Dojima Family. As punishment for his failure to secure a deal with the Shimano Family, Sagawa is killed by members of the Omi Alliance. Majima, inspired by Lee and Nishitani, decides to adopt a more crazy, carefree personality. He encounters Makoto, who does not recognize him, as well as her doctor, who has feelings for her. Majima encourages the doctor to take care of Makoto, then leaves the scene. In a post-credit scene, Makoto visits the Empty Lot to pay respects to her brother, and finds her stopwatch, repaired by Majima, buried in the ground. Majima finally meets Kiryu for the first time in Kamurocho, and greets him gleefully.\n\nThe game was first announced in a special \"Yakuza\" event on August 24, 2014, together with a trailer. A Chinese-language localization of the game was announced in 2014 and eventually released in Asia in May 2015. Shonan no Kaze performed the game's main theme and ending theme, \"Bubble\" and \"Kurenai\" respectively; these songs were not licensed for the English release and were instead replaced by original instrumental tracks.\n\nThe Chinese localization of the game replaces late-game character Lao Gui, Chinese hired assassin of the Dojima Family, with a face model of Hong Kong actor Sam Lee.\n\nOn December 5, 2015, at PlayStation Experience in San Francisco, Sony Computer Entertainment's Gio Corsi announced that \"Yakuza 0\" would be coming to the Americas for the PlayStation 4. Initially, no official confirmation was made of a European release. In July 2016, it was announced that the game would release in North America and Europe for the PlayStation 4 in January 2017.\n\nWestern localization of the game was led by Scott Strichart, associate producer of Atlus USA, who has localized \"Yakuza Kiwami\", \"Yakuza Kiwami 2\", and \"Yakuza 6\". The team took a year and a half to localize Yakuza 0, which has 1.8 million Japanese characters, nearly twice as many as the average JRPG, which has 1 to 1.2 million Japanese characters. In addition to challenges translating tone and humor, Strichart's team at Atlus had difficulties localizing traditional Asian games, including Mahjong and Shogi. In order to make these minigames accessible to Western audiences, Atlus had to provide detailed rules alongside gameplay. During the localization process, Strichart said the team wrote a total of \"34 pages of Mahjong explanation.\"\n\n\"Yakuza 0\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nThe game debuted at number 1 on the Japan software chart in its first week of release. The PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 version sold 146,000 units and 90,000 sales respectively. PlayStation LifeStyle's review of the import version was a 9/10, calling it the best in the series and \"the result of 10 years spent not just perfecting a formula, but adding to it.\" The game received a 36/40 from \"Famitsu\" on both platforms. \"Eurogamer\" ranked the game 45th on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\", while \"Polygon\" ranked it 44th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017, and \"The Verge\" named it as one of their 15 Best Video Games of 2017.\n\nAs of June 28, 2018, \"Yakuza 0\" and \"Yakuza Kiwami\" were relaunched as PlayStation Hits. The games, as with all PlayStation Hits games, come in a red case and retail for $19.99 in both the United States and Canada.\n\nDue to the highly favorable reception of the \"Yakuza\" games in the West, Sega announced in May 2018 that it will remaster Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4, and Yakuza 5 for the PS4.\n\nAs of June 2015, the game has sold over 500,000 copies within Japan and Chinese-speaking regions of Asia. Sega president Haruki Satomi stated that the Chinese version of the game sold more than originally expected.\n\nIn the UK, \"Yakuza 0\" was the 8th top selling game in the week of January 28. Stock for the game was running low, which indicated the game sold far beyond expectations.\n\nThe game was nominated for \"Best PS4 Game\" in \"Destructoid\"s Game of the Year Awards 2017, and for \"Best Action-Adventure Game\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards; it also became a runner-up for \"Best Style\" in Giant Bomb's 2017 Game of the Year Awards. The game won the award for \"Best Main Character\" (Goro Majima) in \"Game Informer\"s 2017 game of the Year Awards.\n"}
