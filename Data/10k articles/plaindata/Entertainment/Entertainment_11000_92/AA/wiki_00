The company produced licensed toys from Warner Bros., Disney, and Jim Henson's Muppets. Its principal subsidiaries included Dakin Inc. and International Tropic-Cal Inc. The Applause brand survives as part of Russ Berrie.\n\nThe company was founded as The Wallace Berrie Company in 1966 by Wallace Berrie. In 1979 the company obtained worldwide rights to The Smurfs and released figurines in 1979 at $1.50 each. The figurines became one of the best-selling toys of 1982. That year, the company acquired the Applause division from Knickerbocker Toys, which came with the licenses to Disney, Sesame Street, and Raggedy Ann and Andy. In 1986, the company changed its name to Applause Inc. and released California Raisins merchandise. It would also produce various Batman merchandise, focusing largely on small figures and dolls, from the late 1980s into the early 1990s. In 1992, Applause released the Magic Trolls Babies toy line.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1995, the company built a strong retail business by focusing on its classic entertainment licensed brands with in-store merchandising displays as a platform for entertainment event properties, e.g. The Lion King, The Flintstones, Pocahontas, The Little Mermaid, Star Trek, and Star Wars. Also during this period, one of the most significant events was the company's acquisition of the licensed rights to the very popular Looney Tunes characters.\n\nIn late 1995 the company acquired Woodland Hills, California company, Dakin Inc., the most widely recognized brand name in stuffed animals. Dakin was founded in 1955 by Richard Dakin as an import business. This acquisition strengthened Applause's generic stuffed animal business to balance out its already strong entertainment license portfolio.\n\nApplause created a Strategic Alliances Group to oversee products for food-related and premium-based programs such as from Taco Bell, KFC, Kellogg's, General Mills, and Pillsbury. In 1998 the company produced fast food toys for \"A Bug's Life\", \"Mulan\", \"Pokémon\" (KFC) and \"Godzilla\".\n\nIn 2004 CEO Bob Solomon shot himself after it was apparent that the company was not going to survive. The company filed for bankruptcy shortly after his death. The Applause name was acquired by Russ Berrie in a bankruptcy auction. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1171527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1171527", "title": "Bourré", "text": "Bourré\n\nBourré (also commonly known as Bouré and Boo-Ray) is a trick-taking gambling card game primarily played in the Acadiana region of Louisiana in the United States of America and by the Somerset Men's Tennis team on county week, as well as at the tennis tournament in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. Crossgates, in Leeds, UK, was also once a hotbed of the game but has suffered a decline in recent years as many former players have moved away from the area. It is also played in the Greek island of Psara, with the name Boureki (Μπουρέκι in Greek). The game's closest relatives are probably Spades and Euchre; like many regional games, Bourré sports a large number of variant rules for both gameplay and betting considerations.\n\nThe object of Bourré is to take a majority of the \"tricks\" in each \"hand\" and thereby claim the money in the \"pot\". If a player cannot take a majority of tricks, the secondary goal is to keep from \"bourréing\", or taking no tricks at all. A bourré usually comes at a high penalty, including matching the amount of money in the pot.\n\nThe game is played with a standard 52-card deck, aces high and two to seven players. With seven players, only three cards may be dissed (so as to not use the dead cards). After every player antes, the dealer passes out five cards to each player, one at a time. In a traditional game, the dealer flips his own fifth card—the last dealt—and that card's suit is considered. (Should the dealer make an error whilst dealing the cards, any of the players may yell out \"shitter\" and if judged to have been a bum deal, the deal moves to the player left of the original dealer). trumps\" (in Boureki \"kozia\" or \"atoy\"); however, house rules may allow a dealer to flip any card (without first seeing the other cards). As in Spades, the chosen suit beats all others; a two of trumps is \"higher\" in rank than an ace of any other suit.\n\nAfter the deal, each player (starting to the dealer's left and continuing clockwise) states an intent to play. Many variants require an additional ante at this point. Those who are not playing in the hand \"fold\"; those cards are collected by the dealer.\n\nOnce every player has stated intent, the dealer asks those still in the game (in the same order as before) how many new cards they desire. They can take any number from zero to five; their discards go in a separate pile and the dealer hands them as many new cards as they discarded. If the main stock is depleted before all players have been serviced, the dealer shuffles the \"folded\" hands and deals those; if that stock is depleted as well, the discards are shuffled and used.\n\nOnce everyone, including the dealer, has either folded or completed their redraw, the trick-taking phase begins. The first player to the dealer's left who is still in the game starts by playing any card (with few exceptions); rules of play are as follows (a lower-numbered rule overrides any higher-numbered one).\n\n\nThe winner of a given \"round\" or \"trick\" collects the cards and places them face-up in front of him, then leads with another card. Play proceeds until all five tricks have been completed.\n\n\nDeal then passes to the left.\n\nThere are complex rules about forced plays; a simple example is when someone who has just taken their second trick holds the ace of trumps. Since the ace of trumps is unbeatable, they \"must\" play it as their next card. Similar occurrences are when a player has taken one trick and has both ace and king or (more complex) ace, queen and jack. This is sometimes called the \"cinch win\" rule. If it is a \"cinch\" that you will win, you must win immediately by laying down the winning cards all at once. While the rules themselves are simple in theory, details about forced plays can make Bourré challenging for even a skilled player.\n\nThe \"must play to win\" rule can have contentious results if a player is playing \"nice\", trying to keep others from bourréing. Most games disallow such \"nice\" plays; players must attempt to bourré as many other players as possible. As Bourré is a game with imperfect information and gamesmanship should (hopefully) trump rules-lawyering, care should be applied to any analysis of rounds when looking for such \"nice\" plays.\n\nVariations in rules of Bourré abound, possibly due to its nature as a regional game. Perhaps most common is the introduction of a \"pot limit\", which caps the total amount a single bourré or renege can cost a given player. In some games, it is common for the dealer to ante for all of the players; this simplifies trying to determine whether individuals have anteed. In a sense, the dealer is paying for his face-up trump. In this variation, for a five-person, one-dollar-ante game, the dealer of each hand would ante five dollars. A common point of dissent is whether a player who holds trumps but not the lead suit should be forced to play a trump if he cannot beat a higher trump already on the table; while consensus seems to be that the \"play to win\" rule applies, groups of players are known to require a player to play trump even though the player cannot possibly win the trick. Punishments for misplay range from simple retraction (good for new players), retraction-and-renege, or just a renege, which can lead to the misplaying individual attempting to bourré one or more other players. The default ante amount is understandably variable and the second ante is fairly common.\n\nA game of Bourré apparently sparked the dispute which led to NBA star Gilbert Arenas's suspension. During an overnight flight from Phoenix to Washington, DC, on December 19, 2009, Arenas needled teammate Javaris Crittenton for losing over $1,000 in a game of Bourré. The two exchanged words, with Arenas joking that he would blow up Crittenton's car and Crittenton saying he would shoot Arenas in his surgically repaired knee. Two days later Arenas brought four guns to the Washington Wizards' locker room and left them, with a sign saying \"Pick One,\" at Crittenton's locker. The incident, combined with Arenas's trivialization of it in the media, led to his indefinite suspension from the NBA on January 6, 2010. He has since been restored as an active NBA player.\n\nA game of Bourré also sparked a feud on the Memphis Grizzlies' team plane between NBA teammates OJ Mayo and Tony Allen in January, 2011. \"Mayo owed Allen money from a card game, ‘Bourré,' and sources said Mayo became increasingly belligerent and antagonistic toward Allen when asked to settle the debt,\" Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski reports.\nAllen walked away from Mayo, the sources told Wojnarowski, only to return later and find Mayo still berating him. Then Mayo \"inched close to Allen\" and \"Allen hit Mayo.\"\nOther players separated the two, according to Wojnarowski's sources, and the pair was called in to talk to coach Lionel Hollins about it.\nMayo missed the following game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, on January 5. The team says it was due to bronchitis, but Wojnarowski's sources say it was \"connected to the fight.\"\n\n"}

He collaborated with his wife, Mary M. Talbot to produce \"Dotter of Her Father's Eyes\", which won the 2012 Costa biography award.\n\nBryan Talbot was born in Wigan, Lancashire on 24 February 1952. He attended Wigan Grammar School, the Wigan School of Art, and Harris College in Preston, Lancashire, from which he graduated with a degree in Graphic Design.\n\nTalbot began his comics work in the underground comix scene of the late 1960s. In 1969 his first work appeared as illustrations in \"Mallorn\", the British Tolkien Society magazine, followed in 1972 by a weekly strip in his college newspaper. He continued in the scene after leaving college, producing Brainstorm Comix, the first three of which formed \"The Chester P. Hackenbush Trilogy\", a character reworked by Alan Moore as Chester Williams for \"Swamp Thing\".\n\nTalbot started \"The Adventures of Luther Arkwright\" in 1978. It was originally published in \"Near Myths\" and continued on over the years in other publications. It was eventually collected into one volume by Dark Horse Comics. Along with \"When the Wind Blows\" it is one of the first British graphic novels. In the early to mid-eighties he provided art for some of \"2000 AD\"'s flagship serials, producing three series of \"Nemesis the Warlock\", as well as occasional strips for \"Judge Dredd\". His \"The Tale of One Bad Rat\" deals with recovery from childhood sexual abuse.\n\nTalbot moved to the U.S. market in the 1990s, principally for DC Comics, on titles such as \"Hellblazer\", \"\", and \"Dead Boy Detectives\".

{"id": "7510274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7510274", "title": "Concept musical", "text": "Concept musical\n\nConcept musicals were first introduced in the 1940s, though two shows compete for the title of 'first concept musical:' \"Allegro\" and \"Love Life\". The form began to flourish in the late 1960s, with the advent and subsequent popularity of \"Man of La Mancha\", \"Cabaret\", and \"Hair\". Stephen Sondheim, the most prolific author of concept musicals, created \"Company\" in 1970, bringing the genre to the forefront of the commercial realm. Director-choreographer Bob Fosse and producer-director Harold Prince were equally instrumental in making defining contributions to the concept musical. Modern examples of the concept musical include \"Assassins\" and \"Avenue Q\". Shows ranging from \"Fiddler on the Roof\" to \"Sweeney Todd\" have been argued as being concept musicals, though there is little critical agreement.\n\nThe concept musical has direct ties to the megamusical, which has similar roots in the Andrew Lloyd Webber work \"Cats\", and the similarly plotless revue. Mirroring the social upheaval of the 1960s and beyond, the concept musical as a form provided a means of expression and experimentation for musical theatre writers and audiences alike.\n\n“The term 'concept musical' did not appear in theatrical scholarship until after 1970, when the phrase “conceived by” preceded Michael Bennett’s name in the \"A Chorus Line\" billing. Most theater historians agree that the terms 'concept' and 'musical' were not linked until 1968, in a \"New York Times\" review of \"Zorba\" by critic Martin Gottfried. Referring to Harold Prince's direction rather than the show itself, Gottfried wrote: \"Conception is the big word here - it is what is coming to replace the idea of a 'book'... there is even less room than in the usual musical [for story] because Prince's concept... apparently won out on every question about cutting.\" In a later review of Sondheim's \"Follies\", Gottfried defined it as \"a show whose music, lyrics, dance, stage movement and dialogue are woven through each other in the creation of a tapestry-like theme (rather than in support of a plot).\"\n\nModern critics disagree as to the exact definition of the concept musical. It is generally agreed upon that in a concept musical, emphasis is placed upon style, message, and thematic metaphor rather than on the plot itself. Thus, the show's structure is rarely cohesive or linear. Critics agree that the most defining aspect of a concept musical is its use of theme. This holistic approach to each show, which focuses on the truthful representation of the theme in every aspect of the final production, sets it apart from other musical theatre forms. Young-Gerber states: “In musical comedy there is \"no\" theme. The revue \"uses\" a theme to unify disparate musical numbers and specialty acts. The integrated musical \"contains\" a theme. In contrast, the concept musical \"embodies\" a theme [that is] developed as the musical is written.”\n\nThus, the concept musical can also be defined by its structural characteristics and common staging techniques. Its songs \"punctuate rather than flow out from the story,\" serving as a means of self-reflection for the character and acting as commentary upon the theme. The message of the show often spurs within its director a \"renewed emphasis on the visual aspects of the performance... [leading] to a more abstract, unrealistic, non-representational staging, as the director has to free himself/herself from the confines of scenic verisimilitude in order to explore the visual dynamics of the stage.\" The attention paid to visual presentation has led many critics to recognize the concept musical as the most expressive and imagistic form of musical theatre. Theatre historian Vagelis Siropoulos writes: \"A sense of aesthetic totality is provided not by the linear unfolding of a narrative but by the overarching staging concept, which turns the spectator's attention to the overall principle of organization in the same way that an abstract painting does.\"\n\nThe concept musical can be recognized as an extension of the growing concern for the cohesiveness of a particular production: \"Unlike Rodgers and Hammerstein or Lerner and Loewe, who simply found a good story and musicalized it, now it was considered appropriate (and artistically more satisfying) to have a vision of the whole show.\" Leonard Bernstein was a key figure in this movement, with his shows \"Candide\" and \"West Side Story\" representing a \"radical experiment in book writing\" in which the book is controlled by theme and metaphor.\n\nThe concept musical's non-linear structure and focus on theme are suggestive of the works of Bertolt Brecht. A similar connection can be made to the Living Newspapers of the 1930s. The Broadway production of \"Lady in the Dark\", written by Kurt Weill, Ira Gershwin, and Moss Hart, is considered by some to be a predecessor of the modern concept musical. Its attention to characters and their psychological makeup, rather than the plot and its through-line, foreshadow the concept musical's priority of personal expression. Following \"Lady in the Dark\" and throughout the course of his career, Weill favored ideas over a linear narrative. Whatever the exact origin, the growing maturation of musical theatre allowed the genre to become \"a vehicle for social commentary and experimentation in form,\" with the concept musical at the forefront of this movement.\n\nThere are two major contenders for the title of first concept musical, although the term itself had yet to be invented: \"Allegro\" (1947) by Rodgers and Hammerstein, and \"Love Life\" (1948) by Weill and Lerner.\n\n\"Allegro\", which concerns a son following in his father's footsteps, represents a \"musical experiment\" conducted by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Defying \"virtually all musical theatre conventions\" of the time, its Greek chorus frequently interrupts the narrative, and the show focuses on a larger theme of personal struggle in the face of success. Minimalistic in its staging, patterns of light were used to represent both spaces and emotions. However, many critics disagree as to \"Allegro\"'s status as a concept musical, stating that the linear nature of the plot continues regardless of the choral interludes. The show was a critical failure, which many theatre historians blame on the inexperience of director-choreographer Agnes de Mille. Disheartened, Rodgers and Hammerstein returned to a more traditional format. Whether or not it was indeed a concept musical or merely a predecessor of things to come, \"Allegro\" \"opened the door to a splendid new way of writing for musical theatre.\" \"Allegro\" also provides a connection between the concept musical and Stephen Sondheim, who was mentored by Hammerstein and worked as a production assistant on \"Allegro\".\n\n\"Love Life\", the story of a marriage lasting over a century, \"disregarded the traditional use of time, interrupted its action with jolting vaudeville numbers that commented on the story, and... tried to illustrate sociological ideas by paralleling them to a long-term personal relationship.\" Freed from his usual partnership with Loewe, Lerner's growing experimentation with the genre is represented in \"Love Life\". Like \"Allegro\", \"Love Life\"'s narrative is not explicitly linear, exploring the theme of marriage through a variety of lenses. Sondheim has stated that \"Love Life\" was \"a useful influence on my own work, but it failed because it started out with an idea rather than a character.\"\n\nConcept musicals began to emerge as a significant form in the early 1960s. Their fragmented approach to storytelling helped to revitalize musical theatre as a genre, which was becoming formulaic. 1961 saw the premiere of \"The Fantasticks\" and \"Stop the World – I Want to Get Off\". In 1965, \"Man of La Mancha\" premiered at the Goodspeed Opera House, eventually transferring to Broadway. The \"antithesis of what people expected musicals to be,\" it was nonetheless incredibly popular, and marked the growing undercurrent of rebellion against the traditional musical theatre model.\n\nThe following year, in 1966, Broadway saw the premiere of \"Cabaret\", by John Kander and Fred Ebb. Directed by Harold Prince, the show centers on the Kit Kat Klub, a seedy nightclub that thrives despite the war raging outside. \"Prince’s impact… on the concept musical is significant, and he can be considered the primary director who contributed to its creation.\" The show features songs that comment on the action within the narrative frame of the Kit Kat Klub. Removed from the story, these songs serve as commentary in the style of Brecht and Weill’s \"The Threepenny Opera\".\n\nOne of the first rock musicals, \"Hair\" opened Off-Broadway at The Public Theater in 1967 and then on Broadway in 1968. Representative of a communal 1960s \"happening,\" it effectively \"provided ‘safe’ exposure to the counterculture for middle-class audiences.\"\n\n\"The concept musical truly arrived with \"Company\", a musical that managed to be palatable to audiences even as it broke just about every rule of musical comedy.\" The 1970 show, with music and lyrics by Sondheim and a book by George Furth, focuses on Bobby, a single man living in New York City on the eve of his thirty-fifth birthday. It examines his romantic and personal relationships with several girlfriends and a variety of his married friends. The success of \"Company\" paved the way for more adventurous concept musicals by Sondheim and others.\n\nDirector-choreographer Bob Fosse was a key figure in the further development of the concept musical. After directing the film version of \"Cabaret\", Fosse helped to shape the 1972 Broadway musical \"Pippin\", written by Stephen Schwartz and Roger Hirson. Fosse’s conceptual vision for \"Chicago\", which opened on Broadway in 1975, featured vaudeville routines that “comment[ed] on the system of justice and imprisonment in Chicago in the 1920s... Kander and Ebb and Fosse and Prince were advancing upon the convention by which characters have two modes of existence in musicals. They were taking the convention literally, putting show business settings next to “real” settings… and letting the two overlap.”\n\n\"A Chorus Line\" marked the first use of the word \"conception\" in connection with musical theatre. The show, based on interviews with actual dancers, uses the premise of an audition to expose the complex lives of previously-faceless chorus members. Considered by many to be the quintessential concept musical, the popularity of the 1975 New York Shakespeare Festival/Public Theater production and its subsequent Broadway transfer kicked the growing concept musical phenomenon into high gear.\n\n\"Cats\", first brought to the stage in 1981, \"heralded the dawning of a new postmodern musical era, encapsulating the major difference between the concept musical and the megamusical.\" Though critics agree that the show is based around a concept rather than a linear plot, author Andrew Lloyd Webber had intended to create a show that was not meant to \"reflect [or] comment on the world, even in an oblique, metaphorical way.\" This was a drastic difference from the metaphors that defined the concept musical. Thus, the concept musical branched out into the megamusical, which utilizes spectacle and increased technology to \"radicalize the imagistic potential of musical theatre.\"\n\n\"Starlight Express\", an \"experiment\" by Lloyd Webber, debuted on the West End in 1984 and on Broadway in 1987. Like \"Cats\", the show focuses on a central theme rather than a linear plot, with the entire cast on roller skates playing trains. The original concept was to be an \"entertainment 'event' for children who love trains.\" Lloyd Webber has been quoted as saying that the end result was \"not quite what we intended,\" given that the \"joy and sense of pure fun that was the original intention seemed to get lost.\"\n\n\"Avenue Q\", which premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre in 2003, can also be considered a concept musical. Authors Jeff Whitty, Jeff Marx, and Bobby Lopez have spoken of their difficulty categorizing the show: they wanted something that \"didn't move like a story,\" but was not a true revue. Lopez calls it the \"hybrid king of revue-slash-show. Using kind of Internet logic. A hyperlink type of logic to go from one subject to another.\" Its structure is circular, utilizing a series of vignettes and isolated situations to comment on the central idea. The show's theme, like \"Pippin\", focuses on the central character's coming of age search for his purpose. Young-Gerber finds that none of the scenes \"bring him closer to discovering his purpose, indicating that the events of the musical will continue after the section shared with the audience is completed.\"\n\nSondheim is considered by a number of critics to be the leading musical theatre composer of his time. His contributions to the concept musical as a genre are undisputed. Sondheim believes that every show, concept musical or not, should contain \"a secret metaphor that nobody knows except the authors.\" Theatre historian Foster Hirsch writes that, like Prince, Sondheim has \"instincts in [his] approach... that echo Brecht and Weill,\" an opinion that is echoed by many others. The themes and issues presented in his concept musicals are intended to confront the audience rather than provide them with a means of escape. Sondheim has stated that his primary principle when writing is that \"content dictates form,\" meaning that the true heart of any issue must be presented in a similar fashion. This approach has often led him to embrace the concept musical.\n\nAfter the success of \"Company\", Sondheim continued to experiment with the concept musical form. \"Follies\" opened in 1971 on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre, winning the Tony Award for Best Music and Lyrics and the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for Best Musical. It was directed by Prince and Bennett, with choreography by Bennett. A number of critics have argued that \"Follies\" can be taken for a commentary on America under the Nixon presidency. In true Sondheim fashion, its content defines its form: the parallelisms of the young versions of the four leads, mirrored against their older selves, create multiple structural permutations and confrontations. These combinations thereby break down a linear sense of narrative. Set against a backdrop of aging glamour and the roads not taken, the show \"belies Sondheim's preoccupation with choice and its consequences, or rather subverts it into an understanding that making a mess of choices or being unable to choose at all is a constant.\"\n\n\"Pacific Overtures\" \"is often seen as the most obscure of Sondheim's scores,\" though a theme of naive illusion maturing to acceptance can be delineated. The show, directed by Prince, opened in 1976 on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre, winning the Drama Critics Circle award for Best Musical. Sondheim explained the \"naive linear approach\" of his writing process for \"Pacific Overtures\": \"What we actually did was to create a mythical Japanese playwright in our heads, who has come to New York, seen a couple of Broadway shows, and then goes back home and writes a musical about Commodore Perry's visit to Japan. It's this premise that helped to give us tone and style for the show.\" The traditional forms of kabuki and vaudeville were mixed to present a unique viewpoint. \"Assassins\", which was directed by Jerry Zaks and opened in 1991 Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons, has no protagonist or linear plot. The show, shifting back and forth chronologically, explores the motives and efforts of the successful and would-be assassins of various United States presidents. Its number of short scenes, many of which are crude and slapstick, echo the structure of \"Company\".\n\nSeveral other Sondheim musicals, including \"Merrily We Roll Along\", \"Sweeney Todd\", and \"Sunday in the Park With George\" have also been argued by some critics as meeting the definition of a concept musical, though this status is debated. \"Merrily We Roll Along\", which follows a trio of friends backwards from retirement to young adulthood, can be compared to \"Allegro\" in structure and theme, though the former has a narrative, while the latter does not.\n\nMuch has been written about the importance and impact of the concept musical. Drama theorist and critic Kathryn Edney believes that the concept musical \"is rarely popular or particularly profitable, although it often garners critical praise, scholarly attention, and a cult following among the musical theater cognoscenti.\" She postulates that the discrepancies between the concept musical and megamusical are a direct result of the efforts of Sondheim and Lloyd Webber, whose \"competing musical and personal styles... polarized fans of this genre. One is not supposed to enjoy both \"Cats\" and \"Company\".\" Likewise considering the relationship between the concept musical and megamusical, Siropoulos finds that the concept musical \"is the product of a culture permeated by spectacle... The concept musical's disproportional concentration on the visual aspects of performance goes hand in hand with representational ends, an obligation to represent, however obliquely, the external world.\"\n\nSiropoulos also argues that Prince, over any of his peers, is the true link between the concept musical and megamusical. Prince's work on \"Company\" and \"Evita\", in particular, showcase his abilities in directing two distinct styles. \n\nDramaturg Scott McMillin argues that the concept musical built upon the theories of Rodgers and Hammerstein to bring the genre into the modern era, allowing the musical to become \"arguably the major form of drama produced so far in America.\" \n\nTheatre historian John Bush Jones argues that the concept musical undermines the role of the traditional musical as a narrative medium, proposing that the term 'concept musical' is \"too broad to be of much value,\" suggesting instead the term 'fragmented musical.'\n"}

It was distributed by Hollywood Pictures and Cinergi Pictures and released on January 30, 1998.\n\nAmidst a storm, Captain John Finnegan and his crew, Joey Panuchi and Leila, are hired by mercenaries Hanover, Mulligan, Mason, Billy, T-Ray, Mamooli, and Vivo to pilot their boat across the South China Sea to an undisclosed location in the middle of the ocean. Meanwhile, the \"Argonautica\", a luxury cruise ship built and owned by Simon Canton, is undertaking its maiden voyage when a saboteur disables the ship's navigation and communication systems. A large object rises from beneath and collides with the vessel, leaving it dead in the water, while the panicking passengers are attacked by unseen creatures.\n\nFinnegan's boat collides with a speedboat shaken loose during the collision, at which point the mercenaries take over and reveal they intend to rob the \"Argonautica\"'s passengers and vault, before sinking the ship with torpedos. The group boards the ship, leaving Leila and Billy behind to repair the boat, where they are both killed by the same creature. The group reaches the ballroom only to find blood and no sign of the passengers. Finnegan and Joey go to the engine room to scavenge parts to repair the boat, under the guard of T-Ray and Mamooli. T-Ray goes off to investigate strange noises and is torn to shreds by the creature. Mamooli contacts Hanover, but is dragged off by the creature; as Joey and Finnegan are escaping they run into Trillian, a passenger who was imprisoned for stealing. Meanwhile Hanover's group reaches the vault and Vivo opens it only to be accidentally killed by Canton, who was hiding inside the vault along with Captain Atherton and three other passengers, who are shot dead by Mason and Mulligan. Canton and Captain Atherton explain that the ship was attacked by unknown creatures that killed everyone else on board.\n\nUnder questioning, Canton is found to be responsible for the ship's sabotage, having hired the mercenaries to sink the unprofitable ship so that he could collect on the insurance. The group is attacked by the creatures, consisting of giant spike-covered tentacles, which eat Captain Atherton. Canton theorizes that the creatures are an extreme evolution of the Ottoia, which liquefy their victims and then eject the carcasses. The creatures attack and the survivors flee; Mason is grabbed by the creature but kills himself by detonating a grenade. Mulligan elects to stay behind and try to kill the creatures in a last stand. Mulligan kills a creature, but is ambushed and devoured by another one. The survivors are herded towards the bow of ship, where they find a \"feeding room\" full of bloody skeletal remains. The creatures break through the hull, flooding the lower decks and separating the survivors. Hanover tries to sacrifice Joey to save himself, but instead gets grabbed by the creature and devoured.\n\nFinnegan and Joey spot an island from a distance and make it back to Finnegan's boat, but they have lost their engine parts, rendering it useless as a means of escape. They instead set the boat's autopilot to crash into the \"Argonautica\" and detonate the torpedoes. As Finnegan and Trillian find jet skis they can use to reach the island, the tentacles smash through the main deck, revealed to be part of a single giant creature. Finnegan discovers Joey has gone missing, leaving him and Trillian to escape while being pursued by the creature. Canton jumps onto Finnegan's boat, but is unable to disable the autopilot. The boat crashes into the \"Argonautica\", destroying both ships and killing Canton and the creature. \n\nFinnegan and Trillian reach the island and are reunited with Joey, who survived the ordeal and paddled ashore using Finnegan's personal watercraft. As the three relax, a loud roar echoes from the forest and something huge crashes toward them through the trees. As the camera pulls back, the island is revealed to be primordial. Finnegan is heard saying his movie catchphrase, \"Now what?\", as the film ends.\n\n\nStephen Sommers began writing the script to \"Deep Rising\", then called \"Tentacle\", when he worked at Hollywood Pictures in the mid-1990s. Claire Forlani was originally cast as Trillian St. James, but dropped out after just three days, due to creative differences with Sommers, and Famke Janssen was subsequently cast. Janssen almost did not get the part because the producers felt she was too recognizable from \"GoldenEye\", but they relented. Harrison Ford turned down the role of John Finnegan, which later went to Treat Williams, and the film's budget was later downsized.\n\nFilming for \"Deep Rising\" began on June 12, 1996 and lasted until October 18 of that year. The film was originally set for release in the fall of 1997, but was delayed until the following January. Industrial Light and Magic was responsible for the film's special effects while Rob Bottin who had previously worked on \"The Thing\" and on Paul Verhoven's \"RoboCop\" was hired as the special makeup effects designer.\n\nThe exterior shots of the cruise ship \"Argonautica\" was created by CGI, and is an original design not based on any existing vessel. Two models of the cruise ship were created, a 38ft. model for shots of the \"Argonautica\" on the ocean, and a 110-ft. model for the sinking of \"Argonautica\".\n\nOn its opening weekend the film made $4,737,793 (42% of its total gross), ranking #8. It ended with a total intake of $11.2 million.\n\n\"Deep Rising\" received mostly negative reviews. At Rotten Tomatoes, it has a \"Rotten\" rating of 29%, based on 31 reviews. It also made its way to the Roger Ebert's most hated films list. In his own words, \"Deep Rising is essentially an \"Alien\" clone with a fresh paint job\". whereas \"Variety\" stated that \"'Deep Rising' is an old-fashioned B-movie with A-budget effects, but the quality sheen can't disguise the cheap-thrills hokum.\"\n\nOn the other hand, \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave \"Deep Rising\" a positive review awarding it a B- and stating that it is \"a tightly written, often howlingly funny Aliens knockoff that, in its portrayal of tough men and tougher women under pressure, favorably recalls the work of Howard Hawks.\" while Bloody Disgusting stated that \"Excellent cast, State-of-art special effects, and terrific acting, this is a movie that should not be missed.\"\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe movie was released on DVD and VHS on October 14, 1998, both of which are now out of print. It was released on Blu-ray as a double feature with \"The Puppet Masters\" from Mill Creek Entertainment on October 9, 2012. Kino Lorber re-released the film on DVD and Blu-ray with new special features on August 21, 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "2094013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094013", "title": "Flair bartending", "text": "Flair bartending\n\nFlair bartending is the practice of bartenders entertaining guests, clientele or audiences with the manipulation of bar tools (e.g. cocktail shakers) and liquor bottles in tricky, dazzling ways. Used occasionally in cocktail bars, the action requires skills commonly associated with jugglers. It has become a sought-after talent among venue owners and marketers to help advertise a liquor product or the opening of a bar establishment. Competitions have been sponsored by liquor brands to attract flair bartenders, and some hospitality training companies hold courses to teach flair techniques.\n\nFlair bartending is sometimes referred to as \"extreme bartending\" or contracted to \"flairtending\". The word \"flair\" became popular among practitioners in the mid-1990s. \"Flair\" is also used as a verb (e.g. \"to flair\"), referring to any trickery used by a bartender in order to entertain guests while mixing a drink. Flair can include juggling, flipping (bottles, shakers), manipulating flaming liquors or even performing close-up magic tricks (also referred to as \"bar-magic\").\n\nFlair is showmanship added to bartending that enhances the overall guest experience. The ideas behind mixology and drink-oriented or service-minded bartending can still be upheld with the correct application of working flair. Recently, there is a noticeable rise in bartenders combining prominent mixology knowledge and working flair skills all over the world. Working flair and Exhibition flair are very similar on the grounds that they both require precision and practice, however the use of exhibition flair has become a competition oriented style where significantly greater risks are being taken. Working flair, which is much more common, focuses more on delivering drinks to customers while still ensuring visual entertainment.\n\nThe earliest record of a flair bartender is barman Jerry \"The Professor\" Thomas, who poured fiery streams of boiling water and flaming whisky and mixed an original cocktail called the Blue Blazer in the late nineteenth century.\n\nFlairing was also prominently featured in the 1988 film \"Cocktail\" starring Tom Cruise.\n\nBoth working flair and exhibition flair can be seen in competitions, depending on the rules and regulations of each event. The important distinction between working flair and exhibition flair is not so much the level of liquid in the bottles (though that is a criterion) but the speed in which the bottle is thrown and/or the drink is made. Working flair usually incorporates a \"flat\" throw, which is when the bottle is released into the air without flipping. This gives an illusion of the bottle floating, but reduces the chances of liquid spilling. This also opens the bartender to be able to use similar routines, regardless of what bottle they grab, as the level of liquid is not a factor. The accepted definition of working flair is \"flair that does not noticeably slow service\", usually involving bottles filled to various levels (as in a real work situation) that are quickly manipulated and then poured. Exhibition flair almost always involves bottles that are often pre-set with less than 2 ounces (60ml) specifically for flipping. Exhibition flair often involves longer sequences and routines, multiple objects, and performances choreographed to music.\n\nThe first open competition to have an exhibition round was the Quest for the Best Bartender in 1995.\n\nThe first open competition to have a working flair round was the Quest for the Best Bartender in the World in 1999.\n\nThe first all working flair bartending competition was the Flair Bartenders Shakedown in 2006 organized by BarWars LLC.\n\nThere are different styles of flair bartending competitions. \"Legends of Bartending\" World Bartender Championships test the bartender on four disciplines of bartending, accuracy, speed, working flair and exhibition flair. The \"Blue Blazer\" and Independent Flair League (IFL) in Poland rewards flair and mixology together; competitors gain points for both flair and creative mixology. NATIONS International Flair Challenge and other competitions like Roadhouse World Flair, MBA, Athens Flair Open feature pure exhibition flair where the biggest and best moves are shown.\n\nIn 1986, T.G.I. Friday's management encouraged their bartenders to show their personalities behind the bar and this resulted in several bartenders (a few being John JB Bandy, John Mescall, and Magic Mike) being sent to the corporate T.G.I. Friday's office in Texas to shoot a bartending video. At the end of 1986, T.G.I. Friday's hosted the first national flair bartending competition called \"Bar Olympics\" in Woodland Hills, California. John JB Bandy was the winner of this competition. In 1987, after interviewing 34 bartenders, John JB Bandy was approached across the bar by Touchstone Pictures to assist in training Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown for the 1988 film, \"Cocktail\". Later that year after filming, John JB Bandy produced the very first flair bartending training video called \"Olympic Bartending\". T.G.I. Friday's is credited for modernizing and popularizing flair bartending in the United States beginning in the mid-1980s because they allowed artistic personality freedom behind the bar. London (Roadhouse) and Orlando (Quest for the Best at Pleasure Island's Manniquins) were the hotbeds of flair bartending in the early and mid-1990s. In 1991, T.G.I. Friday's started its global competition called \"World Bartender Championship\". The global competition has continued to today with divisional champions from across the US, Latin America and European Divisions coming to compete in Carrollton, Texas.\n\nThere are hundreds of flair bartending competitions around the world each year, most of which are local and not well publicized. In 2005 the Flair Bartenders Association (FBA) launched the \"FBA Pro Tour\", a linked series of events where competitors earn points toward the title Pro Tour Champion at the end of the year. In 2007 there were 14 events on the Pro Tour with 7 of them located in the US.\n\nIn 2008 the World Flair Association launched the Grand Slam. A worldwide tournament the includes the best competitions from all over the world. It is seen today as the biggest competition/tournament to win in the world of flair. Bartenders travel far and wide for the Grand Slam events to try and earn the title of Grand Slam World Champion. The Grand Slam events vary each year, being located in Europe, Asia, and America.\n\nFive-Time World Champion Ken Hall and Jim Allison, president of the FBA, organized six of those seven events. The flagship flair bartending event is \"Legends of Bartending\", which celebrated its twelfth year in 2010.\n\nSome the biggest flair bartending events all over the World includes\n\nThe International Bartenders Association was founded in 1951. In 2000, the IBA initiated a World Flair Competition. This event is held at the IBA's annual congress of members, together with the organization's World Classic Cocktail Competition (inaugurated in 1955).\n\nThe newest major events to gain credibility among top competitors include:\n\nMajor events are mostly Grand Slam Events. Prize money has reduced significantly since the recession a few years ago. However, there are a lot more competitions worldwide. With the help of the Internet there have also been some online competitions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6577162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6577162", "title": "Funeral oration (ancient Greece)", "text": "Funeral oration (ancient Greece)\n\nA funeral oration or epitaphios logos () is a formal speech delivered on the ceremonial occasion of a funeral. Funerary customs comprise the practices used by a culture to remember the dead, from the funeral itself, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. In ancient Greece and, in particular, in ancient Athens, the funeral oration was deemed an indispensable component of the funeral ritual.\n\nThe \"epitaphios logos\" is regarded as an almost exclusive Athenian creation, although some early elements of such speeches exist in the epos of Homer and in the lyric poems of Pindar. Pericles' Funeral Oration is the earlier extant of the genre. The Athenians are those who set the standard and, therefore, Demosthenes praises them, saying that \"you alone of all mankind publicly pronounce over your dead funeral orations, in which you extol the deeds of the brave\".\n\nIn Homer very few elements of \"epitaphios logos\" or laudation are found. At the funeral of Patroclus chief in all the mourning is Achilles; the son of Peleus laid his bloodstained hand on the breast of his friend and cried, \"Fare well Patroklos, even in the house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you.\" As he spoke he treated the body of Hector with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroklos. At the funeral of Hector the women, Andromache, his mother and Helen, deliver the final public statements over the dead body. Andromache laments the loss of her husband with these emotional words:\n\nIn the \"Sixth Olympian For Hagesias of Syracuse\", the poet mentions a characteristic example of an epitaph high praise: \"Hagesias, that praise is ready for you, which once Adrastus' tongue rightly spoke for the seer Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, when the earth swallowed up him and his shining horses. In Thebes, when the seven pyres of corpses had been consumed, the son of Talaus spoke in this way: “I long for the eye of my army, a man who was good both as a prophet and at fighting with the spear.”\" Nicole Loraux observes that the \"epitaphios\" was \"born of lyric poetry and in competition with it\", since the funeral oratory \"uses poetic themes but reinterprets them from a resolutely political perspective\".\n\nThe orator Anaximenes of Lampsacus claimed that the funeral oration had been originated in the 6th-century BC in Athens by Solon, but this is widely doubted by historians. More plausible, but not beyond doubt, is the statement by Dionysius of Halicarnassus that the Athenians instituted the funeral oration \"in honour or those who fought at Artemisium, Salamis, and Plataea, and died for their country, or to the glory of their exploits at Marathon.\"\n\nThucydides describes in detail the funeral rituals and points out that \"the dead are laid in the public sepulchre in the most beautiful suburb of the city, in which those who fall in war are always buried\". This suburb was Kerameikos, where there was a monument for all the Athenians fell in battle, except such of them as fought at Marathon.\n\nHistorians now believe that the \"demosion sema\" (a collective burial site for the war dead) and the \"epitaphios logos\" were first established around 470 BC, customs that continued during the Periclean period. The earliest preserved casualty list, giving the names of those who died fighting for their city in a given year, dates to 490-480 BC and it is associated with the battle of Marathon, and white-ground lekythoi depicting funerary scenes started around 470 BC. The funeral oration of Pericles, as reported by Thucydides, is the earliest \"epitaphios\" presented in full. The burial of the war dead in the first year of the Peloponnesian War is regarded as reflecting the fifth-century dominance of the public co-memorial.\n\nThough Plato is consistently suspicious of the ability of oratory to teach, in the \"Menexenus\" he demonstrates a theoretical interest in the project of funeral oratory. He actually describes the scheme of the traditional Athenian funeral oration with the following succinct phrase:\n\nThereby, the traditional \"epitaphios\" must contain: a \"eulogy\" of the war dead and the city, an \"exhortation\" to the relatives to copy the virtues of the war dead and a \"consolation\" for the living members of their families.\n\nTherefore, the \"epitaphios\" consists of the following parts:\n\nThe primary function of the funeral oration was to give public expression to the conception of the potential excellence of polis. It was an occasion on which Athens \"invented\" and \"reinvented\" itself in narrative form. The city displayed its achievements, as well as the civic and personal virtues to which the citizens could aspire. The secular prose of the funeral oration dedicates itself to celebrating the ideal of the democratic Athenian city. Through the \"epitaphios\", a civic discourse, the city recognizes itself as it wishes to be.\n\nIt is for this reason that Plato has chosen the funeral oration as a main target of him. In \"Menexenus\" he engages the concerns of funeral oratory and appropriates for philosophy part of the intellectual mission that the Athenians associated with the most celebrated and democratic form of epideictic, the funeral oratory.\n\nWhereas the \"epitaphios\" originated itself as a public speech composed for a specific occasion, a number of specimens of this genre were not composed for delivery at the public burial. They would have been read to small audiences at the intellectual gatherings that met at so many venues. Gorgias' funeral oration, maybe that of Lysias and clearly Plato's parodic \"epitaphios\" in \"Menexenus\" were not designed to be delivered before the Athenian people.\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\nSecondary sources\n"}

His former boss Mr. Turnbull, determined to convince him to return to his nine-to-five existence, chases after him as he performs his routine in seedy nightclubs and honky tonks, but instead the two create Tap Dancing Magicians, a course for pressured businessmen. When their little venture becomes one of the most successful corporations in the world, Donald ironically finds himself feeling the same way he did when he originally quit his job.\n\n\nBrian De Palma had become successful with his 1968 underground comedy, \"Greetings\", and was hired by Warner Bros. to direct \"Get to Know Your Rabbit\" in 1970, right after he had directed a follow-up to \"Greetings\" called \"Hi, Mom!\". While very much a studio picture, \"Rabbit\" was in line with his films up to that time, which were mainly comedies. Much of the comedy has its roots in the traditional British absurdist sense of humor associated with the likes of Monty Python and \"The Goon Show\". Crittenden's screenplay is filled with oddball characters and bizarre situations, such as a bomber who is put on hold when he calls to announce his device will explode in six minutes, or a beautiful young woman who confesses to Donald her crush on the paper boy prompted her to prostitute herself so she could afford a newspaper subscription.\n\nWarner Bros. and star Tommy Smothers felt uneasy about De Palma's direction, as he was at that time an up-and-coming filmmaker with only a couple of films. He was fired from the production due to creative differences, mostly surrounding the ending of the film. \"Get to Know Your Rabbit\" was completed by the studio in 1970 but they didn't release it until two years later. Uncertain how to market it, the studio did little to promote it and the movie quickly disappeared from theaters. The experience gave the director a distaste for the studio system, and he would not work for a major studio again for several years.\n\nIn 1973, the year after the release of \"Get to Know Your Rabbit\", De Palma would put his focus on suspense and obsession with a horror film called \"Sisters\". These themes would recur in much of his output in years since.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38162520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38162520", "title": "History of American comics", "text": "History of American comics\n\nThe history of American comics began in the 19th century in the realm of mass print media and yellow journalism, where they served as a boon to mass readership. In the 20th century, comics became an autonomous art medium and an integral part of American culture.\n\nThe history of American comics started in 1842 with the publication of Rodolphe Töpffer's work \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in the U.S. Local artists took over this new medium and created the first American comics. But it is not until the development of daily newspapers that an important readership is reached through comic strips. The first years corresponded to the establishment of canonical codes (recurring character, speech balloons, etc.) and first genres (family strips, adventure tales). Characters acquired national celebrity and were subject to cross-media adaptation while newspapers were locked in a fierce battle for the most popular authors.\n\nThe second major evolution came in 1934 with the comic book, which allowed the dissemination of comics (first reprints of comic strips) in dedicated media. In 1938, when Superman appeared in one of those comic books, began what is commonly called the Golden Age of Comic Books. During World War II, superheroes and funny animals were the most popular genres. Following the decline of the superheroes, new genres developed (i.e., western, romance, and science fiction) and reached an increasingly important readership. At the beginning of the 1950s, with the emergence of television, comic books sales began to decline. Meanwhile, they suffered many attacks on their alleged harm to youth. For instance, the introduction of the Comics Code Authority (CCA) removed the crime/horror series; though neither comic strips nor magazines were affected by these attacks.\n\nIn 1956 began the Silver Age of Comic Books with the return of the preference for superheroes, such as Flash and Green Lantern by DC Comics. If Dell Comics and its comics for children remained the leading publisher of comic books, genres other than superheroes started to decline and many publishers closed. Very popular superheroes, mainly created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, appeared in Marvel Comics. This turned into the leading publisher of comics in the next period known as the Bronze Age of Comic Books (from the early 1970s to 1985) during which the stories became less manichean while superhero comics maintained their hegemony. The distinction between these two periods is often associated by historians to an event but it is rather a series of changes that affected many aspects of the comics world. At the same time, underground comics appeared, which, aesthetically, addressed new themes, and economically, were based on a new distribution model. Comic strips continue to be distributed throughout the country and even some of them gained international dissemination, such as \"Peanuts\".\n\nThe Modern Age initially seemed to be a new golden age when writers and artists recreated classic characters or launched new series that attracted millions of readers. However, it was then marked by a series of crises that threaten the financial stability of many agents. Alternative comics, successors of underground comics, develop in line with Art Spiegelman and his \"Maus\". On the other hand, the comic strip experienced a crisis more pronounced in the 2000s and linked to that of the press as a whole, while at the same time a new American product, the webcomics, appeared.\n\nAmerican comics historians generally divide 20th-century American comics history chronologically into ages. The first period, called Golden Age, extends from 1938 (first appearance of Superman in \"Action Comics\" #1 by National Allied Publications, a corporate predecessor of DC Comics) to 1954 (introduction of the Comics Code). The following period, the Silver Age, goes from 1956 to early 1970s. The Bronze Age follows immediately and spans until 1986. Finally the last period, from 1986 until today, is the Modern Age. This division is standard but not all the critics apply it, since some of them propose their own periods. Furthermore, the dates selected may vary depending on the authors (there are at least four dates to mark the end of the Bronze Age).\n\nIn \"A Complete History of American Comic Books\", Shirrel Rhoades resumes the canonical division but cites fan historian Ken Quattro, who proposes three heroic periods (from 1938 to 1955, from 1956 to 1986 and from 1986 until today). Rhoades also cites Steve Geppi (the publisher of the \"Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\") who, taking into account comic strips, divides the history of comics in ages: Victorian (Victorian Age, from 1828 — the year when sequential storytelling appeared in the British press (specifically in the \"Political Register\") — to 1882 — the debut of \"Grit\"), of platinum (Platinum Age, from 1882 to 1938), of gold (Golden Age, from 1938 to 1945, the end of World War II — after WWII many marginal superheroes disappeared), atomic (Atom Age, from 1946 to 1956), of silver (Silver Age, from 1956 to 1971), of bronze (Bronze Age, from 1971 — the year when Marvel Comics published a comic-book story about the dangers of drugs in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #96–98 — to 1985 — the year when DC's \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" appeared), of copper (Copper Age, from 1986 to 1992; the era began with the publication of \"\" and \"Watchmen\"), of chrome (Chrome Age, from 1992 — the debut of Image Comics — to 1999 — the year when Marvel Comics emerged from bankruptcy), and modern (Modern Age, since 2000, the year when Marvel's \"Ultimate\" line appeared). Consideration of comic strips in the general history of comics has led Geppito add two periods before the Golden Age: the Victorian Age (from 1828 to 1882) and the Platinum Age (the period of comic strips). Alternative definitions of the latter two periods exist: the Victorian Age has also been defined by fan historian Jamie Coville as beginning in 1842 (with the publication of \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" by Rodolphe Töpffer in the U.S.) and ending in 1897; the Platinum Age has also been defined as beginning in 1897 (with the publication of the \"Yellow Kid\" magazine) and ending in 1938. Quattro sets the ending of the Golden Age in 1949, the year that most of the remaining superheroes (i.e., the heroes that did not disappear after WWII) lost their eponymous series. Comics historian William W. Savage sets the ending of the Atom Age (the period in which there was a prevalence of atomic-bomb narratives and horror stories) in 1954, the year that CCA prohibited most of what had appeared prior to 1954.\n\nAn alternative name for the period after the mid-1980s is Dark Age of Comic Books, due to the popularity and artistic influence of titles with serious content, such as \"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\" and \"Watchmen.\" Pop culture writer Matthew J. Theriault proposed an alternative periodization scheme in which the recent history of comics is divided in ages: dark (Dark Age, from c. 1985 to 2004), modern (Modern Age, from c. 2004 to 2011; the era began with the publication of \"Avengers Disassembled\" and \"Infinite Crisis\"), and postmodern (Postmodern Age, since 2011; the era began with the publication of \"Ultimate Fallout\" #4, the first appearance of Miles Morales). Comics creator Tom Pinchuk proposed the name Diamond Age for the period starting with the appearance of Marvel's \"Ultimate\" line (2000–present).\n\nOriginally only the Golden Age and the Silver Age had a right of citizenship since the terms \"Golden Age\" and \"Silver Age\" had appeared in a letter from a reader published in the nº 42 of \"Justice League of America\" in February 1966 that stated: \"If you guys keep bringing back the heroes from the Golden Age, people 20 years from now will be calling this decade the Silver Sixties!\"\n\nRandy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith, in \"\", reject the traditional scheme and prefer to speak of an era of invention, proliferation, diversification, etc.\n\nComics in the United States originated in the early European works. In fact, in 1842, the work \"Les amours de Mr. Vieux Bois\" by Rodolphe Töpffer was published under the title \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in the U.S. This edition (a newspaper supplement titled \"Brother Jonathan Extra\" No. IX, September 14, 1842) is an unlicensed copy of the original work as it was done without Töpffer's authorization. This first publication was followed by other works of this author, always under types of unlicensed editions. Töpffer comics were reprinted regularly until the late 1870s, which gave American artists the idea to produce similar works. In 1849, \"Journey to the Gold Diggins by Jeremiah Saddlebags\" by James A. and Donald F. Read was the first American comic.\n\nDomestic production remained limited until the emergence of satirical magazines that, on the model of British \"Punch\", published drawings and humorous short stories, but also stories in pictures and silent comics. The three main titles were \"Puck\", \"Judge\" and \"Life\". Authors such as Arthur Burdett Frost created stories as innovative as those produced in the same period by Europeans. However, these magazines only reach an audience educated and rich enough to afford them. Just the arrival of technological progress allowed easy and cheap reproduction of images for the American comic to take off. Some media moguls like William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer engaged in a fierce competition to attract readers and decided to publish cartoons in their newspapers.\n\nThe period of the late nineteenth century (the so-called \"Platinum Age\") was characterized by a gradual introduction of the key elements of the American mass comics. Then, the funnies were found in the humor pages of newspapers: they were published in the Sunday edition to retain readership. Indeed, it was not the information given that distinguished the newspapers but the editorials and the pages which were not informative, whose illustrations were an important component. These pages were then called comic supplement. In 1892, William Randolph Hearst published cartoons in his first newspaper, \"The San Francisco Examiner\". James Swinnerton created on this occasion the first drawings of humanized animals in the series \"Little Bears and Tykes\". Nevertheless, drawings published in the press were rather a series of humorous independent cartoons occupying a full page. The purpose of the cartoon itself, as expressed through narrative sequence expressed through images which follow one another, was only imposed slowly.\n\nIn 1894, Joseph Pulitzer published in the \"New York World\" the first color strip, designed by Walt McDougall, showing that the technique already enabled this kind of publications. Authors began to create recurring characters. Thus, in 1894 and still in the \"New York World\", Richard F. Outcault presented \"Hogan's Alley\", created shortly before in the magazine \"Truth Magazine\". In this series of full-page large drawings teeming with humorous details, he staged street urchins, one of whom was wearing a blue nightgown (which turned yellow in 1895). Soon, the little character became the darling of readers who called him \"Yellow Kid\". On October 25, 1896, the \"Yellow Kid\" pronounced his first words in a speech balloon (they were previously written on his shirt). Outcault had already used this method but this date is often considered as the birth of comics in the United States.\n\n\"Yellow Kid\" success boosted sales of the \"New York World\", fueling the greed of Hearst. Fierce competition between Hearst and Pulitzer in 1896 led to enticing away of Outcault by Hearst to work in the \"New York Journal\". A bitter legal battle allowed Pulitzer to keep publishing \"Hogan's Alley\" (which he entrusted to Georges B. Luks) and Hearst to publish the series under another name. Richard Outcault chose the title \"The Yellow Kid\". Published in 1897, the \"Yellow Kid\" magazine consisting of sheets previously appeared in newspapers and it was the first magazine of its kind.\n\nComics historian Ken Quattro sets the ending of the Golden Age in 1949, the year that most of the remaining superheroes (i.e., the heroes that did not disappear after WWII) lost their eponymous series. Comics historian William W. Savage describes the period 1945–1954 as the period in which there was a prevalence of atomic-bomb narratives and horror stories. Even the few superhero titles that survived the era featured stories reflecting atomic anxieties.\n\nSavage sets the ending of the period in 1954 because this was the year that the Comics Code Authority prohibited most of what had appeared prior to 1954. The crackdown on EC Comics's horror line and its imitators in order for them to comply with the 1954 Code altered the comics industry. The era between the end of the Golden Age and the Silver Age nearly caused the end of the industry. As a result of the Code's restrictions, the mid-1950s saw the rise of Dell Comics, whose family-friendly flagship title \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" often sold over two million copies a month.\n\nThe Silver Age began with the publication of DC Comics' \"Showcase\" #4 (Oct. 1956), which introduced the modern version of the Flash. At the time, only three superheroes—Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman—were still published under their own titles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3636075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3636075", "title": "History of television", "text": "History of television\n\nThe invention of the television was the work of many individuals in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Individuals and corporations competed in various parts of the world to deliver a device that superseded previous technology. Many were compelled to capitalize on the invention and make profit, while some wanted to change the world through visual and audio communication technology.\n\nFacsimile transmission systems pioneered methods of mechanically scanning graphics in the early 19th century. The Scottish inventor Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. The English physicist Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851. The first practical facsimile system, working on telegraph lines, was developed and put into service by the Italian priest Giovanni Caselli from 1856 onward.\n\nWilloughby Smith, an English electrical engineer, discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873.\n\nAs a 23-year-old German university student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884. This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk \"image rasterizer\" became exceedingly common. Constantin Perskyi had coined the word \"television\" in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on August 24, 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others. However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology, by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn among others, made the design practical.\n\nThe first demonstration of the \"instantaneous\" transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina. In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted \"several times\" each second.\n\nIn 1911, Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, \"very crude images\" over wires to the \"Braun tube\" (cathode ray tube or \"CRT\") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner, \"the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy\".\n\nBy the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird employed the Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype in a little village called Santa Cruz on the island of Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named \"Stooky Bill\", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.\n\nIn 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Pathé established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of The Derby. In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead, a 17.5mm film was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.\n\nAn American inventor, Charles Francis Jenkins, also pioneered the television. He published an article on \"Motion Pictures by Wireless\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses. On June 13, 1925, Jenkins publicly demonstrated the synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used a Nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles (from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C.), using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution. He was granted U.S. patent 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922).\n\nOn December 25, 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum at Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus. By 1927, Takayanagi improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931. By 1928, he was the first to transmit human faces in halftones. His work had an influence on the later work of Vladimir K. Zworykin. By 1935, Takayanagi had invented the first all-electronic television. His research toward creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II.\n\nHerbert E. Ives and Frank Gray of Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on April 7, 1927. The reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a two-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24 inches wide by 30 inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets also received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. A flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \"It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\"\n\nIn 1928, WRGB (then W2XB) was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady, NY. It was popularly known as \"WGY Television\".\n\nMeanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Léon Theremin had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16-line resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926. As part of his thesis on May 7, 1926, Theremin electrically transmitted and then projected near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen. By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until 1931 by RCA, with 120 lines.\n\nBecause only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution in mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to about 120. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal.\n\nAnton Codelli (22nd. March, 1875 - † 28. April 1954), a Slovenian nobleman, was a passionate inventor. Among other things, he had devised a miniature refrigerator for cars and a new rotary engine design. Intrigued by television, he decided to apply his technical skills to the new medium. At the time, the biggest challenge in television technology was to transmit images with sufficient resolution to reproduce recognizable figures. As recounted by media historian Melita Zajc, most inventors were determined to increase the number of lines used by their systems – some were approaching what was then the magic number of 100 lines. But Baron Codelli had a different idea. In 1929, he developed a television device with a single line – but one that formed a continuous spiral on the screen. Codelli based his ingenious design on his understanding of the human eye. He knew that objects seen in peripheral vision don’t need to be as sharp as those in the center. The baron’s mechanical television system, whose image was sharpest in the middle, worked well, and he was soon able to transmit images of his wife, Ilona von Drasche-Lazar, over the air.\nDespite the backing of the German electronics giant Telefunken, however, Codelli’s television system never became a commercial reality. Electronic television ultimately emerged as the dominant system, and Codelli moved on to other projects. His invention was largely forgotten.\n\nThe advancement of all-electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical TV usually only produced small images. It was the main type of TV until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.\n\nIn 1897, J. J. Thomson, an English physicist, in his three famous experiments was able to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the \"Braun tube\". It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor-coated screen. A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal \"Scientific American\" in 1909. In 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal \"Nature\" in which he described how \"distant electric vision\" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube (or \"Braun\" tube) as both a transmitting and receiving device. He expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in \"The Times\" and the Journal of the Röntgen Society. In a letter to \"Nature\" published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some \"not very successful experiments\" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died. They were later repeated in 1937 by two different teams, H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting \"very faint\" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel. The first cathode ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.\n\nIn 1926, Hungarian engineer Kálmán Tihanyi designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing the principle of \"charge storage\" within the scanning (or \"camera\") tube. The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or \"camera\" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by Kálmán Tihanyi beginning in 1924. His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (\"photoelectrons\") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed \"Radioskop\". After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930, and so he applied for patents in the United States. Although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of RCA's \"iconoscope\" in 1931, the U.S. patent for Tihanyi's transmitting tube would not be granted until May 1939. The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October. Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval. Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day.\n\nOn December 25, 1926, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a TV system with a 40-line resolution that employed a CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. Takayanagi did not apply for a patent.\n\nOn September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (\"Pem\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).\nMeanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.\n\nIn 1933 RCA introduced an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle. Dubbed the Iconoscope by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was claimed to be much more sensitive than Farnsworth's image dissector. However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique \"multipactor\" device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. A problem with the multipactor, unfortunately, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.\n\nAt the Berlin Radio Show in August 1931, Manfred von Ardenne gave a public demonstration of a television system using a CRT for both transmission and reception. However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film. Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on August 25, 1934, and for ten days afterwards.\n\nIn Britain the EMI engineering team led by Isaac Shoenberg applied in 1932 for a patent for a new device they dubbed \"the Emitron\", which formed the heart of the cameras they designed for the BBC. On November 2, 1936, a 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace, and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the Victorian building's towers. It alternated for a short time with Baird's mechanical system in adjoining studios, but was more reliable and visibly superior. This was the world's first regular high-definition television service.\n\nThe original American iconoscope was noisy, had a high ratio of interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially when compared to the high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. This was the first time that anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighbor buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA could do the same before the 1939 New York World's Fair.\n\nOn the other hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken. The \"image iconoscope\" (\"Superikonoskop\" in Germany) was produced as a result of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their \"Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher\" (\"Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television\") in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.\n\nAmerican television broadcasting at the time consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941. RCA, for example, used only Iconoscopes in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco. In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents. With this historic agreement in place, RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems. In 1941, the United States implemented 525-line television.\n\nThe world's first 625-line television standard was designed in the Soviet Union in 1944, and became a national standard in 1946. The first broadcast in 625-line standard occurred in 1948 in Moscow. The concept of 625 lines per frame was subsequently implemented in the European CCIR standard.\n\nIn 1936, Kálmán Tihanyi described the principle of plasma display, the first flat panel display system.\nIn 1978, James P Mitchell described, prototyped and demonstrated what was perhaps the earliest monochromatic flat panel LED television display LED Display targeted at replacing the CRT.\n\nThe basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built.\nAmong the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no practical details. Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it. Another inventor, Hovannes Adamian, also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him, and was patented in Germany on March 31, 1908, patent № 197183, then in Britain, on April 1, 1908, patent № 7219, in France (patent № 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent № 17912).\n\nScottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's first color transmission on July 3, 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on February 4, 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London's Dominion Theatre.\n\nMechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green and blue images into one full color image.\n\nThe first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disc. This device was very \"deep\", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console. However, Baird was not happy with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.\n\nMexican inventor Guillermo González Camarena also played an important role in early TV. His experiments with TV (known as telectroescopía at first) began in 1931 and led to a patent for the \"trichromatic field sequential system\" color television in 1940.\n\nIn 1939, Hungarian engineer Peter Carl Goldmark introduced an electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 4.\n\nCBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as August 28, 1940, and live cameras by November 12. NBC (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on February 20, 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on June 1, 1941. These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22, 1942, to August 20, 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.\n\nAs early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the \"Telechrome\". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). A demonstration on August 16, 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. This used a patterned version of the phosphor plate, with the guns aimed at ridges on one side of the plate. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.\n\nSimilar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.\n\nOne of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic Compatible color system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.\nAlthough all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953, high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on January 1, 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\n\nEarly color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of GE's relatively compact and lightweight Porta-Color set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets.\n\nColor broadcasting in Europe was also not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color, and by the early 1980s black-and-white sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.\n\nDigital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. Digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.\n\nDigital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high-performance computers. It wasn't until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Japanese consumer electronics firms developed HDTV technology, and the MUSE analog format proposed by NHK, a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard—based on an analog system—was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.\n\nIn March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \"simulcast\" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.\n\nThe final standard adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, that is, 1080 lines per picture and 1920 pixels per line. William F. Schreiber, who was a director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.\n\nDigital television transition started in the late 2000s. All the governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by the 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low. But soon, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.\n\nAdvent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as \"connected TV\" or \"hybrid television\", is a television set with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 features, and is an example of technological convergence between computers and television sets and set-top boxes. Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access. These TVs come pre-loaded with an operating system.\n\nSmart TV should not to be confused with Internet TV, IPTV or with Web TV. Internet television refers to the receiving television content over internet instead of traditional systems (terrestrial, cable and satellite) (although internet itself is received by these methods). Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.\n\nA first patent was filed in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an \"intelligent\" television system, linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs.\n\nMajor TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015.\n\nStereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on August 10, 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London. Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electro-mechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs.\n\nAlthough 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads among the public. Many 3D television channels that started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s.\n\nProgramming is broadcast by television stations, sometimes called \"channels\", as stations are licensed by their governments to broadcast only over assigned channels in the television band. At first, terrestrial broadcasting was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because bandwidth was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of channels available, government regulation was the norm.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which had public service as part of its Royal Charter.\n\nWRGB claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on January 13, 1928, broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady, NY, under the call letters W2XB. It was popularly known as \"WGY Television\" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters W2XBS and which today is known as WNBC. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a Felix the Cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers.\n\nOn November 2, 1936, the BBC began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian Alexandra Palace in north London. It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.\n\nWith the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna. A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to a switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offer pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to CATV for cord cutters.\n\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) adopted the American NTSC 525-line B/W 60 field per second system as its broadcast standard. It began television broadcasting in Canada in September 1952. The first broadcast was on September 6, 1952 from its Montreal station CBFT. The premiere broadcast was bilingual, spoken in English and French. Two days later, on September 8, 1952, the Toronto station CBLT went on the air. This became the English-speaking flagship station for the country, while CBFT became the French-language flagship after a second English-language station was licensed to CBC in Montreal later in the decade. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, CKSO in Sudbury, Ontario, launched in October 1953 (at the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that was relaxed in 1960–61 when CTV, Canada's second national English-language network, was formed).\n\nIn former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia and the Czech Republic) the first experimental television sets were produced in 1948. In the same year the first TV- transmission was performed. The first regular TV public transmission started on May 1, 1953. The state-owned TV-centers were in Prague, Bratislava, Brno and Ostrava. In 1961 more than a million citizens had a television set. In 1970, Czechoslovak television had three channels: Czech, Slovak and a bilingual Federal Channel. In 1973, color broadcasting started.\n\nThe first experiments in television broadcasting began in France in the 1930s, although the French did not immediately employ the new technology.\n\nIn November 1929, Bernard Natan established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. On April 14, 1931, there took place the first transmission with a thirty-line standard by René Barthélemy. On December 6, 1931, Henri de France created the Compagnie Générale de Télévision (CGT). In December 1932, Barthélemy carried out an experimental program in black and white (definition: 60 lines) one hour per week, \"Paris Télévision\", which gradually became daily from early 1933.\n\nThe first official channel of French television appeared on February 13, 1935, the date of the official inauguration of television in France, which was broadcast in 60 lines from 8:15 to 8:30 pm. The program showed the actress Béatrice Bretty in the studio of Radio-PTT Vision at 103 rue de Grenelle in Paris. The broadcast had a range of . On November 10, George Mandel, Minister of Posts, inaugurated the first broadcast in 180 lines from the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower. On the 18th, Susy Wincker, the first announcer since the previous June, carried out a demonstration for the press from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Broadcasts became regular from January 4, 1937 from 11:00 to 11:30 am and 8:00 to 8:30 pm during the week, and from 5:30 to 7:30 pm on Sundays. In July 1938, a decree defined for three years a standard of 455 lines VHF (whereas three standards were used for the experiments: 441 lines for Gramont, 450 lines for the Compagnie des Compteurs and 455 for Thomson). In 1939, there were about only 200 to 300 individual television sets, some of which were also available in a few public places.\n\nWith the entry of France into World War II the same year, broadcasts ceased and the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was sabotaged. On September 3, 1940, French television was seized by the German occupation forces. A technical agreement was signed by the Compagnie des Compteurs and Telefunken, and a financing agreement for the resuming of the service is signed by German Ministry of Post and Radiodiffusion Nationale (Vichy's radio). On May 7, 1943 at 3:00 evening broadcasts. The first broadcast of Fernsehsender Paris (Paris Télévision) was transmitted from rue Cognac-Jay. These regular broadcasts (5 hours a day) lasted until August 16, 1944. One thousand 441-line sets, most of which were installed in soldiers' hospitals, picked up the broadcasts. These Nazi-controlled television broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower in Paris were able to be received on the south coast of England by R.A.F. and BBC engineers, who photographed the station identification image direct from the screen.\n\nIn 1944, René Barthélemy developed an 819-line television standard. During the years of occupation, Barthélemy reached 1015 and even 1042 lines. On October 1, 1944, television service resumed after the liberation of Paris. The broadcasts were transmitted from the Cognacq-Jay studios. In October 1945, after repairs, the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was back in service. On November 20, 1948, François Mitterrand decreed a broadcast standard of 819 lines; broadcasting began at the end of 1949 in this definition. Besides France, this standard was later adopted by Algeria, Monaco, and Morocco. Belgium and Luxembourg used a modified version of this standard with bandwidth narrowed to 7 MHz.\n\nElectromechanical broadcasts began in Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on 180 lines using telecine transmission of film, intermediate film system, or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras based on the iconoscope began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin Summer Olympic Games were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and Hamburg in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system on the air in February 1937, and during World War II brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the victorious Allies imposed a general ban on all radio and television broadcasting in Germany. Radio broadcasts for information purposes were soon permitted again, but television broadcasting was allowed to resume only in 1948.\n\nIn East Germany, the head of broadcasting in the Soviet occupation zone, Hans Mahler, predicted in 1948 that in the near future ‘a new and important technical step forward in the field of broadcasting in Germany will begin its triumphant march: television.’ In 1950, the plans for a nationwide television service got off the ground, and a Television Centre in Berlin was approved. Transmissions began on December 21, 1952 using the 625-line standard developed in the Soviet Union in 1944, although at that time there were probably no more than 75 television receivers capable of receiving the programming.\n\nIn West Germany, the British occupation forces as well as NWDR (Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk), which had started work in the British zone straight after the war, agreed to the launch of a television station. Even before this, German television specialists had agreed on 625 lines as the future standard. This standard had narrower channel bandwidth (7 MHz) compared to the Soviet specification (8 MHz), allowing three television channels to fit into the VHF I band.\n\nWhen color was introduced, West Germany chose a variant of the NTSC color system, modified by Walter Bruch and called PAL. East Germany accepted the French SECAM system, which was used in Eastern European countries. With the reunification of Germany, it was decided to switch to the PAL color system. The system was changed in December 1990.\n\nIn Italy, the first experimental tests on television broadcasts were made in Turin since 1934. The city already hosted the Center for Management of the EIAR (lately renamed as RAI) at the premises of the Theatre of Turin. Subsequently, the EAIR established offices in Rome and Milan.\nOn July 22, 1939 comes into operation in Rome the first television transmitter at the EIAR station, which performed a regular broadcast for about a year using a 441-line system that was developed in Germany. In September of the same year, a second television transmitter was installed in Milan, making experimental broadcasts during major events in the city.\n\nThe broadcasts were suddenly ended on May 31, 1940, by order of the government, allegedly because of interferences encountered in the first air navigation systems. Also, the imminent participation in the war is believed to have played a role in this decision. EIAR transmitting equipment was relocated to Germany by the German troops. Lately, it was returned to Italy.\n\nThe first official television broadcast began on January 3, 1954 by the RAI.\n\nTelevision broadcasting in Japan started in August 28, 1953, making the country one of the first in the world with an experimental television service. The first television tests were conducted as early as 1926 using a combined mechanical Nipkow disk and electronic Braun tube system, later switching to an all-electronic system in 1935 using a domestically developed iconoscope system. In spite of that, because of the beginning of World War II in the Pacific region, this first full-fledged TV broadcast experimentation lasted only a few months. Regular television broadcasts would eventually start in 1953.\n\nIn 1979, NHK first developed a consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio. The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125 lines). Satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of BS-9ch commenced on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK television programming.\n\nSony first demonstrated a wideband analog high-definition television system HDTV capable video camera, monitor and video tape recorder (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in Algiers. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 video switcher all working in the 1125-line component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio.\n\nThe first testing television station in Mexico signed on in 1935. When KFMB-TV in San Diego signed on in 1949, Baja California became the first state to receive a commercial television station over the air. Within a year, the Mexican government would adopt the U.S. NTSC 525-line B/W 60-field-per-second system as the country's broadcast standard. In 1950, the first commercial television station within Mexico, XHTV in Mexico City, signed on the air, followed by XEW-TV in 1951 and XHGC in 1952. Those three were not only the first television stations in the country, but also the flagship stations of Telesistema Mexicano, which was formed in 1955. That year, Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta, who had signed on XEW-TV, entered into a partnership with Rómulo O'Farrill who had signed on XHTV, and Guillermo González Camarena, who had signed on XHGC. The earliest 3D television broadcasts in the world were broadcast over XHGC in 1954. Color television was introduced in 1962, also over XHGC-TV. One of Telesistema Mexicano's earliest broadcasts as a network, over XEW-TV, on June 25, 1955, was the first international North American broadcast in the medium's history, and was jointly aired with NBC in the United States, where it aired as the premiere episode of \"Wide Wide World,\" and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Except for a brief period between 1969–1973, nearly every commercial television station in Mexico, with exceptions in the border cities, was expected to affiliate with a subnetwork of Telesistema Mexicano or its successor, Televisa (formed by the 1973 merger of Telesistema Mexicano and Television Independiente de Mexico). This condition would not be relaxed for good until 1993, when Imevision was privatized to become TV Azteca.\n\nThe Soviet Union began offering 30-line electromechanical test broadcasts in Moscow on October 31, 1931, and a commercially manufactured television set in 1932.\n\nFirst electronic television system on 180 lines at 25 fps was created in the beginning of 1935 in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). In September 1937 the experimental Leningrad TV Center (OLTC) was put in action. OLTC worked with 240 lines at 25 fps progressive scan.\n\nIn Moscow, experimental transmissions of electronic television took place on March 9, 1937, using equipment manufactured by RCA. Regular broadcasting began on December 31, 1938. It was quickly realized that 343 lines of resolution offered by this format would have become insufficient in the long run, thus a specification for 441-line format at 25 fps interlaced was developed in 1940.\n\nTelevision broadcasts were suspended during Great Patriotic War. In 1944, while the war was still raging, a new standard, offering 625 lines of vertical resolution was prepared. This format was ultimately accepted as a national standard.\n\nThe transmissions in 625-line format started in Moscow on November 4, 1948. Regular broadcasting began on June 16, 1949. Details for this standard were formalized in 1955 specification called \"GOST 7845-55, basic parameters for black-and-white television broadcast\". In particular, frame size was set to 625 lines, frame rate to 25 frames/s interlaced, and video bandwidth to 6 MHz. These basic parameters were accepted by most countries having 50 Hz mains frequency and became the foundation of television systems presently known as PAL and SECAM.\n\nStarting in 1951, broadcasting in the 625-line standard was introduced in other major cities of the Soviet Union.\n\nColor television broadcast started in 1967, using SECAM color system.\n\nThe first Turkish television channel, ITU TV, was launched in 1952. The first national television is TRT 1 and was launched in 1964. Color television was introduced in 1981. Before 1989 there was the only channel, the state broadcasting company TRT, and it broadcast in several times of the dateline. Turkey's first private television channel Star started it broadcast on 26 May 1989. Until then there was only one television channel controlled by the state, but with the wave of liberalization, privately owned broadcasting began. Turkey's television market is defined by a handful of big channels, led by Kanal D, ATV and Show, with 14%, 10% and 9.6% market share, respectively. The most important reception platforms are terrestrial and satellite, with almost 50% of homes using satellite (of these 15% were pay services) at the end of 2009. Three services dominate the multi-channel market: the satellite platforms Digitürk and D-Smart and the cable TV service Türksat.\n\nThe first British television broadcast was made by Baird Television's electromechanical system over the BBC radio transmitter in September 1929. Baird provided a limited amount of programming five days a week by 1930. During this time, Southampton earned the distinction of broadcasting the first-ever live television interview, which featured Peggy O'Neil, an actress and singer from Buffalo, New York. On August 22, 1932, BBC launched its own regular service using Baird's 30-line electromechanical system, continuing until September 11, 1935. On November 2, 1936 the BBC began broadcasting a dual-system service, alternating between Marconi-EMI's 405-line standard and Baird's improved 240-line standard, from Alexandra Palace in London, making the BBC Television Service (now BBC One) the UK's first regular high-definition television service. The government, on advice from a special advisory committee, decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic system gave the superior picture, and the Baird system was dropped in February 1937. TV broadcasts in London were on the air an average of four hours daily from 1936 to 1939. There were 12,000 to 15,000 receivers. Some sets in restaurants or bars might have 100 viewers for sport events (Dunlap, p56). The outbreak of the Second World War caused the BBC service to be abruptly suspended on September 1, 1939, at 12:35 pm, after a Mickey Mouse cartoon and test signals were broadcast, so that transmissions could not be used as a beacon to guide enemy aircraft to London. It resumed, again from Alexandra Palace on June 7, 1946 after the end of the war, began with a live programme that opened with the line \"Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?\" and was followed by the same Mickey Mouse cartoon broadcast on the last day before the war. At the end of 1947 there were 54,000 licensed television receivers, compared with 44,000 television sets in the United States at that time.\n\nThe first transatlantic television signal was sent in 1928 from London to New York by the Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television, although this signal was not broadcast to the public. The first live satellite signal to Britain from the United States was broadcast via the Telstar satellite on July 23, 1962.\n\nThe first live broadcast from the European continent was made on August 27, 1950.\n\nThe first regularly scheduled television service in the United States began on July 2, 1928, fifteen months before the United Kingdom. The Federal Radio Commission authorized C. F. Jenkins to broadcast from experimental station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. For at least the first eighteen months, 48-line silhouette images from motion picture film were broadcast, although beginning in the summer of 1929 he occasionally broadcast in halftones.\n\nHugo Gernsback's New York City radio station began a regular, if limited, schedule of live television broadcasts on August 14, 1928, using 48-line images. Working with only one transmitter, the station alternated radio broadcasts with silent television images of the station's call sign, faces in motion, and wind-up toys in motion. Speaking later that month, Gernsback downplayed the broadcasts, intended for amateur experimenters. \"In six months we may have television for the public, but so far we have not got it.\" Gernsback also published \"Television\", the world's first magazine about the medium.\n\nGeneral Electric's experimental station in Schenectady, New York, on the air sporadically since January 13, 1928, was able to broadcast reflected-light, 48-line images via shortwave as far as Los Angeles, and by September was making four television broadcasts weekly. It is considered to be the direct predecessor of current television station WRGB. \"The Queen's Messenger\", a one-act play broadcast on September 11, 1928, was the world's first live drama on television.\n\nRadio giant RCA began daily experimental television broadcasts in New York City in March 1929 over station W2XBS, the predecessor of current television station WNBC. The 60-line transmissions consisted of pictures, signs, and views of persons and objects. Experimental broadcasts continued to 1931.\n\nGeneral Broadcasting System's WGBS radio and W2XCR television aired their regular broadcasting debut in New York City on April 26, 1931, with a special demonstration set up in Aeolian Hall at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-fourth Street. Thousands waited to catch a glimpse of the Broadway stars who appeared on the six-inch (15 cm) square image, in an evening event to publicize a weekday programming schedule offering films and live entertainers during the four-hour daily broadcasts. Appearing were boxer Primo Carnera, actors Gertrude Lawrence, Louis Calhern, Frances Upton and Lionel Atwill, WHN announcer Nils Granlund, the Forman Sisters, and a host of others.\n\nCBS's New York City station W2XAB began broadcasting their first regular seven-day-a-week television schedule on July 21, 1931, with a 60-line electromechanical system. The first broadcast included Mayor Jimmy Walker, the Boswell Sisters, Kate Smith, and George Gershwin. The service ended in February 1933. Don Lee Broadcasting's station W6XAO in Los Angeles went on the air in December 1931. Using the UHF spectrum, it broadcast a regular schedule of filmed images every day except Sundays and holidays for several years.\n\nBy 1935, low-definition electromechanical television broadcasting had ceased in the United States except for a handful of stations run by public universities that continued to 1939. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) saw television in the continual flux of development with no consistent technical standards, hence all such stations in the U.S. were granted only experimental and non-commercial licenses, hampering television's economic development. Just as importantly, Philo Farnsworth's August 1934 demonstration of an all-electronic system at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia pointed out the direction of television's future.\n\nOn June 15, 1936, Don Lee Broadcasting began a one-month-long demonstration of high definition (240+ line) television in Los Angeles on W6XAO (later KTSL, now KCBS-TV) with a 300-line image from motion picture film. By October, W6XAO was making daily television broadcasts of films. By 1934 RCA increased the definition to 343 interlaced lines and the frame rate to 30 per second. On July 7, 1936 RCA and its subsidiary NBC demonstrated in New York City a 343-line electronic television broadcast with live and film segments to its licensees, and made its first public demonstration to the press on November 6. Irregularly scheduled broadcasts continued through 1937 and 1938. Regularly scheduled electronic broadcasts began in April 1938 in New York (to the second week of June, and resuming in August) and Los Angeles. NBC officially began regularly scheduled television broadcasts in New York on April 30, 1939, with a broadcast of the opening of the 1939 New York World's Fair.\n\nIn 1937 RCA raised the frame definition to 441 lines, and its executives petitioned the FCC for approval of the standard. By June 1939, regularly scheduled 441-line electronic television broadcasts were available in New York City and Los Angeles, and by November on General Electric's station in Schenectady. From May through December 1939, the New York City NBC station (W2XBS) of RCA broadcast twenty to fifty-eight hours of programming per month, Wednesday through Sunday of each week. The programming was 33% news, 29% drama, and 17% educational programming, with an estimated 2,000 receiving sets by the end of the year, and an estimated audience of five to eight thousand. A remote truck could cover outdoor events from up to away from the transmitter, which was located atop the Empire State Building. Coaxial cable was used to cover events at Madison Square Garden. The coverage area for reliable reception was a radius of 40 to from the Empire State Building, an area populated by more than 10,000,000 people (Lohr, 1940).\n\nThe FCC adopted NTSC television engineering standards on May 2, 1941, calling for 525 lines of vertical resolution, 30 frames per second with interlaced scanning, 60 fields per second, and sound carried by frequency modulation. Sets sold since 1939 that were built for slightly lower resolution could still be adjusted to receive the new standard. (Dunlap, p31). The FCC saw television ready for commercial licensing, and the first such licenses were issued to NBC- and CBS-owned stations in New York on July 1, 1941, followed by Philco's station WPTZ in Philadelphia.\n\nThe first official, paid advertising to appear on American commercial television occurred on the afternoon of July 1, 1941, over New York \nstation WNBT (now WNBC) before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The announcement for Bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.\n\nAfter the U.S. entry into World War II, the FCC reduced the required minimum air time for commercial television stations from 15 hours per week to 4 hours. Most TV stations suspended broadcasting; of the ten original television stations only six continued through the war. On the few that remained, programs included entertainment such as boxing and plays, events at Madison Square Garden, and illustrated war news as well as training for air raid wardens and first aid providers. In 1942, there were 5,000 sets in operation, but production of new TVs, radios, and other broadcasting equipment for civilian purposes was suspended from April 1942 to August 1945 (Dunlap).\n\nBy 1947, when there were 40 million radios in the U.S., there were about 44,000 television sets (with probably 30,000 in the New York area). Regular network television broadcasts began on NBC on a three-station network linking New York with the Capital District and Philadelphia in 1944; on the DuMont Television Network in 1946, and on CBS and ABC in 1948.\n\nFollowing the rapid rise of television after the war, the Federal Communications Commission was flooded with applications for television station licenses. With more applications than available television channels, the FCC ordered a freeze on processing station applications in 1948 that remained in effect until April 14, 1952.\n\nBy 1949, the networks stretched from New York to the Mississippi River, and by 1951 to the West Coast. Commercial color television broadcasts began on CBS in 1951 with a field-sequential color system that was suspended four months later for technical and economic reasons. The television industry's National Television System Committee (NTSC) developed a color television system based on RCA technology that was compatible with existing black and white receivers, and commercial color broadcasts reappeared in 1953.\n\nCable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.\n\nThe abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924.\n\nEarly cable television was analog, but since the 2000s all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.\n\nSatellite television is a system of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television programme for viewing on a television set. Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.\n\nThe most common method of reception is direct-broadcast satellite television (DBSTV), also known as \"direct to home\" (DTH). In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the K wavelength and are completely digital. Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television receive-only. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C-band spectrum from FSS type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed \"big dish\" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.\n\nThe direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. Digital signals may include high-definition television (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are free-to-air or free-to-view, while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription.\nIn 1945 British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed a worldwide communications system that would function by means of three satellites equally spaced apart in earth orbit. This was published in the October 1945 issue of the Wireless World magazine and won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1963.\n\nThe first satellite television signals from Europe to North America were relayed via the Telstar satellite over the Atlantic ocean on July 23, 1962. The signals were received and broadcast in North American and European countries and watched by over 100 million. Launched in 1962, the \"Relay 1\" satellite was the first satellite to transmit television signals from the US to Japan. The first geosynchronous communication satellite, Syncom 2, was launched on July 26, 1963.\n\nThe world's first commercial communications satellite, called Intelsat I and nicknamed \"Early Bird\", was launched into geosynchronous orbit on April 6, 1965. The first national network of television satellites, called Orbita, was created by the Soviet Union in October 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to a network of twenty ground downlink stations each equipped with a parabolic antenna in diameter. The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972. ATS-6, the world's first experimental educational and Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), was launched on May 30, 1974. It transmitted at 860 MHz using wideband FM modulation and had two sound channels. The transmissions were focused on the Indian subcontinent but experimenters were able to receive the signal in Western Europe using home constructed equipment that drew on UHF television design techniques already in use.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the Moskva (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signals via satellites was launched in 1979. Stationary and mobile downlink stations with parabolic antennas in diameter were receiving signal from Gorizont communication satellites deployed to geostationary orbits. The first in a series of Soviet geostationary satellites to carry Direct-To-Home television, Ekran 1, was launched on October 26, 1976. It used a 714 MHz UHF downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing UHF television technology rather than microwave technology.\n\nIn the United States, the satellite television industry developed from the cable television industry as communication satellites were being used to distribute television programming to remote cable television headends. Home Box Office (HBO), Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), and Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN, later The Family Channel) were among the first to use satellite television to deliver programming. Taylor Howard of San Andreas, California became the first person to receive C-band satellite signals with his home-built system in 1976. PBS, a non-profit public broadcasting service, began to distribute its television programming by satellite in 1978. On October 18, 1979, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began allowing people to have home satellite earth stations without a federal government license. The front cover of the 1979 Neiman-Marcus Christmas catalogue featured the first home satellite TV stations on sale for $36,500. The dishes were nearly in diameter and were remote-controlled. The price went down by half soon after that, but there were only eight more channels. The Society for Private and Commercial Earth Stations (SPACE), an organisation that represented consumers and satellite TV system owners was established in 1980.\nEarly satellite television systems were not very popular due to their expense and large dish size. The satellite television dishes of the systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s were in diameter, made of fibreglass or solid aluminum or steel, and in the United States cost more than $5,000, sometimes as much as $10,000. Programming sent from ground stations was relayed from eighteen satellites in geostationary orbit located above the Earth.\n\nBy 1980, satellite television was well established in the USA and Europe. On April 26, 1982, the first satellite channel in the UK, Satellite Television Ltd. (later Sky1), was launched. Its signals were transmitted from the ESA's Orbital Test Satellites. Between 1981 and 1985, TVRO systems' sales rates increased as prices fell. Advances in receiver technology and the use of Gallium Arsenide FET technology enabled the use of smaller dishes. 500,000 systems, some costing as little as $2000, were sold in the US in 1984. Dishes pointing to one satellite were even cheaper. People in areas without local broadcast stations or cable television service could obtain good-quality reception with no monthly fees. The large dishes were a subject of much consternation, as many people considered them eyesores, and in the US most condominiums, neighborhoods, and other homeowner associations tightly restricted their use, except in areas where such restrictions were illegal. These restrictions were altered in 1986 when the Federal Communications Commission ruled all of them illegal. A municipality could require a property owner to relocate the dish if it violated other zoning restrictions, such as a setback requirement, but could not outlaw their use. The necessity of these restrictions would slowly decline as the dishes got smaller.\n\nOriginally, all channels were broadcast in the clear (ITC) because the equipment necessary to receive the programming was too expensive for consumers. With the growing number of TVRO systems, the program providers and broadcasters had to scramble their signal and develop subscription systems.\n\nIn October 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which gave those using TVRO systems the right to receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and required those who did scramble to make their signals available for a reasonable fee. Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition. In January 1986, HBO began using the now-obsolete VideoCipher II system to encrypt their channels. Other channels uses less secure television encryption systems. The scrambling of HBO was met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels, claiming that clear signals from cable channels would be difficult to receive. Eventually HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service for $12.95 per month, a price equal to or higher than what cable subscribers were paying, and required a descrambler to be purchased for $395. This led to the attack on HBO's transponder Galaxy 1 by John R. MacDougall in April 1986. One by one, all commercial channels followed HBO's lead and began scrambling their channels. The Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association SBCA was founded on December 2, 1986 as the result of a merger between SPACE and the Direct Broadcast Satellite Association (DBSA).\n\nVideocipher II used analog scrambling on its video signal and Data Encryption Standard based encryption on its audio signal. VideoCipher II was defeated, and there was a black market for descrambler devices, which were initially sold as \"test\" devices.\n\nBy 1987, nine channels were scrambled, but 99 others were available free-to-air. While HBO initially charged a monthly fee of $19.95, soon it became possible to unscramble all channels for $200 a year. Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since some people would never have cable service, and the industry was starting to recover as a result. Scrambling also led to the development of pay-per-view events. On November 1, 1988, NBC began scrambling its C-band signal but left its K band signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising. Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band. ABC and CBS were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local network affiliates. The piracy on satellite television networks in the US led to the introduction of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. This legislation enabled anyone caught engaging in signal theft to be fined up to $50,000 and to be sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison. A repeat offender can be fined up to $100,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years.\n\nSatellite television had also developed in Europe but it initially used low power communication satellites and it required dish sizes of over . On December 11, 1988 Luxembourg launched Astra 1A, the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe. This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in K band and allowing reception with small dishes (90 cm). The launch of Astra beat the winner of the UK's state Direct Broadcast Satellite licence holder, British Satellite Broadcasting, to the market.\n\nIn the US in the early 1990s, four large cable companies launched PrimeStar, a direct broadcasting company using medium power satellite. The relatively strong transissions allowed the use of smaller (90 cm) dishes. Its popularity declined with the 1994 launch of the Hughes DirecTV and Dish Network satellite television systems.\n\nOn March 4, 1996 EchoStar introduced Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) using the EchoStar 1 satellite. EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 to increase the number of channels available on Dish Network to 170. These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150-200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used. This greatly reduced the popularity of TVRO systems. In the mid-1990s, channels began moving their broadcasts to digital television transmission using the DigiCipher conditional access system.\n\nIn addition to encryption, the widespread availability, in the US, of DBS services such as PrimeStar and DirecTV had been reducing the popularity of TVRO systems since the early 1990s. Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent K band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the solar panels and energy efficiency of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the digital modulation methods now used require less signal strength at the receiver than analog modulation methods. Each satellite also can carry up to 32 transponders in the K band, but only 24 in the C band, and several digital subchannels can be multiplexed (MCPC) or carried separately (SCPC) on a single transponder. Advances in noise reduction due to improved microwave technology and semiconductor materials have also had an effect. However, one consequence of the higher frequencies used for DBS services is rain fade where viewers lose signal during a heavy downpour. C-band satellite television signals are less prone to rain fade.\n\nInternet television (Internet TV), (online television) or IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is the digital distribution of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable and satellite, although internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows and other video content over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters.\n\nInternet television should not to be confused with Smart TV, IPTV or with Web TV. Smart television refers to the TV set that has an inbuilt operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.\n\nA television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD. In the late 2000s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a USB device.\nMechanical televisions were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the United Kingdom, United States, and Soviet Union. The earliest commercially made televisions sold by Baird called Televisors in the UK in 1928 were radios with the addition of a television device consisting of a neon tube behind a mechanically spinning disk (patented by German engineer Paul Nipkow in 1884) with a spiral of apertures first mass-produced television set, selling about a thousand units.\n\nThe first commercially made electronic televisions with cathode ray tubes were manufactured by Telefunken in Germany in 1934, followed by other makers in France (1936), Britain (1936), and the United States (1938). The cheapest model with a 12-inch (30 cm) screen was $445 (). An estimated 19,000 electronic televisions were manufactured in Britain, and about 1,600 in Germany, before World War II. About 7,000–8,000 electronic sets were made in the U.S. before the War Production Board halted manufacture in April 1942, production resuming in August 1945. Television usage in the western world skyrocketed after World War II with the lifting of the manufacturing freeze, war-related technological advances, the drop in television prices caused by mass production, increased leisure time, and additional disposable income. While only 0.5% of U.S. households had a television in 1946, 55.7% had one in 1954, and 90% by 1962. In Britain, there were 15,000 television households in 1947, 1.4 million in 1952, and 15.1 million by 1968. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, color television had come into wide use. In Britain, BBC1, BBC2 and ITV were regularly broadcasting in color by 1969.\n\nBy the late 2000s, CRT display technology was largely supplanted worldwide by flat-panel displays such as LCD. Flat-panel television, especially LCD, has become the dominant form of television since the early 2010s.\n\nThe first national live television broadcast in the U.S. took place on September 4, 1951 when President Harry Truman's speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco was transmitted over AT&T's transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets.\n\nThe first live coast-to-coast commercial television broadcast in the U.S. took place on November 18, 1951 during the premiere of CBS's \"See It Now\", which showed a split-screen view of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1958, the CBC completed the longest television network in the world, from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nReportedly, the first continuous live broadcast of a \"breaking\" news story in the world was conducted by the CBC during the Springhill mining disaster, which began on October 23 of that year.\n\nThe development of cable television and satellite television in the 1970s allowed for more channels and encouraged businessmen to target programming toward specific audiences. It also enabled the rise of subscription television channels, such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime in the U.S., and Sky Television in the U.K.\n\nImportant people in the development of TV technology in the 19th or 20th centuries.\n\n\nLinks related to the development or history of television\n"}

{"id": "18886262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18886262", "title": "Kharbaga", "text": "Kharbaga\n\nKharbaga is a two-player abstract strategy game from Africa. In a way, it is a miniature version of Zamma; however, there are more diagonal lines per square on the board as compared to Zamma. The game is considered part of the Zamma family. The game is also similar to Alquerque and draughts. The board is essentially an Alquerque board with twice the number of diagonal lines or segments allowing for greater freedom of movement. The initial setup is also similar to Alquerque, where every space on the board is filled with each player's pieces except for the middle point of the board. Moreover, each player's pieces are also set up on each player's half of the board. The game specifically resembles draughts in that pieces must move in the forward directions until they are crowned \"Mullah\" (or \"Sultan\") which is the equivalent of the King in draughts. The Mullah can move in any direction.\n\nIt is unknown how old the game is; however, the idea that pieces must move forward until they are crowned Mullah is a feature thought to have been developed and borrowed from draughts which came into being only in the 17th century. This is, however, open to debate.\n\nTwo similar games are played by the Hopi native American Indians of Arizona, US, which may suggest a historical connection with Kharbaga, and Alquerque in general. One of the Hopi games is called tukvnanawopi. The board pattern, the number of pieces, and the initial setup are the same as in Kharbaga's. The only differences, and they are significant, is that in tukvnanawopi pieces can move in any direction at any time during the game (there is no need for promotion to Mullah or King as in Kharbaga), and also when a row of squares on one end of the board becomes empty during the game, pieces can no longer be played in that row of squares. As the game progresses, more rows of squares become empty and unplayable, and the playing board continues to shrink. The other Hopi game which is also played throughout Mexico is called tuknanavuhpi. In this case, when a row of points on one end of the board becomes empty, it is no longer playable, and again the playing board shrinks as the game progresses.\n\nLastly, another native American Indian tribe called the Keres of New Mexico, US plays a game most similar to Kharbaga. The only difference is that pieces can move in any direction at any time during the game and each player has 22 pieces. It is uncertain how the game can be played this way since both players would yield 44 pieces total and there are only 41 intersection points that make up the board. The game is called Aiyawatstani or \"chuck away grains\".\n\nThe player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner.\n\nThe board is a 5 x 5 square grid, or a 4 x 4 square board with pieces played on the intersections with left and right diagonal lines running through each square of the board. Each player has 20 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other player plays the white pieces.\n\n\n"}

The narration was written by Buñuel, Rafael Sanchez Ventura, and Pierre Unik, with cinematography by Eli Lotar. \n\n\nThe film focuses on the Las Hurdes region of Spain, the mountainous area around the town of La Alberca, and the intense poverty of its occupants, who were so backwards and isolated that bread was unknown. A main source of income for them was taking in orphan children, for whom they received a government subsidy. Buñuel, who made the film after reading the ethnographic study \"Las Jurdes: étude de géographie humaine\" (1927) by Maurice Legendre, took a Surrealist approach to the notion of the anthropological expedition. The result was a travelogue in which the narrator’s extreme (indeed, exaggerated) descriptions of human misery of Las Hurdes contrasts with his flat and uninterested manner.\n\nBuñuel claimed:\n\"I was able to film Las Hurdes thanks to Ramon Acin, an anarchist from Huesca...who one day at a cafe in Zaragoza told me, 'Luis, if I ever won the lottery, I would put up the money for you to make a film.' He won a hundred thousand pesetas...and gave me twenty thousand to make the film. With four thousand I bought a Fiat; Pierre Unik came, under contract from \"Vogue\" to write an article; and Eli Lotar arrived with a camera loaned by Marc Allégret.\" \n\nThe movie is a documentary, parodying the exaggerated documentaries of travelers across the Sahara being filmed at the same time. One of Buñuel's points is that there are plenty of terrible subjects for a documentary right in Spain.\nThe film was originally silent, though Buñuel himself narrated when it was first shown. A French narration by actor Abel Jacquin was added in Paris in 1935. Buñuel used extracts of Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 4 for the music. \n\nBuñuel slaughtered at least two animals to make \"Las Hurdes\". One Hurdano claimed that he arranged for an ailing donkey to be covered with honey so he could film it being stung to death by bees. Similarly, his crew shot a mountain goat that subsequently fell from a cliff for another sequence.\n\nThe film provoked such an uproar in Spain - Ruoff calls it a \"revolutionary film\" - that it was banned from 1933 to 1936. \n\n"}

Magic Landing was one of two amusement parks operating in El Paso during the 1980s, the other being Western Playland.\n\nMagic Landing opened to the public on July 4, 1984. It included the Old Galveston Railway, a narrow-gauge railroad within the park, among other attractions.\n\nDuring Magic Landing's brief run, rumors of various incidents were circulated, but one confirmed incident caused the park's attendance numbers to fall over the next three years, and may have led to its closure. In the summer of 1985, Frank Guzman Jr, an 18-year-old male employee, was killed at the park. He was asked by a patron to retrieve his baseball hat for him from off the roller coaster track. The teenager climbed up the track and rested his arm on the active part of the track. Within a few minutes, the roller coaster went down the track and cut his arm off. After an hour on the track, the young man was rushed to William Beaumont Army Medical Center and died three hours later.\n\nIn 1988, Magic Landing closed to the public mid-season due to low attendance and problems obtaining the $1,000,000 insurance policy required by the state. (The high insurance rate stemmed from the above-mentioned roller coaster death.) Since its closing, Magic Landing's buildings stood out in the El Paso desert, many of them falling apart, for over 20 years. (The rides, though, only remained until the early to mid-1990s.) In 2009, by the county's request, the remaining buildings and rubble on the property were demolished due to multiple incidents of vandalism and arson over the previous few years. CFI Trucking now uses the land as a lot for their trailers. The frame for the sign and base for ticket booths are among the only remnants of the park. Western Playland, El Paso's only other amusement park, has since been relocated to Sunland Park, New Mexico. In 2013 the park mysteriously burned down.\n\n"}

The NDA is the sister company of the National Cheer Association (NCA), which was founded by Lawrence Herkimer in 1948. In 1976, the NCA created the NCA Superstar to make a distinction between the dance and cheerleading aspects of the company. Eventually in 1999, the NCA Superstar changed its name to the National Dance Alliance.\n\nThe National Dance Alliance (NDA) is the sister company of the National Cheer Association (NCA) founded by Lawrence Herkimer in 1948. The NDA is an organization that provides high quality training and teaching to middle school, high school, and college dance teams around the country. NDA hosts many camps, clinics, competitions, and various performance events throughout the year for dancers to attend. Each year, the NCA/NDA hosts over 75,000 cheerleaders and dancers at their summer camps and over 1,500 teams from 45 states at their National Championships.\n\nThe National Dance Alliance's core goals are to inspire young dancers and to teach them about the importance of teamwork. The NDA emphasizes that the primary purpose of a dance team is to raise spirit for the school’s athletic teams as well as the overall community. The NDA instills strong leadership skills in all of its dancers and teaches dance teams how to be role models at the schools they attend.\n\nLawrence Herkimer, a famous innovator in the world of cheerleading, founded the NCA in 1948. The NCA was the first cheerleading company to hold camps and clinics that invited cheerleaders and dancers from around the country to learn new tricks and improve their technique under the supervision of trained and qualified instructors. The NCA had always incorporated dance into its programs, by allowing dance, pom-pom, or drill teams to learn alongside the cheerleaders. In 1976, the company made a distinction between cheerleading and dance by creating the NCA Superstar as the dance section of the company. The NCA Superstar eventually changed its name to the National Dance Alliance in 1999. The National Dance Alliance brand was established and is now a “full service provider in the dance spirit industry”.\nThe NCA and NDA are both a part of the Varsity Spirit Corporation, an organization that hosts competitions, offers camps and clinics to train dancers and cheerleaders, and sells cheer and dance apparel.\n\nThe National Dance Association extends invitations to high school and college dance teams from all over the country to attend its summer or fall camps. Many of these camps are held at university campuses, hotels, and convention centers. Teams that attend NDA’s camps get evaluated and receive personalized feedback from members of the NDA staff. These camps are intended to prepare teams for their upcoming season. NDA offers three different types of camps that dance teams can choose from including overnight camps, day camps, and home camps.\n\nThe overnight camp is either a three- or four-day session that is available to teams at all different technical levels. All NDA overnight camps offer classes that benefit all levels of training, including beginner, intermediate, advanced, and elite. The overnight camp gives participants the opportunity to audition to become an All-American Dancer. Participants selected to be All-American Dancers are given the opportunity to attend many special event performances hosted by the NCA and NDA all over the country.\n\nThe NDA day camps are two-, three-, or four-day sessions for teams that are not able to attend any of the overnight camps and instead would like to attend a camp where they do not spend the night. The day camps consist of the same curriculum as the NDA overnight camps; however, classes are held from 9am-5pm after which, participants are required to go home. Classes are offered in all styles of dance for all levels. Dancers are also eligible to audition to become an All-American Dancer at the NDA day camps.\n\nThe home camps are available to teams that would prefer to work privately with a trained NDA instructor in the privacy of their own school. This option allows teams to have a personalized teaching atmosphere that focuses on the specific needs of the team. Home camps give coaches the opportunity to create their own camp schedule that best fits their team. Coaches can choose from a wide variety of technique classes, choreography classes in many different styles, and team-building exercises for their team to participate in. Dancers can also be selected to audition to be an All-American Team Member.\n\nThe National Dance Alliance gives dance teams the opportunity to compete against one another at the NDA Classic Championships or Nationals. The invitation to compete at these competitions is extended to school and college dance teams, as well as All-Star dance teams. The competitions are split up based on whether the dance team is at the collegiate, school, or all-star level. Each year, the NCA/NDA administers about 40 local, regional and national competitions nationwide.\n\nTo compete at the National competitions, the NDA College Rule Book for College Teams states that teams must have qualified at the NDA Summer or Fall Camps, Regional or Classic competition, or by video submission. At the collegiate level, teams can be offered bids to the National Competition based on the team’s participation, conduct, and achievements at camp.\n\nThe NDA offers high school and middle school dance teams the opportunity to compete in their classical or regional championships. These competitions allow for teams to compete against other dance teams in their region. Compared to the national championships, the classical and regional competitions are less expensive and allow you to stay close to home. Competing in either of these types of competition can also qualify teams to compete in the NDA National Championship.\n\nThe NDA gives dancers the chance to perform in the Walt Disney World Christmas Parade. This event is televised and aired on Christmas Day on ABC network. The trip is a four-day and three-night event that is held at Disney’s Colorado Springs Resort in Florida. Dancers who participate in this event also get the privilege of visiting many of Disney World’s theme parks. Dancers eligible to attend this trip must attend a NCA or NDA camp or be an All-American Team Member or an All-American Nominee of a Varsity, Junior Varsity, Freshman or Junior High team. Also, all teams who won trophies or plaques in competitions, whether they are individuals or an entire team, may attend.\n\nThis event is open to all freshman, juniors, and seniors in high school who were selected to be an All-American Team Member. Dancers eligible to attend are able to perform in London’s New Year’s Day Parade.\n\nNDA gives dancers the opportunity to perform in a variety of parades around the country that occur on the morning of Thanksgiving. All-American Team Members can perform in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, the Houston Thanksgiving Day Parade, or the Philadelphia Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n"}

The duo play themselves in a satirical account of what the audience would perhaps imagine the pair doing in their daily lives. Most of the action involves Penn and Teller playing practical jokes on each other along with Penn's girlfriend, Carlotta (Caitlin Clarke). The final joke, as the title of the film implies, has serious consequences for all three. It was the last theatrical film to be directed by Arthur Penn, and received mostly negative reviews from critics.\n\nPenn & Teller appear on a television show where Penn jokingly comments that he wishes someone were trying to kill him. Soon after, the magicians are off to a scheduled show in Atlantic City. At the airport, a religious zealot confronts Penn about his comments from the television show the night before. Teller and Carlotta play a prank on Penn while going through security and Penn gets back at Teller by planting a toy gun on him while at the airport.\n\nAfter exposing fraudulent psychic surgery to Carlotta's wealthy Uncle Ernesto, Penn and Teller are kidnapped by angry Filipinos wishing revenge for damaging their reputation. Immediately before being brutally tortured, the situation is revealed to Penn as a birthday prank played by Teller, Carlotta and Uncle Ernesto.\n\nSoon after, while leaving the theatre from their nightly performance, someone opens fire on Penn, shooting him in the arm. Teller is accused of hiring an assassin as a joke, but as time goes on it becomes clear that Teller is not part of the joke. Teller purchases a gun for self-defense and \"femme fatale\" Officer MacNamara vows to keep Penn safe from snipers.\n\nOfficer MacNamara announces that a nameless villain, a supposed vehement Penn & Teller fan who dresses and acts like Penn, has been arrested. Penn and Teller get to tour his bizarre apartment turned Penn & Teller shrine. Teller innocuously disposes of his gun in a trashcan of the apartment. Shortly after MacNamara departs, Penn is stabbed in the stomach by an assailant on the street. Penn rushes off to hospital where, once Teller is out of sight, he appears perfectly fine. Teller proceeds to pursue the would-be assassin in a peculiar chase scene back to the apartment.\n\nThe madman, dressed as Penn, forces Teller to enact a Penn & Teller routine with him, hanging in gravity boots in front of a camera. He then uses duct tape to secure the hapless Teller to the gravity boot rig. Officer MacNamara returns and the assassin leaves to finish off Penn. MacNamara confesses to Teller her contempt of Penn & Teller. The confused Teller is able to grab the gun from the wastebasket and threatens MacNamara with it. He hears a voice behind him and as the individual grabs him, he shoots the individual only to realize it's Penn, who appears to fall over dead.\n\nMacNamara laughs, thinking that it's a new joke. She then reveals herself as Carlotta. The implications of what has just happened suddenly catch up with them: The whole event had been a joke on Teller who turned everything around on the players. Teller, breaking silence for the first time, immediately thinks they switched the gun for a replica, but then realizes the gun he was holding is real and he just killed his partner. Teller turns the gun on himself.\n\nCarlotta, stricken with grief, throws herself out the window. Upon returning to his apartment and finding everyone dead, the \"hired assassin\", realizing he'll certainly be implicated in the deaths, shoots himself. Others who come into the apartment and find the carnage shoot themselves. Gunshots are heard in the distance, while the Bee Gees song \"I Started a Joke\" plays in the background. In a voice over, Penn explains this is the definitive end of it all.\n\n\n"}

PWR was founded in December 2013.\n\nProfessional wrestling in the Philippines started in 1989 through the short-lived show called \"Pinoy Wrestling\". It aired on national television via PTV-4, with character actor Johnny Revilla as host and ringside reporter comedian Jimmy Fabregas.\n\nIts roster consisted of locally trained wrestlers such as Joe Pogi, King Cobra, Macho Franco, Caloy Bakal, and Max Buwaya. There were also tag teams such as The Smoky Mountain Brothers, The Bakal Boys, and Dr. Q’s henchmen The Brusko Brothers, Kamikaze Kid and Roboto. Women wrestlers like Aerobica and Pinay Wonder and midgets such as The Mikrobyos and The Tureritos were also featured. Other wrestlers include Juan Duwag, Waway The Wild Man, Turko Turero, Pinoy Ranger, Sultan Bato, Iggy Igorot, Lawin and Zorro. The show was discontinued in the early part of 1990.\n\nIn 2012, the idea of forming PWR was born in a Facebook group. Wrestling fans from different parts of the country linked up and were added to the group to establish a wrestling company, discuss fantasy bookings, and conceptualize characters and gimmicks. This came about despite pro wrestling not being as popular in the Philippines since the end of the WWE Attitude Era in the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as the exposure of kayfabe. The upstart promotion got an assist from veteran American pro wrestler Joe E. Legend, who helped them in the preparations.\n\nSometime between late 2013 and early 2014, the group was contacted by a Japanese promoter Ankei Tamashiro doing a show in the Philippines for WNC-Reina, where two of the main attractions were former WWE and ECW superstar Tajiri and half-Filipina triple crown champion Shuri Kondo. The Japanese promoter's representative in Manila found PWR's Facebook page and asked the group to assist them in setting up and promoting the show in the country. These events further encouraged the group to pursue the idea of setting up the first-ever wrestling promotion in the country.\n\nThe pioneer batch of aspiring professional wrestlers were officially trained by an American pro wrestler who goes by the name of Josh Bauserman, whom they met in Manila during the early stages of planning. The founders credit Bauserman for teaching them everything about pro wrestling, from in-ring maneuvers to backstage activities.\n\nPWR has recently expanded its reach within the international community as international wrestlers such as Billy Suede and Koto Hiro have joined their roster. In 2017, WWE officials were also in attendance during PWR Live: Bagong Yugto.\n\nThe promotion held its inaugural event called Renaissance on September 27, 2014, at the Makati Cinema Square Arena, Makati City.\n\nPWR then held subsequent events to complete its calendar: Terminus, Vendetta, and Wrevolution X, which is considered to be PWR's WrestleMania equivalent.\n\nOn August 15, 2015, PWR held an event called PWR Live, still at the Makati Cinema Square Arena. Multiple events named PWR Live have been staged since.\n\nTo date, 2 PWR shows have been aired on television (on tape delay) via TV5: \"Terminus\" (2014) and \"PWR Live\" (August 2015)\n\nAfter its second Renaissance event in September, PWR held a second PWR Live event in November, but in a new venue, at the iAcademy Auditorium in Makati City. Since then, all PWR events have been hosted there.\n\nCelebrity guests who have been attendance in previous events include Quark Henares, Stanley Chi, Red Ollero, Darius Semaña, radio DJs Poch and Tino, Mihk Vergara, King Palisoc, Miko Livelo, Brian Wilson of Juan Direction, Ramon Bautista, and Ryan Rems Sarita.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, PWR held a house show at the LBD Sports Arena in Candelaria, Quezon, its first outside Metro Manila.\n\n\nThe promotion has posted various campaigns on most social media platforms for pro-wrestling training on both males and females ages 18 and above for their scheduled bootcamp.\n\n"}

However, it remains widespread. Law enforcement is poor.\n\nIn 2013 the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (SWEAT) estimated that there were between 121,000 and 167,000 prostitutes in South Africa.\n\nHIV, child prostitution (including sex tourism) and human trafficking are problems in the country.\n\nThe Immorality Act, 1927 prohibited extramarital sex between \"Europeans\" and \"natives\". This was redefined by the Immorality Amendment Act, 1950 as illicit carnal intercourse between \"Europeans\" and \"non-Europeans\",\n\nThe Immorality Act, 1957, later renamed the Sexual Offences Act, 1957, repealed the 1927 Act (as amended) and introduced new offences for brothel keeping, pimping and procuring. Interracial sex was now criminalised as unlawful carnal intercourse between \"white\" and \"coloured\" people.\n\nThe Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 criminalised \"committing an immoral or indecent act with such other person\" and also soliciting for the same.\n\nMunicipal by-laws also contained provisions about prostitution.\n\nAs part of the repeal of many petty apartheid laws under the government of P. W. Botha, the Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act 1985 repealed the interracial restrictions of the Immorality Acts.\n\nThe Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 renamed the Immorality Act, 1957 to the Sexual Offences Act, 1957 and criminalised the act of prostitution. It also made the provisions of the 1957 Act gender neutral.\n\nIn 2002, an appeal by brothel keepers and prostitutes in the country's Constitutional Court, submitting that the laws on prostitution were in breach of the constitution, was dismissed.\n\nThe most recent legislative change was the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, section 11 which added Section 20(1)(aA) of the SOA, which states that any person who has unlawful carnal intercourse or commits an act of indecency with any other person for reward, is guilty of an offence, effectively criminalising the client as well as the prostitute.\n\nIn 2017 a report by the South African Law Reform Commission, recommended that the current law be retained (proffered option), or that prostitution should be decriminalised but third party involvement remain illegal.\n\nDecriminalisation has been under active discussion since 2009. Currently the South African Law Reform Commission has four proposals that were submitted for public discussion ranging from criminalisation to decriminalisation.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2010 Football World Cup, there were calls to decriminalise and regulate prostitution when an estimated 40,000 prostitutes were expected to travel to South Africa for the tournament.\n\nIn March 2012, the ANC Women's League came out in favor of decriminalisation, and stated that they will campaign for this to become an ANC policy. It is argued that decriminalisation \"would challenge the stigma that surrounds sex workers. It would help secure their human rights and dignity, and make for safer work and living conditions for them.\" Decriminalising prostitution would limit the power the police have on sex workers and it would stop the police or law enforcers from taking advantage of sex workers. Police enforcement is rigorous and police taking and accepting bribes by the police and their clients is common place.\n\nIn April 2013, the Commission for Gender Equality also stated its support for decriminalization. They argued that current laws violate sections of the constitution, and that sex workers would be better protected if the law is changed.\n\nSex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (SWEAT), is a group based in South Africa that has been working to decriminalize sex work and eventually legalize it. They also provide health services for sex workers since they can't access them elsewhere. They have launched different programs to bring awareness to problems facing sex workers such as Sex Work Empowerment and Enabling Environment (SWEEP), #SayHerName, advocacy and law reform, and Sisonke movement.\n\nSex workers are at a disadvantage when it comes to the police, since they are facing extreme violence and abuse from them, they have no one to turn to in times of trouble. In an interview with one sex worker in Cape Town, she said: \"The colored police officer grabbed me, and my clothes came off. Then they pepper sprayed me in my mouth and beat me\". Many sex workers face random and unjustified violence from the police and can't report that violence to anyone. As many as 7 out of 10 sex workers have endured police brutality in some form, whether it's beating or rape.\n\nThere were fears of increased prostitution in connection with the 2010 Football World Cup, some sources estimating that an extra 40,000 sex workers would enter South Africa for the competition. As a result, there were calls for prostitution to be legalised and regulated to help control AIDS and STDs and for the protection of the sex workers. However this generated considerable opposition and no changes were made to the laws.\n\nDespite the fears, there was little evidence of increased prostitution.\n\nSouth Africa has one of the world's largest HIV epidemics. A study by the SA National Aids Council (Sanac) estimated that there was a 60% infection rate, although this varies from area to area, for example, Johannesburg 72%, Durban 54% and Cape Town 40%.\n\nThe reluctance to use condoms has contributed significantly to the epidemic.

{"id": "20365402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20365402", "title": "Ral Partha Enterprises", "text": "Ral Partha Enterprises\n\nRal Partha Enterprises, Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio produces miniature figures in 25 mm, 30 mm, 15 mm, and 54 mm scale. The company was founded in 1975 and is now a division of Iron Wind Metals, LLC, a company created in 2001 around Ral Partha's manufacturing capacities. The company's products are made by spin-casting metal alloys which depict soldiers, adventurers and creatures that have been inspired by history and fiction. Their miniatures are sold at gaming conventions, in hobby shops, and by internet and mail order for use in role playing games, wargaming, dioramas, competitive painting, and collecting. \n\nThe company began as a basement enterprise undertaken by a group of wargamers around the talents of Tom Meier, a 16-year-old sculptor. The company grew with the increasing popularity of board and role-playing games. By 1982 Ral Partha products were sold worldwide. Ral Partha is best known for its historical figures, \"Fantasy Collector's\" series, and miniatures produced for TSR, Inc.'s \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" and FASA's \"BattleTech\" games. Tom Meier became a freelance sculptor in 1988, and retains copyrights to much of his work for Ral Partha. He works on commission and operates Thunderbolt Mountain Miniatures, a boutique company for pet projects involving dioramas, 54 mm figurines, and a new series of elves and goblins. During its 40-year history Ral Partha has employed more than two dozen sculptors, of whom the most prolific were Dennis Mize, Julie Guthrie, Sandra Garrity, Robert N. Charrette, and Dave Summers. \n\nThe owners of the original Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. sold the company to FASA in 1998, and was one of the assets acquired by WizKids in 2000. The following year Ral Partha's production assets were recast as Iron Wind Metals, LLC of Cincinnati, a company which continues to produce many of the Ral Partha lines of miniatures. In 2015 and the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ral Partha, Iron Wind Metals reacquired the long unused trademarks and relaunched Ral Partha as a division of the company focused on producing archived miniature lines under the banner of the \"Chaos Wars\" gaming world.\n\nIn 1980 Ral Partha licensed select designs to Rawcliffe Pewter a long-time producer of cast metal art. The pewter versions of Ral Partha sculpts were typically bare-metal with a satin finish and decorated with glass jewels. In time, a division of the company called \"Partha Pewter\" was established to produce directly for the giftware market.\n\nRal Partha established a licensing agreement with RAFM, a miniatures manufacturer in Paris, Ontario, Canada in 1980. The two companies have had a long-term working relationship which lasted well into the 1990s.\n\nIn 1979 Citadel Miniatures was formed by Games Workshop as a miniatures production shop to produce their own figures and to distribute Ral Partha figures in Britain. Citadel Miniatures attempted to establish a U.S. division in 1982 with Ral Partha as the local manufacturer. The partnership was short lived and in 1984 Games Workshop established their own U.S. subsidiary and became a direct competitor. The Citadel Miniatures U.S. products were brought under the Ral Partha logo and marketed as \"Ral Partha Imports.\" In 1985 the import lines included the \"FTx-xx Fantasy Tribes\", \"FAx-xx Fantasy Adventurer\", \"FF/31-xxx Fiend Factory\", \"FS/32-xx Fantasy Special\", the popular \"WF-xx Weird Fantasy\" series with whimsical themes, \"FMM-xx Fantasy Mysterious Miniatures\", and \"LB-xx Tabletop's Laser Burn\" line of space marines. Historical lines included Romans \"AR-xx\", Dark Ages \"DA-xx\", Medievals \"M-xxx\" and Samurai \"SAM-xx\". At least two figures (FTT 3 Troll hurling rock and FTT 4 Troll in chainmail with scimitar) were sculpted by Tom Meier while visiting England in 1981.\n\nIn 1986 Minifigs gained the rights to manufacture and distribute Ral Partha's fantasy range in Britain. The following year Ral Partha dropped Citadel Miniatures' historical lines and began to distribute Denizen Miniatures' dwarves (\"33-xxx\"), orcs (\"34-xxx\"), \"36-xxx Legion of the Damned\" skeletons, and \"39-xxx Fantastic Adventurers\".\n\nBy 1989, Jeux Descartes of Paris gained the rights to distribute Ral Partha figures in continental Europe. Some early Ral Partha advertisements erroneously give the name as \"Jeaux Descartes.\" The relationship was on-going in 1997, but was probably severed when FASA purchased Ral Partha the following year.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Ral Partha products were distributed in Australia by \"Military Simulations\" of Moorabbin, Victoria and then Bentleigh, Victoria.\n\nOnly a product code marked Ral Partha's early packaging and customers required a contemporary catalog in order to identify the miniature. In late 1979 the company switched from product codes that used descriptive letter and number codes to a numeric system. For example, in the series \"Personalities and Things that Go Bump in the Night\", \"ES-001 Evil Wizard, casting spell\" became 01-001, and the first figure of the 15th century Renaissance series \"1501 Command Set\" became 54-001. The change was not universal. Ral Partha used letter codes for Citadel Miniatures and Denizen Miniatures in their line of \"Ral Partha Imports\" until 1992. Ral Partha's international partners used their own systems. RAFM of Canada used the descriptive product codes as late as 1984. Jeux Descartes initially used Ral Partha's numeric codes on packaging of their own design, but new lines were introduced selectively and given codes sequential to their own series. As a result, product codes often differ depending on whether the miniatures were produced in the United States, Canada, or Europe.\n\nThroughout the company's history, figures were modified to improve reproducibility, unpopular designs were re-sculpted, and existing product codes were used for new designs. A common cause of modification was a level of detail or animation which challenged the casting technology. An industry-wide reorientation of scale from 25 mm to 30 mm in the late 1990s, and interest in removing artist's royalties from lines, also prompted new sculpts of existing lines.\n\nFew of Ral Partha's miniatures were marked with product codes and the company's advertisements and catalogs remain a critical resource for collectors. Advertisements by Ral Partha and its British and Canadian partners appear in most editions of TSR, Inc.'s \"Dragon\" and Games Workshop's \"White Dwarf\" magazines. Product catalogs were published annually from 1978 to 1997, and in 2000. The 1998 and 1999 catalogs were combined into a single issue. Ral Partha also released Christmas catalogs in 1982 and 1983, an \"Imports\" catalog in 1984, historical miniatures catalogs in 1985 and 1996, a 2000 \"Direct Mail Catalog\", and sporadically released updated order forms which listed all the figures in production. In the late 1996 Ral Partha augmented their catalogs with a webpage which highlighted popular products and new releases. After the formation of Iron Wind Metals in 2001, an online catalog and electronic order forms entirely replaced printed catalogs.\n\nRal Partha Enterprises was formed in 1975 when Glenn E. Kidd, Tom Meier and Rich Smethurst set out to produce Meier's sculptures. Meier pioneered the sculpture of miniatures in a two-part epoxy putty designed for automotive repair. The epoxy held detail better than traditional media and rest of the miniature industry adopted its use. When mixed together, the blue and yellow components of the putty formed a green putty which gave rise to the term \"Greens\" for the original artist's work. Finding themselves still short of funds, the three enlisted Marc Rubin, Chuck Crain, and Jack Hesselbrock as partners. The six investors pooled USD $3,000 to purchase the equipment necessary to produce Meier's sculptures.\n\nThe company had its origins in the established hobby of historical wargaming, but the company's rapid growth was fostered by the popularity of role-playing games. The company was named \"Ral-Partha\" after a particularly successful wizard character created by Tom's young friend John Winkler. The character was a notoriously hard bargainer whose shrewdness was exemplified by the catch phrase \"What's it worth to you?\" It was hoped that the fledgling company would have similar good fortune. Like their popular line of \"3-stage characters,\" Ral Partha has had a trio of aspects. The first was Winkler's gaming character, depicted as \"ES-001 Evil Wizard, casting spell.\" \"Ral\" Winkler himself became one of the company's chief casters. Lastly, \"Ral\" was the company's totemic progenitor credited with collaborative projects and depicted as \"10–412 Lord of the Balrogs\".\n\nProducts were originally cast in the basement of 3642 Hyde Park Avenue, in the Fairfax neighborhood of Cincinnati, the home of the company's first president, Glenn E. Kidd. In the spring of 1978, the company established a factory at 3726 Lonsdale Street in the Norwood section of Cincinnati. At the time of the move, the address was erroneously rendered as 2732 and 2736 Lonsdale, but there is no 2700 block of that street. Small stickers were applied to the 1978 product catalog to correct the address. Those stickers have typically fallen off in the intervening years. By November 1980 Ral Partha moved to a larger industrial space at 5938 Carthage Court, where it, and the Iron Wind Metals production facilities remained until 2014. Iron Wind Metals has its offices and production facilities at 10437 Chester Rd in Woodlawn, Ohio.\n\nRal Partha's formative years were the late 1970s, when the company was a part-time basement enterprise producing the art of a teenage sculptor for a nascent gaming market. In 1979, the company became a full-time endeavor with industrial space and two professional sculptors designing products for multiple themes made popular by the rapidly expanding gaming market. The number of sculptors and catalog of miniatures grew rapidly. In the mid-1980s, the preponderance of work moved from Ral Partha's sculptors' designs to manufacturing under license for nationally marketed games. In the short run, the move was economically beneficial. However, the lack of product diversity left the company vulnerable to the marketing decisions of clients for whom miniatures were a minor interest. Between 2001 and 2014, Ral Partha was an unused trademark caught up in the mergers and intellectual property negotiations between large game producers. Since 2001 the focus of Iron Wind Metals has been on existing product lines, \"Battletech\" licensed figures, and manufacturing for partner companies who carryout their own designs, marketing and distribution. In 2014 the production and productive capacities were reunited under Ral Partha Enterprises, a division of Iron Wind Metals.\n\nThe young company received early encouragement from the sale of its entire stock at Gen Con 1976, a convention of gaming enthusiasts. Ral Partha's lines and customer base grew quickly and they regularly won multiple categories of the Origins Award. Ral Partha's figures were popular with historical wargamers, but fans of fantasy themed role-playing games like TSR Inc.'s \"Dungeons & Dragons\" accounted for the majority of their sales. Meier's sculpts tended to carry greater detail than many of his contemporaries, but some early products presented challenges to the casting process.\n\nOne of Tom Meier's earliest lines was the \"Fantasy Line\", which included about two dozen figures in late 1976. Meier's \"ES18 Adventuress\" is credited as being the first female character for role-playing games. The fantasy line was renamed \"ES/01-xxx Personalities and Things that Go Bump in the Night\" in 1978, and Meier augmented the line throughout the 1980s.\n\nAs early as 1976, Meier had begun a series of soldiers from Classical antiquity which were collected together as \"AN/35-xxx The Hoplites\". By 1978 the line was essentially complete and included Greeks, Carthaginians, Persians, Gauls, Early Republic Romans and Macedonians. Another series begun by Meier in 1976 was a line of 11th-century knights and footmen called \"11/42-xxx 1200 A.D.\". The series included Vikings, English, French, Spanish, Moorish, Mongol, and Sung Chinese soldiers.\n\nRal Partha put \"E-xxx Wizards, Warriors and Warlocks\" into production in 1976, 1977, and 1979. The line included some of Meier's earliest work and much of it was executed in the style of Heritage Models, for whom he had briefly worked. The \"E-xxx\" series was retired in 1980, but portions of it were re-released in 1995 as part of the \"19-xxx Ral Partha Remembered\" line commemorating the company's 20th anniversary.\n\nIn 1978 Ral Partha acquired The Old Guard's \"Legions of the Petal Throne\" line of figures for TSR Inc.'s \"Empire of the Petal Throne,\" a role-playing game based on M. A. R. Barker's world of Tékumel. Ral Partha retained the services of William Murray, the line's sculptor. Tom Meier and Brian Apple made contributions to the series (\"T, Y, P, M, NH-xxx\") in 1979, but it was discontinued later that year.\n\nAs early as 1978, Ral Partha produced three series of 15 mm historical miniatures sculpted by George Freeman of Dayton, Ohio. They included Napoleonic-era figures \"N-xxx Days of the Empire\", \"AW-xxx American Civil War\", and \"AK-xxx Desert Rats\", modeling the North African Campaign of World War II. Ann Gallup also contributed an \"AC-xxx\" series to the American Civil War line. In 1979 Ral Partha added Freeman's 25 mm \"W-xxx Waterloo Collector's Series\", but all of Freeman and Gallup's figures were discontinued in 1980. George Freeman's 15mm Napoleonics figures are available from Monday Knight Productions (see external links below).\n\nRal Partha's first venture into science fiction was Meier's 1978 line of space marines and space aliens \"GG-xxx Galactic Grenadiers: Strike Force Alpha\". Their release was in tandem with Gamescience's \"Strike Team Alpha\", a set designed by Michael Scott Kurtick for Meier's Galactic Grenadiers. Other early lines included collectible 54 mm figures called \"S/97-xxx Partha Personalities' and lines of 25 mm dungeon accessories (\"D/97-xxx\") and weapons (\"D/97-5xx\").\n\nIn the summer of 1978, Meier began reworking the themes of the \"E-xxx\" series to create the \"CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors\" line of elves. Meier's lines were successful and he began sculpting full-time in 1979. The addition of dwarves in 1979 and goblins in 1980 almost entirely replaced the \"E-xxx\" series. Meier added halfings in 1982 and began a series of fantasy vehicles. The first was \"02–030 Dwarf Steam Cannon\", released in 1983. Meier's contribution to the series was completed when \"02-078 The Warmachine\" and \"02-020 The Elf Chariot\" were put into production in 1984.\n\nRal Partha hired Dennis Mize in 1979. With two full-time sculptors, Ral Partha's product lines increased rapidly. Mize's first project was \"H-xxx Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age\" to accompany a Fantasy Games Unlimited game of the same name, based on the world of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. The Hyborean line was dropped in 1980, and Mize introduced \"53-7xx The Samurai\" and a line of 15mm fantasy soldiers called \"05-xxx Armies of Myth and Legend\". His popular \"CN/13-xxx Children of the Night\" was begun by 1982 and expanded over the course of the next two years. In 1982 Mize and Meier created figures for small thematic box sets called \"98-xxx The Adventurers\". Mize also added to and revised Meier's \"The Hoplites\" and \"1200 A.D.\" lines in 1984.\n\nIn 1979, Meier introduced \"15/54-xxx Condotitieri\", a line of Renaissance-era figures. The first offerings were Imperialists, to which he added Swiss and Turks in 1980. Meier expanded the historical ranges with the 1983 addition of \"88-xxx The Colonials\". Sculpts for the Anglo-Zulu War were augmented in 1984 with figures for the Northwest Frontier and the Sudan Campaign in 1985.\n\nRal Partha entered the game market in 1980 with the release of \"99–001 Witch's Caldron\", \"99-002 Caverns Deep\", \"99-003 Final Frontier\", and \"99-004 Galactic Grenadiers\", skirmish games designed by Glenn E. Kidd and Marc Rubin. \"Galactic Grenadiers\" included miniatures from the \"GG-xxx\" series. 15 mm figures from \"Final Frontiers\" were released in 1982 as \"08-xxx Star Warriors\". By 1982, the presidency of the company passed from Glenn E. Kidd to Jack Hesselbrock. The lines of 15 mm fantasy figures were taken out of production and the figures from the \"Caverns Deep\" and \"Witch's Cauldron\" games were incorporated into \"98-xxx The Adventurers\" in 1983. Ral Partha returned to the board game market in 1985 when they joined with Leggett Games Inc. to publish \"Fortress\", a skirmish-based board game which incorporated lead Ral Partha miniatures. That same year the company launched \"77-xxx Partha Paints\" and \"Dragonscale\" metallic cremes which were packaged with dragon figures.\n\nIn the spring of 1983 Ral Partha began publishing a four-page newsletter entitled \"The Partha Pipeline\" which was a house fanzine with articles generated by staff and friends. A typical issue included \"Letters to Ral\" where the company's semi-mythical progenitor would answer reader's questions, scenarios for battles with Ral Partha figures, and new releases by Ral Partha and those which they distributed for RAFM. The Partha Pipeline continued for three more years until ending its first series in 1986. A second series using the same name would be revived in 1999.\n\nJulie Guthrie began freelance sculpting for Ral Partha in 1983. Her first line was the \"02-9xx All Things Dark and Dangerous\". She worked with Meier and Mize on \"98-xxx The Adventurers\". Later that year, box sets of \"10-3xx The Best of Ral Partha\" and Julie Guthrie's \"96-xxx Elfquest\" figures for Chasosium's \"Elfquest\" game were put into production. Guthrie expanded the \"All Things Dark and Dangerous\" line in 1984, 1985, and 1986. In 1984 she joined Meier and Mize to develop a short series of miniatures (\"95-xxx\") for Nova Games' Lost Worlds series of combat books. In 1985 Guthrie contributed two sculpts of unicorns to \"PO-3xx Once Upon a Time\" series designed for the giftware market, cast in lead-free alloy, and marketed as \"Partha Pewter\" by Rawcliffe Pewter. Their work with pewter allowed Ral Partha's mold-makers to develop the technical expertise necessary to transition to non-lead alloys in the early 1990s.\n\nRobert N. Charrette joined Ral Partha in 1984 and contributed to Meier's \"The Hoplites\", \"1200 A.D.\", and \"CS/02-xxx Collector Series\" lines. In 1985, Charrette inaugurated figures for Chaosium's \"RuneQuest\" and a line of pulp adventurers. The line was initially called \"20th Century Plus\", but was later renamed \"20-xxx The Roaring Twenties\". Charrette revisited a line of figures he sculpted in 1979 to accompany Fantasy Games Unlimited's \"Gangster!\". Charrette updated the line to include new cinematic themes such as the intrepid archaeologist. In 1986 Charrette introduced \"53-9xx Bushido\", a line of miniatures for \"Bushido,\" a game he authored and sculpted a line of figures for Fantasy Games Unlimited. In 1985, Bob Charrette began producing a line of miniature robot war machines for a game that was first called \"Battledroids\" and renamed \"BattleTech\" in 1986, for FASA's game of the same name. It was the beginning of a permanent relationship between the two companies that would eventually lead to Ral Partha's sale to FASA. Battletech products remain a leading product of Ral Partha's successor, Iron Wind Metals and Charrette continued on as creative development and authored several related novels.\n\nIn 1986 Ral Partha sculptors crafted \"01-3xx 3-Stage Characters\" which consisted of three aspects with increasing amounts of arms and armor to represent a single adventurer's game career. The line was folded into the \"ES/01-xxx\" line in 1987. Because of their popularity with collectors and role-players, they regained status as a separate line and a place of prominence in the 1991 and subsequent catalogs.\n\nAt the same time that integrated campaign worlds like Games Workshop's \"Warhammer Fantasy Battle\" were showing early success, Ral Partha introduced the \"Chaos Wars\" theme into their 1986 and 1987 product lines. It was the first step toward unifying a collection of disparate themes into an integrated brand. In the 1986 catalog sculptors were no longer credited and a mythical \"Ral Partha\" rather than the president of the company addressed customers in the prologue. At about that same time, the Ral Partha staff had developed a four-page \"Rules According to Ral\" for medieval battles. A fantasy version by Bob Charrette, Rich Smethhurst, Marc Rubin, and Chuck Crain was released in 1987 as part of a boxed set \"Rules According to Ral: Chaos Wars\". The Chaos Wars theme collected together numerous existing products, many from Meier's \"ES/01-xxx\" line, and their packaging was marked with stickers.\n\nAs part of the Chaos Wars product line the \"Partha Pipeline\" newsletter was transformed into the \"Ral Partha War Bulletin\" in January 1986. The \"War Bulletin\" followed much of the same format as the \"Pipeline\" but its focus was the Chaos Wars product line. Releases were sporadic and continued until at least the Spring of 1990.\n\nThe new initiative was to include \"10-2xx Free Companies of Chaos Wars\" box sets, but large contracts to produce miniatures for other gaming companies became a higher priority and the Chaos Wars lines were appended to the \"CS/02-xxx Collector's Series\". Among these sets were Charrette's popular \"Fangs of Fury\" beastmen, Tom Meier's \"Korg's Killers\" orcs, and Meier's \"Starbrow's Select\" elves. Having never fully materialized, the Chaos Wars theme was set aside in 1988 in order to give necessary attention to producing official miniatures for TSR, Inc.'s \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" game.\n\nIn 1988 Meier began his own company, Thunderbolt Mountain Miniatures, but continued to do freelance work for Ral Partha. Company president Chuck Crain hired Sandra L. Garrity, Dave Summers, and Richard Kerr as full-time sculptors to produce an official line of monsters and personalities for AD&D figures. The earliest figures included \"10-56x Battlesystem Brigades (25 mm)\" which included an entire 25 mm military unit in for tabletop wargames, and adventurers (\"11-0xx\") and monsters (\"11-4xx\") for role-playing games. In 1990 Ral Partha launched \"10-5xx Dragonlance and Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"10-55x Forgotten Realms\" boxed sets. The line grew rapidly and 1991 saw the addition of box sets for \"11-9xx Battlesystem Brigades (15 mm)\", \"11-5xx Ravenloft\" and \"10-54x Dark Sun\" game worlds. The \"11-05x, 11-06x AD&D Personalities\" of heroes and villains was released in 1994, and additional figures for the Planescape, Ravenloft, and Forgotten Realms game worlds followed in 1995. By 1997 Ral Partha had also added figures for TSR, Inc.'s Dark Sun, Council of Wyrms, and Birthright game worlds. The breadth and earning potential of the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" franchise drove new releases and Ral Partha scrambled to acquire the sculpting talents of British and American sculptors, including Nick Bibby, Jeff Wilhelm, Bob Olley, Chris Atkin, Walter Vail, John M. Garrity, and Jim Johnson in 1992, and Chis Fitzpatrick and Geoff Valley by 1995.\n\nBy 1991 the \"20-xxx BattleTech\" line had grown to include eleven box sets, and more than one hundred 'Mechs, Aerospace fighters, and ground vehicles. Ral Partha also produced 25 mm \"20-9xx Mechwarriors\" depicting pilots, mechanics and guards for role-playing in the BattleTech game world. That same year, Ral Partha sculptors had begun crafting figures for FASA's game Shadowrun, a role-playing game set in a futuristic cyber-world. Shadowrun miniatures had previously been produced by Grenadier Miniatures. Ral Partha introduced their sculpts (\"20-5xx Shadowrun\") in 1992.\n\nThe \"12-xxx The All American Line\" of fighters, orcs, magic-users, undead, dwarves, and elves was released in 1991 and 1992. The name of the line appears to refer to the fact that all the figures were sculpted Ral Partha's four staff sculptors. Other new lines included Richard Kerr's 1992 futuristic tanks for Steve Jackson Games' \"Ogre\" and the introduction of the \"69-xxx\" series for White Wolf, Inc.'s \"\" and \"\" in late 1993. Figures for White Wolf, Inc.'s \"\" followed soon after.\n\nInitially, Ral Partha figures were cast from lead and tin alloy, but in 1993 New York legislators nearly passed a public health bill barring the use of lead in toys and miniatures. Despite the additional cost, numerous manufacturers anticipated parental concerns, similar legislation in other states, workplace safety, and began using white metal alloys. Ral Partha's staff had previously developed a lead-free alloy for their \"Partha Pewter,\" a line of collectible figurines designed for the giftware market. In September 1993 they began using a trademarked white metal alloy they called \"Ralidium\" in all their products and its use marks a clear benchmark for dating old figures. The move away from lead was promoted in advertisements and bright red stickers on existing packaging. In time, New York Governor Mario Cuomo relented to hobbyists' concerns and exempted miniatures from the state's Public Health Law. However, the company never went back to lead. Ral Partha correctly anticipated the industry's movement away from lead, but the associated price increases came at a time when miniatures and role playing games were being eclipsed by collectible card games like Wizards of the Coast's 1993 hit \"\". In 1994 the company experimented with \"Partha Plastics.\" The move was made well after Citadel Miniatures' successful introduction of plastic and part-plastic figures, but the figures were not popular with Ral Partha's older customer base.\nIn 1993 Dennis Mize designed the \"Titans of Terror\" series which invoked the heroes and monsters of the horror films. The following year Mize conceptualized and sculpted \"01-7xx Beastmasters\", a line of carnivores and their trainers. The line was expanded the following year, and would be completed until 1998. That same year Ral Partha produced \"Coins of the Realm,\" fantasy and historical coinage. In 1995 Ral Partha's sculptors crafted figures for Steve Jackson Games' \"Space Knight,\" and dioramas called \"Sculptors' Row\", \"The Sterling Collection\", and \"Encounters of the Imagination\".\n\nDuring Jack Hesselbrock's second term as company president, he re-established a newsletter which he called the \"Ral Partha Gaming Club.\" Like its predecessors it addressed letters from customers and company news. The series ran for six issues from June 1996 to September 1997. In December of 1996 Ral Partha launched a website which hosted the newsletters and product ordering information. The newsletters reveal a number of licensing setbacks. The hobby market had moved away from roleplaying games and wargames and was rapidly becoming dominated by collectible card games like Wizards of the Coast's . Ral Partha faced a number of licensing setbacks. Steve Jackson Games' \"Ogre\" miniatures and all three \"White Wolf\" lines were discontinued in 1996. Bob Charrette's \"18-xxx Runequest\" figures were discontinued the following year.\n\nSince the late 1970s the gaming miniatures industry had undergone what collectors call \"scale creep,\" an increase in size from 20 and 25 mm scales (i.e. height to the eyes of an upright human-sized figure) to 30 mm and 32 mm. By the late 1990s the move to larger figures by market leaders like Games Workshop of Great Britain had made it such that Ral Partha's sculpts of the 1970s and early 1980s appeared significantly smaller than others. In response to the shift in the market, Ral Partha began adding to Tom Meier's collector's series (\"CS/02-xxx\") with a 30 mm scale \"Fantasy Armies\" line in a \"British style\" which tended to have over-sized weapons, punk and Gothic fashions, and separate square bases. Chris Fitzpatrick designed a line of elves. Bob Olley produced new dwarves, goblins, trolls and ogres. Jeff Wilhelm created a series of skeletons. Jim Johnson's contributions were bands of humans known as \"Horse Lords\", \"Savages,\" \"Reavers,\" and \"Tyrants.\" Sandra Garrity designed the \"Knights of the Legion of Justice\" A set of rules of the \"Fantasy Armies\" were developed by an outside work group called \"Ral Partha Publishing.\" The game was first introduced in the 1997 Ral Partha catalog flier as \"14-001 Bloodstorm.\" Soon after the project was retitled \"Battlestorm\" and published in 1998. The game was advertised as the first volume of the \"Fables Gamesystem,\" but no subsequent installments were issued.\n\nBuoyed by the success of Magic:The Gathering, in 1997 Wizards of the Coast acquired TSR, Inc. and with it, control of the rights to \"Dungeons & Dragons\" miniatures. After an extension to their contract, Wizards of the Coast did not renew Ral Partha's license for \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" miniatures and the figures went out of production at the end of 1998 These miniatures are highly sought after by collectors who believe that Wizards of the Coast had ordered the destruction of the master molds.\n\nThe loss of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and other licenses meant that FASA's BattleTech figures became the majority of Ral Partha's revenue. Under threat of also losing those lines and the financial difficulties created by the changing hobby market, the owners of Ral Partha sold the company in 1998 to FASA and Lanier Hurdle and Mike Hurdle, owners of Zocchi Distribution, a hobby shop supplier. FASA gained sole ownership in the spring of 1999, and Ral Partha began to produce miniatures for FASA's \"Crimson Skies\", \"\", and \"\" games. No sooner were these miniatures in stores when FASA ceased production of all their games.\n\nIn December 1999 Ral Partha launched \"The Partha Pipeline\" to announce new products for FASA's games, as well as house designs. At this time Ral Partha had an in-house design studio and a host of staff and free-lance sculptors which included Kev Adams, Jeff Grace, Behrle W. Hubboch III, Randy Kerr, Robert Kyde, Phil Lewis, Dennis Mize, Bob Olley, Tim Prow, Steve Saunders, C. Staples, Dave Summers, Jeff Wilhelm, John Winter. The second series of the \"Partha Pipeline\" ran until late 2000 when the Ral Partha assets faced another acquisition.\n\nIn January 2001 WizKids, a New Jersey-based producer of plastic collectible miniatures games, acquired the bulk of Ral Partha's assets as part of their purchase of FASA's \"BattleTech\" and \"Shadowrun\" games. WizKids purchased the rights to some figures from Ral Partha sculptors, but the bulk reverted to the artists. Meier retained his \"15/54-xxx Condotitieri,\" \"88-xxx The Colonials\", and most of the \"CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors\" lines. Charrette remained in possession of his \"53-9xx Bushido\" figures. Ral Partha continued to produce miniatures for the \"Battletech\" and \"Shadowrun\" gaming worlds. Wizkids licensed the rights to rulebooks and other gaming materials to Fantasy Productions, better known as \"FanPro\" in the United States, which had produced and distributed the German language versions of those games for FASA. FanPro's support of the \"Shadowrun\" and \"Battletech\" game worlds resulted in continued demand for metal miniatures by gaming enthusiasts.\n\nIn March 2001 Ral Partha began producing collectible metal versions of the WizKids 64-figure \"Mage Knight\" Rebellion set. The relationship between Wizkids and Ral Partha was a short one. By year's end Wizkids rethought its investment in metal miniatures and divested itself of Ral Partha's manufacturing capabilities while retaining the Ral Partha trademark.\n\nIn late 2001 Ral Partha's manufacturing capacities were spun off from WizKids, and renamed Iron Wind Metals, LLC, with longtime general manager Michael Noe as president and in partnership with Marc Rubin, one of Ral Partha's original owners. Iron Wind Metals retained the same location and much of the same production staff, molds, equipment, working relationships with artists, and licensing agreements. In addition to their own lines, Iron Wind Metals carries out contract production work for other gaming labels such as Tom Meier's Thunderbolt Mountain, Dark Sword Miniatures, Crocodile Games, and dozens of others.\n\nIron Wind Metals' new focus on productive capacities reflected a shift in game production strategy. The previous model had been that gaming companies hired sculptors and other creative talent to feed their in-house casting and packaging facilities. This model was successful, but artists sometimes didn't have the capital necessary to retain copyrights, and the mercurial nature of the market meant that their game designs could be sold to others, or languish as assets of dead companies. In the late 1980s, many game designers and sculptors established boutique companies, often operating out of their own homes, and then contracted out or made partnerships with companies like Iron Wind Metals to do the production.\n\nIron Wind Metals continued to use the name Ral Partha to describe archived designs, but the website and Ral Partha trademark remained the property of Wizkids which underwent a series of acquisitions. In 2003 WizKids was purchased by Topps, a manufacturer of sports cards who were interested in WizKids range of similarly collectible plastic miniatures. In 2007 Topps was purchased by The Tornante Company, a private equity firm. Citing falling profits associated with the Great Recession, Tornante put the Wizkids product lines on hold in November 2008, but continued to lease the intellectual properties of \"Battletech\" and \"Shadowrun\" game worlds. In September 14, 2009, The Tornante Company sold the majority of the Wizkids assets to the National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA), but retained the rights to \"Battletech,\" \"Shadowrun,\" and the Ral Partha trademark and website.\n\nThe divisions and purchases meant that assets important to the Ral Partha brand were divided among numerous enterprises. Between 1998 and 2009, the Ral Partha trademark passed from FASA, to Wizkids, Topps, and finally The Tornante Company. None of whom utilized the brand. The miniatures for the \"Battletech\" miniatures produced by Ral Partha and then Iron Wind Metals remained popular, but the future of the game was always in question. FanPro had lost its bid to produce the \"Battletech\" and \"Shadowrun\" game worlds, but InMediaRes created a new subsidiary, Catalyst Game Labs to design new expansions for the games and provided continuity by employing many former FanPro staff The productive capacities for Ral Partha miniatures remained with Iron Wind Metals who had retained working relationships with many of the artists, but could not use the Ral Partha name. Longtime customers could special order many of the figures, but they could not be marketed as Ral Partha figures. The trademark languished until 2014 when The Tornante Company agreed to sell the assets to Iron Wind Metals. By the end of 2014 Iron Wind Metals had recreated Ral Partha by forming a new division which united the Ral Partha trademark, website and sculptors' copyrights with their improved productive capacities.\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ral Partha, Iron Wind Metals relaunched the miniature lines from Ral Partha's \"golden age.\" Establishing Ral Partha as a division of Iron Wind Metals, president Mike Noe and co-owner Mark Rubin launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the production costs of its 1980s lines under the \"Chaos Wars\" game world. Ral Partha had begun developing \"Chaos Wars\" in 1986. At that time they had released a new version of 'house rules\" called \"Rules According to Ral\" gaming system with scenarios, several boxed sets, and blister packs marked with \"Chaos Wars\" stickers. However, the initiative was put on hold by the push to produce miniatures for lines licensed by TSR, FASA, and other partners. After a sixteen-year hiatus, \"Chaos Wars\" returned as a series of blister packs, limited edition boxed sets, and battle packs of elves, orcs and goblin figures drawn from Ral Partha's \"CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors\", \"12-xxx The All American\" and other lines. A majority of the figures were sculpted by Tom Meier who supported the re-release. In 2016 Iron Wind Metals completed a second campaign and revived previously archived figures of dwarves, undead and troglodytes \n\nRal Partha's sculptors, artists, and mold-makers and the years in which they worked for the company:\n\nStaff Sculptors\nFreelance Sculptors\n\nMold-Makers, Casters and Production Managers\n\nGraphic Artists and Illustrators\n\nOrigins Awards / H.G. Wells Awards\n\n\nOrigins Hall of Fame\n\n\nStrategist Club \"Creativity in Wargaming\" Award\n\n\nThe Courier Award\n\n\nGames Day Awards\n\n\nThe company was honored by the writers of the television show \"Andromeda\" by the naming of a fictional planet \"Ral Parthea,\" a planet-wide nature preserve created by an ancient race of space aliens. The miniature company's name has been adopted by the San Francisco \"Scandinavian Preppy\" band Ral Partha Vogelbacher. Reportedly the last part of the band's name was the surname of a childhood bully of one of the members, and forms a statement of the nerd pride movement.\n\n"}

{"id": "39241299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39241299", "title": "Si Ronda", "text": "Si Ronda\n\nSi Ronda is a 1930 silent film from the Dutch East Indies which was directed by Lie Tek Swie and starred Bachtiar Effendi. Based on contemporary Betawi oral tradition, it follows the exploits of a bandit, skilled in \"silat\" (traditional Malay martial arts), known as Si Ronda. In the \"lenong\" stories from which the film was derived, Ronda was often depicted as a Robin Hood type of figure. The production, now thought lost, was one of a series of martial arts films released between 1929 and 1931. \"Si Ronda\" received little coverage in the media upon its release. A second adaptation of the tale, \"Si Ronda Macan Betawi\", was made in 1978.\n\n\"Si Ronda\" was adapted from a \"lenong\" (a Betawi oral tradition similar to a stage play) popular with ethnic Chinese and native audiences of the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at \"silat\" (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take from the rich to give to the poor. The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.\n\nSimilar stories to Si Ronda's include those of Si Jampang and Si Pitung; these stage plays centred on extraordinary men (referred to as \"jago\") who, though living outside the law, generally fought for the common populace. Adaptations of the genre, manifested as bandit films, became popular in domestic cinema following the release of \"Si Tjonat\" by Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. This release was followed by the Wong brothers' \"Rampok Preanger\" (also 1929), and an adaptation of the Si Pitung stories in 1931. Not all films in this genre, which consisted of a quarter of all domestic releases for 1929–1931, maintained the heroic qualities of the central character: the Wongs' adaptation of \"Si Pitung\", for instance, portrayed him as a simple bandit and not the Robin Hood figure of stage.\n\n\"Si Ronda\" was directed by Lie Tek Swie and produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of Tan's Film. The two had previously worked together on the company's highly profitable \"Njai Dasima\" in 1929. Cinematography was handled by A. Loepias. Shot in black-and-white, this silent film starred Bachtiar Effendi, a set decorator with Tan's, in his on-screen debut playing the title role. It also featured Momo, an actor who had appeared in the film \"Njai Dasima\".\n\n\"Si Ronda\" was released in 1930; Effendi stated that it was released before Tan's \"Nancy Bikin Pembalesan\" (\"Nancy Takes Revenge\"), a sequel to \"Njai Dasima\", began screening in May 1930. Dutch newspapers indicate that it had screened in Medan, North Sumatra, by 1932. Biran writes that the film received little coverage; he notes that Sinematek Indonesia has no news clippings related to \"Si Ronda\".\n\nAfter \"Si Ronda\", Lie and Tan collaborated on three further films. Lie left Tan's in 1932, reportedly as his approach no longer matched Tan's low-class target audience and caused the works to go over budget. Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, when he left to head the cinema magazine \"Doenia Film\". Momo continued acting until 1941, first with Tan's and later with Standard Film. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives.\n\nAnother film based on the Ronda stories, titled \"Si Ronda Macan Betawi\" (\"Ronda the Betawi Tiger\"), was released in 1978. Directed by Fritz G. Schadt, it starred Dicky Zulkarnaen in the title role and Lenny Marlina as his lover. In this adaptation Ronda uses his \"silat\" skills to fight corrupt land owners and colonial government workers.\n"}
{"id": "11327862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11327862", "title": "South Park controversies", "text": "South Park controversies\n\n\"South Park\" is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Its frequent depiction of taboo subject matter, unusual (especially Sophomoric) humor and portrayal of religion for comic effect has generated controversy and debate throughout the world over the course of its 22 seasons. Stone and Parker, who write the show, use the show frequently to lampoon a wide range of topics and both sides of contentious issues.\n\nParker and Stone usually reply to such controversies by regarding themselves as \"equal opportunity offenders\". They reject the notion of political correctness, and state that no particular topic or group of people will be exempt from mockery and satire, out of fairness to any person or group of people who have been ridiculed before.\n\nIn the United States, South Park is mainly rated TV-MA: This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17. TV-MA: This program may contain one or more of the following: crude indecent language (L), strong sexual content (S), or graphic violence (V). To note, some episodes on syndication have been reclassified TV-14.\nIn Australia, the first three seasons and some episodes in season 4, were rated M: Recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over. The M rating is unrestricted and moderate in impact, and it is equivalent to America's TV-14 rating. The latter seasons are rated MA15+, which is a rating restricted for people over 15 years, and is strong in impact. Despite being rated M on television, the season 3 DVD set was the first season to receive an MA15+ rating. The consumer advice usually goes as follows; Adult themes (A), coarse language (L), sexual references (S) and/or animated violence (V). Depending on the rating, the terms \"moderate\" and \"strong\" precede these descriptions.\nIn the United Kingdom, the show is generally rated 15, until season 7 when it gets an 18 rating due to the audio commentaries (the episodes are only rated 15). However, some episodes, such as those in the first four seasons do have a 12 rating (Cartman Gets an Anal Probe). Furthermore, the season 3 DVD set was originally rated 18 in the UK, Canada and Ireland, due to the content of the final episode, World Wide Recorder Concert (which contains references to child molestation). It was re-rated 15 in the UK upon its re-release in 2008, although in Ireland it is still rated 18, as a number of episodes in the latter seasons.\nIn Canada, most of the DVD sets have a 14A rating. Season 9 has an 18A rating though. Season 4 is the only season rated R13 in New Zealand and the first season is rated M, akin to Australia's rating. The rest of the seasons have a R16 rating. The television rating of the show in New Zealand is AO (adults only). In Spain, the show is rated 18 (years and above).\n\n\"South Park\" was banned in India. According to VH1 India's channel head Ferzad Palia, after being reviewed by the Indian Ministry of Broadcasting, the show was banned for its vulgarity.\n\nAs the series first became popular in the United States, several schools punished students for wearing \"South Park\"-related T-shirts, while a group of school principals in New Jersey mounted a small campaign to notify parents of the show's content. Hickory Flat Elementary School in Cherokee County, Georgia issued a ban on wearing any \"South Park\" clothing. In a 1999 poll conducted by NatWest Bank, eight- and nine-year-old children in the United Kingdom voted \"South Park\"'s character Eric Cartman their favorite personality. This drew the concern of several parent councils, who were expecting that a children's television show character would top the list, and the headmaster of a Cambridgeshire public school urged parents to prevent their children from watching the show. Parker and Stone, who are not opposed to allowing kids to watch the show, assert however that the show is not meant to be viewed by kids, and the show is almost \"always\" rated TV-MA, while being accompanied by the following warning:\n\"All characters and events in this show—even those based on real people—are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated... poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.\"\n\nThe conservative advocacy group Parents Television Council has frequently criticized \"South Park\" for \"over-the-top vulgar content\" and \"tastelessness,\" condemning the show as a \"curdled, malodorous black hole of Comedy Central vomit\" that \"shouldn't have been made.\"\n\nAction for Children's Television founder Peggy Charren claimed that the show's use of language and racial slurs represents the depravity of Western civilization, and that it is \"dangerous to the democracy.\"\n\nSeveral other Christian activist groups have protested the show's parodies of Christianity-related matter and portrayal of Jesus Christ—whom \"South Park\" has depicted saying \"Goddamn,\" shooting and stabbing other characters, and as unable to perform actual miracles. In its review of the \"South Park\" movie, the ChildCare Action Project stated that children who watch either the show or film would have their efforts to \"understand or [develop] an understanding of the Gospel\" hindered or corrupted. The Christian Family Network prepared an educational guide on how to \"protect our youth from vile trash like \"South Park\",\" and claims that their efforts to \"restore morality, and protect life for the individual, family, and community\" would be impeded if children watched the series.\n\nMatt Stone insists that \"[kids] don't have any kind of social tact or etiquette\", and claims that parents who disapprove of \"South Park\" for its portrayal of how kids behave are upset because they \"have an idyllic vision of what kids are like.\"\n\nSeveral groups have called for a boycott of the show, its sponsors, and the networks that air it. For example, in late 2008, on behalf of Muslim activists and members of the Russian Pentecostalist Church, a group of prosecutors in Moscow sought to have the Russian channel 2×2 closed in an attempt to prevent them from broadcasting the series, which they claimed promoted \"hatred between religions.\" Their appeal was rejected by Russian media officials, and the channel's broadcasting license was extended until 2013. Aside from the efforts in Russia, no group or individual in a country where the show is aired has mounted a significant campaign to ban the series and its availability on home media entirely.\n\nA Canadian judge in the Calgary Judicial District has described \"South Park\" as a \"vulgar, socially irreverent program that contributes nothing to society.\"\nThe show further lampooned the controversy surrounding its use of profanity, as well as the media attention surrounding the network show \"Chicago Hope\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> single use of the word \"shit,\" with the season five premiere \"It Hits the Fan\".\n\nThe PTC also criticized the show for its excessive use of the racial epithet \"nigger\" in the season 11 (2007) premiere \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson.\" Despite its 43 uncensored uses of the word, the episode generated relatively little other controversy, as most in the black community and the NAACP praised the episode for its context and its comedic way of conveying other races' perceptions of how black people feel when hearing the word. While some in the Jewish community have praised the show's depiction of the character Eric Cartman holding an anti-Semitic attitude towards fellow student Kyle Broflovski as a means of accurately portraying what it is like for a young Jew to have to endure bigotry as an ethnic minority, other Jews have blamed \"South Park\" and Cartman for having found themselves surrounded by \"acceptable racism.\"\n\n\"South Park\" parodied Scientology in a short that aired as part of the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The short was entitled \"The Gauntlet\" and also poked fun at John Travolta, a Scientologist. The season five (2001) episode \"Super Best Friends\" features illusionist David Blaine forming his own cult, called \"Blaintology.\" Parker and Stone have acknowledged that this is meant to be a reference to Scientology.\n\nIn the season nine (2005) episode \"Trapped in the Closet\", Stan Marsh is recognized as the reincarnation of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard before denouncing the church as nothing more than \"a big fat global scam.\" Tom Cruise, also a Scientologist, is seen in the episode locking himself in Stan's closet and refusing to come out, as other characters ambiguously plead for him to \"come out of the closet\" in a parody of rumors involving Cruise's sexuality. One scene retold the story of Xenu, a story Scientology normally attempts to keep confidential and only reveals to members once they make significant monetary contributions to the church. The show's closing credits billed every member of the episode's cast and crew as \"John Smith\" and \"Jane Smith\" in a parody of both Cruise and the church's reputations for litigiousness.\n\nOn March 13, 2006, nearly two months after suffering a stroke, Isaac Hayes, the voice of the character Chef, quit \"South Park\". A press release cited his objections to the show's attitudes toward and depiction of various religions. While the press release did not specifically mention \"Trapped in the Closet,\" Parker and Stone assert that he quit because of the episode and its treatment of Scientology, as Hayes was a member. Stone commented that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on \"South Park\": \"[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [lampooned] Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin\". Fox News suggested that, because he was still suffering from the effects of his stroke, Hayes was hospitalized and not in a position to make a rational decision to leave the show. Fox also reported that Hayes left the show because of pressure from fellow Scientologists and that the decision was not voluntary, noting that Hayes had previously defended the episode after an amicable discussion with Parker and Stone about its content. Fox claimed moreover, that the original press release announcing his departure was put out by someone not authorized to represent him. In a 2016 oral history of \"South Park\" in \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Hayes's son, Isaac Hayes III, confirmed that the decision to leave the show was made by Hayes' entourage while Hayes was unable to make such decisions on his own.\n\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" was scheduled to rebroadcast on March 15, 2006 on Comedy Central, but the broadcast was canceled without prior notice, and was replaced with a repeat of the season two (1998) episode \"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\". The controversy that soon followed was dubbed \"Closetgate\" by the \"Los Angeles Times\". Representatives of Comedy Central insist that the episode was changed as a tribute to Hayes following his departure. Comedy Central's parent company, Viacom, also owns Paramount Pictures, which was set to distribute the then-upcoming film \"\", which stars Cruise. Several media outlets alleged that Cruise threatened to boycott the publicity tour for the film unless Viacom cancelled the episode's rebroadcast. Comedy Central, as well as Cruise's representative and publicist, immediately denied the allegations. Cruise himself later said that he would not \"dignify\" the rumors by personally addressing whether or not they were true.\n\nIn response to the episode being pulled, Parker and Stone issued the following statement, with several mocking references to Scientology:\n\n\"Mission: Impossible III\" was released on May 5, 2006, while \"Trapped in the Closet\" was rebroadcast without controversy on July 19, 2006. Stone stated that he and Parker would have threatened to end their relationship with Comedy Central had the network finally refused to rebroadcast the episode. The episode was nominated for an Emmy, and is included on \"South Park's\" 10th Anniversary DVD, called \"South Park – The Hits, Volume 1\" and is one of the show's female voice actresses, April Stewart's favorite episode.\n\nCameron Adams of the \"Herald Sun\" highlighted the episode \"All About Mormons\" among \"Top Choice\" picks in television. Chris Quinn of the \"San Antonio Express-News\" placed the episode at number 7 on his list of: \"Top 10 Most Offensive South Park Episodes and Therefore, Maybe The Best, List\". The episode was used as an exhibit in discussing Mormonism in popular culture, by Utah Valley State College religious studies professor Dennis Potter, in a presentation titled: \"The Americanization of Mormonism Reflected in Pop Culture\". The LDS Church called the episode a gross portrayal of Church history, but contended that \"it inflicted no perceptible or lasting damage to [the] church,\" and that such portrayals are distractions.\n\nSeveral Roman Catholics took offense at the season nine (2005) finale \"Bloody Mary.\" In the episode, a statue of the Virgin Mary is portrayed as releasing copious amounts of actual blood while undergoing overt menstruation; characters had declared the phenomenon a miracle when they initially thought the blood was flowing from her rectum. Another scene features Pope Benedict XVI closely inspecting the anal and vaginal regions of the statue and being sprayed with blood. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights demanded an apology from Comedy Central and unsuccessfully campaigned to have the episode both removed permanently from the network's rotation and never be made available on DVD. Viacom board member Joseph A. Califano, Jr. and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued formal complaints with then-Viacom CEO Tom Freston.\n\nIn February 2006, leaders from the New Zealand Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Council of Christians and Muslims, and other religious groups together lobbied media conglomerate CanWest to stop the episode's debut airing and potential rebroadcasts in New Zealand on the music channel C4, while protesters condemned the lobby for attempting to take advantage of the New Zealand people's lack of a guaranteed right to the freedom of speech. The network rejected the plea, and was allowed to air the episode, doing so ahead of schedule to take advantage of the media attention surrounding the campaign.\n\nThe season 10 episodes \"Cartoon Wars Part I\" and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" feature a plot in which the Fox network plans to air an episode of the animated show \"Family Guy\" that contains an uncensored cartoon depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Residents of South Park panic, fearing a terrorist response and a repeat of the real-life violent protests and riots that occurred worldwide after some Muslims regarded Muhammad's cartoon depiction in a Danish newspaper as insulting and blasphemous. The first episode had a cliffhanger ending instructing viewers to watch part two to find out whether the image of Muhammad would be shown uncensored. In the second episode, Kyle persuades a Fox executive to air the \"Family Guy\" with the image uncensored, while echoing Parker and Stone's sentiments regarding what should or should not be censored of \"[either] it's got to all be OK or none of it is\". Within the universe of the episode, the \"Family Guy\" episode is aired uncensored, despite a retaliation threat from Al-Qaeda. However, the actual \"South Park\" broadcast itself ran a black screen that read \"Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammed on their network\" instead of the scene containing Muhammad's depiction, which Parker and Stone say was neutral and not intended to insult Muslims.\n\nParker and Stone note the contradiction in being allowed to feature a profane depiction of Jesus, while being forbidden to feature a purely benign depiction of Muhammad, but claim they harbor no hard feelings toward Comedy Central for censoring the scene, since the network confessed to being \"afraid of getting blown up\" rather than claim 'religious tolerance' like other networks. Parker and Stone claim the only regrets they have over the incident was that their mocking of the show \"Family Guy\" in the episode generated more attention than its commentary on the ethics of censorship. Previously, Muhammad was depicted uncensored and portrayed in a heroic light in the season five (2001) episode \"Super Best Friends\", which resulted in virtually no controversy. Muhammad also appears among the large crowd of characters gathered behind the main characters and \"South Park\" sign in some of the show's previous opening sequences.\n\nParker and Stone repeated this plot for the 200th episode \"200\". Again, the depiction was censored throughout the episode. After the episode aired, a leader of Revolution Muslim, an obscure New York-based radical Muslim organization, targeted \"South Park\"’s creators for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of Muhammad. The author of the post, who goes by the username Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee, wrote on Twitter that he prayed for Allah to kill the show’s creators and “burn them in Hell for all eternity.” He also posted a similar entry on his blog and on the Revolution Muslim website. The post included a picture of the assassination of Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh by a Muslim extremist in 2004 with the caption: \"Theo Van Gogh – Have Matt Stone And Trey Parker Forgotten This?\" He also noted: \"We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh if they do air this show.\"\n\nFollowing the airing of this episode, Malaysia's conservative Islamic PAS party demanded that the makers of the satirical cartoon sitcom \"South Park\" apologize to Muslims around the world for its portrayal of Muhammad dressed as a bear, though it was later shown that it was actually Santa inside the suit. \"Even though they have added the audio bleeps, \"South Park\"'s producer and broadcaster should apologize to the Muslims, as this is a sensitive issue,\" said PAS vice-president Mahfuz Omar. \"The show itself spells of bad intention, and the depiction of the Prophet is provocative. It creates religious tension.\"\n\nThe following episode \"201\" censored the word \"Muhammad\" throughout the episode, as well as several lines from the \"Super Best Friends\" during the final act. According to the South Park Studios webpage, episode \"201\" was censored by Comedy Central after the studio delivered the episode, but before it was aired. The studio advises that the episode is not available online because they do not have network clearance to air the uncensored episode.\n\nDue to the controversies, the episode \"201\" was removed from the British Comedy Central TV schedule, and replaced with a repeat of \"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,\" and the repeat of \"200\" was replaced with a repeat of \"Sexual Healing\". The episode \"Super Best Friends\", previously available via the South Park Studios website has been made unavailable. Additionally, the Netflix streaming version of the episode, also previously available, has been changed to \"Disc Only\". \"Super Best Friends\" was also removed from the iTunes Store as well as the Xbox Live Video Marketplace.\n\nDespite the controversies, \"200\" and \"201\" are available on the Region 1 release of \"South Park – The Complete Fourteenth Season\" disc. The episodes were censored and so were the commentaries regarding the episodes.\nThe Region 2 and 4 releases of \"South Park – The Complete Fourteenth Season\" had both \"200\" and \"201\" removed for undisclosed reasons, despite the packaging claiming that all fourteen episodes are included in the set. In the chalkboard gag of The Simpsons episode, \"The Squirt and the Whale\", Bart pokes fun at the death threats Parker and Stone received by writing \"South Park, We'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared.\" \n\nAll this being said, in some South Park season intros, Muhammad can be seen uncensored.\n\nSeveral viewers criticized the season 10 (2006) episode \"Hell on Earth 2006\" for its depiction of Steve Irwin with a stingray stuck in his chest.\nThe episode originally aired seven weeks after Irwin, an internationally popular Australian TV personality and wildlife expert, died when his heart was pierced by a stingray barb. Several groups and even devout fans of the show derided the scene and its timing as \"grossly insensitive\" and \"classless\", while Irwin's widow Terri Irwin expressed concern that her children could one day see the episode.\n\nIn the 2009 episode \"Pinewood Derby\" several world leaders were depicted, including Mexican President Felipe Calderón, failing to successfully deal with an international crisis. MTV withdrew the episode in Mexico causing controversy amongst Mexico's \"South Park\" fans who felt it was censorship; MTV denied this, claiming they had just failed to get permission in time to show the Mexican flag on TV.\n\nComedy Central (Netherlands) chose temporarily not to broadcast some scenes from several shows following the November 2015 Paris attacks. While no specifics were given, it included a scene in the 2015 episode \"Sponsored Content\" where presidential candidate Mr. Garrison states that he knows there is only one way how to deal with Syrian refugees, and the crowd shouts \"fuck them all to death\".\n\nOne of Parker and Stone's earliest responses to the show being condemned as \"nothing but bad animation and fart jokes\" was creating a show-within-the-show about two even-more-crudely-drawn characters named Terrance and Phillip who do little else but pass gas around each other. The child characters on the show find Terrance and Phillip, who debuted in the season one (1997) episode \"Death\", to be hysterical, while their parents find them to be horribly offensive. An entire episode featuring the duo aired on April 1, 1998. It was broadcast in lieu of an episode that was supposed to continue from the show's previous episode from four weeks earlier, which ended with a cliffhanger promising to reveal the identity of Cartman's father in the show's next airing. Several fans were angered by the April Fools' Day prank, and Comedy Central received thousands of e-mail complaints. Comedy Central moved the planned air date of the next show up a month, so that fans could sooner watch the actual show they originally expected to see.\n\nMichael Moore interviewed Matt Stone for his 2002 film \"Bowling for Columbine\". Stone discussed his experiences growing up in the Littleton area and the social alienation that might have contributed to the Columbine High School massacre. Stone, who is a gun-owner himself, said that Moore's presentation of their interview was fair, but he criticized the director for a short animated segment that followed the interview. The cartoon, which is about the history of guns in the United States, implies that there is a connection between the Ku Klux Klan and the establishment of the National Rifle Association. Matt Stone, who did not have anything to do with that short cartoon, criticized Moore for making the cartoon \"very South Park-esque\" and argued that Moore deliberately sought to give viewers the incorrect impression that he and Trey Parker had produced the animation, by playing these two completely separate segments consecutively. \"We have a very specific beef with Michael Moore. I did an interview, and he didn't mischaracterize me or anything I said in the movie. But what he did do was put this cartoon right after me that made it look like we did that cartoon.\" Stone called it \"a good reference to what Michael Moore does in films [...] he creates meaning where there is none by cutting things together.\" The pair responded by depicting Moore in an unflattering light before having his character blow himself up in their 2004 film \"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "56758497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56758497", "title": "The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment", "text": "The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment\n\nThe Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) is a non-profit trade association for the video game industry in the United Kingdom (UK). UKIE was originally founded as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), and then later Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), before changing to UKIE in 2010.\n\nThe association was founded in 1989, though then named as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA). Around 2002, the organisation changed its name to Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, reflecting that their primary concerns were video game development on the United Kingdom islands and not mainland Europe. \n\nIn March 2010, members of the ELSPA voted to rename the association as UKIE, reflecting \"the evolving and expanding nature of the industry, which the association exists to represent, and to encompass the new areas of activity that will be undertaken\". The name was fully changed by September 2010.\n\nIn 2011, UKIE proposed a merger with The Independent Game Developers' Association (TIGA), a UK trade association for video game developers, to consolidate the two organisations under one trade body to represent the entire UK games industry. However TIGA's board rejected the proposal. TIGA's stance remained unchanged when a merger proposal was raised once again in 2013.\n\nUKIE's primary goal is to represent the UK's video game industry, and as of December 2017, represented over 395 video game companies worldwide. The association provides strategy and advice for developers and publishers, collects and publishes retail date for UK video game sales, and lobbies and meets with members of the government to help establish policy related to video games.\n\nOne of its more notable activities was to help petition the UK government to use the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system rather than the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Prior to 2012, video games were exempted from being required to be rated by BBFC, unless they contained sexual content, nudity, or violence, though developers and publishers could voluntarily submit their works for review. Works that exceeded certain ratings could not be legally sold to minors. The ELSPA worked with the Video Standards Council (VSC), a government organization that was created to form a code of practice for how to inform consumers about content ratings in games and other video formats. ELSPA had recommended that as an industry standard, any game not needing classification by BBFC to be otherwise classified under the PEGI system, with the VSC helping to determine appropriating ratings.\n\nIn March 2008, Dr. Tanya Byron published a report commissioned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, colloquially called the Byron Review, describing potentially harmful effects of video games on children, a debate over how to better label video games arose, and recommended that parents need to be given more information than the BBFC's rating alone. ELSPA along with other concerned groups believed that the BBFC lacked the clarity needed for video game ratings; current CEO Mike Rawlinson also said that the BBFC ratings were developed for linear content, while PEGI's were better reflective of interactive content such as video games. In 2008, ELSPA started a large push to getting PEGI as the approved system, while in the interim petitioning the BBFC to color-code its ratings labels to approach the same color-coding used by PEGI. The UK Parliament passed the Digital Economy Act 2010 into law, and required by July 2012 to transfer the rating of video games from BBFC to the VSC (outside of games that contain strong pornographic content) and officially adapting the PEGI rating system, along with legal enforcement of selling mature titles to minors. The associate continued to work with the VSC to help establish how the PEGI rating should be displayed on packaging and other materials, and provide awareness to consumers and parents of the new change.\n\nUKIE has campaigned and lobbied for the availability of tax relief for the UK games sector for many years. In 2012, they offered recommendations to the government consultations based on responses and opinions from over 200 video games companies in the country. A tax incentive scheme was scheduled to be included in the March 2010 United Kingdom budget by the outgoing Labour government, however it was not finalised and introduced until 2014 when the European Commission approved the decision. The tax relief scheme allows video games developers and companies to claim back up to 20% of their production costs if the project meets certain conditions, resulting in an estimated £188 million per year for the UK games industry. In 2017, the European Commission granted an extension to the scheme for another six years until 2023.\n"}

{"id": "16807156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16807156", "title": "Toa (Bionicle)", "text": "Toa (Bionicle)\n\nToa are a fictional species of cyborg warriors and the primary protagonists of the Lego toy series Bionicle. Constructible Lego sets depicting Toa were marketed as the main toys of the franchise and released regularly throughout its tenure.\n\nIn the theme's original story (Generation 1), the Toa are heroic beings - usually depicted in teams of six - whose duty is to protect their villager counterparts, the Matoran, from danger and maintain peace throughout their universe. Certain Matoran are destined to become Toa after their dormant Toa Power is activated. Once they have completed their destiny, a Toa can choose to sacrifice their power and transform into Turaga, elders who typically governs Matoran. Each Toa represents an element and has the ability to create, manipulate and absorb it, for which they normally use a set of a tools to channel. Each also wear a Kanohi, a mask that grants them specific powers.\n\nIn the theme's rebooted story (Generation 2), the premise is similar. The Toa are six element-powered heroes who are summoned to the island of Okoto to save the inhabitants from the schemes of Makuta and his minions. Each Toa wears a Great Mask of Power that amplifies their elemental energy and carry tools to channel it.\n\nThe first Bionicle sets created and released were six Toa characters, later known as the Toa Mata. The warrior-like appearance of the toys was believed to be to restricting by some Lego \"company traditionalists\" because it went against Lego's values of \"high-quality products that have an emphasis on free play and encouraging the imagination, and not modern warfare or violence.\" \n\nToa have been around for most of the Bionicle universe's existence, devised by the Great Beings to serve as heroes for the Matoran, and fulfill dangerous tasks that would ensure the workers could continue to fulfill their duties. These tasks could range from rescuing Matoran from Rahi attacks, to engaging in war to defend territories and prevent enslavement, and in some cases ensure the survival of the Great Spirit Mata Nui. The first Toa to come into existence was Helryx, a Toa of Water. She assisted with the construction of Metru Nui. Shortly before Mata Nui was brought to life, the Toa Mata were created, trained and placed in hibernation inside Karda Nui, ready to awaken the Great Spirit should he ever fall into a coma. After Mata Nui became active, destined Matoran were transformed into Toa through the use of Toa Stones. This was the process by which most Toa came into being, with the Toa Mata and Helryx soon becoming exceptions rather than the standard.\n\nOver time, the number of Toa grew greatly, with some giving up their powers to become Turaga, allowing other Matoran to take their place. Most joined teams and fought against Dark Hunters and Rahi; death in such conflicts was a regular occurrence. Those who served with distinction were chosen as bodyguards for the Brotherhood of Makuta, taking the name Toa Hagah. When the team assigned to Makuta Teridax discovered his plan to depose Mata Nui and began a rebellion, they were mutated by his lieutenants and became outcasts, while the other teams were swiftly eliminated or corrupted. Following the Great Cataclysm in which the Brotherhood's evil became common knowledge, Toa became fugitives, and their numbers reduced drastically, with some elements like Iron and Magnetism suffering particularly heavy persecution due to the danger they posed to Makuta.\n\nToa are bound to adhere to the Toa Code, a set of ethics not fully detailed in the story. The most important aspect of this code is not to commit murder; killing is only permitted in self-defense or the defense of an innocent's life. While Toa are almost always heroes, some do not adhere to the code: Helryx does not due to being created before the existence of the code, Lesovikk does not consider himself worthy of the title of Toa, and there are traitors who simply ignore it. Throughout the disastrous takeover by Makuta Teridax, the main antagonist of the Bionicle saga, the Toa continued to operate, albeit in hiding. After Teridax's defeat at the hands of Mata Nui, the Toa migrated to the newly reformed Spherus Magna along with all the other Matoran Universe residents, who could now speak the Agori language.\n\nThere were once as many as 3,000 Toa in existence, but after many centuries of war, murder and Toa Power sacrifice, their numbers diminished to near as 40.\n\nThe chosen guardians of the Great Spirit Mata Nui, destined to awaken him if he would ever fall. They were known as the Toa Mata, six Toa warriors. In Matoran, \"Toa Mata\" literally means \"Spirit heroes\" or \"Heroes of the Spirit.\" Their eventual summoning failed to deliver them to the island of Mata Nui immediately, and left them drifting in the ocean for a millennium. When they finally arrived on the island, they had forgotten all but their names, and had to be informed of their quest by the Turaga. Despite regular disagreement about their next course of action, they learned to work together to achieve their duty, and were able to end the Rahi threat to the Matoran by defeating Makuta temporarily, and later fought the Bohrok and Rahkshi with the same success.\nAfter their transformation in Energized Protodermis, they became the Toa Nuva, with increased strength and improved armor, weaponry, and masks. They then added the suffix \"Nuva\" (meaning \"New\") to their name and masks. Their new powers did not come without risk; their command of the elements was tied to artifacts known as Nuva Symbols. They learned this when the Bohrok-Kal targeted and stole the Symbols, which made their powers desert them. The Toa Nuva would later hide these symbols at locations known only to themselves to prevent such a disaster occurring again.\n\nAfter donning Artakha's Adaptive Armor, they were able to master any environment with its ability to adapt to the current situation. After being teleported to Karda Nui, Tahu, Gali, and Onua dispatched themselves to the Swamp of Secrets, while Lewa, Kopaka and Pohatu remained in the skies and stalactite villages to rescue the local Av-Matoran. After using legendary Keystones to power the Codrex dome, Energy Storms raged throughout Karda Nui, killing every Makuta there (save those who had already fallen in battle). The storms confirmed that they succeeded in their ultimate quest to awaken Mata Nui, unaware that Makuta Teridax had taken over his body. They would lead a resistance movement against their archenemy during the months of his reign. After Spherus Magna's reformation, Tahu's transformation, and Mata Nui's last wish (to find the Great Beings), the team has currently split up to fulfill different missions.\n\nIn their time on Karda Nui, Tahu's team was known as the Mistika, in the Matoran language translating to \"spirits of the mist\", with their armor adapting to a swamp environment with aerial capabilities armed with Nynrah Ghost Blasters. Kopaka's team also received a Matoran term, \"spirits of the sky\", or Phantoka, armed with Midak Skyblasters.\n\nIn the 2015 reboot new versions of the Toa Mata appear, mostly retaining their respective elements (only the \"Air\" element has changed, being replaced with \"Jungle\"). After awakening Ekimu and helping reclaim his Mask of Creation, the Mask Maker forges new armor for the Toa, which gives them the ability to \"Unify\" with Elemental Creatures. With aid from Ekimu, they battle Umarak the Hunter, a minion of Makuta's, who steals the Mask of Control and is transformed into a horrifying beast upon putting it on. Stealing the pieces of the Mask of Ultimate Power, he attempts to bring Makuta back from the Shadow Realm and into the main reality. Ultimately, the Toa fulfill their destiny and manage to reimprison Makuta before returning to the stars from whence they came.\n\nThe Toa of Fire and the leader of the Toa, Tahu initially demanded fierce loyalty to his command, discarding others' own opinions and ignoring them altogether, plunging them into dangerous tasks. Although the team acknowledged him as a leader, they did not respect him. His aggression after arriving on Mata Nui was easily brought to the surface, causing him to almost drive himself to madness with the burdens of his amnesia. He eventually managed to control his anger, gaining the respect of his comrades, even the Toa of Ice, Kopaka, whom he constantly clashed with.\n\nToa Mata Tahu's weapons included a Kanohi Hau, the Mask of Shielding, which could protect him from oncoming attacks, but not ambushes. He also carried a Fire Sword to channel his Fire element. Like his fellow Toa Mata, he collected five other Kanohi and went to Kini-Nui for a Golden Kanohi, containing the powers of the Kanohi Hau, Akaku (X-Ray Vision), Kaukau (Underwater Breathing), Miru (Levitation), Kakama (Speed), and Pakari (Strength). Tahu's appearance in this form is dominantly red with orange legs and arms.\n\nToa Nuva Tahu's weapons included a Kanohi Hau Nuva, the Nuva Mask of Shielding, which allowed him to protect not just himself, but others around him. His Fire Sword transformed into two Magma Swords, which served to channel his Fire element or be put together to make a lavaboard. He collected five Kanohi Nuva to store at Ta-Suva, but were lost when Ta-Koro sank after a Rahkshi attack. Tahu's Nuva appearance slightly unchanged from his Toa Mata form, but bared silver shoulder and chest armor.\n\nOnce he gained Adaptive Armor, his armor shifted in the Swamp of Secrets, gaining a Nynrah Ghost Blaster, and Rotating Blades which could also serve as a shield. He also carried a Nynrah Ghostblaster, which fired energy which could be manipulated mentally.\n\nAfter arriving on Bara Magna, he was devolved into a crude version of his Toa Mata self by the Ignika in order to wield the Golden Armor, as the armor was designed to be wielded by his Mata form, not his Nuva form. As such, his adaptive weapon has taken the form of his old Fire Sword. Soon after, he was clad in Golden Armor and destroyed all the Kraata controlling the Rahkshi, which interrupted Makuta Teridax's concentration and gave Mata Nui his only chance to defeat the tyrant. After Mata Nui's victory, he helped lead the inhabitants of the reformed Spherus Magna, the original \"paradise.\" Having assumed the powers of all the Kraata the armour destroyed, he is now the most powerful Toa in existence.\n\nIn the 2015 rebooted series, Tahu is characterized with a forgetful nature, an undying sense of luck, and a drive to be the best of his team, but he retains his original temper. \nThe Toa of Air, Lewa is often eager to face his Toa responsibilities with carelessness, considering the entire ordeal of a fight as an \"adventure.\" Cheery and light-hearted, he has no bounds. He naturally speaks in the \"treespeak\" dialect native to Le-Koro, and prefers dense jungle areas as his home. After briefly being controlled by both Makuta Teridax (after his Mask was infected by an infected Rahi, then rescued by Onua) and a Bohrok krana, he learned not to take his urgent role so lightly, his will renewed to never again underestimate threats. After Teridax took over the universe, Lewa was transported to Tren Krom's island, who switched bodies with him in order to save their universe. Though their spirits were switched back by Arthaka, he was recently expelled into space along with everyone else in the Core Processor. He is currently on Bota Magna thanks to a dimension-hopping Vezon.\n\nLewa is armed with the Kanohi Miru, Mask of Levitation, which allows him to glide or hover in the air; the Nuva version allowing him to share this ability with others. As a Toa Mata, he was armed with an Axe, later transformed into a pair of Air Katana, which when put under his arms could also help him glide or soar in conjunction with his Kanohi. As a Phantoka, he is armed with an Air Saber, and a Midak Skyblaster. Later on the journey of Karda Nui, he discovers the Axalara T9, and pilots it against Makuta Antroz in the Jetrax T6, though this vehicle was later teleported back to Karda Nui following Mata Nui's reawakening.\n\nIn the 2015 rebooted series, Lewa's element is now \"Jungle\" instead of \"Air.\" He is portrayed as a rebellious, cunning, and sarcastic Toa, whose carelessness and out-of-the-box thinking can lead to trouble with his teammates, but can also help to solve situations. As a Uniter, he is depicted similarly, but his speech is often ungrammatical. \n\nThe Toa of Water, Gali is calm and extraordinarily wise. Seeking to contain Tahu's aggression and protect the unity of the Toa, she takes her role as a Toa with the utmost importance, and is willing to protect any sentient being threatened by the evils of the Brotherhood of Makuta. Considering her peaceful lifestyle, she is an accomplished warrior against those who threaten her allies, like the amphibious rahi that dwell near Ga-Koro. Her concern for Tahu greatens in the 2003 \"Mask of Light\" storyline, where she saves him from dying after being poisoned by the Rahkshi, after which the two came to mutually respect one another.\n\nGali is armed with the Kanohi Kaukau, Mask of Underwater Breathing, which allows her to breathe underwater for a limited time; the Nuva version of this mask allows her to share this ability with others, as well as last longer underwater. As a Toa Mata, she was armed with hooks, which were later transformed into Aqua Axes, which doubled as fins to help her swim faster underwater. She additionally had propellers as a Nuva. As a Mistika, she is armed with a Nynrah Ghost Blaster with laser sighting.\n\nIn the 2015 rebooted series, Gali's personality is similar to the original series, willing to bring help to the less fortunate with her strong sense of justice. She can be kind, mellow and somewhat prone to jokes that rarely deliver, but also aggressive if the situation calls for it. During the final battle against Makuta, Gali was briefly trapped in the Shadow Realm, where she learned of what would happen to herself and her teammates once Makuta was defeated.\n\nThe Toa of Ice and team deputy, Kopaka's modus operandi is to work alone, often despising the Matoran's virtue of unity, but his analytical side persuaded him to go against his will after realizing it was the only way to fight Teridax. His aloof nature constantly brought him into conflict with Tahu, though the two eventually came to respect one another. He has also learned to respect the ideals of unity. Despite Kopaka's prior issues with teamwork and unity, he always protected the innocent with the same devotion of his fellow Toa, especially the inhabitants of Ko-Koro, his home region. He was the first to actually defeat a group of Rahkshi warriors in open combat, protecting Jaller and Takua from being attacked on an ice lake in their journey with the Mask of Light; he did this by shooting Panrahk, Guurahk and Lerahk into a frigid lake with an ice-spike then flash freezing all three under the water.\n\nKopaka is armed with the Kanohi Akaku, Mask of X-Ray Vision, which allows him to see through objects; the Nuva version lets him share this power with others. As a Toa Mata, he was armed with an Ice Sword, which was later transformed into a double-ended Ice Blade, and an Ice Shield; the Ice Blade also had the added benefit of splitting in half to provide Kopaka with a pair of \"Power Skis\" allowing him to slide down the slopes surrounding Ko-Koro with immense speed and agility. As a Phantoka, he is armed with a Midak Skyblaster equipped with a Protosteel Blizzard Blade attached with an aiming laser. He also piloted the Jetrax T-6, which was briefly stolen by Makuta Antroz.\n\nIn the 2015 rebooted series, Kopaka carries an Ice Spear and a Frost Shield, the latter weapon being able to split apart into a pair of skiis. He retains much of his original personality, primarily his cold demeanor, with the added elements of a strict code of conduct, clumsiness, a poor sense of direction, and perfectionism. \n\nThe Toa of Stone, Pohatu is regarded as one of the friendliest Toa. With Gali, he continues to hold the peace between the Toa, but unlike her, is ready to do so in a friendlier way that benefits all of his friends. The only thing he feared was water, on account of the fact he couldn't swim (and was too heavy to float). He also once rescued Takua from a Nui-Jaga that was spreading the Makuta's infection to the Po-Matorans' Kolhii balls.\n\nPohatu is armed with the Kanohi Kakama, Mask of Speed, which lets him move at incredible speeds; the Nuva version lets him share this power with others. As a Toa Mata, he is armed with Feet Additions, durable enough to smash through a boulder, later transformed into an even stronger form, and he gained dual Climbing Claws which he could put together to make a Kodan ball for sport. As a Phantoka, he is armed with a Midak Skyblaster along with Twin Propellers which double as drills. During his journeys in Karda Nui, he discovers the Rockoh T3, and pilots it against Antroz in the Jetrax T6.\n\nIn the 2015 rebooted series, he carries a dagger and a pair of Stormerangs, which can double as jets once attached to his feet. He is now depicted with a brave, resolute, and stubborn personality, but dislikes the dark and scorpions. After gaining his Uniter armor, he refused to work with his Elemental Creature, Ketar, because he was a scorpion. However, he ultimately learned to work with him and even came to respect him.\n\nThe Toa of Earth, Onua is very quiet, speaking only when he has something important to add, making him very well-respected among his comrades. He is intelligent, wise, and strong. He also has excellent night vision but can't see well in bright light. A running gag in the series has Onua saving people at the last moment, including catching Tahu as he was dropped from the sky and Lewa when he was given an infected mask by the Makuta and later infected by a Bohrok Krana (this has been somewhat carried on in the 2015 reboot, in which he saves the other Toa from a deadly arena and moves Pohatu out of the way of incoming rocks).\n\nOnua wears the Kanohi Pakari, Mask of Strength, which increases his already-impressive strength; the Nuva version of the mask lets him share this extra strength with others. As a Toa Mata, his weapons were his hands, which sported large claws. When he became a Toa Nuva, he received dual Quake Breakers which he could put on his feet to travel over rough ground, and as a Mistika, he is armed with a Nynrah ghost blaster and a Multi-Resistant shield.\n\nIn the 2015 rebooted series, Onua carries an Earthquake Hammer, which can split into a pair of Turbo Shovelors. His personality remains very much the same as his old one, with the addition of using underground caves as a place to think and sleep. \nThe history of the Toa Hagah dates back to prior the coming of the Toa Mata during the early stages of Makuta Teridax's plan. The guardians of Makuta Teridax, the Toa Team was made of six Toa chosen specifically in reward of their previous deeds. Given an elite status and unique armor that identified them as Hagah, or Guardians in the Matoran language, and thus were named the Toa Hagah.\n\nThe Toa Hagah served Teridax on Destral, deceived and manipulated to destroy the rampant artificial Bohrok the Brotherhood created, which were initially considered by the Brotherhood as a potential weapon, unknown to the elitist faction. Eventually, this deception did not last long, and they rebelled against Teridax and the Brotherhood when they discovered that they had committed theft and stolen the Kanohi Avohkii. When four of their number were captured by the Brotherhood, Norik and Iruini rescued their comrades, but were mutated by Roodaka into Toa Hagah-Rahkshi mutants named Rahaga. Although they escaped with their lives, they had been given a fate worse than death, and could never be accepted into Matoran society as true heroes.\n\nThe \"Rahaga\", accepting their fate, educated themselves about Rahi to save them from the onslaught of the Visorak legion. They also searched for the mythical Keetongu (which possessed the ability to cure those infected with Hordika venom) to aid in their task. The quest eventually took them to Metru Nui, ruined by the Great Cataclysm and overrun by the Visorak. they chose to hide the Mask of Light in Metru Nui, creating a seal that could only be opened with the fragments of the Makoki stone they had broken and hidden across the city. Arriving to rescue the Toa Metru, sent to their deaths, they informed them of their mutation by Hordika venom into Toa Hordika, educating them in their new forms and the possibility of a cure in Keetongu.\n\nThere, they helped the Toa Hordika in defeating the Visorak and evacuating the Matoran from the city. They were later transformed back into the Toa Hagah by Roodaka when she was coerced by the Toa Nuva. On behalf of the Order of Mata Nui, They searched for Teridax under the Coliseum, but were trapped in an illusion where they only saw the happiness and peace of a world freed from Teridax's reign. They were later snapped out of the illusion by Tren Krom in Lewa's body, and fought in the resistance against Teridax. As of the original series' cancellation, they were preparing to go to the aid of the Toa Mahri, who had been brainwashed by a monstrous enemy.\n\nNorik is the Toa Hagah of Fire, and the leader of the Toa Hagah, and was previously the Rahaga of Fire. In the discovery of the Brotherhood's rebellion, he allowed his team to become overconfident against their foes, paving the way for their capture. He, along with Iruini, was the only one to escape the fate of his teammates, and teamed up with him to rescue them. Now changed to a Turaga-esque wise persona, he became cautious, but still preferred to lead with actions instead of words. He was also very concerned about Vakama's rapid primal transformation, and was the only one to escape capture once more when Vakama joined Roodaka.\n\nAs a Rahaga, Norik was armed with a Rhotuka spinner with the \"Snare\" power, which tangled the limbs of a target. His Rahaga Staff could also be manipulated to distract his reptile Rahi prey (Norik specialized in the capture and study of these Rahi such as Furnace Salamanders) as he prepared to strike.\n\nAs a Toa Hagah, he is armed with the Hagah's standard weapons: a Lava Spear which contained the power of Lava and could sap or increase the heat of its target, and a Rhotuka-Launching Shield with Rhotuka containing \"slow opponent\" power which weakened and slowed its target. He wears the Kanohi Pehkui, Great Mask of Diminishment, although it was in the shape of a standard Noble Kiril and not of a standard Great Pehkui. It was presented to him by enslaved Matoran working under threats from the Brotherhood of Makuta and is shaped like a Noble Kiril to honor a past hero.\n\nGaaki is the Toa Hagah, and formerly Rahaga, of Water. As a Toa of Water, Gaaki can create, control, and absorb water. This also gives her the ability to control water, create storms, and cause floods. These abilities were lost when she was turned into a Rahaga, but she has since regained her powers. Her Rhotuka spinner as a Rahaga was used to capture Rahi by flowing through the depths of water, attaching itself to the target, and floating them up towards the surface. As a Rahaga, she was feisty and always wanted to prove herself as good a Rahaga as the rest. She was also a translator, and her area of expertise was the capture of water Rahi. She always wanted to show the other Rahaga that she was a great expert in the capture of Rahi. She was visibly affected by her mask, as she often felt that the power was using her rather than the other way round.\n\nBomonga is the Toa Hagah of Earth. As a Rahaga, Bomonga was known to hunt in absolute silence and preferred to work alone. His prey were the Rahi \"hiders,\" insect and nocturnal species. Bomonga searched for Rahi under cover of darkness and was known to burrow into the earth to wait for the creatures to come near. From a place of concealment, he would launch silent spinners to incapacitate his targets. Extremely patient and skilled, he would wait for hours to catch one Rahi. As a Toa of Earth, Bomonga can create, control, and absorb earth. This also gives him the ability to control earth, and create earthquakes. He frequently used his Mask of Growth in battle, being proficient enough to bring down a Tahtorak, a Rahi far stronger than he. These abilities were lost when he was turned into a Rahaga, but he has since regained his powers.\n\nKualus is the Toa Hagah of Ice. He can create, control, and absorb ice, giving him the ability to create snowstorms, to travel via ice bridges and more. As a Rahaga, he learned how to speak the language of flying Rahi, passing this knowledge on to Nuju. He could also play his staff like a flute.\n\nThe Toa Hagah of Stone. He is known to be loud and boisterous and believes in plain speaking and taking direct action rather than sneaking around. He truly loves massive beasts and can teach others how to befriend them. As a Rahaga, he used a lasso spinner to capture the beasts and used his staff to leave an invisible mark so he could track them. He has since been turned back into a Toa. Pouks along with the other Toa Hagah defeated the Kanohi Dragon on Xia.\n\nThe Toa Hagah of Air. As a Toa, he believed that the team needed to spend more time on more routine dangers, such as Rahi invasions; the rest of the team did not share this view, and the differences of opinion lead to him quitting the team. This meant he was not present when his comrades were captured, so he was able join forces with Norik again to save them. Upon becoming a Rahaga, Iruini quickly resigned himself to the mutation, and did not accept that Keetongu had the power to cure him. However, he was overjoyed to become a Toa again, adopting an adventurous attitude.\nThe Toa Inika/Toa Mahri were once six Matoran from the island of Mata Nui that journeyed to Voya Nui to save the Toa Nuva, who had disappeared on the island while searching for the Mask of Life. These Matoran were Jaller, Hahli, Kongu, Matoro, Hewkii, and Nuparu. Having braved the nightmare realm of Karzahni on their journey to the island, they were immediately transformed by a bolt of lightning from the Red Star when they came ashore. The unusual nature of their transformation meant they had electricity interlaced with their elemental powers, their faces glowed bizarrely, and their Kanohi were organic.\n\nAs Toa Inika, they battled the Toa Nuva's captors, the evil Piraka, for control over the Mask of Life, while also searching for the Toa Nuva. They teamed up with the Voya Nui Resistance Team, led by Garan and consisting of Balta, Dalu, Kazi, Piruk, and Velika, as well as one the Mask's guardians, Order of Mata Nui operative Axonn. They eventually battled against Vezon and Fenrakk/Kardas, and Kongu used his Mask of Telepathy to read the Mask's mind, learning that the Mask wanted Matoro as its new guardian. After Jaller froze Vezon and Kardas, Matoro took the Mask off of Vezon. To his own surprise, it came off right when he touched it, but before long the Mask flew into the sea. Axonn opened a secret tunnel so the Toa Inika could go down into the Pit and find the mask, while on the surface, the Toa Nuva were rescued by the Voya Nui resistance team.\n\nUpon emerging out into the dark water of Pit, a blast of energy from the Mask of Life transformed them again, changing their Kanohi and removing their lightning powers. They were branded as allies of the Barraki by the Mahri Nui Matoran, and most were captured by the Barraki themselves while Matoro was imprisoned by Hydraxon, but later freed by Teridax, who had taken control over a Maxilos robot. The Toa Mahri later escaped with the help of a Hahnah Crab and stole some Cordak Blasters from the Barraki. They were named the protectors of Mahri Nui by Defilak, the city's leader. They battled the Barraki and Hydraxon (who was working against both sides), for the Mask of Life, but temporarily abandoned this objective when they learned that they had destroy the Cord connecting Voya Nui to Mahri Nui for Mata Nui to live. With Axonn's help, they evacuated the Matoran of Mahri Nui and Voya Nui into the tunnels above the Cord, where they would be safe from the destruction that would follow. Having saved the Matoran from another attack by the Piraka, they returned to the Pit destroyed the Cord and wrested the Mask of Life from their enemies. As Mahri Nui was wiped out by the falling island, the Mahri rushed to the hole where the island would fall, only for the Mask of Life to go dark, as the Great Spirit Mata Nui finally died. Matoro, however refused to give up, and his allies agreed to stand and fight against the approaching armies of the Barraki to buy Matoro time to revive Mata Nui. Matoro reached the hole just before Voya Nui fell back into place, and fell through a torrent of water to Karda Nui, the core of the Matoran Universe while the others held off the Barraki. As Jaller prepared to unleash a Nova Blast in last ditch effort to obliterate the Barraki, Matoro gave his life to don the Ignika and save Mata Nui's life, and sent his fellow Toa back to Metru Nui. After Jaller powered down his energy, they learned of Matoro's fate from Turaga Vakama. They became the protectors of Metru Nui in the absence of the Toa Nuva (they had left Voya Nui to fulfill their own destiny of awakening Mata Nui, now possible thanks to Matoro's sacrifice).\n\nDuring Teridax's reign the Toa Mahri were chosen to perform an espionage mission on the island Zakaz, home of the Skakdi, who created a powerful gold-skinned fusion. The Mahri were hypnotized by the creature and relished following the fusion's command. On Spherus Magna, Kopaka learned of this, and Gaaki gathered her team to rescue the Mahri. The fusion's hold over the team was disrupted when a being called \"Annona\" attacked the Skakdi, freeing them from its control.\n\nJaller has a strong sense of justice and responsibility, and is known for his immense courage. He is willing to do whatever it takes to do his duty.\n\nAs leader of a Toa team, Jaller tries to be a more cautious leader of Toa compared to other Toa of Fire such as Tahu or Vakama. He tries hard to heed the opinions of his teammates as well, but nevertheless experienced annoyance when Matoro began taking charge of the team in the Pit, though the two eventually resolved their differences.\n\nAs a Matoran, Jaller was captain of the Ta-Koro (and later Ta-Metru) Guard, and played defense for the Ta-Koro Kolhii Team. He was best friends with Takua, who later became Toa Takanuva, and their friendship continues even as Toa. When Jaller was a Matoran and Takua accidentally melted the totem turning into the Mask of Light, Jaller also carried a backpack for carrying Kanohi masks like the one they discovered. He originally wore a powerless Komau (Mask of Mind Control) before it broke inside a Matoran sphere. Turaga Vakama replaced it with a Noble Hau originally worn by Turaga Lhikan.\n\nAs a Toa Inika, Jaller wore the Kanohi Calix, the Mask of Fate, which allows him to perform at his physical peak, pulling off feats others would deem impossible. He carried two Energized Flame Swords and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.\n\nAs a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Arthron, which gives him echolocation. He carries a Power Sword and a Cordak Blaster as his main tools. During his time in Mahri Nui, Jaller mounted his blaster on the back of a Hahnah Crab, which remained in the Pit after Jaller was teleported back to Metru Nui. \n\nAs a Matoran on Mata Nui, Hahli spent most of her time tending to her many village chores like fish-catching and net-mending, without ambition to travel or go on adventures. Her shyness kept her from speaking up, despite being full of ideas, and her fellow Ga-Matoran would often forget or overlook her. Nevertheless, Nokama could see true potential in her, selecting her to play for Ga-Koro in the Kolhii Tournament. She wore a Kaukau as her Kanohi Mask. She also came to share an affectionate friendship with Jaller following the Bohrok crisis.\n\nWhen she became a Toa, Hahli was initially nervous about her new role, and the power she possessed. She eventually warmed up to it, however, and became more confident to the point of choosing to go on solo missions without fear. She soon became her team's strongest member during the underwater Mahri quest.\n\nAs a Toa Inika, she wore the Kanohi Elda, Mask of Detection, which allowed her to sense the presence of other beings and the Mask of Life. She carried a Laser Harpoon and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.\n\nAs a Toa Mahri, she wears the Kanohi Faxon, Mask of Kindred, which allows her to copy the abilities of other Rahi that shares her current environment. She carries a set of Protosteel Talons and a Cordak Blaster. She also gained a pair of fins on her back to help her swim faster.\n\nHewkii is known for his athletic ability on both Metru Nui and Mata Nui, winning many Copper Masks as a Matoran. These talents helped develop his combat skills and reflexes. He also possessed keen senses, allowing him to pinpoint weak spots. He wore a Kakama as his Kanohi Mask.\n\nWhen he became a Toa Inika, he was initially uncomfortable with his new role, desiring to find the Ignika quickly so that he could return to his old friends and his old life. However, he eventually grew accustomed to being a Toa. An athlete by nature, he also disliked the advantage afforded to him by his Mask of Power, and did not use it in combat unless necessary.\n\nAs a Toa Inika, he wore the Kanohi Sanok, Mask of Accuracy, which, as the title suggests, increased his accuracy in hitting a target. He carried a Laser Axe with a Climbing Chain attached to it and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.\n\nAs a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Garai, Mask of Gravity, which increases or decreases the gravity of a target. He carried a Cordak Blaster mounted on his wrist, an Aqua Warblade, and a pair of Electrifying Chains. One of the chains was broken during the underwater Mahri quest, but was later repaired.\n\nNuparu is a master engineer, and feels at ease when surrounded by machinery he can tinker with, continuing this passion even as a Toa. He also has a great passion for learning, enjoying being a Toa, as it meant the ability and opportunity to explore new places and study new things, like Rahi. While in Mahri Nui, he continued his duties, but was upset that he was in the middle of a crisis, meaning he couldn't take the time to learn all there is to learn.\n\nAs a Matoran, he wore a Pakari as his Kanohi Mask and was known for creating the Boxor robots to help repel the Bohrok.\n\nAs a Toa Inika, he wore the Kanohi Kadin, Mask of Flight, which allowed him to fly, an ironic twist for a Toa of Earth. He carried a Laser Drill and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher mounted on his right shoulder. His hands became a pair of sharp claws for digging.\n\nAs a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Volitak, Mask of Stealth, which allows him to become completely silent and mostly transparent. He carries a Cordak Blaster, a Razor-Edged Protosteel Shield, and an Aqua Blaster Blade, the latter of which was not featured in the set.\n\nWhile a Matoran, Kongu was known to be very serious during times of danger, being the military leader of the Gukko Force. Over time, however, Lewa was known to influence Kongu, teaching him to be more laid back and gain enjoyment out of his missions. Once becoming a Toa, Kongu began following that advice, and is now generally fun-loving and full of wit, having a joke or comment ready at the right time. Kongu gets along well with his fellow Toa, especially with Nuparu. The Toa of Air at first complained that Nuparu, being a Toa of Earth, shouldn’t have received the Kadin, Mask of Flight. But he later cheerfully offered to help his friend learn to fly, saying that Nuparu might break the Mask of Flight as an excuse to help him.\n\nAs a Toa Inika, Kongu suffered an unusual problem with his own mask; he could not turn the Kanohi Suletu off, and was thus constantly forced to listen to the thoughts of his teammates, something that was naturally very distracting. His problems with Kanohi continued as a Toa Mahri when the Kanohi Zaath was bestowed upon him, as he had no control over the Rahi once he had summoned them, and the undersea monsters that he did call to his aid invariably made the situation worse.\n\nAs a Toa Inika, he wore the Kanohi Suletu, Mask of Telepathy, which, as mentioned above, allowed him to read other people's minds. He carried a Laser Crossbow and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher.\n\nAs a Toa Mahri, he wears the Kanohi Zatth, Mask of Summoning, which, as mentioned above, allows him to summon Rahi to his aid. He originally carried a Cordak Blaster and an unidentified Toa tool, which he quickly replaced with a second Cordak Blaster out of personal preference. \n\nWhile a Matoran, Matoro had served as Turaga Nuju's translator and trusted aide, as he could understand Nuju's strange bird calls. When translating for Nuju, he would strike a narrator's pose, with his legs apart, head back and use a deep and booming voice to relay Nuju's wisdom. Unlike most other Ko-Matoran, Matoro was not asocial, but instead was very friendly towards others. When he became a Toa, Matoro felt that his job as a translator had not prepared him for being a Toa nearly as much as the other Toa Inika, most of whom had backgrounds as athletes or warriors. Despite his fear, he did his best to fulfill his new duties.\n\nConstantly burdened with the amount of secrets he was intended to keep, Matoro struggled with being unable to tell his friends, though he ultimately knew that revealing anything would endanger them, something he was not willing to do. His secrecy led some of the other Toa, such as Hahli and Jaller, to think that Matoro refused to share secrets with them on purpose, even though they were friends.\n\nDuring his time as a Toa, and the experiences in searching for the mask, Matoro slowly began taking charge, filling the role of the leader. Jaller, who naturally emerged as the leader, felt conflicted about Matoro's attitude, though the two amicably resolved their differences. Meanwhile, Matoro struggled with his own challenges; the power of his Kanohi Tryna appalled him, and he tried to avoid using it where possible. The mask was in fact bestowed upon him by the Ignika to test his character. Matoro also discovered Makuta Teridax had not merely survived his supposed death, but possessed a robotic prison guard called Maxilos. In this form, the tyrant coerced Matoro into cooperating with his plans, threatening to kill the other Toa Mahri if he did not.\n\nAs a Toa Inika, Matoro wore the Kanohi Iden, Mask of Spirit, which allowed his spirit to physically leave his body. He carried an Energized Ice Sword and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher as his Toa tools. As a Toa Mahri, he wore the Kanohi Tryna, Mask of Reanimation, which allowed him to give life to and control dead beings. He carried a Twin Cutter and a Cordak Blaster, transformed from his previous weapons.\n\nAs a destined bearer and user of the Kanohi Ignika, Matoro was not cursed by the mask, and was also one of the only ones that could access its power. He ended up sacrificing his life so that Mata Nui could be resurrected and that his teammates could breathe air again (he teleported them back to Metru Nui).\n\nTakanuva was originally an Av-Matoran named Takua, who was hidden on Metru Nui during the Time Slip to ensure that a Toa of Light would one day come into being to counter the Makuta. At some point his Mask was damaged, and was replaced with a Kanohi Pakari that never fit properly, and turned blue due to his lack of control over his disguise as a Ta-Matoran. He was known in Metru Nui for his tendency to wander off and not fulfill his duties; Matoran joked that a squad of Vahki were assigned to keep an eye on him.\n\nTakua continued to show this lack of interest in his work after being brought to Mata Nui, and was eventually banished by Turaga Vakama during the Dark Time. Takua began wandering across the island, and undertook errands to aid the Turaga of all the villages. On the way, he discovered the Toa stones hidden by the Toa Metru 1,000 years before, and with the Turaga's blessing, assembled them at the Kini Nui in the middle of the island. Together, the stones activated the beacon that finally summoned the Toa Mata to Mata Nui, although the blast threw him to the beach of Ta-Wahi and left him with amnesia. Once again he set off across the island on missions for the Turaga, who named him Chronicler for his heroics. Finally, the Turaga gave him an important task: assemble a small group of Matoran to guard the Kini-Nui temple from Rahi attack, while the Toa confronted Makuta below. At the Turaga's request, Takua chose Matoran from each village who were either the most skilled in their crafts or loners like himself. Takua's Matoran, who named themselves the Chronicler's Company, waged a noble defence of the Kini-Nui, while Takua had visions of the struggle underground through a mental link with Toa Gali. As the battle seemed impossible, reinforcments from the other villages appeared to turn the tide. Takua then journeyed to the Great Mine of Onu-Koro at Whenua's behest, where he discovered another path to Makuta's lair. Thus, Takua witnessed the Toa's battle with the Makuta, and the awakening of the Bohrok. Using an ancient portal, Takua barely escaped with his life.\n\nNow accepted by the Matoran, Takua documented the war with the Bohrok, and journeyed with Nuparu to assist the villages most at risk. Following the defeat of the Bohrok-Kal, Takua discovered the Kanohi Avohkii, Mask of Light, and once again set off across the island, this time accompanied by his best friend Jaller, in the hope they could locate the seventh Toa. They were chased for much of their journey by the Rahkshi, culminating in a final stand at the Kini-Nui with the Toa Nuva. Jaller was killed in the attack, prompting Takua to realize he was in fact the seventh Toa. He donned the Avohkii and became the first Toa of Light. After renaming himself Takanuva (meaning Takua Nuva, as he considered himself a Toa Nuva, although he was not), he fought and temporarily defeated Makuta Teridax, allowing the Matoran to return to Metru Nui after 1,000 years.\n\nTakanuva would guard Metru Nui in the Toa Nuva's absence, and fought Frostelus to defend the city. He later intercepted a dark presence in his mind and went after the culprit, the Dark Hunter codenamed \"Dweller\". As he did, Makuta Icarax dropped a Shadow Leech upon him, (meant to bite Ahkmou and become a Shadow Toa) but was able to incinerate the leech with concentrated light, and fell unconscious from the light drain. His gold colored armor turned to a shining iron gray color, to symbolize the powers of light and shadow now surging through his right and left hands. He then met with Helryx, Krakua, and Brutaka, who showed him the origins of the Toa Nuva through a set of visions, before sending him to Karda Nui. Brutaka opened a portal, but due to the damaged state of his Kanohi Olmak, led to several dimensional journeys, one resulting in him receiving a powdered Makuta virus from a heroic Krika, giving him the power of flight, before arriving in Karda Nui. There, he found the Toa Nuva in the swamps. Takanuva grew to a height of ten feet as a result of arriving in an area with such strong light.\n\nTakanuva saw the Makuta Krika near Toa Gali Nuva, not knowing that Krika was trying to help her. He provided the Toa Nuva with vital information and fought against the Makuta. He witnessed Krika's death, having his density completely eradicated into microscopic particles, because he tried to warn them all of Teridax's betrayal. Enraged by this, he fought ferociously against the remaining Makuta. Vican, a mutated Le-Matoran, (a Shadow Matoran just minutes before) sought out Takanuva, and told him of the Klakk. The Klakk had the power to screech and shatter the barrier that prevented light from returning to Shadow beings. He then restored all Shadow Matoran to Av-Matoran, and lastly himself, turning him gold again. Takanuva then took the Matoran (Still mutated into bat-like creatures) to another location. He assisted the Toa Nuva in awaking Mata Nui, and left for Metru Nui. He, along with the other Toa have formed a revolt against Teridax when he took over the universe.\n\nWhen the Makuta landed on Bara Magna, Takanuva exited the giant robot onto the new planet, altering his colors in the process to not draw attention to himself. He assisted Tahu in retrieving the Golden Armor, killing two Heat Vision Rahkshi in the process. He has since returned his armor to Gold and White.\n\nKrakua is a Toa of Sonics working for the Order of Mata Nui.\n\nLike all De-Matoran, Krakua had very acute hearing. However, despite this, he had a habit of humming to himself, which caused many of his fellow De-Matoran to avoid him.\n\nAs a Toa of Sonics, Krakua is able to create, control and absorb sound. This allows him to create sound waves or concentrated beams of sound, use sonic waves to disrupt a structure's integrity, and absorb all of the sound in an area to create a field of silence. As with other Order operatives, his mind is shielded from mental assaults.\n\nHe carries a Sonic Vibration Sword and wears a Suletu, which is shaped like a Great Hau.\n\nKrakua is currently the only Toa of Sonics still alive.\nHelryx was the first Toa ever to be created and is the leader of the Order of Mata Nui.\n\nDespite being a Toa of Water, Helryx is extremely fierce, somewhat impatient, and quick to anger. She always strives to achieve her vision of the greater good, no matter the decisions and choices she has to make to get it.\n\nShe carries a spiked mace and a shield for melee combat and wears the Kanohi Mask of Psychometry, which allows her to see into a being's past just by touching him. Her mind is also shielded from outside mental presences, as is mandatory with Order training.\n\nDue to the nature of her role in the Order, Helryx excluded herself from the Toa Code, which stipulates that Toa cannot kill their opponents. \nLesovikk is a guilt-ridden Toa of Air and the leader of the first Toa Team.\n\nDue to his hesitation, which led to his team's death, Lesovikk blames himself for causing their deaths, and considers himself unworthy to be a Toa. His self-perceived failure to live up to the standards of the Toa exempts him from the code, and he is willing to kill his opponents.\n\nLesovikk carries an Air Sword and a Cordak Blaster as his main Toa tools. He wears a Faxon as his Kanohi mask.\n\nAfter Lesovikk arrived on Spherus Magna, he was suspected with killing Karzahni, as his sword was found near his body, but a message in the stars caused Kopaka to suspect otherwise.\nAll Toa have elemental powers, which they can use to manipulate existing elements or create new substance, as well as physical traits they possessed as Matoran. These elemental powers recharge naturally over time - the amount the energy exerted will determine how long it takes to return to full strength. They also have the mental discipline to use Great and Noble Kanohi Masks (only the Toa Nuva can use Kanohi Nuva). An ability all Toa share is the ability to perform Nova Blasts in which they release all their elemental energies at once. This has only ever been seen once in the story, when Gali of the Toa Nuva leveled the realm of Karzahni with a wall of water in a last-ditch attempt to defeat Makuta Icarax; it took all her concentration to save the other Toa from drowning. Jaller planned to unleash a Nova Blast in the Pit to buy Matoro time from the armies of the Barraki, and would almost certainly have killed everyone in the immediate area by doing so. Six Toa can combine their elemental powers to create a Protodermis Seal. Any six Toa can do this as long as two of the Toa are not Light and Shadow, as the two are cancelled out. This ability has only been seen being done by teams consisting of a Fire, Ice, Water, Air, Stone, and Earth. Toa are also able to use their Toa Power to heal certain things and create Toa Stones, which contain some of their own Toa Power. When a Toa has united with others, completed his or her duty, and achieved his or her destiny, he or she can sacrifice all of his or her Toa Power, and he or she becomes a Turaga. They can also choose to give up their Toa Power before their destiny is complete, and will become Turaga upon fulfilling that destiny.\n\nIn 2001, Lego faced legal action by Māori activists from New Zealand for trademarking Māori words used in naming the Bionicle product range for use in the Matoran language, including the names of some Toa, and even the word \"Toa\" itself. Despite this, many of the names of the Toa from Māori language, were still kept, though Lego was careful in naming characters from then on. In the 2015 relaunch, the new versions of the original six Toa are called \"Master\" and \"Uniters\" on their packaging, but still referred to as Toa in-universe.\n"}

{"id": "42542965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42542965", "title": "Union Films", "text": "Union Films\n\nUnion Films was a film production company located in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia). Established by ethnic Chinese businessmen Ang Hock Liem and Tjoa Ma Tjoen in 1940, it produced seven black-and-white films before it was dissolved in 1942; all are thought to be lost. The company's films were directed by four men, mostly ethnic Chinese, and launched the careers of actors such as Rendra Karno and Djoewariah.\n\nEstablished during the revival of the Indies film industry, Union released its first film, \"Kedok Ketawa\", in July 1940. This was followed by a series of films penned by Saeroen which were increasingly oriented towards the Indies' growing intelligentsia and attempted to distance themselves from the theatrical conventions which were common in the contemporary film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism. Following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s.\n\nFollowing the commercial successes of \"Terang Boelan\" (\"Full Moon\"; 1937), \"Fatima\" (1938), and \"Alang-Alang\" (\"Grass\"; 1939), the film industry of the Dutch East Indies – which had been severely weakened by the Great Depression – was revived. Film production increased and, in 1940, four new production houses were opened, including Union Films. The company was funded by ethnic Chinese businessman Ang Hock Liem, who is credited as producer for the majority of the company's releases; daily operations, however, were handled by Tjoa Ma Tjoen. Union was headquartered in Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta), and, according to a press release, established to \"improve the quality of Indonesian art\".\nThe fledgling Union's first film, \"Kedok Ketawa\", was released in July 1940. Following a young couple who face off against criminals with the help of a masked bandit, this film was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and Basoeki Resobowo. It received positive reviews; the journalist Saeroen wrote in \"Pemandangan\" that the film's quality was comparable to imported Hollywood productions, and a review in \"Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad\" praised the cinematography. Following these positive reviews, Union hired Saeroen – who had previously written \"Terang Boelan\" and several works for Tan's Film – as a screenwriter. He made his debut for the company with \"Harta Berdarah\", directed by new hires R Hu and Rd Ariffien, following Jo An Djan's departure for Populair's Film. The film, in which a young man convinces a miserly hajji to be more charitable, was released in October 1940 and starred the singer Soelastri and martial artist Zonder.\n\nUnion released their third production, \"Bajar dengan Djiwa\", by February 1941. Directed by R Hu, this film – a drama in which a young woman is sold to a loan shark in order to pay her father's debt – marked the film debut of Djoewariah; she later became Union's leading lady. Ariffien, meanwhile, was tasked with directing \"Asmara Moerni\", based on a script by Saeroen. Attempting to reach the educated audiences by casting a young doctor, Adnan Kapau Gani, opposite Djoewariah, this romance told of a young man who is ultimately able to marry his former maid after she receives an education. Released in April, the film received mixed reviews: one, in the \"Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad\", found the film \"fascinating\", while another for the same paper considered the film dependent on the stage traditions which its advertisements had denounced.\n\nIn July 1941 Union released \"Wanita dan Satria\", a Djoewariah vehicle which follows a well-born womaniser who abuses his social status to gain women's trust before ultimately getting his comeuppance. In advertising \"Wanita dan Satria\", the company again emphasised the non-theatrical background of the film's cast, which also included Moesa, Djoewita and Hidajat. The film received positive reviews; one, from the \"Soerabaijasch Handelsblad\", wrote that \"Wanita dan Satria\" \"gives a clear picture of the precarious position of Indonesian women and motivates the desire for a firmer outline of her rights in the Moslem society.\" This was the company's last film to be directed by Ariffien or written by Saeroen; both men migrated to rival company Star Film soon afterwards.\nHu remained with Union and directed the company's next production, \"Soeara Berbisa\", with \"peranakan\" sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete for the love of a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, \"Mega Mendoeng\", was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for \"Soeara Berbisa\" had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942. In producing both films, Union emphasised realism and targeted educated audiences.\n\nBy the end of 1941, the government of the Dutch East Indies were concerned that Empire of Japan could invade the colony. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of the film magazine \"Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film\" reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Union, though already beginning production of a film set in the Majapahit era titled \"Damar Woelan\", was forced to stop filming. When the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, Union was closed, never to reopen.\n\nAside from Ariffien, who continued directing into the 1960s, none of Union's directors or producers returned to the film industry after the conclusion of the Japanese occupation in 1945. Several actors, however, continued their careers. Djoewariah, for instance, made her first film after leaving Union, \"Sehidup Semati\" (\"One Life, One Death\"), in 1949, and continued acting until the mid-1950s. The career of Soekarno, meanwhile, lasted through the 1970s; he was mostly credited as Rendra Karno after changing his name in the 1950s. Others had careers behind the screen; \"Kedok Ketawa\" star Basoeki Resobowo, for instance, became art director on films such as \"Darah dan Doa\" (\"The Long March\"; 1950).\n\nIn a period of two years, Union released seven films; all were feature length, made in black-and-white, and received wide releases in the Dutch East Indies. Several were screened in nearby Singapore, including \"Bajar dengan Djiwa\" and \"Asmara Moerni\". Though its films were screened at least into the 1940s, the company's output is likely lost.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7221178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7221178", "title": "Walk the Plank (theatre company)", "text": "Walk the Plank (theatre company)\n\nWalk the Plank are a British group of artists, theatre makers, pyrotechnicians and event engineers who specialise in outdoor arts/theatre, touring performance and pyrotechnics. \n\nTheir shows are on land and on water and often mix performance, music, lighting, visual images, fire, and fireworks. The company was established by John Wassell and Liz Pugh in 1991, who identified a niche market for a touring theatre ship, and other aquatic shows on the waterways. The company's work began when the pair purchased a touring theatre ship, the MV \"Fitzcarraldo\". The company's work has now extended far beyond the ship and they work on delivering shows and events, varying in scale from intimate to epic. Walk the Plank have produced work for Toronto’s Wintercity Festival, Singapore Festival, Euro 2004, Tall Ships 2005, Centerparcs, Sir Paul McCartney, the Commonwealth Games, as well as multiple city and local councils. Perhaps their most well known credit are the opening and closing ceremonies for Liverpool's Capital of Culture celebrations.\n\nTheir administrative base is in Salford, Greater Manchester and they have workshop facilities in Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall.\n\nTheir work often involves community engagement and they are known for scheduling and leading participation elements which fit the context of the event they are organising.\n\nThe company's Senior Management Team (including co-founders John Wassell and Liz Pugh and Project Directors Andy Stratford and Billie Klinger) are trusted advisers in the areas of outdoor arts and cultural events.\n\nThe \"Fitzcarraldo\" was built in 1971 in Sandnessjøen, Norway for TFDS as the MV Bjarkøj. She was 20 years a general cargo and passenger ferry working the islands around Tromsø in north Norway.\n\nIn December 1991 Walk the Plank purchased the ship, renaming it the \"Fitzcarraldo\". The ship was registered British in 1992, the same year of its first British national tour. Its hold was adapted as a theatre. \n\nEach summer, from 1992 to 2006 the \"Fitzcarraldo\" set sail from the Albert Dock, Liverpool and toured ports and harbours in Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales. Audiences of up to 125 people can sit the aft deck to watch as the hatches rise and the cargo holds are craned open.\n\nIn 2000, 's co-production (with Company) of \"Moby Dick\" won Best Fringe Production at the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards. Jim Burke also won the Best New Play award for this adaptation. \n\nIn 2003 the ship went on a national tour to 19 ports with a stage adaption of Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, to positive reviews. At first the audience sits on the quayside, and the \"Fitzcarraldo\" represents the \"Abraham Lincoln\"; later they sit in the \"Fitzcarraldo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hold, which represents the inside of the \"Nautilus\", or occasionally the seabed.\n\nCurrently, due to mechanical deterioration to some of its driving components the ship resides in the Canning Dock, which is part of Liverpool's Albert Dock complex, and is used as a static venue for many events including parties, cabaret evenings, live music, and drama.\n\nWalk the Plank are currently making plans to sell the Fitzcarraldo, in order to focus on delivering large scale outdoor events, creating touring performance and continue to provide pyrotechnics elements and firework displays to both public sector and private corporate organisations.\n\nWTP Pyrotechnics is a limited company who donate all their profits to Walk the Plank. This is a major source of income for Walk the Plank other than arts grants and donations. WTP Pyrotechnics creates fireshows, firework displays, site-specific work, and outdoor spectacles – producing work in landlocked and waterside locations. They have created shows on canals and rivers, in harbours and parks and town centres in the UK and abroad.\n\nPast projects include site-specific events, fireshows and aquatic spectacle, working with pyrotechnics, machines, music, large images, and mobile structures, performance, and fire; usually, one-off specially-commissioned pieces created for a particular site or occasion. The work is often on, near, or by water, but they work inland also.\n\n"}
