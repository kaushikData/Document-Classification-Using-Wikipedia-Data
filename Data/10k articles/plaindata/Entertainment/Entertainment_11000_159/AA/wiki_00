{"id": "7296287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7296287", "title": "AWA Tower", "text": "AWA Tower\n\nThe AWA Tower is an heritage-listed office and communications complex in Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia built for Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited. The AWA Tower consists of a radio transmission tower atop a 15-storey building. It is located in the Sydney central business district at 45-47 York Street, close to Wynyard Park and Wynyard railway station. It was designed by Robertson, Marks and McCredie in association with DT Morrow and Gordon and built from 1937 to 1939 by William Hughes and Co. Pty Ltd. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nThe AWA Tower was designed by architects Morrow and Gordon from 1937–1939 and became one of the most notable commercial buildings of Sydney. It brought geometric Art Deco design and modernism to the city skyline with polished trachyte facing at ground level intending to signal a progressive and go-ahead firm. The 1939 steel-framed brick building was designed by Robertson, Marks and McCredie. The tower was modelled on Berlin's Funkturm Tower, built a few years earlier, and both took inspiration from the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The communications tower was an integral part of the structure and remained the tallest structure in Sydney (other than the Sydney Harbour Bridge) until the 1960s. The tower is high atop a high building. The tower was , and at the point of the building there was a viewing platform.\n\nThe building is decorated with appropriate symbols of communication, including a winged Pegasus, said to be chosen by Sir Ernest Fisk, the pioneer of wireless technology and a founding director of AWA. For many years, the tower wore the sign \"Beam Wireless\", a service providing radio contact to commercial shipping on the England–Australia route introduced in 1927.\n\nAmalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited was the first to manufacture televisions in Australia, and in the 1960s large AWA neon logos were attached to the building to symbolise this fact. In later years, the company expanded into a wide range of electronic products, including gaming systems. In 2000, when the company folded, the building was sold to Jupiter's Casino Group. It is covered by a conservation order, and remains known as the AWA building, although the big red AWA signs have been removed. The tower, which was demolished and rebuilt in 1994, remains illuminated at night, but the viewing platform has long been gone.\n\nThe tower (featuring the AWA logo) features in the science fiction film \"The Matrix\"; when Neo and Trinity rescue Morpheus from the agents, the AWA Tower can be seen below as they make their escape by helicopter.\n\nThe building is comprised of 12 office floors, a ground floor and basement. The frontage along York Street is and along York Lane. The building is surmounted by a steel tower which gives the building an overall height of above street level. The building is steel framed and faced in brick with polished trachyte facing at the ground floor.\n\nThe building is vertically modelled to give a skyscraper appearance. A Pegasus is depicted in relief sculpture on a plain brick parapet at the top of the building. Pegasus, a winged horse, was chosen by Sir Ernest Fisk as a suitable association with the work of Australia's great wireless undertaking. The building retains the original Fisk system of double glazed windows. The communications tower was designed as an integral part of the building and its supports are part of the structure of the building.\n\nThe York Street Entry Foyer and Lift Lobby is faced with Wombeyan Russet marble with simple Art Deco streamlined detail and the letter AWA over the entrance. The former Vestibule (main ground floor) interior retains its silver ash timber panelling. Above the panelling there is a series of symbolic plaster relief's executed by Otto Steen. Three relief's comprise three \"themes\". In each corner are figures representing the four ancient elements - earth, water, fire and air. Over the entrance surrounding an AWA symbol are the signs of the zodiac. A series of small relief's along the north and south walls represent various nations, symbolising the unification of the world throughout radio. The former Entrance Lobby interior retains a map of the world incised into the polished trachyte wall above the auditorium doors.\n\nOther significant interiors include the fifth floor Boardroom, ancillary offices and executive bathroom\n\nAs at 21 November 2002, physical condition is excellent. Archaeological potential is low.\n\n\nAs at 28 August 2017, AWA Building and Tower is of significance for its important associations with radio and communication technology. It is a simple vertically emphasised skyscraper which represents the epitome of the 1930s desire to integrate architecture with technology. The tower, for a time was the tallest structure in Sydney, and is an integral part of the building and still has a landmark quality.\n\nAWA Tower was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nAWA Building and Tower is of historical significance because for over twenty years it was the tallest structure in Sydney and the building and tower still are an important landmark today.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nAWA Building and Tower is aesthetically significant because it is a simple vertical \"emphasised\" skyscraper which represents the epitome of the 1930's desire to integrate architecture with technology. It is part of a significant group of Art Deco office buildings located along York Street between Margaret and King Street.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nAWA Building and Tower is socially significant because of its association with the development of the radios and communications technology and industry.\n\n\n\n"}

The film follows the lives of two Afghan bodybuilding champions, Hamidullah Shirzai and Noorulhoda Shirzad, who are part of the national team training for the 2004 Mr. Asia competition in Bahrain. Although the men enjoy celebrity status in their country, their training is hampered by a lack of financial support, problems in gaining access to the bodybuilding supplements and professional guidance that would improve their competitive performances, and the ongoing military conflict across Afghanistan. Hamid also has the added burden of being nagged by his father to settle down and marry and by the abrupt withdrawal of support by a gym owner who once encouraged his progress. The Afghan national team arrives in Bahrain for the Mr. Asia event, but the more flamboyant competitors from other countries overshadow them.\n\n\"Afghan Muscles\" is the first feature-length film directed by Danish filmmaker Andreas Møl Dalsgaard (born 1980), who received a BA in social anthropology from the University of Aarhus and became a student director at the National Film School of Denmark in 2005. Dalsgaard became interested in the subject during a 2003 visit to Kabul, when he noticed large posters of scantily clad male bodybuilders around the Afghan capital. Dalsgaard spent three years following a group of bodybuilders for the film, which he later described as “a culture of young men seeking modernity in their very own way, trying to be successful and gain a name and fame in the cultural chaos of postwar Kabul.”\n\nDuring a presentation of \"Afghan Muscles\" at the 2007 AFI Fest, Dalsgaard acknowledged that his film intentionally avoided highlighting any involvement by Afghan women in bodybuilding, either as athletes or audience members. \"It's men looking at men,\" he stated. \n\n\"Afghan Muscles\" shared the 2007 AFI Fest Grand Jury Prize for Documentary with \"Operation Filmmaker,\" directed by Nina Davenport. The film also played in festivals in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. \"Afghan Muscles\" has been released in the U.S. on DVD by Cinema Guild.\n\n"}

The game plays as an action RPG, with battles initiated once the player moves the playable character into an enemy character, sending involved characters into a separate battle screen.\n\nThe game takes place in Akihabara and stars protagonist and NEET Asahi Tachibana, living a regular life after deciding to drop out of college. Transfer student, Saki Hoshino, recently moved to the area and runs into Asahi. Other main characters in include Japanese idol Riyu Momose, the very young looking Yamato Hongo. The game involves the party getting stuck in a world of delusions, trapped in a repeating day long cycle on a Sunday. The party also keeps coming across a strange, unidentifiable man in a pink sash, that always seems to be around when unexplainable incidents occur.\n\nThe game was first announced on May 30, 2016, as developer Acquire's first action role-playing video game. First information on the title, such as it being a game for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4, were first revealed in an issue of \"Famitsu\". The game was 75% complete as of the time of the announcement. On June 7, 2016, Xseed Games announced they would be releasing the game in English on both platforms. The game will be the second of three \"Akiba\" games to be translated to English; the original \"Akiba's Trip\" for PlayStation Portable was never translated or released in English, but the second game, \"\", was translated and published by Xseed Games. The game's story was announced to be more serious in theme than the prior two games in the series. Despite this, similar to the prior games, it will still take place in a realistic recreation of Japan's Akihabara, coupled with surreal dungeon areas more akin to games such as \"Persona 3\". Key staff for the game include director Kohta Takano of \"Divine Gate\", character designs by UCMM, and a theme song titled \"Again\", sung by ClariS. On October 27, 2016, PQube confirmed a European release.\n\nThe game was originally scheduled for release in Japan during the fall of 2016, but was later delayed to winter of that year, before the release was narrowed down to December. The PlayStation 4 version launched on December 16, 2016, with the PlayStation Vita release pushed back to March 16, 2017. Both PS4 and PS Vita versions were released on PSN digitally and retail on May 16, 2017.\n\nUpon the PlayStation 4 version's release, the game failed to chart in the weekly Media Create Top 20. In Famitsu's Top 30, \"Akiba's Beat\" ranked as the 26th best selling of that tracking window with 5248 units sold, for a 20-40% sell-through. This figure was roughly a tenth of what \"\" sold in a similar period of time on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 back in 2013. The magazine's reviewer gave the PlayStation 4 version of the game a 27/40. \n\nThe western release received mixed to negative reviews with Cory Arnold of Destructoid awarding the game 3.5 (out of 10) citing \"If Akiba's Trip is the shirtless jock who kicks the door in with beers in hand, Akiba's Beat is the timid cocktail-drinker standing in the corner with one hand in his pocket.

He received his MBA from Wharton Business School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1972.\n\nLevy joined CBS Records International in 1972, and stayed until 1984. He began his career as the chief of staff in the office of CBS Records International president Walter Yetnikoff, before moving to Paris as head of manufacturing and logistics. In 1976 he was appointed vice president of marketing in Europe and later also put in charge of management of CBS Italy. In 1979 he was promoted to CEO of CBS France.\n\nIn 1984 Levy moved to PolyGram as CEO of its French operations, and expanded the label into the largest music company in France, with market share of 35%, in just four years.\n\nIn 1988 he moved to London to be executive vice president of PolyGram in charge of its worldwide pop marketing and music publishing activities.\n\nIn 1990, he led the firm's negotiations to buy Island Records and A&M Records, which brought to PolyGram top-selling artists, as U2 and Sting. He integrated A&M and Island into the Group, using this opportunity to regroup all labels into one distribution company and also add video. In addition to his marketing role, he took over the management of PolyGram's new operations in the U.S., and then reorganized PolyGram Records (U.S.) into a new large-scale venture: PolyGram Group Distribution, Inc., which oversaw the operations of the United States divisions of PolyGram including PolyGram Music Group, PolyGram Video, PolyMedia, PolyGram Special Markets, PolyGram Merchandising, Independent Label Sales, etc. Overall, PGD, Inc. oversaw the distribution, marketing and sales of the audio and video products belonging to PolyGram in the United States. That year, PolyGram was floated on the Amsterdam and New York stock exchange at a valuation of 2B$.\n\nIn 1991, Levy was promoted to worldwide President and CEO of PolyGram N.V. overseeing all global business/entertainment operations for PolyGram including: PolyGram Music Group and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. He spent the next seven years turning the primarily European music group into a worldwide entertainment force that sold one out of every five albums and released movie hits such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Fargo.\n\nIn 1992 Levy acquired Motown and Def Jam further diversifying PolyGram’s musical slate. He then spent the next few years consolidating the firm's music strategy: balanced multinational operations, investment in local content, consolidating the global marketing operations and prioritizing profit over market share.\n\nBy the mid 1990s PolyGram was the most profitable of all the music majors and the number one music company in the world.\n\nBeginning in 1992, after observing a gradual flattening in the music sales. Levy led the company’s expansion into the international movie business with the establishment of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. PFE produced and distributed films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Trainspotting, Bean, Fargo and Dead Man Walking.\nPolyGram Filmed Entertainment became the biggest European owned studio with sales in excess of 1B$ and distribution in 26 countries.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1998 Levy also sat on the Board of Management of Phillips, and played a key part in developing world-class software and content while being one of the industry leaders in hardware. In 1996, Phillips CEO Jan Timmer left the company and was replaced by Cor Boonstraa. Over the next few years the strategy of the company shifted; in 1998 Phillips left the software side to focus on hardware. PolyGram was then sold to Seagram for 11B$ and Levy left the company.\n\nAfter leaving PolyGram, Levy was senior advisor at McKinsey and made seed investments in a number of different media companies mainly in the Internet space.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Levy was the Chairman and CEO of EMI Music worldwide.\n\nFor the first six months of his tenure Levy led the consolidation of EMI and Virgin Group into one company with distinct content streams and branding, resulting in overheads savings of £250 million on an annual basis. He then focused on changing the strategy to the changing context of digital, shifting EMI from a content-driven to a consumer-focused company.\n\nOver the next few years Levy invested over £100m in technology both inside the company and vis a vis the consumer. EMI was the first media company to digitize its content and to start discussions and negotiations with Apple regarding its iTunes launch, while at the same time leading the debate over digital rights management.\n\nDuring this time EMI adopted consumer segmentation, market research practices and investment measuring techniques in its marketing operations. It also built a powerful global marketing operation that supported the success of primarily English speaking artists globally.

{"id": "44974975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44974975", "title": "Australian Directors Guild", "text": "Australian Directors Guild\n\nThe Australian Directors Guild (ADG) is an industry guild representing the interests of film, television, commercials and digital media directors, including documentary makers and animators, throughout Australia. With its headquarters in Sydney, the ADG has branches in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.\nFounded initially as the Australian Feature Film Director’s Association in September, 1981 and renamed the Australian Screen Directors Association four months later, the Guild became the Australian Directors Guild in 2007 in order to align itself more clearly to other international Directors Guilds which had for some years been strengthening their ties with each other and with their Australian counterpart. In 2014, the ADG membership voted unanimously for constitutional changes to enable the Guild to register as a trade union under Australia’s Federal Industrial Relations Act. In February, 2015 registration as an industrial organisation was approved by the Fair\nWork Commission.\n\nThe ADG is a craft association representing screen directors working in all genres. It seeks to promote excellence in screen direction through seminars, conferences, workshops and awards, to encourage communication and collaboration between directors and others in the industry, to provide professional support for its members, to represent the interests of directors in cultural and policy debates and decisions and to play a constructive role in matters affecting the Australian screen industry as a whole.\n\nThe ADG is governed by a board of directors, elected from and by the membership, and appoints a full-time executive director and a coordinator.\n\nThe ADG provides members with information, access, professional advice and advocacy relating to issues that affect directors – such as contracts, fees, codes of practice, rights and disputes. It maintains and provides connections with overseas Guilds through its affiliation with the International Association of English Speaking Directors Organisations (IAESDO).\n\nThe Guild organises a Directors Attachment Scheme in cooperation with Screen Australia whereby successful applicants are placed in productions in order to gain experience working in film or television. Beginning in 1993, the ADG has held regular directors conferences and between 1988 and 2008, it printed a newsletter which later became the magazine, \"Screen Director\". Current issues of \"Screen Director\" are available online.\n\nIn 2007 the ADG began giving annual awards for directors. These have grown to include 17 categories with special awards recognising service and achievement.\n\nOzdox, a semi-autonomous documentary group affiliated with the ADG and working closely with Guild staff, fosters and promotes documentary culture, primarily through discussion screenings and seminars. Founded in 2003, Ozdox encourages documentary directors to become members of the ADG.\n\nIn 1995 the ADG formed the Australian Screen Directors Authorship Collecting Society (ASDACS)) to collect overseas royalties for distribution to Australian and New Zealand directors\n\nAs of 2014, the ADG had a membership of over 700, including full/retired members, associate members and student members. Full members must be refereed and their credentials approved by the ADG Board. Membership fees are determined according to annual wage levels and state location.\n\nGuild Chapters in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia organize a range of local events and activities and liaise with their relevant State screen bodies.\nThe staff and operations of the Guild are financed through fees for membership, income from events, a small percent of overseas royalties collected through ASDACS, a voluntary levy from the budgets of members' productions and sponsorship from state and federal film bodies, and Media Super.\n\nIn early 1981, a meeting of film directors was held in response to plans to import an overseas director for Hoodwink, a feature film financed by Australian taxpayers through the New South Wales Film Corporation. The meeting held the view that the development of Australian directors was a key part of the rationale for government funding of films. Failing to gain support for their opposition from the relevant industry union, the Australian Theatrical & Amusement Employees Association (AT&AEA), the directors decided to set up the Australian Feature Film Directors Association. In around September 1981, 18 directors met at the AT&AEA headquarters in the Sydney suburb of Glebe to sign the Articles of Association. Nine directors were the formal signatories: Gillian Armstrong, James Ricketson, Esben Storm, Albie Thoms, Henri Safran, Keith Salvat, Tom Jeffrey, Carl Schultz and Michael Pate.\n\nThe organization soon attracted interest from directors other than feature film directors, especially from television directors, leading to the decision to change its name to the Australian Screen Directors Association (ASDA). New signatories to the ASDA Articles of Association on 15 January 1982 included Phillip Noyce and Stephen Wallace and a number of directors best known for their television work: John Power, Maurice Murphy, Peter Maxwell, Ron Way and Ian Barry.\n\nIn the years that followed, ASDA continued to concern itself with the importation of overseas directors, supporting directors of note and where Australian directors were also included in the projects. A range of cultural events, meetings and seminars were organized and, as membership grew, membership fees enabled the employment of a manager. Attempts at instituting a standard directors contract proved fruitless as the Screen Producers Association of Australia (SPAA) refused to negotiate, citing ASDA's lack of industrial registration as its reason. Nevertheless, in 1985 a disputes committee was formed and ASDA continued to represent directors in disputes with producers.\n\nASDA Board meetings were initially held in members' houses or at an industry watering hole, the 729 Club, until 1984 by which time income had increased sufficiently for the establishment of an office in the suburb of Glebe. In 1985, with the admission of documentary directors, membership reached 100, but the influence of ASDA through its various activities reached many more directors as well as others interested/involved in film and television production. These cultural events also became a source of finance.\n\nAs the organization developed further, eventually including membership in other capital cities, the Australian Film Commission (AFC) began to give financial support to ASDA's cultural events and seminars. Correlatively, with the growth of membership and establishment of a financial base, ASDA was able to play a role in the politics of the industry. Lobbying on behalf of directors' viewpoints on a range of issues soon became one of the Association's primary activities.\n\nBy 1992 ASDA membership was around 200 and, as activity within the organisation increased, this number soon doubled. By the end of the decade, members numbered almost 900, including both associate and student members.\n\nDuring the 1990s, members participated directly in the Association through a range of committees including a documentary committee, an animators committee, a television directors committee, a women’s committee, events committee and policy committee, among others. President Stephen Wallace, in revitalising ASDA, recognised the members’ interest in the art/craft of directing and proposed the institution of a Directors Conference and Directors Discussion Screenings. Many such screenings were held over the following years, along with a range of seminars and meetings to discuss industry policy.\n\nASDA’s first National Directors Conference was held in June, 1993. Over the next years, these conferences coincided with ASDA’s AGM and became forums for policy debate as well as for exploration of directing issues. At the 1995 conference, ASDA presented the first Cecil Holmes Award in recognition of services to directing. The Award is now generally given in alternate years or with the identification of a deserving recipient.\n\nDuring this period also, ASDA continued its participation in industry policy development with submissions to and meetings with relevant organisations, reviews and government departments. Work on a Standard TV directors contract was begun and a reconstituted Disputes Committee began life by dealing with a serious television dispute arising in some measure out of the lack of such a contract. Other disputes continued to be brought to the committee by directors working in many areas of the industry. In 1999, one of these disputes, with Channel 9 over wages for directors on the \"Far Scape\" series, brought the long-simmering issue of industrial representation to the fore. President Stephen Wallace vigorously rejected the view that ASDA should work through the industry union, the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA) but rather that it should itself seek industrial registration.\n\nASDA's efforts to develop standard directors' contracts continued and in 1999 Neil Haggquist, the business agent for the Directors Guild of Canada (DGC) was brought to Australia to help develop a contract which would be acceptable both to Australian and US companies. Also in this period a prolonged struggle to achieve Moral Rights for directors was initiated when both federal government film agencies, the Australian Film Commission and the Film Finance Corporation Australia, as well as the Australian Writers Guild came out in opposition to the inclusion of directors as authors in mooted changes to the Copyright law of Australia.\n\nASDA understood that the authorship of screen directors was not well-recognised and was under additional threat in a changing global and technological landscape. As a consequence, many of its activities at this time were aimed at fostering a better understanding of the director's role. Thanks to these efforts, when Moral Rights legislation was introduced into the Copyright Act in 2000, directors were defined as makers of a film along with writers and producers. Importantly, with the subsequent passing of the 2006 Copyright Amendment Act, ASDA and the Australian Writers Guild, now working together, managed to achieve protection for their members from contractual pressures to waive their moral rights – a waiver which is permitted and widely exercised in some other jurisdictions, notably in the United States.\n\nIn 1994, ASDA President Stephen Wallace, at the invitation of the late John Juliani the DGC (Directors Guild of Canada), met in Toronto with the DGA (Directors Guild of America) and BECTU (Britain's Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union), thus beginning a process of achieving closer relationships with overseas guilds. Subsequently, ASDA regularly participated in the annual International Directors' Guild Forum, an event which it hosted in Sydney in 1998.\n\nSimilarly in 1995, ASDA formed ASDACS (the Australian Directors Collecting Society) after having been approached by the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques to distribute money collected on behalf of directors from the sale of video tapes in France. ASDACS subsequently formed further relationships with other European collecting societies and in recent years has distributed roughly half a million dollars annually to its 800 director members in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 1999, ASDA made further gains for directors in arguing for their inclusion as beneficiaries under the retransmission scheme proposed in the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act (2000). These efforts came to fruition in 2005 through the Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Act, providing for film directors to share in retransmission royalties along with producers in certain cases.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, political, social and technological changes were resulting in a diminution of member involvement in many organizations across Australia and ASDA was not immune to these changes. Most of the member committees of the earlier period had become inactive, members meetings became infrequent, and most of the work fell to active members of the Board—particularly successive Association presidents Donald Crombie and Ray Argall—and to the Executive Directors: Richard Harris (1998-2007), Drew Macrae (2007-2009), In 2009-2011, the ADG also employed an industrial relations and policy manager, Needeya Islam. Much of their time was claimed by industrial issues, international relations and the necessity of participation in a large number of policy debates and reviews of public sector institutions and regulations, with their attendant demands for consultations, participation in industry committees and detailed submissions.\n\nIn this period also, digital media became an increasingly significant area of concern as rapid transformations affected telecommunications, television and “film” which was increasingly moving away from celluloid formats.\n\nThanks to consistent participation in industry politics and promotion of directors’ viewpoints, by the time the Association changed its name to the Australian Directors Guild (ADG) in 2007, it had become a well-established and well-recognised player in a complex industry/cultural scene in which seemingly every possible craft and interest group was establishing its own organised representation. ADG President Ray Argall became involved in the work of the Australian Screen Council, an attempt, ultimately ill-fated, to bring the screen guilds together. More broadly and in line with the ADG's understanding of the increasing impact of globalisation on Australian screen, Argall officially represented Australia in the founding of the International Federation of Coalitions for Cultural Diversity in Seville in 2007. He is currently the Asia Pacific member of the Federation Board and coordinates the Australian Coalition for Cultural Diversity.\n\nIn 2007, the first ADG Directors Awards were established. They are open to financial members in all categories and are the only Australian film directing awards judged solely by directors. This was the year in which the ADG was first included in the Directors Finder initiative by the Directors Guild of America. The DGA Finders Award spotlights the director of an undistributed independent film chosen from member countries within the International Association of English Speaking Directors Organizations (IAESDO).

The game is popular in game theory because the conclusions can be applied to real-life networks. The game is described as follows:\n\n\nWe also use assumptions regarding formula_3\n\nThe game arises from trying to find a price formula_14 so that every player individually optimizes their own welfare. This implies every player must individually find formula_15. Solving for the maximum yields formula_16.\n\nWith this maximum condition, the game then becomes a matter of finding a price that satisfies an equilibrium. Such a price is called a market clearing price.\n\nA popular idea to find the price is a method called fair sharing. In this game, every player formula_2 is asked for amount they are willing to pay for the given resource denoted by formula_6. The resource is then distributed in formula_19 amounts by the formula formula_20. This method yields an effective price formula_21.\nThis price can proven to be market clearing thus the distribution formula_22 is optimal. The proof is as so:\n\nformula_23\n\nformula_24\nformula_25\nformula_26\nformula_27\n\nComparing this result to the equilibrium condition above, we see that when formula_28 is very small, the two conditions equal each other and thus, the fair sharing game is almost optimal.\n"}

{"id": "772629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772629", "title": "Canon (fiction)", "text": "Canon (fiction)\n\nIn fiction, canon is the material accepted as officially part of the story in the fictional universe of that story. It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of fan fiction. The alternative terms mythology, timeline, universe and continuity are often used, with the former being especially used to refer to a richly detailed fictional canon requiring a large degree of suspension of disbelief (e.g. an entire imaginary world and history), while the latter two typically refer to a single arc where all events are directly connected chronologically. Other times, the word can mean \"to be acknowledged by the creator(s)\".\n\nThe use of the word \"canon\" originated in reference to a set of texts derives from Biblical canon, the set of books regarded as scripture, as contrasted with non-canonical Apocrypha. The term was first used by analogy in the context of fiction to refer to the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels, written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as contrasted with numerous Holmes adventures added later by other writers. This usage was afterwards extended to the writings of various other authors.\n\nThe term \"canon\" nowadays refers to all works of fiction within a franchise's fictional universe which are considered \"to have actually happened\" within the fictional universe they belong to.\n\nWhen there are multiple \"official\" works or original media, the question of what is canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\"), by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media (as was in the case of \"Star Wars\" before the franchise was purchased by Disney), by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own continuities universe, but not across them, or not resolved at all. The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to reboots or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the \"Star Trek\" remake (2009), because of the ways in which it influences the viewer experience.\n\nThe official \"Star Trek\" website describes \"Star Trek\" canon as \"the events that take place within the episodes and movies\" (that is, the television series \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", and the \"Star Trek\" film series, with \"\" having long existed in a ). Events, characters and storylines from tie-in novels, comic books, and video games are explicitly excluded from the \"Star Trek\" canon, but the site notes that elements from these sources have been subsequently introduced into the television series, and says that \"canon is not something set in stone.\" One example of a non-canonical element that later became canonical in the Star Trek universe were the first names for Sulu and Uhura, introduced in novels, plus \"Tiberius\" becoming the official middle name of Enterprise captain James T. Kirk. The name was introduced in the \"Star Trek\" animated series, and was later added into the official biography of the character by its mention in the live-action film \"\" (1991).\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" canon originally existed on several levels. The highest level was the original \"Star Wars\" films, and statements by George Lucas; tie-in fiction from the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe had a different level of canonicity. The complex system was maintained by Leland Chee, a Lucasfilm employee. After Disney bought the franchise, all material published prior to April 25, 2014 that was not any of the Star Wars movies or the CGI cartoon \"The Clone Wars\" was declared in the \"Legends\" continuity, marking them as no longer official canon. All subsequent material exists on the same level of canon, with the Lucasfilm Story Group being established to ensure no contradictions among canon works.\n\nThe makers of \"Doctor Who\" have generally avoided making pronouncements about canonicity, with Russell T Davies explaining that he does not think about the concept for the \"Doctor Who\" television series or its spin-offs.\n\nIn literature, the term \"canon\" is used to distinguish between the original works of a writer who created certain characters and/or settings, and the later works of other writers who took up the same characters or setting. For example, the canon of Sherlock Holmes consists of the 56 short stories and four novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. The subsequent works by other authors who took up Sherlock Holmes are considered \"non-canonical\".\n\nFan fiction is almost never regarded as canonical. However, certain ideas may become influential or widely accepted within fan communities, who refer to such ideas as \"fanon\", a portmanteau of \"fan\" and \"canon\". Similarly, the jargon \"headcanon\" is used to describe a fan's personal interpretation of a fictional universe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48402268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48402268", "title": "Causal loop", "text": "Causal loop\n\nA causal loop in the context of time travel or the causal structure of spacetime, is a sequence of events (actions, information, objects, people) in which an event is among the causes of another event, which in turn is among the causes of the first-mentioned event. Such causally-looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. A hypothetical example of a causality loop is given of a billiard ball striking its past self: the billiard ball moves in a path towards a time machine, and the future self of the billiard ball emerges from the time machine \"before\" its past self enters it, giving its past self a glancing blow, altering the past ball's path and causing it to enter the time machine at an angle that would cause its future self to strike its past self the very glancing blow that altered its path.\n\nBackwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to \"come from nowhere.\" The notion of objects or information which are \"self-existing\" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical, with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a \"bootstrap paradox\", an \"information paradox\", or an \"ontological paradox\". The use of \"bootstrap\" in this context refers to the expression \"pulling yourself up by your bootstraps\" and to Robert A. Heinlein's time travel story \"By His Bootstraps\". The term \"time loop\" is sometimes used to refer to a causal loop, but although they appear similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting.\n\nAn example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin. A similar example is given in the television series \"Doctor Who\" of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name. Everett gives the movie \"Somewhere in Time\" as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.\n\nKrasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws. He does not find this paradoxical, and attributes problems regarding the validity of time travel to other factors in the interpretation of general relativity.\n\nA 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and Igor Novikov labeled such items without origin as \"Jinn\", with the singular term \"Jinnee\". This terminology was inspired by the Jinn of the Quran, which are described as leaving no trace when they disappear. Lossev and Novikov allowed the term \"Jinn\" to cover both objects and information with reflexive origin; they called the former \"Jinn of the first kind\", and the latter \"Jinn of the second kind\". They point out that an object making circular passage through time must be identical whenever it is brought back to the past, otherwise it would create an inconsistency; the second law of thermodynamics seems to require that the object become more disordered over the course of its history, and such objects that are identical in repeating points in their history seem to contradict this, but Lossev and Novikov argued that since the second law only requires disorder to increase in \"closed\" systems, a Jinnee could interact with its environment in such a way as to regain lost order. They emphasize that there is no \"strict difference\" between Jinn of the first and second kind. Krasnikov equivocates between \"Jinn\", \"self-sufficient loops\", and \"self-existing objects\", calling them \"lions\" or \"looping or intruding objects\", and asserts that they are no less physical than conventional objects, \"which, after all, also could appear only from either infinity, or a singularity.\"\n\nThe term \"predestination paradox\" is used in the \"Star Trek\" franchise to mean \"a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past.\" This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of \"\" titled \"Trials and Tribble-ations\", although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as Calvinism and some forms of Marxism which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined. Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term \"predestination paradox\" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.\n\nA self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be \"truly\" known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. Predestination does not necessarily involve a supernatural power, and could be the result of other \"infallible foreknowledge\" mechanisms. Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in Newcomb's paradox. A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play \"Oedipus Rex\", in which Oedipus becomes the king of Thebes, whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling. The movie \"12 Monkeys\" heavily deals with themes of predestination and the Cassandra complex, where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.\n\nGeneral relativity permits some exact solutions that allow for time travel. Some of these exact solutions describe universes that contain closed timelike curves, or world lines that lead back to the same point in spacetime. Physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov discussed the possibility of closed timelike curves in his books in 1975 and 1983, offering the opinion that only self-consistent trips back in time would be permitted. In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, \"Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves\", the authors suggested the \"principle of self-consistency,\" which states that \"the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.\" The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.\n\nPhysicist Joseph Polchinski argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a billiard ball sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a wormhole at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as \"Polchinski's paradox\". Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and Robert Forward showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.\n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find \"any\" initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven. The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.\n\nNovikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel. Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.\n\nPhysicist David Deutsch shows in a 1991 paper that quantum computation with a negative delay—backwards time travel—could solve NP problems in polynomial time, and Scott Aaronson later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve PSPACE problems in polynomial time. Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning. Researchers published in 2014 a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons. However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC (closed timelike curve, aka causal loop) fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic quantum field theory on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of general relativity.\n"}

Starring Ratna Asmara and Ali Joego, it follows a woman who goes to Jakarta to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, \"Djaoeh Dimata\" took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 gulden.\n\nThe first domestically produced feature film to be released in five years, \"Djaoeh Dimata\" received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by Roestam Sutan Palindih's \"Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum\" (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at Sinematek Indonesia.\n\nA poor villager, Asrad (Ali Joego), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri (Ratna Asmara) travels to the capital, Jakarta, to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and – unknown to Asrad – soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.\n\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies, with over forty domestic productions released. Following the Japanese occupation in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the ethnic Chinese-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film – Rd Ariffien's \"Berdjoang\" (\"Struggle\"; 1943) – six short films, and several newsreels. All were pro-Japanese propaganda.\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender in August 1945, a number of native Indonesian employees of Nippon Eigasha formed Berita Film Indonesia, which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly proclaimed Indonesian government. During the ensuing revolution, allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of newsreels at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce fictional films. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.\n\nSPFC hired Andjar Asmara, a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct \"Djaoeh Dimata\"; he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name. However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and dialogue coach; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product. Max Tera served as assistant cinematographer on this black-and-white film.\n\nThe film starred Ratna Asmara (wife of Andjar), Ali Yugo, Iskandar Sucarno, and Djauhari Effendi, all of whom had previous theatrical experience. Ratna and Ali, together with Andjar, had been members of the travelling troupe Dardanella in the early 1930s and entered the film industry together in 1940 with \"Kartinah\". Iskandar and Djauhari, meanwhile, had been active in the theatre during the occupation; both made their feature film debuts with \"Djaoeh Dimata\". \n\nPrincipal photography was conducted on sets constructed by artistic director Hajopan Bajo Angin in SFPC's studio in Jakarta. The company's equipment was of good quality, but conditions were detrimental to filming; a contemporary report notes that one take, done inside the studio, was ruined by the sound of a passing car. Filming, which took two to three months, was completed on 10 November 1948. Production costs were almost 130,000 gulden, which was partially obtained from ethnic Chinese backers. The film included multiple songs, including Gesang Martohartono's 1940 hit \"Bengawan Solo\".\n\n\"Djaoeh Dimata\" was released in late 1948, the first domestic feature film since \"Berdjoang\". Despite this five-year gap, film critic Usmar Ismail writes that it did not stray from the formula which had been proven before the war, one which Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran notes focused on songs, beautiful scenery and romance. Roestam Sutan Palindih's \"Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum\" (\"Tears Flow in Citarum\"), which had similar themes, was released shortly after \"Djaoeh Dimata\" by the rival Tan & Wong Bros.; it proved the greater financial success. Only three domestic productions were released in 1948; the last was another SPFC production, entitled \"Anggrek Bulan\" (\"Moon Orchid\"), which was also directed by Andjar.\n\nReviews of the film, which was rated for all ages, were mixed. One in the Jakarta-based \"Het Dagblad\" found the film to have many (unspecified) weak moments as well as strong ones. It particularly praised Ali's acting as a blind man, as well as Denninghoff-Stelling's camerawork. Another reviewer, in the magazine \"Mestika\", described Ratna as an \"unprecedented tragedienne\" capable of making viewers cry \"unrestrained tears of emotion\". After \"Djaoeh Dimata\" was released in Singapore in June 1949, a reviewer for \"The Straits Times\" praised the film's \"fine photography and almost perfect sound\".\n\nAndjar directed two further films for South Pacific, \"Anggrek Bulan\" and \"Gadis Desa\" (\"Maiden from the Village\"; 1949). Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with \"Sedap Malam\" (\"Sweetness of the Night\"), for Djamaluddin Malik's company Persari. Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s. SPFC made another six films before shutting down at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution in 1949. A 35 mm copy of \"Djaoeh Dimata\" is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.\n\n"}

He was originally a supporting character in \"Minnie the Minx\" by Leo Baxendale, but eventually received his own spin-off comic.\n\nAs his name suggests, Fatty Fudge is an obese boy with an addiction to unhealthy food, particularly confectionery. He is very greedy and would do anything for food, which Minnie often uses to her advantage. He is largely confined to supporting roles in the Minnie the Minx cartoon strip in which, alongside Minnie's other rival Soppy Susan, he is usually the butt of Minnie's pranks, although his services are occasionally engaged by Minnie for the furtherence of her schemes. His real name is Frederick James Fudge.\n\nHe has a son named Frederick Fudge Jr. and he also appeared with him in The Beano comics, The Beano Video, The Beano Videostars and the TV series \"Curious George\".\n\nIn the Beano Video and the Beano Videostars, three of his clones were Red, Yellow and Blue. However the red version of Fatty Fudge appeared without the blue and yellow Fatty Fudges in \"Pink Glove\" from the Beano Video and \"Jelly Babies\" from the Beano Videostars.\n\nFrom 1989–1991, however, Fatty had his own spin-off strip devoted entirely to the parodying of famous films. Examples of this include \"Ghost Burgers\", \"Toast Busters\" (both puns on \"Ghostbusters\"), \"You only eat Rice\" (\"You Only Live Twice\"), \"Sleeping Fatty\" (\"Sleeping Beauty\"), \"Frankfurterstein\" (\"Frankenstein\"), \"Fishfinger\" (\"Goldfinger\"), \"Live and Let Diet\" (\"Live and Let Die\"), \"The Incredible Bulk\" (\"The Incredible Hulk\"), \"2001: A Space Obesity\" (\"\"), and \"20,000 Leeks Under the Sea\" (\"20.000 Leagues Under the Sea\"). He also appeared in a parody of the British quiz show \"Bob's Full House\", called \"Slob's Full Tum\", where contestants had to eat as much as they could and whoever got a full tum in the quickest time was the winner. The game show was hosted by \"Slob Monkhouse\", again a parody of the original host name Bob Monkhouse. These strips were all drawn by Jim Petrie, the \"Minnie the Minx\" artist at that time.\n\nThe strip reappeared in Issue 3616, dated 17 December 2011, it was so former artist Jim Petrie could get a proper retirement. The comic asked for ideas for the strip on Beano.com. In the end, the winning idea was \"The Tummy Returns\", suggested by William Clyde, this appeared in the comic. Other suggestions that were considered good by Petrie included: \"Iron (stomach) Man\" (\"Iron Man\"), \"A-lard-in\" (\"Aladdin\"), \"Harry Scoffer and the order on Phoenix Street\" (\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\"), all from Harry Rickard, \"Currynation Street\" (\"Coronation Street\") and \"The Fat in the Hat\" (\"The Cat in the Hat\"), both by Oliver Forde.\n\n"}

L. James. After accepting entrepreneur CEO Christian Grey's proposal in \"Fifty Shades Darker\", Anastasia Steele must adjust not only to married life but to her new husband's wealthy lifestyle and controlling nature. The paperback edition was first published in April 2012.\n\nAnastasia 'Ana' Steele and Christian Grey return to Seattle after a long honeymoon. Christian is upset to find that Ana has kept her maiden name, Steele, at work. After some resistance, Ana relents and changes her name at work to Grey after realizing how important it is to Christian. As a belated wedding gift, Christian gives Seattle Independent Publishing to Ana, who plans to rename it Grey Publishing.\n\nWhile Christian is on a business trip in New York, Anastasia goes out for a drink with longtime friend, Kate Kavanagh, doing so against Christian's wishes. Returning home, she finds that her former boss, Jack Hyde, who was fired for attempting to sexually assault Ana, has been apprehended by the security staff. Duct tape is found in his pocket and in his van there are tranquilizers and a ransom note—all indications that he intended to kidnap her. Jack is arrested. Angry with Ana for defying him, Christian cuts short his New York business trip and returns to Seattle. Furious that Ana reneged on her promise to have Kate over rather than go out, an upset Christian sulks while Ana sleeps. Eventually, the two argue and Ana berates him for being overly controlling and possessive. She demands more freedom and access to her friends. Christian finally relents after realizing how much Ana's friends mean to her and that Ana did the right thing by staying with Kate rather than at home. Soon after, Christian surprises her with a trip to Aspen, with Kate, Elliot, Mia, and Kate's brother, Ethan. While there, Elliot proposes to Kate, and she accepts.\n\nAna's step-father, Ray, is in a medically-induced coma after a car accident. When he awakens a few days later, Ana and Christian arrange to move him to Seattle to recover. It is also Ana's birthday weekend, and Christian surprises her with all her family and friends at a dinner. He gives her a charm bracelet with the charms representing all their \"firsts\" including an ice cream cone to represent their \"vanilla\" relationship. Christian also gifts her with an Audi R8. Soon after, Ana learns she is pregnant. Christian angrily accuses her of getting pregnant on purpose and leaves. He returns early the next morning drunk, claiming Ana will choose the baby - whom he believes to be a boy - over him. Ana says it could be a girl, though Christian refuses to accept that due to his sexist and chauvinistic nature. Ana becomes furious when she discovers a text message on Christian's phone from Elena Lincoln, the woman who seduced him when he was fifteen and introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle. The message indicates they met for a drink.\n\nThe next two mornings, Anastasia and Christian barely speak to each other: Christian is angry over the unplanned pregnancy; Anastasia is upset about his late-night encounter with Elena, though Christian insists their relationship is long-since over. When Christian is away on a business for a few days, Ana receives a call from Jack Hyde. He has kidnapped Mia Grey and demands $5 million in two hours. He warns Ana not to tell anyone or he will kill Mia.\n\nAnastasia feigns illness and returns home to escape her bodyguard, Sawyer. She takes a gun and goes to the bank. While collecting the money, the suspicious bank manager calls Christian. who believes Ana is leaving him. To protect Mia's life, Ana lies to Christian, saying she is leaving him to raise the baby alone. Hyde instructs Ana to leave her phone but she tricks him by taking the bank manager's phone instead and dropping it in the trash. She leaves via the back entrance to a waiting car, shocked that Hyde's accomplice is Elizabeth Morgan, her co-worker. When handing over the money, Hyde tries to kill Ana out of vengeance for losing his job, causing Elizabeth to feel guilty for being involved. Angered by his behavior and his hurting Ana, she and Hyde argue. On the ground and bruised, Ana shoots Hyde in the leg. When Ana starts to black out she hears Christian calling her name.\n\nAna wakes three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though he is angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, he realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Ana returns home the next day. Christian learns from his private investigator, Welch, that he and Hyde had the same foster family. He tells Ana about how he met and was seduced by Elena. By introducing him to the world of BDSM, Elena helped Christian learn to take control of his life. If she had not intervened, he would still be plagued with horrible memories of his mother and would never have been able to control his life. Ana feels guilty for her behavior when he explains that he had been looking for his psychiatrist, Dr. Flynn, because he needed help. When he could not contact Flynn, Christian wound up at Elena's salon and they then had a drink at the bar. Although she made a pass at him, Elena realized that Christian loved Ana and finally agrees to leave on good terms. \n\nThe next day, a furious Christian discovers that Elena's ex-husband, Eric Lincoln, has bailed Jack from jail out of spite for her affair with Christian. Christian tells Ana that after learning about the affair, Eric severely beat Elena and divorced her. Despite Christian's urging, Elena refused to press charges against Eric out of guilt. Christian retaliated by buying out Eric Lincoln's logging company to sell it off. It is also learned Elizabeth confessed to police that she was blackmailed by Hyde to be his accomplice. (However, her ultimate fate remains a mystery.)\n\nTwo years later, Ana and Christian have a son named Theodore Raymond Grey, nicknamed Teddy, and Ana is six months pregnant with their second child, a daughter whom they decide to name Phoebe. Elliot and Kate have married and have a two-month-old daughter named Ava. At the end, after having BDSM sex, Ana and Christian are getting ready to celebrate Teddy's second birthday with their family and friends.\n\n\"Fifty Shades Freed\" entered \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list at number three. In the UK the novel sold over two million copies.\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson, the director of the film adaptation of the first installment of the book series, \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", confirmed on 6 February 2015 that both \"Fifty Shades Freed\" and the second book in the trilogy, \"Fifty Shades Darker\", will also be adapted for film. The film was released on 9 February 2018. In November 2015, Universal Studios announced that both films will be shot back-to-back with principal photography scheduled to commence in early 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "7576955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7576955", "title": "George Formby Sr", "text": "George Formby Sr\n\nGeorge Formby (born James Lawler Booth; 4 October 1875 – 8 February 1921) was an English comedian and singer in musical theatre, known as one of the greatest music hall performers of the early 20th century. His comedy played upon Lancashire stereotypes, and he was popular around Britain. His nickname, \"The Wigan Nightingale\", was coined because of the way he would use his bronchial cough as a comedic device in his act.\n\nFormby was born into poverty in the industrial north west of England; his mother was an alcoholic and part-time prostitute, and during much of his youth he was maltreated. To earn money he would sing for pennies on street corners, before he joined a singing duo in his teens. He began to develop his own act during the 1890s and built up a following in Lancashire. He also developed a series of stage characters, including that of \"John Willie\", which is described by the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards as \"the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad ... hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through.\" Formby also had a successful recording career and made the transition from music hall to revue in 1916.\n\nHis health had always been poor, but a stage accident in 1916 weakened Formby's lungs, and he suffered increasingly for the next few years, reducing his ability to perform. Tuberculosis and influenza—the latter contracted in the pandemic of 1918—weakened his constitution further, and he died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1921 at the age of 45. Formby's act, and one of his costumes and canes, inspired Charlie Chaplin in the formation of his character the Tramp. Formby's son also used parts of his father's act when starting his stage career and, once established, also changed his name to George Formby; Formby Jr went on to become the top British male star in box office takings between 1937 and 1943.\n\nGeorge Formby was born James Lawler Booth in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, on 4 October 1875. He was the illegitimate and only child of Sarah Jane Booth (c. 1856–1912), a poor, illiterate cotton weaver. His father, Francis Lawler, a coal miner, was not named on the birth certificate; six months after the birth of their son, the couple married, both aged about 19. Sarah worked as a prostitute; she was small, around tall, and sang in pubs in exchange for alcoholic drinks. She was convicted 140 times for offences that included theft, prostitution, drunkenness and brawling. The marriage was turbulent, and Formby was often neglected, mistreated and suffered malnourishment. Because Sarah was frequently absent from home, and often detained overnight at the local police station, Formby was regularly forced to sleep outside. As a result he developed asthma and became susceptible to bronchitis. In his later years he recalled that his \"childhood was the most miserable as ever fell to the lot of a human creature\".\n\nFormby left formal education at the age of eight or nine, and did not learn to read until well into his teenage years. To earn money for the household, he sang on street corners for coppers; the family's poverty worsened when, in October 1890, Lawler died from pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 33. Formby secured a job at a cotton mill and spent two years as a loom builder. He supplemented his wages by singing in pubs, alehouses and free-and-easies, the last being places where informal arrangements were made for patrons to provide their own entertainment. Around this time he joined up with another boy to form an act, \"the Glenray Brothers\" (also \"the Glen Ray Brothers\"), which was profitable enough to have a manager; the act continued until Formby's boy soprano voice broke, after which the pair separated.\n\nFormby began to develop his own stage act during the 1890s, and built a large fan base in Lancashire. He devised several characters with their own costumes, and composed a series of comic songs. By 1896 his assignment book records that he was buying and collecting comic songs and securing the singing rights. He was billed as J.H. Booth until 1897, when he changed his stage name to George Formby. Although rumoured to have picked his new surname after seeing it as a destination on a railway carriage, the main sources agree this story is likely to be apocryphal. The origin of the Formby name is more likely to have been a suggestion from Dennis Clarke, the manager of the Argyle Theatre in Birkenhead, while George was chosen in honour of the music hall star George Robey. Formby first used his new stage name in Birkenhead in 1897.\n\nOne of the earliest characters Formby developed was \"John Willie\". Baz Kershaw, the professor of theatre, described the character as Formby's \"onstage alter ego\", while the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards describes Willie as \"the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad in baggy trousers, tight jacket, and bowler hat, slow-talking, hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through.\" His costume included ill-fitting clothes, large boots worn on the wrong feet, and a variety of hats; he would often carry a cane. In 1908 he lent one of his costumes to a young Charlie Chaplin when the latter was touring with Fred Karno's troupe; Chaplin also incorporated Formby's cane twirl and duck-like walk into his act.\nIn 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old music hall performer, and they married in her home town of Halifax in August. Little is known about Salter, although the 1901 census shows that she was still living with her parents. The marriage does not appear to have been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, there is no evidence of a divorce between the couple and no information relating to when the couple separated.\n\nIn 1897 or 1898 Formby was signed to appear at the Lyceum Theatre, Blackburn, supporting the magician Walford Bodie; a 40-week tour followed, with Formby earning 30 shillings a week. In 1898, while performing at the Wigan Empire as part of the tour, Formby met Eliza Hoy, the daughter of the Empire's cashier. The couple married in August the following year at Wigan Registry Office, although this marriage was bigamous because of his union two years previously with Salter. In the months after their marriage, Eliza persuaded Formby to join the Roman Catholic Church, which helped her parents overcome their initial distrust of him. Formby and Eliza had thirteen children, of whom seven survived: four daughters and three sons. The cultural historian David Bret states that Formby was \"possessed of staggering consumptive virility\", as the comedian also had several children with other partners. Eliza became an important figure in Formby's professional life, making his costumes and standing in the wings during his performances to help him. Eliza also continued working as a seamstress and would sell chips during lunchtimes to supplement the family's income.\n\nIn 1902 Formby performed for the first time in London, when he was booked by Ted Granville, the proprietor of the Royal Albert Music Hall in Canning Town, to appear for £3 a week; Granville subsequently became Formby's London agent. Eliza Formby later recounted that Belle Elmore, the wife (and later victim) of the murderer Dr Crippen, saw Formby perform, and was so impressed that she contacted Granville and told him to travel to Leeds to see the act. Formby soon transferred to the London Pavilion music hall, where he was immediately successful, and became \"an idol of the town\", according to \"The Times\". His popularity increased when Marie Lloyd, the influential music hall singer and actress, said that she would only watch two acts: his and Dan Leno's. Lloyd recommended Formby to the proprietor of the Tivoli Music Hall, who gave the comedian a ten-week run. Robey was also impressed, and in 1905 he recommended Formby as the lead in a pantomime in Newcastle at a salary of £35 a week. He was able to command £325 a week by 1920.\nAfter the Formbys had lost three daughters to early deaths, their first son, George Hoy Booth, was born in 1904. Although the boy was born unable to see owing to an obstructive caul, he gained his sight during a violent coughing fit or sneeze when he was a few months old. Over the course of 1904 Formby purchased the singing rights to 57 songs, more than his normal annual number of between 10 and 20; the average cost of his songs was around a guinea. Two years later he made his first recordings, on phonograph cylinders, for the Louis Sterling Cylinder Company, and in 1907 he signed a recording contract with Zonophone. He was one of the few performers who had no difficulties recording clearly with the primitive equipment, and he performed in a relaxed fashion for an invisible audience. He would sing his song and then talk to the listener using a variant of his normal stage patter. Some of those songs, such as \"Playing the Game out West\" and \"Since I Parted my Hair in the Middle\" have been identified by Dave Russell, the social historian, as \"clever depictions of a provincial innocent let lose in the capital\".\n\nFor much of January and February 1908 Formby appeared in various London music halls for which he received £20 a week. The following year, and staying in the capital, he played three halls a night in exchange for £45 a week. One such venue was the Tivoli with Lloyd and Little Tich as the headline acts. When not performing in London, Formby continued to tour the provincial music halls. In 1910 he again appeared at the Tivoli, and was reviewed in \"The Times\", in which the reporter opined that Formby \"becomes more of an artist the longer he sings\". Later that year Formby recorded what would become his most famous song, \"Standing at the Corner of the Street\", which he also co-wrote. By 1913 his record sales were strong enough for him to negotiate a new recording contract worth £300 a year.\n\nFormby's career received a further boost in July 1913 when he was one of seven acts to appear before George V and Queen Mary in a Royal Command Performance at Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool. \"The Times\" reported that Formby's \"broad humour succeeded with unexpected ease, and their Majesties praised him very highly after the performance.\" Formby was embarrassed by his performance. His usual act partly consisted of a running patter with the orchestra conductor, which he again did on this occasion; behind the conductor sat the royal party, and it looked to some that Formby was speaking disrespectfully to them. The king understood to whom Formby was talking, however, and afterwards presented him with a tiepin. In October Formby appeared in his second Royal Command Performance of the year, in a charity show organised by the French actress Sarah Bernhardt. He took part in two acts: a performance of \"Ten Little Nigger Boys All in a Row\", alongside other music hall entertainers including Robey, Mark Sheridan, Cicely Courtneidge and George Graves, followed by a short solo piece.\nIn March 1914 Formby appeared in \"No Fool Like an Old Fool\", a 20-minute-long silent comedy film, which is thought to be lost; it was his only film appearance, and little is known about the plot or his character. When the First World War broke out in August that year, he tried to enlist, but was turned down on medical grounds; instead he, like many music hall stars, was active in the recruiting campaign for the army and spoke at rallies, particularly on behalf of the Derby Scheme.\n\nFormby was always worried that his son George would watch him on stage, as he did not wish the boy to become a comic, saying \"one fool in the family is enough\". Nevertheless, although he had sent George away to train as a jockey, in 1915 he allowed his son to appear on screen, taking the lead part of a stable boy in \"By the Shortest of Heads\", a thriller directed by Bert Haldane. After the filming, Formby sent his son to Ireland, to continue his jockey training, and also sent the five horses Formby had purchased that year, which joined others he had previously bought.\n\nFormby was injured in June 1916 during rehearsals for the revue \"Razzle-Dazzle\", after a stage collapsed onto him at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. He suffered lung damage and was treated for a pulmonary haemorrhage at Guy's Hospital before recovering. Although he was the lead in the show, the premiere took place without him; it was criticised by reviewers, and \"The Observer\" thought that \"some of it seemed to have strayed in by mistake out of a second-rate provincial pantomime\". Formby returned within a week and the reviews were more positive, with \"The Observer\" stating that it was \"one of the successes of the season ... \"Razzle-Dazzle\" is now one of the liveliest revues in London, and the most spectacular\". By August the production had transferred to the Empire Theatre, Leicester Square.\nThe damage to Formby's lungs from the accident was exacerbated by tuberculosis, and he began to miss an increasing number of his appearances. In 1917 the Southport Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his lawyer said that Formby was dying of the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.\n\nFormby's health was further damaged in the influenza pandemic of 1918, during which he contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome and was unable to work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.\n\nIn early 1921 Formby was appearing at the Newcastle Empire in \"Jack and Jill\" when he collapsed after a show. He returned to his home near Warrington, where he died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 8 February, at the age of 45. He was buried in a family plot in the Catholic section of Warrington Cemetery. He left over £25,000 in his will, listing Eliza as executrix. As their marriage had been bigamous, he described her as \"my reputed wife Eliza Ann Booth, otherwise Eliza Ann Hoy\".\n\nThe obituarist for \"The Manchester Guardian\" wrote that Formby was one of the \"great drolls\" of the music hall whose humour \"always seemed to take its rise in a sympathetic perception of human vanities and weaknesses\". \"The Dundee Courier\" considered him a great comedian, made all the greater by his continuing to perform through his illness, while the drama critic J. T. Grein, writing in \"The Illustrated London News\", thought that Formby, \"along with [Harry] Lauder, Robey and [Albert] Chevalier, formed the leading quartette of the profession\".\n\nFormby was the first comic to use a delayed entrance as a joke to make the audience laugh before he arrived: his orchestra played his entrance music, and then he failed to appear on stage. His act included songs, described by Smart and Bothway Howard as \"characteristically simple, some with tunes derived from Methodist hymns, and with catchy choruses\", and he would chat to the orchestra conductor and front rows, punctuating his stage patter—delivered in a deadpan style—with his cough. He used his health—particularly the coughing—as part of his act, and would say that he was \"Coughin' well tonight!\" He also created the phrase \"It's not the cough that carries you off – it's the coffin they carries you off in!\" One of Formby's nicknames, \"The Wigan Nightingale\" was coined because of the way he used his bronchial cough in his act.\n\nThe \"John Willie\" character, like much of Formby's act, used pathos as one of the comedic drivers, \"but it was not contrived and was never mawkish\", according to Alan Randall and Ray Seaton, two of Formby Jr's biographers. In his examination of British screen stars, Geoffrey Macnab agrees, and identifies that although Formby's jokes were about himself, \"there was grit in the routines, a resolute denial of self-pity\". \"The Times\" examined the performer's style of humour, and considered it \"often crude, and always simple, but it was always true humour, and, what is more, it was invariably clean.\"\n\nMuch of Formby's humour was based in his north western roots, particularly Wigan, which he told people was where he was born, rather than Ashton. He would refer to taking his holidays at Wigan Pier, which was a small wooden platform on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal for loading coal, rather than a pleasure pier. \"The Manchester Guardian\" called him \"Lancashire's accredited representative on the London variety stage ... clown-satirist of genius\".\n\nWhen he performed in London, Formby would change his act, introducing himself as \"Good evening, I'm Formby fra' Wigan ... I've not been in England long\"; he slightly modified his stage persona, and he played \"the naïve boy trying to fit in with the sophisticated south\". Smart and Boothroyd consider that \"the contrast between his northern accent and metropolitan bravado was humorous, and the more urbane and sophisticated his audience the more George exaggerated his provincial gormlessness\".\n\nSix weeks after Formby's death, his son George first appeared on stage in a copy of his father's act; he initially appeared under the name George Hoy—using his mother's maiden name—but soon took his father's stage name. Formby Jr went on to become the top British male star in box office takings between 1937 and 1943, and the highest-paid entertainer in Britain.\n\nChaplin, who derived some of his stage persona from Formby's, sailed in 1908 with Karno's troupe to the United States, where he developed the character of the Tramp, the image of which became universally familiar by 1915. George Orwell later used Formby's humorous concept of \"Wigan Pier\" in the title of his 1937 study of depression and unemployment in the area, \"The Road to Wigan Pier\".\n\nFormby left over 190 recordings, and after his death \"The Times\" commented, \"There cannot be many people who have not heard at some time in their lives either the words or the refrain of 'John Willie – Come On', 'One of the Boys', 'I was Standing on the Corner of the Street', or 'Playing the Game in the West, songs described by Fisher as \"afizz with gaiety and champagne\".\n\nIn October 1922 a large marble memorial was unveiled at the site of Formby's grave, in the presence of Formby Jr, Eliza and a large crowd. The memorial later became the resting place for both the younger Formby and Eliza. In June 2012 a blue plaque was unveiled at Hodgson Street, Ashton, Formby's birthplace.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5216949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5216949", "title": "Larry Parnes", "text": "Larry Parnes\n\nLaurence Maurice Parnes (3 September 1929 – 4 August 1989) was an English pop manager and impresario. He was the first major British rock manager, and his stable of singers included many of the most successful British rock singers of the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nParnes' reputation has been damaged in recent years by testimony from many of the artists he managed in the late fifties and early sixties who were ruthlessly exploited, often worked to exhaustion on pay which was a tiny fraction of the profit he made from their talent. Shortly before his death, Parnes told an interviewer that his one regret was 'not to have looked after his bank balance better.' By this time Billy Fury had died in poverty having made Parnes a fortune.\n\nParnes was born to a Jewish family in Willesden, London. After leaving school he began work in a clothing store, and by the age of 18 ran a women's clothing shop in Romford, Essex. He then bought a share in a bar in Romilly Street, Soho. He agreed to invest in a touring play, \"The House of Shame\", which became both successful and notorious in 1954 after its publicist, John Kennedy, persuaded two actresses to stand outside the theatre dressed as prostitutes.\n\nIn 1956, with John Kennedy Parnes began to manage young rock and roll singer Tommy Hicks; he and John Kennedy approached his parents, after Steele, aged 19, had already signed another contract, which was under the legal age. Steele anglicised the name of his Swedish grandfather to become known as Tommy Steele. Steele achieved popular success, some of his songs being co-written by Parnes' friend Lionel Bart, and Parnes succeeded in presenting Steele as an \"all-round entertainer\". Parnes claimed in a court action that he and Kennedy took 40 per cent of Steele's \"gross takings\", out of which they had to pay 10 per cent to booking agents as well as the costs of Steele's accommodation, advertising and publicity, travel and other aspects \"needed to keep Tommy on the road to stardom\". This became the standard arrangement with Parnes' artists.\nAfter Steele's success, Parnes looked to find other young men who he could groom to become pop stars. At Bart's suggestion, he next signed Reg Patterson (né Smith), whom he re-christened Marty Wilde, and who also rose to pop stardom in the UK. Parnes developed a network of contacts within the British recording industry and entertainment business, with leading British songwriters providing songs for his growing stable of talent, and many of his protégés achieving success in the British pop charts. A flamboyant gay man, Parnes' approach was to select, and then groom, handsome young men who would be attractive to a teenage audience. He also gave them new stage names, which were rumoured to reflect what he considered to be their sexual characteristics. Among those he managed with at least some degree of success were Billy Fury (originally Ron Wycherley), Vince Eager (Roy Taylor), Dickie Pride (Richard Knellar), Lance Fortune (Chris Morris), Duffy Power (Ray Howard), Johnny Gentle (John Askew), Terry Dene (Terence Williams), Nelson Keene (Malcolm Holland), and Georgie Fame (Clive Powell). He also managed Tommy Bruce, as well as Joe Brown, who he unsuccessfully tried to persuade to change his name to Elmer Twitch.\n\nMusic journalist Richie Unterberger has commented:\n\nSometimes, Parnes employed his charges himself rather than being employed by them, and paid them a weekly wage. According to one report:\n\nThe BBC TV programme \"Panorama\" featured Parnes as a 'beat svengali' and the press gave him the nickname \"Mr Parnes, Shillings and Pence\". He was bitingly satirised as the manipulative \"Major Rafe Ralph\" by Peter Sellers, from a script by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, on the 1959 album \"Songs For Swingin' Sellers\".\n\nParnes also promoted concerts, including the 1960 tour by Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran during which Cochran was killed in a road crash. Later the same year he hired the Silver Beetles, an early incarnation of the then-unknown Beatles, to back one of his singers, Johnny Gentle, on a short tour of Scotland. Although Gentle tried to persuade him to manage the group, Parnes decided not to do so. Parnes developed the idea of the package tour, for which his stars toured the country together in a bus, playing one-night stands around the country. In 1962, he hired the Tornados as backing group for Billy Fury, and also claimed to have given \"their first breaks\" to entertainers Jimmy Tarbuck, Rolf Harris and Mike Yarwood.\n\nParnes remained an influential impresario even after the rise of the Beatles and other groups had eclipsed those in his stable. However, his attitude and approach rapidly became old-fashioned. In 1967 he announced that he was going to devote himself to the theatre, and in 1968 put on \"Fortune and Men's Eyes\", a play about homosexuality in a Canadian prison, but it lost money. He bought a lease of the Cambridge Theatre in 1972, where during his tenure the first UK production of \"Chicago\" played. During the 1970s he ran the business affairs of the Olympic ice skater John Curry and presented two stage productions with him at the Cambridge Theatre and at the London Palladium. He also persuaded actress Joan Collins to perform her first West End play, \"The Last of Mrs Cheyney\", at his theatre in 1976.\n\nParnes was a horse racing fan, and owned racehorses, including Cambridge Gold, named after his involvement in the Cambridge Theatre and John Curry. He had a penthouse property in South Kensington, and country mansions in Send, Surrey, and Icklesham, East Sussex.\n\nParnes retired in 1981 and died from meningitis in London in 1989, aged 59. His obituary in the \"Daily Telegraph\" said:\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n"}

{"id": "733884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733884", "title": "Loi Krathong", "text": "Loi Krathong\n\nLoi Krathong (, ) is a Siamese festival celebrated annually throughout the Kingdom of Thailand and in nearby countries with significant southwestern Tai cultures (Laos, Shan, Mon, Tanintharyi, Kelantan, Kedah and Xishuangbanna). The name could be translated as \"to float a basket,\" and comes from the tradition of making \"krathong\" or buoyant, decorated baskets, which are then floated on a river.\n\n\"Loi Krathong\" takes place on the evening of the full moon of the 12th month in the traditional Thai lunar calendar, thus the exact date of the festival changes every year. In the Western calendar this usually falls in the month of November. In Chang Mai, the festival lasts three days, and in 2018, the dates will be 21-23 November.\n\nIn Thailand, the festival is known as \"Loi Krathong\" (ลอยกระทง). Outside Thailand, this festival is celebrated under different names, including India as the \"Kartik Poornima\" or \"Tripurari Poornima\", Myanmar as the \"Tazaungdaing festival\", Sri Lanka as \"Il Full Moon Poya\" and Cambodia as \"Bon Om Touk\".\n\nAccording to the \"Royal Institute Dictionary\" 1999, \"loi\" (ลอย) means \"to float\", while \"krathong\" (กระทง) has various meanings, one of which is \"a small container made of leaves which can be floated on water during the \"Loi Krathong\" festival\". \"Krathong\" is traditionally a small leaf container which is made to hold a small portion of goods like a traditional Thai dish (such as \"Hor Mok\") or dessert. The traditional krathong used for floating at the festival are made from a slice of a banana tree trunk or a spider lily plant. Modern krathongs are more often made of bread or Styrofoam. A bread krathong will disintegrate after a few days and can be eaten by fish. Banana stalk krathong are also biodegradable, but Styrofoam krathongs are sometimes banned, as they pollute the rivers and may take years to decompose. A krathong is decorated with elaborately-folded banana leaves, three incense sticks, and a candle. A small coin is sometimes included as an offering to the river spirits.\n\nOn the night of the full moon, Thais launch their krathong on a river, canal or a pond, making a wish as they do so. The festival may originate from an ancient rural ritual paying respect to the water spirits. The floats are thought to have been introduced to Chiang Mai in 1947 and have since been incorporated into local culture.\n\nGovernment offices, corporations, and other organizations launch large decorated krathongs. There are competitions for the best of these large krathongs. A beauty contest is a regular feature and fireworks have become common in recent years.\n\nLoi Krathong is often claimed to have begun in the Sukhothai by a court lady named Nopphamat. However, it is now known that the Nopphamat tale comes from a poem written in the early Bangkok period. According to King Rama IV, writing in 1863, it was a Brahmanical festival that was adapted by Thai Buddhists in Thailand to honor the Buddha, Prince Siddhartha Gautama. The candle venerates the Buddha with light, while the krathong's floating symbolizes letting go of all one's hatred, anger, and defilements. People sometimes cut their fingernails or hair and place the clippings on the krathong as a symbol of letting go of past transgressions and negative thoughts. Many Thais use the krathong to thank the Goddess of Water, the Hindu Goddess Ganga, Phra Mae Khongkha ().\n\nThe beauty contests that accompany the festival are known as \"Nopphamat Queen Contests\". According to legend, Nang Nopphamat (; alternatively spelled as \"Noppamas\" or \"Nopamas\") was a consort of the 13th century Sukhothai king Sri Indraditya (who is also known as Phra Ruang) and she had been the first to float a decorated raft. However, this is a new story which was invented during the first part of the 19th century. There is no evidence that a Nang Nopphamat ever existed. Instead, it is a matter of fact that a woman of this name was the leading character of a novel released at the end of the reign of King Rama III, around 1850 CE. Her character was written as guidance for all women who wished to become civil servants.\n\nKelantan in Malaysia celebrates Loi Krathong similarly, especially in the Tumpat area. The ministry in charge of tourism in Malaysia recognises it as an attraction for tourists. Many people visit the celebration each year.\n\nLoi Krathong coincides with the Lanna (northern Thai) festival known as \"Yi Peng\" (). \"Yi\" means 'two' and \"peng\" means a 'full moon day'. \"Yi Peng\" refers to the full moon day in the second month according to the Lanna lunar calendar (the twelfth month of the Thai lunar calendar). The festival is meant as a time to make merit (; ).\n\nSwarms of sky lanterns (; ), literally: 'floating lanterns', are launched into the air. Khom loi are made from a thin fabric, such as rice paper, stretched over a bamboo or wire frame, to which a candle or fuel cell is attached. When the fuel cell is lit, the resulting hot air is trapped inside the lantern and creates enough lift for the khom loi to float into the sky.\n\nAccording to the \"Bangkok Post\", the association of lanterns with the November festivities is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating back to the first decade of the 21st century, when introduced by local tourism authorities.\n\nBecause they are a hazard to passing aircraft and \"...can cause damage to important places in the areas such as the Grand Palace [sic], temples and governmental offices...\" khom loi are increasingly subject to governmental restrictions. In Chiang Mai, authorities cancelled 78 flights in and out of Chiang Mai Airport on 3–4 November 2017. Another 79 flights were rescheduled. Despite those measures, the remains of more than 100 lanterns were later found on airport premises. In Bangkok, the public are prohibited from using fireworks and sky lanterns entirely. Violators may face three years imprisonment and/or a fine of 60,000 baht. One hundred-ninety piers on the Chao Phraya River will be open to the public to float their krathongs. In 2018, up to 158 flights were cancelled or rescheduled at three airports, and in Bangkok 88 piers were closed.\n\nDuring the festival, some people also decorate their houses, gardens, and temples with \"khom fai\" (), intricately shaped paper lanterns which take on different forms. \"Khom thue\" () are lanterns which are carried around hanging from a stick, \"khom khwaen\" () are the hanging lanterns, and \"khom pariwat\" (), which are placed at temples and which revolve due to the heat of the candle inside. The most elaborate \"Yi Peng\" celebrations can be seen in Chiang Mai, the ancient capital of the former Lanna kingdom, where now both \"Loi Krathong\" and \"Yi Peng\" are celebrated at the same time resulting in lights floating on the waters, lights hanging from trees/buildings or standing on walls, and lights floating in the sky. The tradition of \"Yi Peng\" was also adopted by certain parts of Laos during the 16th century.\n\nIn 2016, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) cleaned six tonnes of rubbish from the city's waterways on the day after Loi Krathong. The city governor said that 661,935 floats were collected from waterways across Bangkok. Of these, 617,901 (93.7 percent) were made of decomposible natural materials, while 44,034 were non-biodegradable Styrofoam floats. There were 163,679 fewer krathong collected than in 2015. The city mobilized 210 workers and 45 boats to collect floats from the Chao Phraya River and canals.\n\nIn Nakhon Ratchasima, 50 workers collected krathong from the moat in the town centre near the Thao Suranaree Monument. In Buriram, more than 200 workers and volunteers in Mueang District cleared at least 20,000 krathong from the town's moat. There, Styrofoam krathong will be banned in 2017. In Lampang, more than 100 students and teachers from the Institute of Physical Education helped municipal workers clean up the Wang River in Mueang District.\n\nIn 2018, after the festivities, Bangkok city workers cleared 841,327 krathongs, up from 3.6 percent in 2017, from the Chao Phraya River, local canals, and 30 public parks; 5.3 percent of them were made from styrofoam.\n\n\n"}

They have won both local and international acclaim, as well as numerous awards.\n\nThey are best known for the imaginative re-inventions of Shakespeare and their original African works. They have had a long relationship with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and have close links to Reps Theatre.\n\nOver the Edge first performed on 29 October 1994 at the Avondale Summer Arts Festival in Harare. The members had been friends for years, many having been in Repteens, and were invited to perform some street theatre. This rough and ready performance was the beginning of a long and successful relationship. The group was praised for its talent and enthusiasm but it was especially noted for its racial diversity. Although racial diversity had been standard practise in Zimbabwe Theatres and Theatrical companies since the 1960s, the majority of performers were inevitably white. Over the Edge, on the other hand, had more or less equal ratios of black, white and \"coloured\" members. For most of the company's existence Over the Edge had no formal artistic director, with all members contributing to the vision and growth of the group. Towards the end of their 10 year lifespan Wiina Msamati.\nwas appointed artistic director for a short period. The group's final theatre piece as 'Over the Edge' was a production of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" in 2004. \n\nThe group performed numerous \"re-imaginations\" of Shakespeare, Arthur Miller, Moliere and Joe Orten. These adaptations were often set in Zimbabwe (or in an imagined Southern African country, similar to Zimbabwe) and had many satirical references to Zimbabwe's political scene. The group also performed numerous original comic political satires, with the group's trademark extremism.\n\nThe group won international acclaim when its productions of \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Eternal Peace Asylum\" were performed at the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The group got standing ovations, glowing reviews and packed houses. They won the \"Spirit of The Fringe\" award for \"Twelfth Night\" and Wiina Msamati was nominated for \"Best Actor\" in the Stage Awards for Acting Excellence, run by the London newspaper \"The Stage\". The group went on to tour the United States in March 2001, playing at the American Repertory Theater in Boston and many other venues. The productions of \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Eternal Peace Asylum\" were well received by the American audiences.\n\nIn October 2000, three members of the group performed at the Amsterdam International Improvisation Festival. Their improvised production of \"Long Form\" gained an instant standing ovation. Some time later, members of the group also represented Zimbabwe at the World Improv Championships in 2006, a cultural event attached to the FIFA World Cup in Germany that year. \n\n\"Born African\" is, undeniably, Over the Edge's most successful production to date. Written by Kevin Hanssen, Wiina (Lucian) Msamati and Craig Peter, with additional material by Adam Neill. It was directed by Zane E. Lucas.\n\nThe show has many characters, each actor playing multiple parts, but it centres around the lives of three people living in Zimbabwe: a white lawyer, a coloured youth and a black servant. The production used minimal set and costume, with the donning of a single item of clothing being enough to change character. The three cast members all wore black face paint, in order to bring the characters to the same level.\n\nThe show's main strength was its portrayal of ordinary people in Zimbabwe, a view that is rarely seen in other countries. The show also portrayed lesser well known issues, such as black on black violence, mixed-race relationships and colonial hangovers. The show's central focus, on the other hand, was what it actually meant to \"Be African\". The show ends with the characters thinking of leaving Zimbabwe, but realising that they were \"born African\" and deciding to stay.\n\nThe play was first shown at the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA), before it was reworked and shown at the 2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It was critically acclaimed and the cast were nominated for \"Best Ensemble\" in The Stage Awards.\n\n Over the Edge's last show was their 10 year anniversary in 2004, which was also a reunion of the group. Today the group's members are spread far and wide. Lucian Msamati (also known as Wiina) has been following a successful career in the UK. Craig Peter, and Zane E. Lucas went onto create a theatre development group called Theory X in Zimbabwe. Gavin Peter continues to teach, his passion, and is the Chairman of the Allied Arts Festival in Zimbabwe, a large performing arts festival for school students. Kevin Hanssen lives and works as a performing artist and teacher in Southern Africa and abroad. Adam Neill continues with an acting career in Cape Town, South Africa. Karin Alexander lives and works in Cape Town and Chipo Chung continues to pursue a successful career as an actor and director in the UK and America.\n\n\nOther notable performers who have been in Over the Edge productions include Danai Gurira, Erica Schofield and Michael Pearce.\n\nOver the Edge collaborated with a number of notable Zimbabwean directors and designers over the years, including Di Wilson, Dawn Parkinson, Heeten Bhagat, Stephen Hanly, Heather Cameron, Jacqui Taylor and Laurie MacPherson.\n\n\n"}

The term was popularized by journalist Paulo Henrique Amorim in his blog. Whenever he uses the term, Amorim writes it with an \"i\" in lowercase as a pun with the name of the web portal where he was a journalist before he was dismissed on March 18, 2008, which he describes as a process of \"ideological cleansing\".\n\nThe term is also used by journalists Luiz Carlos Azenha and Rodrigo Vianna on their blogs, which also helped to spread its popularity.\n\nThe term gained notoriety when it was first used in the Brazilian Congress in a speech by Pernambuco Congressman Fernando Ferro, a member of the Workers' Party. He said that film director and Rede Globo commentator Arnaldo Jabor should run for \"President of the PIG\".\n\nPaulo Henrique Amorim explains the expression whenever he uses it in his articles. According to him, \"In no serious democracy in the world, conservative, low-quality and even sensationalistic newspapers, and one single television network matter as much as they do in Brazil. They have become a political party – the PiG, Pro-coup Press Party\". Amorim said that some politicians have become part of the PiG. He said that \"the political parties are no longer an instrument of the coup but they have become the coup itself. Pretending [to do] objective journalism, they not only do the job of a press that omits information; but do the job of a press that lies, distorts and deceits. Former President FHC was among the first politicians who realized that the political strength he needed could be found in the PIG, and thus nowadays he enjoys the image of being a prominent world leader\".\n\nPaulo Henrique said that the mainstream Brazilian press historically defends coup d'états whenever the Brazilian President is not elected from among members of the ruling elites. The PIG, according to Amorim, had its origin with Carlos Lacerda, whom he says \"helped to kill Getúlio Vargas\". It continued its \"struggle against democracy\" throughout the governments of Juscelino Kubitscheck and João Goulart, when finally \"it openly defended and promoted the Brazilian military putsch of March 1964\". According to him, the mass media also \"hammered Rio's governor Brizola throughout his two terms in office, and now conspires against Lula\". Political scientist Wanderley Guilherme dos Santos, who predicted the overthrow of President João Goulart in 1964, said in an interview with \"CartaCapital\" in 2005 that the \"mainstream media led Vargas to commit suicide based on nothing; it almost prevented Juscelino from taking office based on nothing; it led to Jânio resignation, taking advantage of his craziness, based on nothing; it tried to prevent Goulart's inauguration based on nothing\".\n\nIn September 1998, on the eve of the dispute between Lula (Brazilian left candidate, from PT party) and FHC (seen as the right candidate, but with center-left trend, from PSDB party), Amorim led a crusade against Lula on TV Bandeirantes. In an ongoing battle, Amorim attacked Lula in all editions of the main news program of Bandeirantes. Lula sued Paulo Henrique Amorim and TV Bandeirantes, who apologized to PT publicly. When the PT was in opposition, Amorim attacked Lula. However, after the PT went into government, Amorim became his staunch supporter.\n\nAbout the resignation of the IG portal, the site has a page that informs simply discontinued the contract with the journalist:\nOver time, contract costs and market conditions made it impossible to maintain it. Taking the decision , all termination conditions are met and the journalist properly indemnified . Employees of the blog \"Conversa Afiada\" blog, present at the headquarters of IG at the time it was dispatched the notice of termination, and the site removed from the network, were given the opportunity to take away the materials needed, but they did not. Paulo Henrique Amorim preferred to act under the force of a warrant of search and seizure to remove their belongings and copy the file from his site, what he could have done without judicial review. Discontinue collaboration is part of corporate life and the lives of journalists . Paulo Henrique has gone through companies such as Editora Abril, Jornal do Brasil, TV Globo, TV Bandeirantes, TV Cultura and TV UOL \" - all supposedly part of the \"party media coup.\n\nIn 2012, Amorim was ordered to pay compensation of R$30,000 to journalist Heraldo Pereira (Globo), having stated on his blog that Pereira was a \"black with white soul,\" which was considered a manifestation of racism, at a session held in Justice Court of the Federal District.\n\nAccording to writer Fernando Soares Campos, \"without the internet, Lula would have hardly been elected; if he had, he would not take office; if he had taken office, he would have been ousted with ease\". He argues that \"the PIG is strong, is Goliath, but the internet is filled with Davids\". Campos says that the mere existence of the internet interferes with the monopoly of information by large media groups, and this interference hampers coups.\n\nAccording to Paulo Henrique Amorim, only three Brazilian families control the mainstream Brazilian media: the Marinhos (Roberto Marinho, Organizações Globo), the Mesquitas (Julio de Mesquita, Grupo Estado) and the Frias (Octávio Frias, Grupo Folha). According to Amorim, they dominate and condition news in Brazil, through their various newspapers, radio stations, news agencies and internet blogs. They have provoked what Amorim calls \"a massacre\" of the smaller Brazilian regional press, as a consequence of the control they exert on all of the mainstream information, in order to manipulate the Brazilian public opinion.\n\nProfessor Sérgio Mattos, writing in 2005 on media control and censorship in Brazil and elsewhere, also cited the influence of these tycoons, adding, however, two other groups:\n\nIn May 2013, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Brazil, Joaquim Barbosa, in a speech in Costa Rica during World Press Freedom Day, said that there is a lack of political and ideological diversity in the Brazilian press and identified a right-wing bias in that group:\n\nAs one of the main drivers of the acronym \"PiG\", Paulo Henrique Amorim is accused by the conservative journalist Reinaldo Azevedo of promoting two eternal campaigns: one electoral, and another against the newspaper \"Folha de S. Paulo\" and its managing editor. Azevedo said that everything would be done under the auspices of the Brazilian Government, through the advertising budget of a state bank, the Caixa Econômica Federal. According to opponents of the term, the press denounces irregularities in public administration, like several well-known cases of corruption. J.R. Guzzo, \"Veja\"'s columnist, questioned the term \"PiG\", saying that when the press publishes complaints it is accused by the government of \"destabilizing\" Brazil. So, the use of the term would be an attempt to put the population against the press.\n\nAccording to journalist Pedro Doria, the manifestation of an ideological polarity is intolerant and unable to explain a complex social reality. Sergio Leo believes that the mainstream press is too complex to be labeled this way because it would encompass very different opinions and agendas.\n\nHowever, the President of the \"Associação Nacional de Jornais – ANJ\" (\"National Newspaper Association\") Maria Judith Brito said the Brazilian press has assumed the role of a political agent in the 2010 presidential election. Brito is an executive of the \"Folha de S. Paulo\" newspaper and was once a candidate for councilwoman for the Workers' Party. Brito said that the media has taken on the role of the opposition to the Lula administration:\n\nAbout Brito's speech, journalist Luciano Martins Costa of Observatório da Imprensa said that:\n\n"}

The first club opened at 116 E. Walton Street in downtown Chicago, Illinois, United States, on February 29, 1960. Each club generally featured a Living Room, a Playmate Bar, a Dining Room, and a Club Room. Members and their guests were served food and drinks by Playboy Bunnies, some of whom were featured in \"Playboy\" magazine. The clubs offered name entertainers and comedians in the Club Rooms, and local musicians and the occasional close-up magician in the Living Rooms. Starting with the London and Jamaica club locations, the Playboy Club became international in scope. In 1991, the club chain became defunct. On October 6, 2006 a new club was opened in Las Vegas, and in 2010 new clubs were opened as well in Macao and Cancun. In time the Las Vegas club closed on June 4, 2012, the Macao club closed in 2013 and the Cancun club closed in 2014. In May 2014 the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles opened a Playboy themed lounge consisting of gaming tables and Playboy Bunny cocktail waitresses.\n\nThe Playboy Club New York opens on 9/12 with a private party, and a public event on 9/15 with the eelectronic artist RJD2. \n\nThe first Playboy Club opened in Chicago in 1960, and later there were clubs in Miami, New Orleans, New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Detroit, San Francisco, Boston, Des Moines, Kansas City, Phoenix, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Denver, Dallas, Buffalo, St. Petersburg, FL, Lansing, San Diego, Columbus, Lake Geneva, WI, Omaha and St. Louis. There was also a Playboy Club in Canada, in Montreal. Playboy Clubs operated in Japan, under a franchise arrangement, in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Sapporo. There were Playboy Club resorts in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, Great Gorge at McAfee, New Jersey, and at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, as well as Club-Hotels such as the Playboy Plaza in Miami Beach, Florida and Playboy Towers in Chicago. The last American location before Playboy Club Las Vegas opened was Lansing, Michigan, located in the Hilton Hotel, which closed in 1988. International Clubs existed until the 1991 closing of the Manila, Philippines Club located in the Silahis International Hotel. In 2010 International Clubs were opened in Macao and Cancun but in time the Macao Club closed in 2013 and the Cancun Club closed in 2014. Manila was the only Club ever to be featured in \"Architectural Digest\". During the last three months of 1961, more than 132,000 people visited the Chicago club, making it the busiest night club in the world. Playboy Club membership became a status symbol. Only 21% of all key holders ever went to a club. At $25.00 per year per membership, Playboy grossed $25 million for every 1,000,000 members.\n\nThe Rabbit-headed metal Playboy key (supplanted by a metal key-card in 1966) was required for admission to a club. They were presented to the Door Bunny. Through most of the years, a strict dress code was enforced.\n\nIn 1965, Hugh Hefner sent Victor Lownes to London to open Playboy's British casinos, following legalization of gambling in the United Kingdom. In 1981, the casino at 45 Park Lane (now a luxury hotel, 45 Park Lane) was the most profitable casino in the world, and the British casinos contributed $32 million to the corporation. Later, Playboy also operated British casinos in Manchester and Portsmouth. In 1981, Playboy opened a hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. However, the New Jersey gaming regulators denied Playboy a permanent gaming licence, and Playboy sold its interest in the unit to Elsinore Corporation, its partner in the venture, in 1984, at which time the hotel and casino were renamed The Atlantis.\n\nThe Playboy Club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, had a ski slope and was one of the first to install a chair lift. Its \"Playmate Bar\" featured the Russ Long Trio and its showroom was managed by Carlo Cicirello. The 32-piece house orchestra was headed by Chicago pianist, Sam Distefano, who was also Playboy's Vice-President in charge of booking all the entertainment for all Playboy Clubs and Hotels worldwide for 25 years. The Lighter Side Trio entertained at all of the Playboy Clubs from 1972 to 1975, led by Joe DiPietro, with Douglas Brett and Charles Raimond.\n\nOn October 6, 2006, Playboy opened a new Playboy Club in Las Vegas, Nevada. The new club at The Palms, with its prominent neon bunny head, had casinos, bars, and a restroom with pictures of Playmates on the walls. The club closed in June 2012.\n\nAustralian women were invited to Sydney to audition for the iconic Playboy Bunny role and for positions as singers and dancers at the Playboy Club. A minimum of five women were chosen to travel to Macao for a six-month contract as a Playboy Bunny. The Macao Playboy Club opened on November 24, 2010.\n\nIn October 2010, it was announced that a new Playboy Club in London was to be opened on the site of the old Rendezvous Mayfair Casino 14 Old Park Lane. It was opened on June 4, 2011. The 17,000 sq ft property, spread over two floors, was designed by London-based architects Jestico + Whiles. The club features a casino, cigar terrace, gentleman's tonic, sports bar (\"The Player's Lounge\"), night club (\"The Tale Bar\"), cocktail bar under the direction of Salvatore Calabrase, and a fine dining restaurant under the reins of Iron Chef Judy Joo. Along the stair-walls, a row of lenticular portraits are hung winking and smiling at guests as they walk by.\n\nIn November 2012, spokesperson Sanjay Gupta announced that PB Lifestyle, the company in India with rights to the brand, would be opening its first club in India at Candolim, Goa in December 2012. It was planned as a beach location. In April 2013, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar refused the application on \"technical grounds\". Parrikar said only individuals, not corporations, were eligible to operate a beach shack style club. The law did not preclude opening a night club. After the Goa club, PB Lifestyle planned to open clubs in Hyderabad and Mumbai. India's obscenity laws ban material deemed \"lascivious or appealing to prurient interests\". Adult magazines such as \"Playboy\" are banned in India. Designer Mohini Tadikonda has altered the original Playboy Bunnies uniform to satisfy India's obscenity laws.\n\n\n\n"}

RSI handles production and broadcasting of radio and television programs in Italian for Switzerland (Italian-speaking Switzerland). RSI's administrative headquarters are located in Via Canevascini in Lugano-Besso.\n\n\"Radio svizzera di lingua italiana\" was established in 1925 as \"Radio Monte Ceneri\", originally named after the mountain where the transmitter was placed. After several years of experimental broadcast, in 1933 the \"Società svizzera di Radiodiffusione\" (Swiss Radio Broadcasting Corporation) began regular transmissions in Ticino and Grigioni. The intentions of its founders were to promote cohesion in the confederation while promoting the value of the Swiss Italian culture. In the 1930s and 1940s, when most of Switzerland's neighboring states were under fascism, Radio Monte Ceneri was the only Italian language radio free of censorship, becoming the only reliable voice for the Italian population and a prominent outlet for Italian intellectuals: during these years it hosted people like Benedetto Croce and Delio Tessa.\n\nThe first television broadcasts started on 18 November 1958, at first produced in studios in Zurich and transmitted with Italian subtitles. In 1961, with the foundation of Televisione svizzera di lingua italiana (TSI), the studios were relocated in Paradiso, near Lugano. This was eight years after the experimental debut of television in Zurich and Genève. The channel began broadcasting in colour in 1968.\n\nDuring the 1970s, when Italian television was still under the RAI monopoly, Swiss television in Italian was the only alternative to the public network for Italians living in Lombardy and Piedmont: the signal reached the city of Milan.

It can be found in modern and postmodern dance, and has been influenced by the work of modern dance pioneers, therapeutic movement techniques such as Feldenkrais and Alexander Technique, and yoga and martial arts.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries dancers began to question the rigidity and formality of classical ballet. Isadora Duncan in particular articulated the need for dance which she described as being connected to the earth, sensuality and the natural body. In pursuit of this goal, pioneers such as Margeret D'Oubler, Martha Graham, Rudolf von Laban and Doris Humphrey began to invent new dance techniques that involved radically different movement.\n\nElements of release technique began to emerge as these pioneers, and protégés such as Merce Cunningham, Jose Limon, Irmgard Bartenieff, Erick Hawkins and Anna Halprin, contributed further ideas and inventions. For example, D'Oubler envisioned dance based on scientific analysis of human anatomy and movement; Humphrey's technique focused on allowing gravity and momentum to affect the body; Hawkins advanced the idea that physiologically efficient movement is inherently beautiful. Some elements were the result of exploring other movement disciplines. For example, Hawkins invited proponents of Ideokinesis to teach his dance company, and others were influenced by F.M. Alexander's concepts.\n\nThe phrase \"release technique\" emerged in the 1970s. Modern dancer Joan Skinner created \"Skinner releasing technique\", which employed elements of Alexander Technique, and Mary Fulkerson created \"Anatomical Release Techique\" based on the work of Mabel Elsworth Todd, Bonnie Bainbridge-Cohen and others.\n\nToday elements of release technique can be found in contact improvisation, Tai Chi, yoga, and somatic practices such as the Feldenkrais method. In dance, it is usually taught as an integrated part of contemporary dance classes and, less frequently, in classes that focus on release technique.\n\n\n"}

It was directed by Tommy Haines and Andrew Sherburne.\n\nIn a farmhouse basement on the Iowa countryside, eccentric collector Mike Zahs makes a remarkable discovery: the showreels of the man who brought moving pictures to America’s Heartland. Among the treasures: rare footage of President Teddy Roosevelt, the first moving images from Burma, a lost relic from magical effects godfather Georges Méliés. These are the films that introduced movies to the world. And they didn’t end up in Iowa by accident. The old nitrate reels are just some of the artifacts that belonged to William Franklin Brinton. From thousands of trinkets, handwritten journals, receipts, posters and catalogs emerges the story of an inventive farmboy who became America’s greatest barnstorming movieman. As Mike uncovers this hidden legacy, he begins a journey to restore the Brinton name that takes us to The Library of Congress, Paris and back for a big screen extravaganza in the same small-town movie theater where Frank first turned on a projector over a century ago.

The film stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow, and was produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and Abrams's production company Bad Robot Productions. \"The Force Awakens\" is the first \"Star Wars\" film to not involve franchise creator George Lucas. Set 30 years after \"Return of the Jedi\", the film follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight alongside the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire.\n\n\"The Force Awakens\" was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) and \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, the composer for the previous six films, returned to compose the film's score. Lucas served as creative consultant during the film's early production. Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, and concluded in November 2014. It is the first live-action \"Star Wars\" film since \"\" (2005).\n\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" was widely anticipated, and Disney backed the film with extensive marketing campaigns. It premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 2015 before its wide release in the United States on December 18. The film received positive reviews, with praise for its acting, screenplay, direction, musical score, visual effects, and action sequences, although it received some criticism for being derivative of the original trilogy. The film and became, unadjusted for inflation, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise, the highest-grossing film in North America, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $2 billion and a net profit of over $780 million. It received five Academy Award nominations and four British Academy Film Award nominations, where it won the award for Best Special Visual Effects. It was followed by \"\" in December 2017, with \"\" scheduled for release in 2019.\n\nThirty years after the Galactic Civil War, the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes them while Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker.\n\nOn the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka. Stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren destroy the village and capture Poe, while Kylo kills San Tekka. Poe's droid BB-8 escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger, Rey, near a junkyard settlement. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, unwilling to kill for the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter; Poe names FN-2187 \"Finn\". As they turn back toward Jakku to retrieve BB-8, they are shot down by a First Order Star Destroyer and crash-land on the planet. Finn survives and assumes Poe died in the crash. He encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Finn, Rey, and BB-8 flee the planet in the \"Millennium Falcon\", which they steal from a junkyard.\n\nThe \"Falcon\" is captured by a larger ship piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, looking to reclaim their former vessel. They are attacked by gangs seeking to settle debts with Han, and flee in the \"Falcon\". The gangs inform the First Order. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon that harnesses star energy, Supreme Leader Snoke allows General Hux to use the weapon for the first time. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Kylo says Han means nothing to him.\n\nThe \"Falcon\" crew determines BB-8's map is incomplete. Han explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meets with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers assistance getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Rey is drawn to a secluded vault and finds the lightsaber that once belonged to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.\n\nStarkiller Base fires and destroys the Republic capital star system and a portion of its fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash on Jakku. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han and Chewbacca. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes by using a Jedi mind trick on a nearby guard.\n\nAt the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking a critical facility. Using the \"Falcon\", Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo refuses and kills Han, enraging Chewbacca, who shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy Starkiller Base.\n\nThe injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Kylo defeats Finn in a lightsaber duel, leaving him badly wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and uses the Force to defeat Kylo before they are separated by a fissure as the planet begins to disintegrate. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Rey and Chewbacca escape with the unconscious Finn in the \"Falcon\". On D'Qar, the Resistance celebrates while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey follows to the oceanic planet Ahch-To. She finds Luke and presents him with the lightsaber.\n\n\nTim Rose and Mike Quinn reprise their respective roles as Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb from \"Return of the Jedi\". Kipsang Rotich returns as the voice of Nien Nunb and Erik Bauersfeld returns to voice Ackbar. This was Bauersfeld's final film role before his death in April 2016. Kenny Baker, originally announced as part of the cast, was credited as \"consultant\" for R2-D2, with Jimmy Vee performing some of the work for R2-D2. Ewan McGregor has an uncredited vocal cameo as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Rey's vision sequence, while archival audio of Frank Oz and Alec Guinness as Yoda and Kenobi, respectively, are also used in the same scene; Oz recorded new dialogue for the film, but it was replaced with preexisting audio from \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\n\nGwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma, the commander of the First Order's legions of stormtroopers.\nDave Chapman and Brian Herring served as puppeteers for BB-8, with Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz credited as \"Vocal Consultants\". Ken Leung appears as Statura, an admiral in the Resistance. Simon Pegg appears as Unkar Plutt, the Junkyard dealer on Jakku. Greg Grunberg plays Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley, an X-wing pilot. Kiran Shah plays Teedo, a scavenger on Jakku who rides a semi-mechanical Luggabeast. Jessica Henwick appears as Jess \"Testor\" Pava or Jess Testor, an X-wing pilot. Brian Vernel appears as Bala-Tik, the leader of the Guavian Death Gang. Yayan Ruhian, Iko Uwais, and Cecep Arif Rahman appear as Tasu Leech, Razoo Qin-Fee, and Crokind Shand, members of the Kanjiklub Gang, a criminal organization. Warwick Davis appears as Wollivan, a tavern-dweller in Maz Kanata's castle. Anna Brewster appears as Bazine Netal, a First Order spy, also at Maz Kanata's castle. Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Kate Fleetwood play First Order Petty Officers, Thanisson and Unamo, respectively. Billie Lourd, daughter of Carrie Fisher, appears as Connix, a lieutenant in the Resistance. Members of the Resistance include Emun Elliott as Brance and Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Korr Sella while Harriet Walter appears as Kalonia, the doctor who tends to Chewbacca. Mark Stanley appears as a Knight of Ren. Sebastian Armesto portrays Lieutenant Mitaka and Pip Torrens portrays Colonel Caplan, both serving the First Order.\n\nDaniel Craig, Michael Giacchino and Nigel Godrich cameo as stormtroopers. Abrams's assistant, Morgan Dameron, appears as a Resistance officer, while his father, Gerald W. Abrams, appears as Captain Cypress. The film's dialect coach, Andrew Jack, appears as Major Ematt of the Resistance. Additionally, Crystal Clarke, Pip Andersen, Christina Chong, Miltos Yerolemou, Amybeth Hargreaves, Leanne Best, Judah Friedlander, and Kevin Smith were cast in minor roles. Abrams has a vocal cameo, singing with Lin-Manuel Miranda on two songs, \"Jabba Flow\" and \"Dobra Doompa\", performed by Shag Kava, consisting of Abrams, Miranda and musicians. \"\" and \"Star Wars Rebels\" cast members Dee Bradley Baker, Matt Lanter, Tom Kane, Catherine Taber, Matthew Wood, Sam Witwer, Meredith Salenger, James Arnold Taylor, show runner Dave Filoni, Michael Donovan, Devon Libran, Elle Newlands, Terri Douglas, Robert Stambler, Verona Blue, TJ Falls, Michelle Rejwan, Eugene Byrd, Fred Tatasciore, David Collins, Amanda Foreman, Christopher Scarabosio, Patrick Correll, Karen Huie, Orly Schuchmacher, Emily Towers, Jonathan Dixon, Kat Sheridan, Salacious Crumb actor Mark Dodson, and Gavyn Sykes actor Christian Simpson were the additional voices used in the film. Riot control stormtrooper FN-2199, who calls Finn a traitor during the battle on Takodana, was portrayed by stunt performer Liang Yang and voiced by sound editor David Acord.\n\n\"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the original trilogy, but denied any intent to make it. In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm, and with it the \"Star Wars\" franchise, to The Walt Disney Company. Speaking alongside Lucasfilm's new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: \"I always said I wasn't going to do any more and that's true, because I'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean I'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.\"\n\nAs creative consultant on the film, Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the \"Star Wars\" universe. Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for \"Episodes VII–IX\", which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy, Bob Iger, Alan Horn, and Kevin Mayer. Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film. Lucas's son Jett told \"The Guardian\" that his father was \"very torn\" about having sold the rights to the franchise, despite having picked Abrams to direct, and that his father was \"there to guide\" but that \"he wants to let it go and become its new generation\". \n\"The Force Awakens\"s first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt. Early drafts had Luke appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that \"every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.\" Luke became the film's MacGuffin and does not appear in person until the final scene. Several directors were considered, including David Fincher, Brad Bird, Ben Affleck and Guillermo del Toro; after a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy, J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.\n\nArndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him. The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013, and Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties. Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a previously discussed summer release. He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, New York City, Paris and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks. Abrams said the key to the film was to return to the roots of the first \"Star Wars\" film and be based more on emotion than explanation. In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete. In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that \"Episodes VII–IX\" would not feature storylines from the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series \"Star Wars Rebels\".\n\nAbrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from \"The Force Awakens\", such as Finn and Rey's last names and backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that \"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\", but said that Abrams was collaborating with \"The Last Jedi\" director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with \"Episode IX\"s then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that \"everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this\". A fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners\"; Forsberg developed the language by studying languages such as Hindi and Gujarati.\n\nIn November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been \"keen\" to involve him and conceded: \"If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.\" He also said, \"They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different … I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new.\" In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that Lucas had seen the movie and \"liked it\". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: \"I think the fans are going to love it, It's very much the kind of movie they've been looking for.\" Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film \"needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain\" and use plot elements from previous \"Star Wars\" films.\n\nIn May 2013, it was confirmed that \"The Force Awakens\" would be filmed in the United Kingdom. Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce \"The Force Awakens\" in the UK. Osborne committed £25 million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and the film industry. According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, \"The Force Awakens\" ultimately received a total of £31.6 million ($47.4 million) from the government.\n\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of \"The Force Awakens\" for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States. The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\". Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed. In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35-mm film (specifically Kodak 5219). In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Daniel Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett and Matthew Cunnelly, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.\n\nCasting began around August 2013, with Abrams meeting with potential actors for script readings and screen tests. Open auditions were held in the UK, Ireland, and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of Rachel and Thomas. Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams. Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement on April 29, 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier. Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement.\n\nThough Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013, their casting was not confirmed until over a year later. Saoirse Ronan, Michael B. Jordan, and Lupita Nyong'o auditioned for new characters; industry publications reported Jesse Plemons was considered, possibly for Luke Skywalker's son; Adam Driver for an unnamed villain; and Maisie Richardson-Sellers for an unknown character. In March 2014, actor Dominic Monaghan said that Abrams was looking for three unknown actors to play the leads in \"The Force Awakens\" and that rumors of bigger-name stars were untrue.\n\nDaisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his \"Girls\" schedule. Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April. In April, John Boyega began talks after dropping out of a Jesse Owens biopic. Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have \"bored\" him.\n\nOn April 29, 2014, the cast was announced with a photo of the first table read of the script at Pinewood Studios near London, picturing director Abrams with Ford, Ridley, Fisher, Peter Mayhew, producer Bryan Burk, Lucasfilm president and producer Kathleen Kennedy, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Hamill, Serkis, Oscar Isaac, Boyega, Driver, and writer Lawrence Kasdan. The announcement was originally planned for May 4 (\"Star Wars\" Day), but was announced early for fear of media leaks. In June 2014, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.\n\nTo prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke. Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist. Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO, but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him. A flashback scene was cut from Rey's vision (following her discovery of Luke's lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\n\nIn May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the \"Star Wars\" set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film. In October 2014, Warwick Davis, who played Wald and Weazle in \"\" and Wicket in \"Return of the Jedi\", announced that he would appear in \"The Force Awakens\", but did not reveal his role. In November 2014, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film. Isaac's uncle, a \"Star Wars\" fan, was cast as an extra at Abrams's invitation upon visiting the set.\n\nIn December 2015, \"The Mail\" reported that Ford would be paid $25 million plus a 0.5% share of the revenue. Ridley and Boyega each would receive $460,000 plus a share if the movie grossed over $1 billion. Fisher received $1.5 million; Abrams was paid $5.1 million plus a 2% share of the revenue. For the original 1977 film, Ford was paid $10,000 ().\n\nIn February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months. The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film. In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun, filming in secret in the UAE emirate of Abu Dhabi by a second-unit. Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65mm IMAX format. In July, Bad Robot reported on Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.\n\nOn May 4, 2014 (\"Star Wars\" Day), the studio posted a selfie taken by Iger with an unidentified actor in a Chewbacca costume. Iger said the photo was taken when he visited Pinewood Studios two weeks earlier to discuss the shoot, \"which was just about to start\", with Abrams, Kennedy, and Horn. Principal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014. Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early-May, where large sets were built on location – including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market – and where explosives were used to create a \"blast crater\". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming. Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.\n\nThat same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the \"Millennium Falcon\" set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle \"went to a 90-degree angle\". Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford's injury. Ford's son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly. Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident, but he kept this to himself for over a month. In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident. Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.\n\nStoryboard artists Simon Duric said, \"The security on the film was a challenge. That script was locked in a safe. Most of the time on a film you can sit at your desk with a copy of the script next to you. On this, you couldn't. That's fine but it was tricky in places. We had people flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs. It was nuts. If a prop was being moved we had to have them covered in a big black sheet. We were told in an email to be [wary] of drones.\"\n\nIn July 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley. Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England. Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August. In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships from the \"Star Wars\" Universe. Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean was used for forest scenes. Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.\n\nCinematographer Daniel Mindel said \"The Force Awakens\" would use real locations and scale models over computer-generated imagery to make it aesthetically similar to the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. Rian Johnson, director of \"The Last Jedi\", reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: \"I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick.\" Abrams's intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original \"Star Wars\". To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.\n\nIn February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's \"Star Wars\" films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film.\n\nAbrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica. In August 2015, he gave the film's estimated running time as 124–125 minutes. Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: \"At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value, except to be sitting around.\" The film was converted to 3D in post-production.\n\nIn July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to compose the score. The music for the film's first two trailers was reworked from earlier Williams compositions. He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis. In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia and Han, in ways that \"will seem very natural and right in the moments for which we've chosen to do these kinds of quotes. There aren't many of them, but there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way.\" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.\n\nRecording sessions for \"The Force Awakens\" began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music. The first day of recording was June 1, 2015. Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings.\n\nWilliams said the recording process was \"very luxurious\", with 12 sessions scattered over a five-month period between June and November. The score was recorded by the Hollywood Studio Symphony, a freelance orchestra, with sessions continuing on and off over that five-month period. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music, although nearly an hour of that was discarded, modified, or rerecorded as Abrams reedited the film. Williams's theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus. Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams's behest. Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015. The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015. Williams's score is more than two hours long.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical \"Hamilton\", where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.\n\nSouth Korean boy band EXO released their song \"Lightsaber\" in collaboration with the film for its release in their home country on November 11. The promoted track was subsequently released as part of their \"Sing for You\" album with a Chinese version, as well as being released in Japanese. Chinese pop singer Luhan provided the Chinese theme \"Inner Force\" for the Chinese release of the film.\n\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" premiered in Los Angeles at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre and Dolby Theatre on December 14, 2015. A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the \"massive\" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests. The film was released in 12 countries, including European nations (such as Italy and France, releasing it on a Wednesday), the Philippines and Thailand on December 16; 32 countries including the United Kingdom (releasing on a Thursday), Mexico and additional European, Asian, African, South American and Oceania countries on December 17; and in North America, Japan, Spain, and Venezuela on December 18, in 3D and IMAX 3D. It was released in India on December 25 and in China on January 9, 2016.\n\nIn North America, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations, as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (High dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema. Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record. On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in North America for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros. Pictures' \"The Hobbit\" trilogy to receive such a release. The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of \"The Revenant\" and \"The Finest Hours\" in mid-January 2016.\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the film's title was announced as \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\".\nSimilarly to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", \"Episode VII\" was included in the film's opening crawl, but not in its official title. In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the \"Star Wars\" universe, revealed that the working title for the film was \"Shadow of the Empire\" \"for the longest time\". Advance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015, and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing. Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater. In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day. In total it sold over $50 million in pre-sales breaking the record. This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14. However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying \"people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening… We have people buying \"Star Wars\" [\"The Force Awakens\"] into 2016. It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon.\" Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK, Canada, and Germany.\n\nThe film is the first live-action \"Star Wars\" film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman. Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Shortly following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, the studio had indicated that the then-untitled film would be released under the \"Disney|Lucasfilm\" branding, similar to the branding used for \"Star Wars Rebels\", and akin to the \"Disney·Pixar\" co-branding of Pixar-produced films released by Walt Disney Pictures. Ultimately, Disney's logo was largely absent from the film's marketing—but nonetheless, appeared on merchandise and the startup sequences of \"Star Wars\" smartphone games—and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm's production logo shown silently before the main titles; Disney chairman Bob Iger explained the change by saying it was \"for the fans\".\n\nDisney backed \"The Force Awakens\" with extensive marketing campaigns. On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store, generating a record 58.2 million views on YouTube in its first week. Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the trailer \"perfectly potent nostalgia\", praising its mix of old and new. \"Empire\" was impressed by the continuity with the first films – \"the \"feel\" of classic \"Star Wars\"\" – but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters. \"The Guardian\" wrote that the use of the \"Star Wars\" fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.\nOn December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters. On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the \"Star Wars\" Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was \"staggering… the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can't think of anything I've ever been to – other than a rock concert – that felt quite like that\". The trailer was viewed over 88million times within the first 24 hours of release, breaking the record. According to the Guinness World Records, the second teaser trailer amassed 30.65 million in 24 hours, setting a new world record for the \"most viewed movie trailer on YouTube in 24 hours\". The event was broadcast live by Verizon on YouTube, StarWars.com and in movie theaters. The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. \"The Huffington Post\"s Graham Milne wrote that the trailer \"was an affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.\"\n\n\"Vanity Fair\" was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to \"The Force Awakens\". The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz. At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film's use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of \"The Guardian\" writing: \"The featurette's angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.\" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, \"Super 8\", saying \"the promos… are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.\"\n\nWalt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at \"The Force Awakens\" at Disney's D23 Expo in August 2015. Drew Struzan—who designed the poster artwork for the previous \"Star Wars\" films—produced a commemorative poster given to the event's attendees. In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer. The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like \"orb\". The trailer debuted during the halftime break of \"Monday Night Football\", before being released online. The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was \"frenzied\", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that \"perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film's release is how little of the story it reveals.\" Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" felt the trailer was \"a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned \"Star Wars\" aesthetic\". The trailer received 128million views in 24 hours, a new record for the most views of a trailer in 24 hours. 16 million of the views came from its airing on \"Monday Night Football\". At the end of October, Air France announced a \"Flight and Cinema\" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France is one of the first countries to release the film. On November 6, a Japanese trailer for the film was released. After seeing the new trailer \"Forbes\"' Ollie Barder stated the trailer gave him \"hope\" that the film would not \"let us all down like the prequels did… [with] a worthwhile story this time\". On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.\n\nOn December 17, 2015, select theaters across North America aired a \"Star Wars\" marathon, airing the six previous \"Star Wars\" episode films in 2D, followed by \"The Force Awakens\" in 3D. Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.\n\nDisney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, \"\", with releases from multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film's premiere. The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the \"Star Wars\" universe. Alan Dean Foster wrote a of \"The Force Awakens\" which was released in e-book form on December 18. In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016. Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of \"The Force Awakens\" between June and November 2016.\n\nDisney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed \"Force Friday\" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for \"The Force Awakens\". Beginning at 12:01 am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world. Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015. Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero. Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling. Many retailers were unable to meet demand for \"Star Wars\" products.\n\n\"The Force Awakens\" is the first \"Star Wars\" film to not have a direct tie-in game to accompany it. Instead, select characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other \"Star Wars\" video games, as described below:\n\nEventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled \"\", which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in the summer of 2016. In addition to fully adapting the film, the game includes bonus levels that take place a few years before the events of the film.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" via download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, with a Blu-ray and DVD release on April 5. The home media release contains additional footage. As with the videodisc releases of all of the first six films in the saga, the videodisc release of \"The Force Awakens\" splits the film into fifty chapters. On March 23, 2016, the film was leaked online prior to its original Blu-ray release and was downloaded more than two million times in twelve hours.\n\nIn January 2016, it was confirmed that Starz would hold the U.S. premium television rights for \"The Force Awakens\", having been released just before the end of Starz's output deal covering most Disney-released films, which includes releases through the end of 2015. \"The Force Awakens\" began broadcasting on all Starz networks on September 10, 2016. The equivalent rights in Canada were held by Netflix.\n\nA Blu-ray 3D \"collector's edition\" of the film was released on November 15, 2016, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by Abrams. The package includes a Blu-ray 3D, regular Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy of the film, as well as an additional Blu-ray disc for the bonus features.\n\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" grossed $936.7million in the United States and Canada, and $1.132billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068billion. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110million tickets in North America, the most tickets sold by any film in North America since \"Titanic\" in 1997. \"The Force Awakens\" earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in North America, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by \"Titanic\" in 1997. The film is the highest-grossing film of 2015, the highest-grossing film in the franchise (surpassing \"\"), the highest-grossing film released by Walt Disney Studios, the highest-grossing film in North America (dethroning \"Avatar\"), and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. When adjusted for inflation, it also stands as the tenth-highest-grossing film in cinematic history, with a worldwide gross of $2.103 billion. It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days. \"\" later did so in 11 days. It was also the third film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release. \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the net profit of the film to be $780.1 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the most profitable film of 2015 and the most profitable film in the last seven years.\n\n\"The Force Awakens\" was released in the United States and Canada on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57 million from Thursday night previews, of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7 million from 391 screens. On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1 million, marking the biggest single and opening day record and the first time a film has earned more than $100 million in a single day. Without Thursday night grosses, the film earned the second largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million). In total, it earned a record $247,966,675 (surpassing the original Sunday weekend estimate of $238 million by almost $10 million) for its opening weekend from around 14,400 screens at 4,134 theaters, for an average of $59,982 per theater (or $17,220 per screen). The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holder(s) Marvel's \"The Avengers\" ($207 million) and \"Jurassic World\" ($208 million). The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1 million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters, which nearly amounts to the $252.5 million total earned by \"Return of the Jedi\" – the 2nd lowest-grossing film in the series – in its original run. Minus the $57 million it earned from Thursday previews, the film earned $190.8 million on straight Friday to Sunday, giving it an average of $63.6 million per day. 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78 million of the opening gross, setting a new record. Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($59,982 per theater from 4,134 theaters), biggest holiday opening, biggest PG-13 rated opening, and biggest December opening. The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25, with 58% of the audience male, 71% adults, 20% families and 9% teenagers.\n\nInternationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens. It opened on December 16, 2015 in 12 international markets and earned $14.1 million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them. It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6 million for a two-day international total of $72.7 million, reaching first place in all 44 markets. It grossed a total of $129.5 million in three days after adding $56.8 million on its third day, topped the daily box office in all countries except for South Korea and Vietnam where it was the second, and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6 million. It broke opening day records in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($14.3 million), Germany ($7.1 million), Australia ($6.8 million), Sweden ($1.7 million), Norway ($1.1 million) and in 16 other countries. Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5 million), Mexico ($3.4 million), Italy ($3.1 million) and Japan ($3 million). After the five days, \"The Force Awakens\" had a total international opening gross of $281 million from 30,000 screens in 72 markets, a new record for December opening and the third biggest international opening of all time. International markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($50.6 million), Germany ($27.5 million), France ($22.5 million), Australia ($19.6 million) and Japan ($13.4 million) and Russia ($12.3 million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia and Sweden. IMAX generated $17.9 million from 276 IMAX theaters.\n\nAfter five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529 million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening, making it only the second time in cinematic history – after \"Jurassic World\" – that a film had opened to more than $500 million globally. This included an IMAX opening record of $48 million.\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2 million, to remain in first place at the box office and recording the biggest second weekend of all time. Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19 million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70 million in 10 days. Internationally, the film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9 million. Of the notable major markets, the film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51 million. As of February 21, the largest markets outside of the United States and Canada are the United Kingdom ($180.7 million), China ($124.5 million), Germany ($109.7 million), Japan ($92.6 million) and France ($88.2 million).\n\n\"The Force Awakens\" crossed the $1 billion mark on the 12th day of its general release (December 26, 2015), making it the fastest film to reach this mark. It became the twenty-fourth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the fifth film of 2015 to do so, making 2015 the first year to have five films gross more than $1 billion. The film experienced another decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 39.5% to $90.2 million domestically, remaining in first place at the box office, to set a third-weekend record.\n\nOn January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following \"Avatar\") to gross over $700 million in North America, and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days. On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800 million domestically unadjusted for inflation, and in the same weekend set a Saturday to Sunday opening weekend record for the studio in China with $52.6 million. On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1 billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat. It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since \"\" to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by \"The Revenant\" in its sixth weekend. In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.\n\nOn February 5, the fiftieth day of release, \"The Force Awakens\" became the first film to earn over $900 million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada. On the following day, it became the third film in cinematic history to pass $2 billion in ticket sales worldwide (after \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\") and the second in original release (after \"Avatar\"). It became the third film to earn over $600 million in Europe. In North America and the United Kingdom and Ireland, it fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26–28, 2016, and in the U.S. it did not achieve $1 million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.\n\nWith a production budget of $306 million, plus $175 million for marketing, printing and advertising costs, \"The Force Awakens\" was predicted to be a major box office success. The cost of the film was subsidized by £31.6 million ($47 million USD) from the UK film incentive program. Total costs, after accounting for profit participations, production and distribution of home videos, as well as other ancillary mediums, is expected to run $423 million. Reports in April 2015 from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and Amboee Brand Intelligence predicted the film would earn up to $540 million worldwide for its opening, breaking the record for the biggest worldwide opening, as well as breaking the record for the biggest U.S. opening. They believed that \"The Force Awakens\" would have the widest release ever, across 4,500 theaters in North America. Instead, it received a total of 4,134 theaters, and had the widest December opening. Box office analyst Phil Contrino likened the film to \"Avatar\" (2009), which opened to $77 million in North America and went on to earn $2.8 billion worldwide, saying \"The Force Awakens\" would earn $1 billion \"without blinking\" and could gross $2 billion. In August 2015, \"Deadline Hollywood\" predicted an opening weekend of $615 million worldwide could be possible, including a $300 million opening in North America. In November, box office analysts reported opening weekend projections were at $175–250 million. In December, capital analyst Barton Crockett suggested that the film will be the first to gross over $3 billion worldwide at the box office.\n\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first \"Star Wars\" film made more when this adjustment is made. It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs. Box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said that while \"Avatar\" and \"The Force Awakens\" were both released on the same date of December 18, higher ticket prices in 2015 and IMAX screenings could push \"Star Wars\" \"into the box office stratosphere\". On December 23, Mark Hughes of \"Forbes\" stated that \"The Force Awakens\" had matched the most optimistic projections for its opening, and he predicted that \"The Force Awakens\" would likely surpass \"Titanic\" as the second-highest-grossing film of all time. He commented that \"The Force Awakens\" could catch \"Avatar\" as the top-grossing film of all time, but only if it managed to avoid major week-to-week declines in ticket sales.\n\nBy January 13, analysts concluded that it was unlikely that \"The Force Awakens\" would surpass \"Avatar\"'s global gross. While \"The Force Awakens\" was very successful in North America, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as Germany, India, Latin America, and parts of Asia. One cited reason for this is that overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in the U.S. The \"Star Wars\" franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for \"The Force Awakens\" heavily focused on appealing to that market. Pamela McClintock of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that, for these territories, \"Star Wars\" \"doesn't have the same legacy as it does in North America and more mature markets. It's also a faster burn, meaning it likely won't stay in theaters as long as \"Avatar\" did.\" Dergarabedian said, \"As in all box-office trajectories, the higher the altitude, the tougher it becomes to rack up sales at the kind of breakneck pace as in the beginning of the run.\"\n\nNancy Tartaglione of Deadline.com argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, \"The Force Awakens\" did well overseas. \"Avatar\" did well internationally because of its novelty, the marketing campaign advertising it as showcasing the newest 3D technology that can only be fully appreciated in the theaters, and because of its extended time in overseas theaters. While \"The Force Awakens\" had appeal with its special effects, analysts feel that it lacked the novelty factor; they also cite that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done. Films do not play in overseas theaters as long as they did back when \"Avatar\" was released. Dergarabedian stated, \"No matter what, [\"The Force Awakens\"] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones.\" Moreover, Mike Fleming of Deadline.com argued that the movie was the \"most valuable movie\" of the year, with \"the net profit to Disney an astounding $923M, and the Cash on Cash Return twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.31\".\n\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 93% approval rating based on 397 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, \"The Force Awakens\" successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 55 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale; women, under-25s and under-18s gave it an \"A+\", while 98% of audiences gave it either an \"A\" or a \"B\".\n\nRobbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave \"The Force Awakens\" five stars out of five and wrote that it \"sets out to shake \"Star Wars\" from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past. That it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" gave it five stars out of five, writing that it was \"both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot … ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.\" \"Variety\"s Justin Chang wrote that the film has \"sufficient style, momentum, love and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans\". Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as \"a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure\". Tom Long of \"The Detroit News\" wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original \"Star Wars\", it leaves \"the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind … the energy, humor and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured\". The Associated Press called it \"basically the same\" as the original film but \"isn't that what we all wanted anyway?\"\n\nAnn Hornaday, writing for \"The Washington Post\", thought the film had \"enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans … \"The Force Awakens\" strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\" Christopher Orr, writing in \"The Atlantic\", called the film \"a mashup masterpiece\" that \"may be completely derivative\" but is \"a delight nonetheless\". \"The Charlotte Observer\"s Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had \"pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the film his highest rating and called it \"the best \"Star Wars\" sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015\". Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Money, found it was the best \"Star Wars\" film since the original trilogy and that it \"is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike\". Jack Bottomley, writing for \"Starburst\", awarded the film a 10 out of 10 score, saying \"From old joys to fresh twists, this is a unique blockbuster experience that celebrates the franchise whilst also expanding it.\"\n\nDespite the critical acclaim for the picture, certain critics found \"The Force Awakens\" derivative of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, some expressing their opinion that the film was essentially a remake of \"A New Hope\".\nAndrew O'Hehir wrote for \"Salon\" that it was \"the work of a talented mimic or ventriloquist who can just about cover for the fact that he has nothing much to say\". Stephanie Zacharek of \"TIME\" wrote that Abrams had delivered \"everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted\". Reviewing for \"Forbes\", Scott Mendelson cited the film's \"top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope\", but felt it was so much \"an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture\". Brian Merchant of \"Motherboard\" wrote that \"Science fiction is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod … one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.\"\n\nIn an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a \"divorce\" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of \"The Force Awakens\". Lucas described the previous \"Star Wars\" films as his \"children\" and criticized the \"retro feel\" of \"The Force Awakens,\" saying: \"I worked very hard to make [my films] completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships – you know, to make it new.\" Lucas also likened Disney to \"white slavers\", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized.\n\nSeveral awards held their nominations before the December release of \"The Force Awakens\", making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies. However, the film was added to the 21st Critics' Choice Awards's slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors, and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of \"The Force Awakens\", where it was named one of Top Ten Films of the year.\n\nThe film received five Academy Award nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, including Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Film Editing, and Best Visual Effects. The film garnered four nominations at the 69th British Academy Film Awards for Best Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Production Design, including two wins, one for Best Special Visual Effects and a BAFTA Rising Star Award for John Boyega. It was nominated for Best Picture at the 2016 Critics' Choice Awards. The film received seven Visual Effects Society Awards nominations, winning four, including Outstanding Visual Effects in an Effects Driven Feature Motion Picture. It received the most nominations at the 21st Empire Awards, including Best Film, Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film, Best Director for J.J. Abrams, Best Male Newcomer for John Boyega, and Best Female Newcomer for Daisy Ridley. It became the most nominated film in Saturn Award history with a total of 13 nominations at the 42nd Saturn Awards, where it won in eight categories, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Writing, Best Actor for Ford, Best Supporting Actor for Driver, Best Music, Best Special Effects, Best Editing, and Best Make-Up.\n\nDaisy Ridley and John Boyega each received several nominations and accolades for their performances. They were nominated as Best Newcomers at various critics circle and associations, including the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, and the Florida Film Critics Circle, \"The Force Awakens\" received eleven nominations at the MTV Movie Awards, the most for the ceremony, including Movie of the Year, Best Female Performance for Ridley, Best Breakthrough Performance for Boyega, and Best Virtual Performance for Lupita Nyong'o and Andy Serkis.\n\nIn addition to several awards and nominations, \"The Force Awakens\" appeared on various critics' lists of the ten best films of 2015.\n\nRian Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he would direct \"Episode VIII\", later titled \"The Last Jedi\". It was released on December 15, 2017. Some second-unit filming took place in September 2015 in Ireland, with principal photography beginning in February 2016 at Pinewood Studios. Hamill, Fisher, Driver, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Serkis, Nyong'o, Gleeson, Daniels, Christie, Vee, and Suotamo reprised their roles in the film, and are joined by Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, and Benicio del Toro.\n\n\"Episode IX\" is scheduled for release on December 20, 2019. Abrams will direct the film and co-write it with Chris Terrio.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "165427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165427", "title": "Viennese waltz", "text": "Viennese waltz\n\nViennese waltz () is a genre of ballroom dance. At least four different meanings are recognized. In the historically first sense, the name may refer to several versions of the waltz, including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing, danced to the music of Viennese waltz.\n\nWhat is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz. It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or \"waltz\" position. The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz, danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar (the international standard of 30 measures per minute), while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats (58-60 measures) per minute. To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words (German), (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz.\n\nThe Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader's right (natural) or toward the leader's left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating \"change steps\" to switch between the direction of rotation. Furthermore, in a properly danced Viennese waltz, couples do not pass but turn continuously left and right while traveling counterclockwise around the floor following each other.\n\nAs the waltz evolved, some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically \"Viennese waltz\" to distinguish them from the slower waltzes. In the modern ballroom dance, two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized: International Style and American Style.\n\nToday the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance.\n\nThe Viennese waltz, so called to distinguish it from the waltz and the French waltz, is the oldest of the current ballroom dances. It emerged in the second half of the 18th century from the German dance and the Ländler in Austria and was both popular and subject to criticism. At that time, the waltz, as described in a magazine from 1799, was performed by dancers who held on to their long gowns to prevent them from dragging or being stepped on. The dancers would lift their dresses and hold them high like cloaks, and this would bring both their bodies under one cover. This action also required the dancers' bodies to be very close together, and this closeness attracted moral disparagement. In 1797, Wolf published a pamphlet against the dance entitled \"Proof that Waltzing is the Main Source of Weakness of the Body and Mind of our Generation\". But even when faced with all this negativity, it became very popular in Vienna. Large dance halls like the Zum Sperl in 1807 and the Apollo in 1808 were opened to provide space for thousands of dancers. The dance reached and spread to England sometime before 1812. It was introduced as the German waltz and became a huge hit. It gained ground through the Congress of Vienna at the beginning of the 19th century and by the famous compositions by Josef Lanner, Johann Strauss I and his son, Johann Strauss II.\n\nInitially, the waltz was significantly different from its form today. In the first place, the couples did not dance in the closed position as today. The illustrations and descriptions make it clear that the couples danced with arm positions similar to that of the precursor dances, the Ländler and the Allemande. The hold was at times semi-closed and at times side by side. Arms were intertwined and circling movements were made under raised arms. No couple in Wilson's plate are shown in close embrace, but some are in closed hold facing each other. Another significant difference from the present technique was that the feet were turned out and the rise of foot during the dance was much more pronounced. This can be seen quite clearly in the figure, and such a style imposes its limitations on how the dance can be performed.\n\nTo understand why Quirey says \"The advent of the in polite society was quite simply the greatest change in dance form and dancing manners that has happened in our history\" we need to realize that all European social dances before the waltz were communal sequence dances – communal, because all the dancers on the floor took part in a preset pattern (often chosen by a master of ceremony. Dancers separately, and as couples, faced outwards to the spectators as much as they faced inwards. Thus all present took part as dancers or as onlookers. This was the way with the country dance and all previous popular dances. With the waltz, couples were independent of each other and were turned towards each other (though not in close contact). Lord Byron wrote a furious letter, which precedes his poem \"The Waltz\", in which he decries the anti-social nature of the dance, with the couple \"like two cockchafers spitted on the same bodkin.\"\n\nThe Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either in a clockwise (natural) or anti-clockwise (reverse) direction interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation. A true Viennese waltz consists only of turns and change steps. Other moves such as the fleckerls, American-style figures and side sway or underarm turns are modern inventions and are not normally danced at the annual balls in Vienna. Furthermore, in a properly danced Viennese waltz, couples do not pass, but turn continuously left and right while travelling counterclockwise around the floor following each other.\n\nThe competitive style of Viennese waltz has a reduced number of steps: change steps, passing changes, hesitations, hovers, the contra check, and natural and reverse turns.\n\nInternational-style Viennese waltz is danced in closed position. The syllabus is limited to natural and reverse turns, closed and open changes, fleckerls, contra check, left whisk, and canter-time pivot turns (canter pivots).\n\nIn World Dance Council competition, canter pivots are excluded.\n\nAmerican-style Viennese waltz has much more freedom, both in dance positions and syllabus.\n\n"}
