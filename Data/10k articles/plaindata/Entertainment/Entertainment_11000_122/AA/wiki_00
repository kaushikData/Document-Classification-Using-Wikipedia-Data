{"id": "170318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170318", "title": "20th Century Fox", "text": "20th Century Fox\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (colloquial: Twentieth Century Fox; Fox; 20th Century Fox) is an American film studio currently owned by Fox Entertainment Group, itself owned by 21st Century Fox. One of the \"Big Six\" major American film studios, it was formed from the merger of the Fox Film Corporation and Twentieth Century Pictures in 1935, and is located in the Century City area of Los Angeles. The studio was owned by News Corporation from 1984 to 2013. On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced its intention to acquire the studio along with the majority of 21st Century Fox's other entertainment assets, which was approved by both companies on July 27, 2018.\n\n20th Century Fox is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).\n\n Twentieth Century Pictures' Joseph Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck left United Artists over a stock dispute, and began merger talks with the management of financially struggling Fox Film, under President Sidney Kent. Spyros Skouras, then manager of the Fox West Coast Theaters, helped make it happen (and later became president of the new company). Aside from the theater chain and a first-rate studio lot, Zanuck and Schenck felt there was not much else to Fox, which had been reeling since the founder William Fox lost control of the company in 1930. The studio's biggest star, Will Rogers, died in a plane crash weeks after the merger. Its leading female star, Janet Gaynor, was fading in popularity and promising leading men James Dunn and Spencer Tracy had been dropped because of heavy drinking.\n\nAt first, it was expected that the new company was originally to be called \"Fox-20th Century\", even though 20th Century was the senior partner in the merger. However, 20th Century brought more to the bargaining table besides Schenck and Zanuck; it was more profitable than Fox and had considerably more talent. The new company, 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, began trading on May 31, 1935; the hyphen was dropped in 1985. Kent remained as President, while Schenck became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Zanuck became Vice President in Charge of Production, replacing Fox's longtime production chief Winfield Sheehan.\n\nThe company established a special training school. Lynn Bari, Patricia Farr and Anne Nagel were among 14 young women \"launched on the trail of film stardom\" on August 6, 1935, when they each received a six-month contract with 20th Century Fox after spending 18 months in the school. The contracts included a studio option for renewal for as long as seven years.\n\nFor many years, 20th Century Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915, the year Fox Film was founded. For instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary. However, in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding, even though most film historians agree it was founded in 1915.\n\nThe company's films retained the 20th Century Pictures searchlight logo on their opening credits as well as its opening fanfare, but with the name changed to 20th Century-Fox.\n\nAfter the merger was completed, Zanuck quickly signed young actors who would carry 20th Century-Fox for years: Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, Carmen Miranda, Don Ameche, Henry Fonda, Gene Tierney, Sonja Henie, and Betty Grable. Also on the Fox payroll he found two players who he built up into the studio's leading assets, Alice Faye and seven-year-old Shirley Temple. Favoring popular biographies and musicals, Zanuck built Fox back to profitability. Thanks to record attendance during World War II, Fox overtook RKO and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (Hollywood's biggest studio) to become the third most profitable film studio. While Zanuck went off for 18 months' war service, junior partner William Goetz kept profits high by going for light entertainment. The studio's—indeed the industry's—biggest star was creamy blonde Betty Grable.\n\nIn 1942, Spyros Skouras succeeded Kent as president of the studio. Together with Zanuck, who returned in 1943, they intended to make Fox's output more serious-minded. During the next few years, with pictures like \"The Razor's Edge\", \"Wilson\", \"Gentleman's Agreement\", \"The Snake Pit\", \"Boomerang\", and \"Pinky\", Zanuck established a reputation for provocative, adult films. Fox also specialized in adaptations of best-selling books such as Ben Ames Williams' \"Leave Her to Heaven\" (1945), starring Gene Tierney, which was the highest-grossing Fox film of the 1940s. Fox also produced film versions of Broadway musicals, including the Rodgers and Hammerstein films, beginning with the musical version of \"State Fair\" (1945), the only work that the partnership wrote especially for films.\n\nAfter the war, and with the advent of television, audiences slowly drifted away. 20th Century-Fox held on to its theaters until a court-mandated \"divorce\"; they were spun off as Fox National Theaters in 1953. That year, with attendance at half the 1946 level, 20th Century-Fox gambled on an unproven gimmick. Noting that the two film sensations of 1952 had been Cinerama, which required three projectors to fill a giant curved screen, and \"Natural Vision\" 3D, which got its effects of depth by requiring the use of polarized glasses, Fox mortgaged its studio to buy rights to a French anamorphic projection system which gave a slight illusion of depth without glasses. President Spyros Skouras struck a deal with the inventor Henri Chrétien, leaving the other film studios empty-handed, and in 1953 introduced CinemaScope in the studio's groundbreaking feature film \"The Robe\".\n\nZanuck announced in February 1953 that henceforth all Fox pictures would be made in CinemaScope. To convince theater owners to install this new process, Fox agreed to help pay conversion costs (about $25,000 per screen); and to ensure enough product, Fox gave access to CinemaScope to any rival studio choosing to use it. Seeing the box-office for the first two CinemaScope features, \"The Robe\" and \"How to Marry a Millionaire\" (also 1953), Warner Bros., MGM, Universal Pictures (then known as Universal-International), Columbia Pictures and Disney quickly adopted the process. In 1956 Fox engaged Robert Lippert to establish a subsidiary company, Regal Pictures, later Associated Producers Incorporated to film B pictures in CinemaScope (but \"branded\" RegalScope). Fox produced new musicals using the CinemaScope process including \"Carousel\" and \"The King and I\" (both 1956).\n\nCinemaScope brought a brief upturn in attendance, but by 1956 the numbers again began to slide. That year Darryl Zanuck announced his resignation as head of production. Zanuck moved to Paris, setting up as an independent producer, seldom being in the United States for many years.\n\nZanuck's successor, producer Buddy Adler, died a year later. President Spyros Skouras brought in a series of production executives, but none had Zanuck's success. By the early 1960s, Fox was in trouble. A new version of \"Cleopatra\" had begun in 1959 with Joan Collins in the lead. As a publicity gimmick, producer Walter Wanger offered $1 million to Elizabeth Taylor if she would star; she accepted, and costs for \"Cleopatra\" began to escalate, aggravated by Richard Burton's on-set romance with Taylor, the surrounding media frenzy, and Skouras' selfish preferences and inexperienced micromanagement on the film's production. Not even his showmanship made up for his considerable lack of filmmaking expertise in speeding up production on \"Cleopatra\".\n\nMeanwhile, another remake — of the 1940 Cary Grant hit \"My Favorite Wife\" — was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep Fox afloat. The romantic comedy entitled \"Something's Got to Give\" paired Marilyn Monroe, Fox's most bankable star of the 1950s, with Dean Martin and director George Cukor. The troubled Monroe caused delays on a daily basis, and it quickly descended into a costly debacle. As \"Cleopatra\"s budget passed $10 million, eventually costing around $40 million, Fox sold its back lot (now the site of Century City) to Alcoa in 1961 to raise cash. After several weeks of script rewrites on the Monroe picture and very little progress, mostly due to director George Cukor's filming methods, in addition to Monroe's chronic sinusitis, Monroe was fired from \"Something's Got to Give\" and two months later she was found dead. According to Fox files she was rehired within weeks for a two-picture deal totaling $1 million, $500,000 to finish \"Something's Got to Give\" (plus a bonus at completion), and another $500,000 for \"What a Way to Go\". Elizabeth Taylor's disruptive reign on the \"Cleopatra\" set continued unchallenged from 1960 into 1962, though three Fox executives went to Rome in June 1962 to fire her. They learned that director Joseph L. Mankiewicz had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors, so Fox was then forced to allow Taylor several more weeks of filming. In the meantime during that summer of 1962 Fox released nearly all of its contract stars, including Jayne Mansfield.\n\nWith few pictures on the schedule, Skouras wanted to rush Zanuck's big-budget war epic \"The Longest Day\" (1962), a highly accurate account of the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, with a huge international cast, into release as another source of quick cash. This offended Zanuck, still Fox's largest shareholder, for whom \"The Longest Day\" was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for many years. After it became clear that \"Something's Got to Give\" would not be able to progress without Monroe in the lead (Martin had refused to work with anyone else), Skouras finally decided that re-signing her was unavoidable. But days before filming was due to resume, she was found dead at her Los Angeles home and the picture resumed filming as \"Move Over, Darling\", with Doris Day and James Garner in the leads. Released in 1963, the film was a hit. The unfinished scenes from \"Something's Got to Give\" were shelved for nearly 40 years. Rather than being rushed into release as if it were a B-picture, \"The Longest Day\" was lovingly and carefully produced under Zanuck's supervision. It was finally released at a length of three hours, and was well received.\n\nAt the next board meeting Zanuck spoke for eight hours, convincing directors that Skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor. Zanuck was installed as chairman, and then named his son Richard Zanuck as president. This new management group seized \"Cleopatra\" and rushed it to completion, shut down the studio, laid off the entire staff to save money, axed the long-running Movietone Newsreel, and made a series of cheap, popular pictures that restored Fox as a major studio. The saving grace for the studio's fortunes came from the tremendous success of \"The Sound of Music\" (1965), an expensive and handsomely produced film adaptation of the highly acclaimed Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical, which became a significant success at the box office and won five Academy Awards, including Best Director (Robert Wise) and Best Picture of the Year.\n\nFox also had two big science-fiction hits in the 1960s: \"Fantastic Voyage\" (1966), and the original \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968), starring Charlton Heston, Kim Hunter, and Roddy McDowall. \"Fantastic Voyage\" was the last film made in CinemaScope, which was ultimately replaced by Panavision lenses.\n\nZanuck stayed on as chairman until 1971, but there were several expensive flops in his last years, resulting in Fox posting losses from 1969 to 1971. Following his removal, and after an uncertain period, new management brought Fox back to health. Under president Gordon T. Stulberg and production head Alan Ladd, Jr., Fox films connected with modern audiences. Stulberg used the profits to acquire resort properties, soft-drink bottlers, Australian theaters and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom-or-bust cycle of picture-making.\n\nForeshadowing a pattern of film production still yet to come, in late 1973 20th Century Fox joined forces with Warner Bros. to co-produce \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), an all-star action blockbuster from producer Irwin Allen. Both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios, and announced that as Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be career suicide to have competing movies. Thus the first joint-venture studio deal was struck. In hindsight (while it may be commonplace now) back in the 1970s it was a risky, but revolutionary, idea that paid off handsomely at both domestic and international box offices around the world.\n\nIn 1977 Fox's success reached new heights and produced the most profitable film made up to that time, \"Star Wars\". Substantial financial gains were realized as a result of the film's unprecedented success: from a low of $6 in June 1976, stock prices more than quadrupled to almost $27 after \"Star Wars\"' release; 1976 revenues of $195 million rose to $301 million in 1977.\n\nWith financial stability came new owners, when Fox was sold for more than $700 million in 1981 to investors Marc Rich and Marvin Davis. Fox's assets included Pebble Beach Golf Links, the Aspen Skiing Company and a Century City property upon which Davis built and twice sold Fox Plaza.\n\nBy 1984 Rich had become a fugitive from justice, having fled to Switzerland after being charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with tax evasion, racketeering and illegal trading with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. Rich's assets were frozen by U.S. authorities. In 1984 Marvin Davis bought out Marc Rich's 50% interest in 20th Century Fox Film Corporation for an undisclosed amount, reported to be $116 million. Davis sold this interest to Rupert Murdoch for $250 million in March 1985. Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge's Metromedia television stations. Murdoch went ahead alone and bought the stations, and later bought out Davis' remaining stake in Fox for $325 million.\n\nTo gain FCC approval of Fox's purchase of Metromedia's television holdings, once the stations of the long-dissolved DuMont network, Murdoch had to become a U.S. citizen. He did so in 1985, and in 1986 the new Fox Broadcasting Company took to the air. Over the next 20-odd years the network and owned-stations group expanded to become extremely profitable for News Corp.\nSince January 2000 this company has been the international distributor for MGM/UA releases. In the 1980s Fox — through a joint venture with CBS called CBS/Fox Video — had distributed certain UA films on video; thus UA has come full circle by switching to Fox for video distribution. Fox also makes money distributing films for small independent film companies.\n\nIn 2008 Fox announced an Asian subsidiary, Fox STAR Studios, a joint venture with STAR TV, also owned by News Corporation. It was reported that Fox STAR would start by producing films for the Bollywood market, then expand to several Asian markets.\n\nIn August 2012, 20th Century Fox signed a five-year deal with DreamWorks Animation to distribute in domestic and international markets. However the deal did not include the distribution rights for previously released films which DreamWorks Animation acquired from Paramount Pictures later in 2014. Fox's deal with DreamWorks Animation ended on June 2, 2017 with \"\", with Universal Pictures taking over the distribution deal with DreamWorks Animation due to NBCUniversal's acquisition of DreamWorks Animation on August 22, 2016, starting on March 1, 2019 with the release of \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\".\n\nIn 2012 Rupert Murdoch announced that News Corp. would be split into two publishing and media-oriented companies: a new News Corporation, and 21st Century Fox, which operates the Fox Entertainment Group and 20th Century Fox. Murdoch considered the name of the new company a way to maintain the 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company (which owns and operates networks such as ABC and ESPN) announced plans to purchase 21st Century Fox, which includes 20th Century Fox, for $52.4 billion. On May 23, 2018, \"USA Today\" reported that Comcast plans to out-bid Disney with an all-cash offer for approximately $60 billion, which was increased to $65 billion in cash on June 13 by offering Fox shareholders $35 a share and \"100 percent of the shares the company left behind after the deal\" (relating to New Fox). Comcast is expecting Disney to increase their bid and include cash as part of the deal. But on July 19, 2018, Comcast officially announced that it was dropping its bid on the Fox assets in order to focus on their bid for Sky. On July 27, 2018, Disney and Fox shareholders approved the merger between the two companies.\n\n20th Television is Fox's television syndication division. 20th Century Fox Television is the studio's television production division.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s features were released to television in the hope that they would broaden sponsorship and help distribution of network programs. Blocks of one-hour programming of feature films to national sponsors on 128 stations was organized by Twentieth Century Fox and National Telefilm Associates. Twentieth Century Fox received 50 percent interest in NTA Film network after it sold its library to National Telefilm Associates. This gave 90 minutes of cleared time a week and syndicated feature films to 110 non-interconnected stations for sale to national sponsors.\n\nRupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox bought out the remaining assets of Four Star Television from Ronald Perelman's Compact Video in 1996. Most of Four Star Television's library of programs are controlled by 20th Century Fox Television today. After Murdoch's numerous buyouts during the buyout era of the eighties, News Corporation had built up financial debts of $7 billion (much from Sky TV in the UK), despite the many assets that were held by NewsCorp. The high levels of debt caused Murdoch to sell many of the American magazine interests he had acquired in the mid-1980s.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1937, a custom record label called \"Fox Movietone\" was produced starting at F-100 and running through F-136. It featured songs from Fox movies, first using material recorded and issued on Victor's Bluebird label and halfway through switched to material recorded and issued on ARC's dime store labels (Melotone, Perfect, etc.). These scarce records were sold only at Fox Theaters.\n\nFox Music has been Fox's music arm since 2000. It encompasses music publishing and licensing businesses, dealing primarily with Fox Entertainment Group television and film soundtracks.\n\nPrior to Fox Music, 20th Century Records was its music arm from 1958 to 1982.\n\nThe \"Twentieth Century Fox Presents\" radio series were broadcast between 1936 and 1942. More often than not, the shows were a radio preview featuring a medley of the songs and soundtracks from the latest movie being released into the theaters, much like the modern day movie trailers we now see on TV, to encourage folks to head down to their nearest Picture House.\n\nThe radio shows featured the original stars, with the announcer narrating a lead up that encapsulated the performance.\n\nFrom its earliest ventures into movie production, Fox Film Corporation operated its own processing laboratories. The original lab was located in Fort Lee, New Jersey along with the studios. A lab was included with the new studio built in Los Angeles in 1916. Headed by Alan E. Freedman, the Fort Lee lab was moved into the new Fox Studios building in Manhattan in 1919. In 1932, Freedman bought the labs from Fox for $2,000,000 to bolster what at that time was a failing Fox liquidity. He renamed the operation \"DeLuxe Laboratories\" which much later became DeLuxe Entertainment Services Group. In the 1940s Freedman sold the labs back to what was then 20th Century Fox and remained as president into the 1960s. Under Freedman's leadership, DeLuxe added two more labs in Chicago and Toronto and processed film from studios other than Fox.\n\n20th Century Fox is known for its searchlight structure logo. Its fanfare was originally composed in 1933 by Alfred Newman, who became the head of Twentieth Century-Fox's music department from 1940 until the 1960s. It was re-recorded in 1935 when 20th Century-Fox was officially established.\n\nThe original Art Deco iteration of the 20th Century-Fox logo, designed by special effects animator and matte painting artist Emil Kosa Jr., was originally made as the design for the 20th Century Pictures logo, with \"Fox\" replacing \"Pictures, Inc.\" in 1935. The logo was originally created as a matte painting on several layers of glass and was animated frame-by-frame. Kosa's final major work for Fox was a matte painting of the Statue of Liberty in the ending scene of \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968), shortly before his death.\n\nIn 1953, Rocky Longo, an artist at Pacific Title (now Pacific Title and Art), was hired to recreate the original logo design for the new CinemaScope picture process. Alfred Newman also re-composed the logo's fanfare with an extension to be heard during the CinemaScope logo that would follow after the Fox logo for films made using the new lenses. In order to give the design the required width to fit into the CinemaScope frame, Longo tilted the number \"0\" in \"20th\". The new fanfare was first used on the film \"How to Marry a Millionaire\" (1953). \"The Robe\", the first film released in the CinemaScope format, featured a choir singing over the logo instead of the regular fanfare.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Fox fanfare was being used in films sporadically. George Lucas enjoyed the Alfred Newman fanfare so much that he insisted for it to be used in \"Star Wars\" (1977). As a result, the original release of \"Star Wars\" featured the CinemaScope version of the logo, but with the version of fanfare as conducted by Lionel Newman, as the original version by Alfred Newman had been misfiled. John Williams composed the film's opening theme in the same key as the fanfare (B major), serving as an extension to it of sorts. In 1980, Williams conducted a new version of the extended fanfare for \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Williams' recording of the fanfare was then used in every subsequent \"Star Wars\" film until \"\" (2005). After the introduction of the CGI Fox logo in 1994, the series used the final view of the new logo, replicating look of the first three released films' opening logos and allowing the Lucasfilm logo to appear during the second part of the fanfare.\n\nIn 1981, Longo repainted and updated the logo design by recoloring it yellow, redesigning it, placing the monument on a background of blue clouds and straightened the \"0\" in \"20th\". The Fox fanfare was re-orchestrated in 1981, as Longo's revised logo was being introduced.\n\nIn 1994, after a few failed attempts (which even included trying to film the familiar monument as an actual three-dimensional model,) Fox in-house television producer Kevin Burns was hired to produce a new logo for the company, this time using the then-new process of computer-generated imagery (CGI). With the help of graphics producer Steve Soffer and his company Studio Productions (which had recently given face-lifts to the Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios logos in 1986 and 1990, respectively), Burns insisted that the new logo would contain more detail and animation, so that the longer 21-second Fox fanfare would be used as the underscore. The new logo incorporated a virtual Los Angeles cityscape that was designed around the monument. In the background, the Hollywood sign, which would give the monument an actual location (approximating Fox's actual address in Century City) can be seen. One final touch was the addition of store-front signs, with each one bearing the name of Fox executives who worked with the studio at the time. These include \"Murdoch's Department Store\" (referring to Rupert Murdoch, president of News Corporation, Fox's parent at the time), \"Chernin's\" (referring to Peter Chernin), \"Burns Tri-City Alarm\" (a homage to Burns' late father, who owned a burglar and fire alarm company in Upstate New York), \"Steve's Place\" (referring to Soffer) and \"Ilinidi's\". It was also the first time Fox was recognized as a subsidiary of News Corporation, as a byline reading \"A News Corporation Company\" was incorporated into the logo.\n\nAs the CGI logo was being prepared to premiere at the beginning of \"True Lies\" (1994), Burns asked Bruce Broughton to compose a new version of the familiar fanfare by Alfred Newman. In 1997, Alfred's son David Newman recorded the new version of the fanfare to reopen the Newman Scoring Stage (originally known as Fox Scoring Stage), and debuted with the release of \"Anastasia\" (1997). This rendition is still in use .\n\nIn 2009, a newly updated CGI logo produced by Blue Sky Studios debuted with the film \"Avatar\" (2009). A \"75th anniversary\" version of the logo was introduced to coincide with 20th Century Fox's 75th anniversary the following year (much akin to practices made by most of the other American major film studios at the time), making its debut with \"\" and its final one with \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nNumerous parodies of the fanfare have appeared in film and television. Variations have also been used by other Fox divisions and affiliated television stations, including WTVT in Tampa, Florida, and the now-defunct Fox Kids Network. Fox Searchlight Pictures, Foxstar Productions, and Fox Studios Australia are just a few of the other corporate entities that have used variations based on the original logo's design. 21st Century Fox, the corporate successor to the old News Corporation, uses a logo incorporating a minimalist representation of the searchlights featured in the logo.\n\n—Includes theatrical reissue(s).\n\nThe Academy Film Archive houses the 20th Century Fox Features Collection which contains features, trailers, and production elements mostly from the Fox, Twentieth Century, and Twentieth Century-Fox studios, from the late 1920s–1950s.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4677724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4677724", "title": "A Bigger Bang (concert tour)", "text": "A Bigger Bang (concert tour)\n\nA Bigger Bang was a worldwide concert tour by The Rolling Stones which took place between August 2005 and August 2007, in support of their album \"A Bigger Bang\". At the time, it was the highest grossing tour of all time, earning $558,255,524. It has since been surpassed by U2's 2009 to 2011 U2 360 Tour, now placing second.\n\nIn 2005, the Stones announced plans for another world tour starting 21 August at a press conference and a mini concert at the Juilliard School in New York City. The A Bigger Bang Tour was expected to include dates throughout the United States and Canada before going to South America, Asia and Europe. During the Q&A, Mick Jagger told reporters that it would not necessarily be their last tour.\n\nAll rehearsals for the tour took place in Toronto, Ontario, in a private school; for the full stage rehearsals, a hangar at Pearson International Airport was rented.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, the Rolling Stones performed a surprise club show on 10 August 2005 at the Phoenix Concert Theatre before an audience of 1,000, each only paying $10 (the Phoenix's regular cover charge).\n\nThe tour had its official start on 21 August 2005 with two shows at historic Fenway Park in Boston. The Stones' huge stage caused extensive damage to the outfield, so that approximately 40,000 square feet (4,000 m²) of sod had to be brought in to repair it, and a subsequent baseball game held at the park three days later had to be pushed back an hour to give the grounds crew more time to complete the repairs.\n\nAt the end of 2005, it was announced by tour producer Michael Cohl that the A Bigger Bang Tour had grossed a record-shattering $162 million since opening at Fenway Park. This broke the previous North American record, held by the Stones themselves for their own 1994/1995 Voodoo Lounge Tour, which grossed approximately $120 million.\nIn terms of revenue, the A Bigger Bang Tour was the largest tour in North America. The second largest was the Stones' 1997/1998 Bridges to Babylon Tour.\n\nOn 1 February 2006, The Stones played their first concert at the Baltimore Arena since 1969, the second smallest venue they have played for the entire tour. Their most intimate performance, save the surprise Phoenix show in Toronto, was in Radio City Music Hall on 14 March 2006, in a private concert for supporters of the Robin Hood Foundation. This benefit concert was their only performance at the venue to date. Other intimate venues The Stones played during the tour was the Beacon Theater in New York City. On 28 August 2005, the Rolling Stones performed at Frank Clair Stadium in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, their first performance in Ottawa since a performance at the Ottawa Auditorium 40 years earlier on 24 April 1965.\n\nWhile on the American leg of the tour, on 5 February 2006 the Stones played \"Start Me Up\", \"Rough Justice\" and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" at the halftime show of Super Bowl XL in Detroit. Before performing \"Satisfaction\", Jagger made an uncharacteristic comment on their longevity: \"This one we could've done for Super Bowl I.\" Jagger was asked to leave out two sexually suggestive lyrics. The audio on his microphone was lowered twice for the two requested omissions, but Jagger still sang those lyrics.\nThe outstanding scale of the tour was realised on 18 February 2006 when the Stones played a one-night concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The free concert was broadcast on television and broke several records as the largest rock concert of all time. There were a reported two million people present on the beach and crowding subsequent streets. A special bridge was constructed for the band to cross from the stage to the hotel safely. Three days after the monstrous event, U2 played in São Paulo, and clearly affected by the huge night, ended their concert with the words, \"I can't get no, satisfaction!\" While the Guinness Book of World Records states the largest free concert ever was given in the same spot in 1994 by Rod Stewart, to 3.5 million people, that figure includes everyone who was on Copacabana Beach for fireworks and New Year's Eve celebrations, not just for that concert. This show was recorded for exhibition on digital movie screens across the United States via Regal Cinemas and heard live on XM Radio. Additionally, the show was shown live on AOL Music in partnership with Network Live.\n\nThe Stones arrived on 8 April in the People's Republic of China for their first-ever performance in the world's most populous country (performances planned in 2003 for the Licks Tour were canceled due to the SARS epidemic). The Chinese authorities requested that the group not perform \"Brown Sugar\", \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Beast of Burden\", and \"Let's Spend the Night Together\", as they were considered to be \"too suggestive.\"\n\nAfter their 18 April 2006 performance in Wellington, New Zealand, the Rolling Stones took a one-month break before embarking on the European leg of their A Bigger Bang Tour. Mick Jagger remained in New Zealand to film a cameo in the sitcom \"The Knights of Prosperity\", while Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood went to Fiji for two weeks with their wives.\n\nDuring the vacation, Richards fell from a tree. After suffering a concussion, he was rushed back to Ascot Private Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand, for further observation. Although reports claimed he had been released two days later, it was soon confirmed by the hospital he underwent brain surgery on 5 May to relieve a blood clot that had gathered behind his skull. The BBC reported that upon discharge, Richards profusely thanked the hospital staff for his care.\n\nOn 15 May, Britain's \"The Independent\" newspaper said that the injury meant up to six shows could be pulled from the start of the band's European tour at an estimated cost of £1 million a show. The A Bigger Bang Tour restarted in Milan, Italy on 11 July 2006 at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, with Jagger singing an entire Italian translation of \"As Tears Go By\" and Richards having made a full recovery; four of the first fifteen dates were rescheduled for later in the summer, with the rest of the dates taking place in the summer of 2007. As well as the first fifteen dates, two more dates were postponed due to Jagger contracting laryngitis.\n\nThe only previous show cancelled was one in Dublin, due to complications with the promoter. Due to delays with construction, the two shows set to be at Wembley Stadium were moved to Twickenham Stadium, London. To promote this European leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour, there were plans to release the new track \"Biggest Mistake\" from the \"A Bigger Bang\" album.\n\nIn mid-August 2007, several media sources reported that the band would quit touring at the end of their tour, and the last concert on the tour, in London on 26 August, would be their last gig ever. Less than a week later, in an interview with \"The Sun\" newspaper, Wood said the band had no plans to quit. and Jagger also stated \"I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours.\"\n\nThe tour concluded with a record total gross of $558,255,524. This surpassed the previous record of $377 million earned by U2 for their successful Vertigo Tour. The Stones also hold the record for third and fourth highest grossing tours with the Voodoo Lounge Tour and Bridges to Babylon Tour.\n\nThe official logo for the tour was the \"Chippy Tongue\"—an exploding re-design of the traditional Tongue logo.\n\nThere were five different ticket options at each concert in the USA: Gold Seating $100, Diamond Seating $350, Premium Seating $175, General Admission $100 and Side Seating $50. In the United Kingdom, the price levels were £40, £60, £90, £150 and £340. Tickets had been seen on eBay for up to $4000. Hundreds of tickets remained unsold at some of the band's British shows, such as the show at Hampden Park, Glasgow, though the show at The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was a sell out. The first concert at Fenway Park also saw California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger charge 36 Republican donors US$100,000 each to view the show with him in his VIP box. Jagger quipped about the Schwarzenegger, \"Apparently he's been fundraising outside, selling bootleg T-shirts and scalping tickets\", to the crowd, with Richards adding, \"Hey, Arnold, don't forget our cut on the T-shirts.\" \n\nThe A Bigger Bang Tour stage was designed by Mark Fisher. Production design was by Fisher, Charlie Watts, Mick Jagger and Patrick Woodroffe. The show included state-of-the-art electronics that presented visual screen shots of the Stones Tongue and live footage. The stage was 25 m (84 ft) tall. The multi-level construction included balconies behind the stage with accommodation for 400 audience. As on the Bridges to Babylon and Licks tours, the band played part of the set on a 'B' stage in the center of the field. A section of the stage detached itself and rolled the entire band along a catwalk, creating an \"island\" B stage in the middle of the stadium. Unusual stage designs in and of themselves have been a feature since Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas '75.\n\nThe introduction featured fireworks and computer-generated graphics representing the literal Big Bang. The four band members' faces hazily appear, and further graphics depicting fast travel through a city's streets before Keith Richards appeared on the screen to the sound of the band's opening song (mainly \"Start Me Up\" or \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" although a handful of other numbers opened shows on the tour).\n\nDuring the concerts, one large central screen played live footage of the various band members, predominantly Jagger. Either side of the main screen, there were two sets of lighting effect panels that combine with the main screen to produce visual effects at various points in the show.\n\nAt stadium gigs, during \"Sympathy for the Devil\", huge flames were sent into the air above the stage. During the 1970s, this song only made sporadic live appearances, though is captured on 1977's \"Love You Live\". However, since 1989's Steel Wheels Tour, \"Sympathy for the Devil\" has become a setlist mainstay and a vehicle for the show's most elaborate effects.\n\nOn Saturday 11 November 2006, Mick Jagger's father, Joe Jagger, died of pneumonia at age ninety-three in Kingston upon Thames near London. Jagger flew to Britain the day before to see his father one last time before returning to Las Vegas the same day, where he was to perform on Saturday night. The show went ahead as scheduled.\n\nRolling Stones\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nThe set list played at the concerts changed at every destination and included new and old songs, but mostly centred around the same numbers. Altogether 80 different songs were played. At almost every destination, the opening song switched between \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\", \"Start Me Up\",\"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll\", and \"Paint It Black\"; the closing numbers were either \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" or \"Brown Sugar.\" A selection of new material was frequent as well as two songs sung by guitarist Keith Richards.\n\nNew tracks included: \"Rough Justice\", \"Infamy\", \"This Place Is Empty\", \"It Won't Take Long\", \"Rain Fall Down\", \"Streets of Love\", \"Back of My Hand\" and \"Oh No, Not You Again.\"\n\nThe Set List for the final show in The O2 in London, England, on 26 August – the last concert of the tour – was the following:\n\n\nAccording to Setlist.fm, these were the most frequently performed songs on the tour:\n\n\nArtists playing as an introduction to the Stones at various destinations included Toots & the Maytals, Lifehouse, The Black Eyed Peas, Alice Cooper, Maroon 5, Beck, Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins, Alanis Morissette, Christina Aguilera, Mötley Crüe, Metallica, Brooks & Dunn, Bonnie Raitt, Trey Anastasio, Dave Matthews Band, Living Colour, The Living End, Joss Stone, Nickelback, Buddy Guy, The Charlatans, Regina, Feeder, the John Mayer Trio, Wilco, Richie Kotzen and Our Lady Peace.\n\nDominican artist Juan Luis Guerra, opened their San Juan, Puerto Rico show making it the only Merengue artist that has ever opened for the Stones. This opening act \"garnered the best reception ever seen at a Stones show\", as reported by It's Only Rock and Roll, the Rolling Stones Fan Club of Europe.\n\nFor the Halifax, Nova Scotia, show acts included Halifax natives Sloan, well known rap artist Kanye West and Alice Cooper. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club opened the show in Wichita and Missoula. Three Days Grace opened both concerts in Regina. Blue October opened for them in Nampa, Idaho.\n\nThe two shows in San Francisco were supported by Metallica, who said they were \"honoured\" to break a seventeen-year span of not performing an opening show, in order to open for the Stones. The Stones acknowledged this gesture by giving them 75 minutes per show, instead of the usual 45 to 60 minutes. They were also Metallica's only dates that year as they had planned to take 2005 off from touring.\n\nGuns N' Roses were scheduled to open for the Stones for two dates in Germany, whilst on one of their Chinese Democracy Tour pre-legs. However, due to Keith Richards' fall from a tree, the shows were cancelled.\n\nVan Morrison was the supporting act in Nijmegen, Netherlands as well as in Oakland, California.. Due to heavy rain his amps, etc. were getting wet, so he was forced to stop after two songs.\n\n\n"}

The war began following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.\n\nA notable event of the war was that Pakistan Air Force flying ace Muhammad Mahmood Alam shot down five Indian Air Force Hawker Hunter Mk.56 fighters in less than a minute, four being in first 30 seconds and became one of the few aviators who became ace in a day and the only jet age ace-in-a-day.

It began in the early 1970s and lasted until the mid-late 1980s. The era also marked the emergence of Ozploitation, a film genre characterised by the exploitation of colloquial Australian culture.\n\nThe Australian film industry declined after World War II, coming to a virtual stop by the early 1960s. The Gorton (1968–71) and Whitlam Governments (1972–75) intervened and rescued the industry from its expected oblivion. The federal and several state governments established bodies to assist with the funding of film production and the training of film makers through the Australian Film Television and Radio School, which fostered a new generation of Australian filmmakers who were able to bring their visions to the screen. The 1970s saw a huge renaissance of the Australian film industry. Australia produced nearly 400 films between 1970 and 1985, more than had been made in the history of the Australian film industry.\n\nIn contrast to pre-New Wave films, New Wave films are often viewed as fresh and creative, possessing \"a vitality, a love of open spaces and a propensity for sudden violence and languorous sexuality\". The \"straight-ahead narrative style\" of many Australian New Wave films reminded American audiences of \"the Hollywood-maverick period of the late 1960s and early '70s that had just about run its course\".\n\nMany filmmakers and actors launched international careers through their work in the Australian New Wave.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral films of the Australian New Wave are regarded as classics of world cinema and have been ranked among films considered the best. Published in 2004, \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\" includes \"Walkabout\", \"Mad Max\", \"Breaker Morant\", \"Gallipoli\", \"Mad Max 2\", \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" and \"Dead Calm\". In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine chose \"Mad Max 2\" and \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" as two of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, ranking in at #280 and #161 respectively. The 2011 book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\" features \"Walkabout\", \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", \"The Last Wave\", \"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith\", \"My Brilliant Career\", \"Mad Max\" and \"Gallipoli\". Since its re-release in 2009, \"Wake in Fright\" has been assessed as one of, if not the greatest, Australian New Wave film.\n\nThe term \"glitter cycle\" refers to a subgenre of eccentric Australian comedies that came to prominence in the early 1990s, spurning a post-new wave revival of Australian film. These films are noted for their celebration of Australian popular culture, camp aesthetic, colourful makeup and costuming, and musical performance pieces. Prominent glitter films include \"Strictly Ballroom\" (1992), \"Muriel's Wedding\" (1994), \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (1994) and \"Love Serenade\" (1996). Other prominent post-new wave revival films of the 1990s include \"The Big Steal (1990)\", \"Proof\" (1991), \"Romper Stomper\" (1992), \"Babe\" (1995), \"Shine\" (1996), \"Kiss or Kill\" (1997), and \"The Castle\" (1997).\n\nIn 2008, a documentary film celebrating the romps of the Australian New Wave of 1970s and 1980s low-budget cinema was made.

{"id": "35626853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35626853", "title": "Bertrand–Edgeworth model", "text": "Bertrand–Edgeworth model\n\nIn microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth model of price-setting oligopoly looks at what happens when there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where there is a limit to the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.\n\nJoseph Louis François Bertrand (1822–1900) developed the model of Bertrand competition in oligopoly. This approach was based on the assumption that there are at least two firms producing a homogenous product with constant marginal cost (this could be constant at some positive value, or with zero marginal cost as in Cournot). Consumers buy from the cheapest seller. The Bertrand–Nash equilibrium of this model is to have all (or at least two) firms setting the price equal to marginal cost. The argument is simple: if one firm sets a price above marginal cost then another firm can undercut it by a small amount (often called \"epsilon undercutting\", where epsilon represents an arbitrarily small amount) so that the equilibrium is zero (this is sometimes called the Bertrand paradox).\n\nThe Bertrand approach assumes that firms are willing and able to supply all demand: there is no limit to the amount that they can produce or sell. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth considered the case where there is a limit to what firms can sell (a capacity constraint): he showed that if there is a fixed limit to what firms can sell, then there may exist no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (this is sometimes called the Edgeworth paradox).\n\nMartin Shubik developed the Bertrand–Edgeworth model to allow for the firm to be willing to supply only up to its profit maximizing output at the price which it set (under profit maximization this occurs when marginal cost equals price). He considered the case of strictly convex costs, where marginal cost is increasing in output. Shubik showed that if a Nash equilibrium exists, it must be the perfectly competitive price (where demand equals supply, and all firms set price equal to marginal cost). However, this can only happen if market demand is infinitely elastic (horizontal) at the competitive price. In general, as in the Edgeworth paradox, no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist. Huw Dixon showed that in general a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium will exist when there are convex costs. Dixon’s proof used the Existence Theorem of Partha Dasgupta and Eric Maskin. Under Dixon's assumption of (weakly) convex costs, marginal cost will be non-decreasing. This is consistent with a cost function where marginal cost is flat for a range of outputs, marginal cost is smoothly increasing, or indeed where there is a kink in total cost so that marginal cost makes a discontinuous jump upwards.\n\nThere have been several responses to the non-existence of pure-strategy equilibrium identified by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth and Martin Shubik. Whilst the existence of mixed-strategy equilibrium was demonstrated by Huw Dixon, it has not proven easy to characterize what the equilibrium actually looks like. However, Allen and Hellwig were able to show that in a large market with many firms, the average price set would tend to the competitive price.\n\nIt has been argued that non-pure strategies are not plausible in the context of the Bertrand–Edgworth model. Alternative approaches have included:\n\n\n"}

The dealer slides the top card partially off the deck as if to deal it, while the dominant hand instead takes hold of the bottom card. The card is snapped away from the deck while the top card is reset.\n\nUnless the dealer is particularly skilled at bottom dealing, the technique produces a slightly different sound from standard dealing, and the second-to-bottom card may be drawn slightly out of place.

{"id": "826885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=826885", "title": "Braess's paradox", "text": "Braess's paradox\n\nBraess's paradox (often cited as Braess' paradox) is a proposed explanation for the situation where an alteration to a road network to improve traffic flow actually has the reverse effect and impedes traffic through it. The paradox was postulated in 1968 by German mathematician Dietrich Braess, who noticed that adding a road to a congested road traffic network could increase overall journey time, and it has been used to explain instances of improved traffic flow when existing major roads are closed.\n\nThe paradox may have analogies in electrical power grids and biological systems. It has been suggested that in theory, the improvement of a malfunctioning network could be accomplished by removing certain parts of it.\n\nDietrich Braess, a mathematician at Ruhr University, Germany, noticed the flow in a road network could be impeded by adding a new road, when he was working on traffic modelling. His idea was that if each driver is making the optimal self-interested decision as to which route is quickest, a shortcut could be chosen too often for drivers to have the shortest travel times possible. More formally, the idea behind Braess's discovery is that the Nash equilibrium may not equate with the best overall flow through a network.\n\nThe paradox is stated as follows:\"For each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions, one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the density of the flow. If every driver takes the path that looks most favourable to them, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times.\"\n\nAdding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. That is because the Nash equilibrium of such a system is not necessarily optimal. The network change induces a new game structure which leads to a (multiplayer) prisoner's dilemma. In a Nash equilibrium, drivers have no incentive to change their routes. While the system is not in a Nash equilibrium, individual drivers are able to improve their respective travel times by changing the routes they take. In the case of Braess's paradox, drivers will continue to switch until they reach Nash equilibrium despite the reduction in overall performance.\n\nIf the latency functions are linear, adding an edge can never make total travel time at equilibrium worse by a factor of more than 4/3.\n\nIn 1983, Steinberg and Zangwill provided, under reasonable assumptions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for Braess' paradox to occur in a general transportation network when a new route is added. (Note that their result applies to the addition of \"any\" new route, not just to the case of adding a single link.) As a corollary, they obtain that Braess's paradox is about as likely to occur as not occur; their result applies to random rather than planned networks and additions.\n\nBraess's paradox has a counterpart in case of a reduction of the road network (which may cause a reduction of individual commuting time).\n\nIn Seoul, South Korea, a speeding up in traffic around the city was seen when a motorway was removed as part of the Cheonggyecheon restoration project. In Stuttgart, Germany, after investments into the road network in 1969, the traffic situation did not improve until a section of newly built road was closed for traffic again. In 1990 the temporary closing of 42nd Street in New York City for Earth Day reduced the amount of congestion in the area. In 2008 Youn, Gastner and Jeong demonstrated specific routes in Boston, New York City and London where that might actually occur and pointed out roads that could be closed to reduce predicted travel times. In 2009, New York experimented with closures of Broadway at Times Square and Herald Square, which resulted in improved traffic flow and permanent pedestrian plazas.\n\nIn 2012, Paul Lecroart, of the institute of planning and development of the Île-de-France, wrote that \"Despite initial fears, the removal of main roads does not cause deterioration of traffic conditions beyond the starting adjustments. The traffic transfer are limited and below expectations\". He also notes that some motorized travels are not transferred on public transport and simply disappear (\"evaporate\").\n\nThe same phenomenon was also observed when road closing was not part of an urban project but the consequence of an accident. In 2012 in Rouen, a bridge was burned by an accident; during the two following years, other bridges were more used, but the total number of cars crossing bridges was reduced. Similarly, in 2015 in Warsaw, a bridge was closed; authorities observed an increased use of other roads and public transport, but half of the vehicles usually crossing the bridge \"disappeared\" (52,000 out of 105,000 daily).\n\nIn 2012, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization demonstrated, through computational modeling, the potential for the phenomenon to occur in power transmission networks where power generation is decentralized.\n\nIn 2012, an international team of researchers from Institut Néel (CNRS, France), INP (France), IEMN (CNRS, France) and UCL (Belgium) published in Physical Review Letters a paper showing that Braess's paradox may occur in mesoscopic electron systems. In particular, they showed that adding a path for electrons in a nanoscopic network paradoxically reduced its conductance. That was shown both by simulations as well as experiments at low temperature using as scanning gate microscopy.\n\nAdilson E. Motter and collaborators demonstrated that Braess's paradox outcomes may often occur in biological and ecological systems. Motter suggests removing part of a perturbed network could rescue it. For resource management of endangered species food webs, in which extinction of many species might follow sequentially, selective removal of a doomed species from the network could in principle bring about the positive outcome of preventing a series of further extinctions.\n\nIt has been suggested that in basketball, a team can be seen as a network of possibilities for a route to scoring a basket, with a different efficiency for each pathway, and a star player could reduce the overall efficiency of the team, analogous to a shortcut that is overused increasing the overall times for a journey through a road network. A proposed solution for maximum efficiency in scoring is for a star player to shoot about the same number of shots as teammates. However, this approach is not supported by hard statistical evidence, as noted in the original paper.\n\nIn soccer Helenio Herrera is well known for his famous quote \"with 10 [players] our team plays better than with 11\".\n\nConsider a road network as shown in the adjacent diagram on which 4000 drivers wish to travel from point Start to End. The travel time in minutes on the Start-A road is the number of travelers (T) divided by 100, and on Start-B is a constant 45 minutes (likewise with the roads across from them). If the dashed road does not exist (so the traffic network has 4 roads in total), the time needed to drive Start-A-End route with A drivers would be formula_1. The time needed to drive the Start-B-End route with B drivers would be formula_2. If either route took less time, it would not be a Nash equilibrium: a rational driver would switch from the longer route to the shorter route. As there are 4000 drivers, the fact that formula_3 can be used to derive the fact that formula_4 when the system is at equilibrium. Therefore, each route takes formula_5 minutes.\n\nNow suppose the dashed line A-B is a road with an extremely short travel time of approximately 0 minutes. Suppose that the road is opened and one driver tries Start-A-B-End. To his surprise he finds that his time is formula_6 minutes, a saving of 25 minutes. Soon, more of the 4000 drivers are trying this new route. The time taken rises from 40.01 and keeps climbing. When the number of drivers trying the new route reaches 2500, with 1500 still in the Start-B-End route, their time will be formula_7 minutes, which is no improvement over the original route. Meanwhile, those 1500 drivers have been slowed to formula_8 minutes, a 20-minute increase. They are obliged to switch to the new route via A too, so it now takes formula_9 minutes. Nobody has any incentive to travel A-End or Start-B because any driver trying them will take 85 minutes. Thus, the opening of the cross route triggers an irreversible change to it by everyone, costing everyone 80 minutes instead of the original 65. If every driver were to agree not to use the A-B path, or if that route were closed, every driver would benefit by a 15-minute reduction in travel time.\n\nIf one assumes the travel time for each person driving on an edge to be equal, an equilibrium will always exist.\n\nLet formula_10 be the formula for the travel time of each person traveling along edge formula_11 when formula_12 people take that edge. Suppose there is a traffic graph with formula_13 people driving along edge formula_11. Let the energy of e, formula_15, be\n\n(If formula_17 let formula_18). Let the total energy of the traffic graph be the sum of the energies of every edge in the graph.\n\nTake a choice of routes that minimizes the total energy. Such a choice must exist because there are finitely many choices of routes. That will be an equilibrium.\n\nAssume, for contradiction, this is not the case. Then, there is at least one driver who can switch the route and improve the travel time. Suppose the original route is formula_19 while the new route is formula_20. Let formula_21 be total energy of the traffic graph, and consider what happens when the route formula_22 is removed. The energy of each edge formula_23 will be reduced by formula_24 and so the formula_21 will be reduced by formula_26. That is simply the total travel time needed to take the original route. If the new route is then added, formula_20, the total energy formula_21 will be increased by the total travel time needed to take the new route. Because the new route is shorter than the original route, formula_21 must decrease relative to the original configuration, contradicting the assumption that the original set of routes minimized the total energy.\n\nTherefore, the choice of routes minimizing total energy is an equilibrium.\n\nThe above proof outlines a procedure known as best response dynamics, which finds an equilibrium for a linear traffic graph and terminates in a finite number of steps. The algorithm is termed \"best response\" because at each step of the algorithm, if the graph is not at equilibrium then some driver has a best response to the strategies of all other drivers and switches to that response.\n\nPseudocode for Best Response Dynamics:\n\nAt each step, if some particular driver could do better by taking an alternate path (a \"best response\"), doing so strictly decreases the energy of the graph. If no driver has a best response, the graph is at equilibrium. Since the energy of the graph strictly decreases with each step, the best response dynamics algorithm must eventually halt.\n\nIf the travel time functions are linear, that is formula_30 for some formula_31, then at worst, traffic in the energy-minimizing equilibrium is twice as bad as socially optimal.\n\nProof:\nLet \"Z\" be some traffic configuration, with associated energy \"E\"(\"Z\") and total travel time \"T\"(\"Z\"). For each edge, the energy is the sum of an arithmetic progression, and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, one can show that \"E\"(\"Z\") ≤ \"T\"(\"Z\") ≤ 2\"E\"(\"Z\"). If formula_32 is the socially-optimal traffic flow and formula_33 is the energy-minimizing traffic flow, the inequality implies that formula_34.\n\nThus, the total travel time for the energy-minimizing equilibrium is at most twice as bad as for the optimal flow.\n\nIn 2013, Dal Forno and Merlone interpret Braess' paradox as a dynamical ternary choice problem. The analysis shows how the new path changes the problem. Before the new path is available, the dynamics is the same as in binary choices with externalities, but the new path transforms it into a ternary choice problem. The addition of an extra resource enriches the complexity of the dynamics. In fact, there can even be coexistence of cycles, and the implication of the paradox on the dynamics can be seen from both a geometrical and an analytical perspective.\n\n\n\n"}

The show is a follow-up to the 1980 television series \"\", which was presented by Carl Sagan on the Public Broadcasting Service and is considered a milestone for scientific documentaries. This series was developed to bring back the foundation of science to network television at the height of other scientific-based television series and films. The show is presented by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who, as a young high school student, was inspired by Sagan. Among the executive producers are Seth MacFarlane, whose financial investment was instrumental in bringing the show to broadcast television, and Ann Druyan, a co-author and co-creator of the original television series and Sagan's wife. The show is produced by Brannon Braga, and Alan Silvestri composed the backing score.\n\nThe series loosely follows the same thirteen-episode format and storytelling approach that the original \"Cosmos\" used, including elements such as the \"Ship of the Imagination\" and the \"Cosmic Calendar\", but features information updated since the 1980 series, along with extensive computer-generated graphics and animation footage augmenting the narration.\n\nThe series premiered on March 9, 2014, simultaneously in the United States across ten 21st Century Fox networks. The remainder of the series aired on the Fox Network, with the National Geographic Channel rebroadcasting the episodes the next night with extra content. The series has been rebroadcast internationally in dozens of other countries by local National Geographic and Fox stations. The series concluded on June 8, 2014, with home media release of the entire series on June 10, 2014. \"Cosmos\" has been critically praised, winning several television broadcasting awards and a Peabody Award for educational content.\n\nOn January 13, 2018, Fox announced another season titled \"Cosmos: Possible Worlds\", which will debut on March 3, 2019, on Fox, and the following day on National Geographic channels. \n\nThe original 13-part \"\" first aired in 1980 on the Public Broadcasting Service, and was hosted by Carl Sagan. The show has been considered highly significant since its broadcast; David Itzkoff of \"The New York Times\" described it as \"a watershed moment for science-themed television programming\". The show has been watched by at least 400 million people across 60 different countries, and until the 1990 documentary \"The Civil War\", remained the network's highest rated program.\n\nFollowing Sagan's death in 1996, his widow Ann Druyan, the co-creator of the original \"Cosmos\" series along with Steven Soter, and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson sought to create a new version of the series, aimed to appeal to as wide an audience as possible and not just to those interested in the sciences. They had struggled for years with reluctant television networks that failed to see the broad appeal of the show.\n\nSeth MacFarlane had met Druyan through Tyson at the 2008 kickoff event for the Science & Entertainment Exchange, a new Los Angeles office of the National Academy of Sciences, designed to connect Hollywood writers and directors with scientists. A year later, at a 2009 lunch in New York City with Tyson, MacFarlane learned of their interest to re-create \"Cosmos\". He was influenced by \"Cosmos\" as a child, believing that \"Cosmos\" served to \"[bridge] the gap between the academic community and the general public\". At the time MacFarlane told Tyson, \"I'm at a point in my career where I have some disposable income ... and I’d like to spend it on something worthwhile.\" MacFarlane had considered the reduction of effort for space travel in recent decades to be part of \"our culture of lethargy\". MacFarlane, who has several series on the Fox network, was able to bring Druyan to meet the heads of Fox programming, Peter Rice and Kevin Reilly, and helped secure the greenlighting of the show. MacFarlane admits that he is \"the least essential person in this equation\" and the effort is a departure from work he's done before, but considers this to be \"very comfortable territory for me personally\". He and Druyan have become close friends, and Druyan stated that she believed that Sagan and MacFarlane would have been \"kindred spirits\" with their respective \"protean talents\". In June 2012, MacFarlane provided funding to allow about 800 boxes of Sagan's personal notes and correspondences to be donated to the Library of Congress.\nIn a \"Point of Inquiry\" interview, Tyson discussed their goal of capturing the \"spirit of the original \"Cosmos\"\", which he describes as \"uplifting themes that called people to action\". Druyan describes the themes of wonder and skepticism they are infusing into the scripts, in an interview with \"Skepticality\", \"In order for it to qualify on our show it has to touch you. It still has to be rigorously good science—no cutting corners on that. But then, it also has to be that equal part skepticism and wonder both.\" In a \"Big Picture Science\" interview, Tyson credits the success of the original series for the proliferation of science programming, “The task for the next generation of \"Cosmos\" is a little bit different because I don’t need to teach you textbook science. There’s a lot of textbook science in the original \"Cosmos\", but that’s not what you remember most. What most people who remember the original series remember most is the effort to present science in a way that has meaning to you that can influence your conduct as a citizen of the nation and of the world—especially of the world.” Tyson states that the new series will contain both new material and updated versions of topics in the original series, but primarily, will service the “needs of today’s population\". “We want to make a program that is not simply a sequel to the first, but issues forth from the times in which we are making it, so that it matters to those who is this emergent 21st century audience.” Tyson considered that recent successes of science-oriented shows like \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"\", along with films like \"Gravity\", showed that \"science has become mainstream\" and expects \"Cosmos\" \"will land on hugely fertile ground\".\n\nTyson spoke about the \"love-hate relationship\" viewers had with the original series' Spaceship of the Imagination, but confirmed during production that they were developing \"vehicles of storytelling\". Tyson affirmed that defining elements of the original series, such as the Spaceship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar with improved special effects, as well as new elements, would be present. Animation for these sequences was ultimately created by a team hand-picked by MacFarlane for the series. Kara Vallow developed and produced the animation, and the animation studio used was Six Point Harness in Los Angeles, California. The sound of the Spaceship of the Imagination, and sound design in general, was created by Rick Steele, who said of the show: \"Cosmos has been, by far, the most challenging show of my career.\" The updated Spaceship was designed to \"remain timeless and very simple\", according to MacFarlane, using the ceiling to project future events and the floor for those in the past, to allow Tyson, as the host, to \"take [the viewer] to the places that he’s talking about\".\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nIn August 2011, the show was officially announced for primetime broadcast in the spring of 2014. The show is a co-production of Druyan's Cosmos Studios, MacFarlane's Fuzzy Door Productions, and National Geographic Channel; Druyan, MacFarlane, Cosmos Studios' Mitchell Cannold, and director Brannon Braga are the executive producers.\n\nFox's CEO Kevin Reilly considered that the show would be a risk and outside the network's typical programming, but that \"we believe this can have the same massive cultural impact that the original series delivered,\" and committed the network's resources to the show. The show would first be broadcast on Fox, re-airing the same night on the National Geographic Channel.\n\nIn Canada, it was broadcast simultaneously on Global, National Geographic Channel and Nat Geo Wild. A preview of the show's first episode was aired for student filmmakers at the White House Student Film Festival on February 28, 2014.\n\n\"Cosmos\" premiered simultaneously in the US across ten Fox networks: Fox, FX, FXX, FXM, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, National Geographic Channel, Nat Geo WILD, Nat Geo Mundo, and Fox Life. According to Fox Networks, this was the first time that a TV show was set to premiere in a global simulcast across their network of channels.\n\nThe Fox network broadcast averaged about 5.8 million viewers in Nielsen’s affiliate-based estimates for the 9 o’clock hour Sunday, as well as a 2.1 rating/5 share in adults 18-49. The under-50 audience was roughly 60% men. Viewing on other networks raised these totals to 8.5 million and a 2.9 rating in the demo, according to Nielsen.\n\n\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" has received highly positive reviews from critics, receiving a Metacritic rating of 83 out of 100 based on 19 reviews.\n\nThe miniseries won the 4th Critics' Choice Television Award for \"Best Reality Series\", with Tyson awarded for \"Best Reality Host\". The miniseries was also nominated for \"Outstanding Achievement in News and Information\" for the 30th TCA Awards and 12 Emmy Awards, including \"Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series\". The program won the Emmy for \"Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming\" and \"Outstanding Sound Editing for Nonfiction Programming (Single or Multi-Camera)\", and Silvestri won the Emmys for both \"Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music\" and \"Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score)\". The series won a 2014 Peabody Award within the Education category. In 2014, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) presented \"Cosmos\" with the Robert B. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking. \"\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" opened the eyes of a new generation to humanity’s triumphs, its mistakes, and its astounding potential to reach unimagined heights.\"\n\nThe new miniseries has been criticized by some Christians and the religious right for some of the things stated during the show. Christian fundamentalists were upset that the scientific theories covered in the show opposed the Genesis creation narrative in the Bible. The Catholic League was upset that the science show \"smears\" Catholicism. A spokesman for the League noted how the show focused on Giordano Bruno, whom the Catholic Church turned over to secular authorities to be burnt at the stake for blasphemy, immoral conduct, and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology, in addition to some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology, and stated that the show \"skipped Copernicus and Galileo—two far more consequential men in proving and disseminating the heliocentric theory—because in their cases, the Church's role was much more complicated\".\n\n\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD on June 10, 2014 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The set contains all 13 episodes, plus an audio commentary on the first episode, and three featurettes: \"Celebrating Carl Sagan: A Selection from the Library of Congress Dedication\", \"\"Cosmos\" at Comic-Con 2013\" and \"\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" – The Voyage Continues\". Exclusive to the Blu-ray version is the interactive Cosmic Calendar.\n\nOn January 13, 2018, it was announced that another season titled \"Cosmos: Possible Worlds\" would debut in 2019 on Fox and National Geographic channels. It will again be hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson and executive produced by Ann Druyan, Seth MacFarlane, Brannon Braga, and Jason Clark. The studio portions are being filmed at Santa Fe Studios with plans for location shooting in the Pacific Northwest, Europe, and Asia. Druyan expects the series to be more inspiring, with a strong emphasis on a hopeful future, and she hopes that the series will help correct antiscience rhetoric and policies. The 13-episode series will premiere on March 3, 2019, on Fox, and the following day on National Geographic.\n\n"}
{"id": "34202871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34202871", "title": "Entertainment industry during World War II", "text": "Entertainment industry during World War II\n\nThe entertainment industry during World War II underwent changes to help aid the cause of the war. The entertainment industry during this time was often controlled by a country's government. Since the governments believed that a supportive home front was crucial to their countries' victory, they generally sought to keep the civilian spirits high and to depict the war in a positive light. With this motive in mind, governments engaged in the regulation and censorship of the forms of media, as well as the introduction of new methods of informing citizens through these media outlets.\n\nGovernment censorship of mass media was enforced in much of the world during this time period in fear of threatening the domestic harmony of a nation. Some of the most popular forms of entertainment during World War II were radio, film, and music. In conjunction with one another, these forms of media kept citizens entertained with a pastime, informed about their country's war efforts, and motivated to contribute to the cause of the war. The radio was a great way to reach out to citizens and communicate with the community.\nIn comparison to television, radio was a much more affordable form of entertainment. Because of this, the radio was the most popular form of entertainment during World War II. Radio stations fueled propaganda and reached a countless number of citizens. Many shows popularized and quickly gained influence in certain countries. Radio broadcasts, like other forms of entertainment at the time, were regulated by the government and were pushed to keep citizens informed about war efforts and to encourage citizens to help the cause. Radio stations, along with other media outlets, were major fuels of propaganda during World War II.\n\nAn example of a popular radio program is Tommy Handley's \"It's That Man Again,\" which continued airing throughout the war in Britain until 1949. Comedian Tommy Handley utilized his radio broadcasts to keep citizens informed about the war efforts and to keep the spirits of Britain high during this time of hardship. \"It's That Man Again\" garnered substantial influence - up to 40% of the British population listened to this show during World War II. The show’s last broadcast occurred on January 6, 1949, with Handley passing away only three days later. To further demonstrate the show’s influence, two memorial services were held in his honor, with thousands of listeners present at the funeral grounds.\n\n\"It's That Man Again\" was hosted on BBC, a broadcasting service program still widely known in Britain today. Like BBC, other broadcasting companies also attempted to keep civilian spirits high and expressed certain opinions on the war. Hosts of radio programs took sides regarding the war; for example, the Voice of Russia, the government's international radio broadcasting station, expressed the country’s opinions and eventually targeted the United States. Radio programs were broadcast in up to twenty-three different languages, which widened the appeal of these stations.\n\nThough Philo Farnsworth had invented the first working television system in 1927, only few people owned television sets because of its price and scarcity. Since most citizens did not own televisions, they relied on cinemas to keep informed and educated. Cinemas of Europe and the United States were mostly regulated by the government. Films made during this time period were more realistic than escapist, in contrast to entertainment during the Great Depression.\n\nCinemas provided for a good place to watch information films. New films that showed in cinemas were often informative of a country’s war efforts or the progress of the war itself. Furthermore, the government released additional films that were designed to model the desired human behaviors and actions during the war. These government films often suggested methods of coping with the loss of families and homes and to inform the audience to caution the presence of enemy spies.\n\nThe Ministry of Information was formed on the day that followed the start of war. It was the department of government that managed propaganda and publicity for Britain during World War II. The Ministry of Information recognized the significant influence that the entertainment industry had over the citizens, so they kept their work close to film maker. British war films typically incorporated a suspenseful story of war while infusing the messages that the Ministry wished to deliver into the storyline.\n\nAnother popular example of one of these films is the British propaganda film \"Miss Grant Goes to the Door\", which taught audiences how to recognize German spies, how to hide Ordnance Survey maps from enemies, and how to be of aid to soldiers and sailors – women were encouraged to knit socks and mittens for sailors. This film further reminded citizens that ‘’Cromwell’’ was the codeword to signify the invasion of Britain.\n\nTheater attendance was at an all-time high in 1946, proving to be Hollywood’s most profitable year of the decade. For the United States, the propaganda agency that coordinated actions with the film industry was the Office of War Information. The agency worked with film makers to record and photograph wartime activities while regulating its content. The agency worked to display the war in a positive light and censored negative content like pictures of soldier insanity and casualty; pictures of American casualties were banned from being published until 1943.\n\nWith the growth of the film industry came the growth of the influence of Hollywood celebrities. Hollywood stars appeared in advertisements and toured the country to encourage citizens to purchase war bonds to support their country in the war.\n\nIn 2008, documents published by the National Archives leaked to the public regarding the involvement of numerous Hollywood celebrities with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Some 750,000 documents reveal that famous American public figures were actually spies for the Office of Strategic Services. These celebrities include celebrity chef Julia Child and baseball player Moe Berg, who were hired to gather information required by the US military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe theme of war took a popular role in the development of pop music. Artists expressed their feelings of hardships during the war. Others sang songs that aimed to lift the spirits of the citizens.\n\nBritish singer Vera Lynn, or the Forces Sweetheart, sang popular songs such as \"We'll Meet Again\" and \"The White Cliffs of Dover\", which restored an optimistic outlook for soldiers and families while uplifting Allied spirits during a time of hardship when Nazi Germany was bombing Britain. American singer and stage actress Adelaide Hall also entertained extensively throughout WWII entertaining both the public and the troops in the UK and with ENSA across Europe.\n\n\"The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)\" was a 1941 Academy Award-winning song by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein, which illustrated memories of the magnificent city of Paris that had been taken over by Germany prior to the song’s release.\n\nThe Andrews Sisters' \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" expressed the feelings of a man's draft experience. Many listeners could relate because of the number of people drafted into the war.\n\nGovernment agencies pushed music producers to record more patriotic and uplifting songs. The Office of War Information especially pushed for this following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in the United States. In her book \"God Bless America\", Kathleen E.R. Smith states that only twenty-seven war-themed songs had reached the top ten charts during the span of the war.\n\nThis suggests that these patriotic war-themed songs, pushed by the government, did not sell well. Billboard archives suggest that the public preferred escapist and rather lighthearted songs. Female singers became more prominent by singing songs expressing the war from the woman’s point of view, illustrating feelings of separation and loneliness. Furthermore, as musicians joined the military, larger bands shrunk and often disbanded, creating a trend towards soloists and smaller music groups.\n\nMany musicians contributed to the war effort. Musician Glenn Miller enlisted in the army to perform in the United States Organization, in which he established the Army Air Force Band. Musician Irving Berlin assisted in the war effort by creating the \"This is the Army\" musical, which raised millions by playing on Broadway and for the US troops.\n\nBecause of the war, approximately 15 million people \"crossed county lines\" and brought about the spread of different music styles like country music and African-American styles.\n\nEven the war itself influenced the music industry through its technology. The capture of Germany’s magnetic tape technology became a staple in music production for independent producers. Magnetic tape sound recording allowed for independent producers to produce high quality sounds without the assistance of major labels.\n\nChanges in music correlated to the evolution of dances. Ballroom dancing gained popularity when people were looking to have a good time. The Grafton Ballroom in Britain was famed for its architecture and interior at the time.\n\nThe evolution of music brought about new sounds such as jazz and swing music. These sounds translated to new dances. Jitterbug dancing grew in popularity. The Jive, which was taken to England by American troops, eventually became a dance of the International style of Ballroom dance.\n\n"}

The death of a boy deeply devoted to him moves him, as dying for a cause is something he would wish for himself, in keeping with Nazi glorification of heroic death.\n\nTheir Communist persecutors are portrayed simply as brutal murderers, typical of works prior to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (and again after its breach). The film was shown for some time after the pact, owing to bureaucratic oversight, complicating the efforts of Nazi propaganda.\n\n"}

He grew up in the small town of Burlington, Kentucky. Fields wanted to be an artist since childhood: \"I don't know that becoming an artist is a decision you can make... I've been drawing since before I can remember, and I started painting at age nine. I used to do all these monsters and stuff, and my mom was frankly a little concerned about it. Now that I'm making a living at it, I think mom's OK with it. My parents always encouraged me to draw and do what I wanted with it. They've always been 100% behind me.\" Fields attended the Central Academy of Commercial Art in Cincinnati, and moved to Chicago after graduation. He worked there for about a year in advertising, producing illustrations and concept sketches for both television commercials and print ads. He worked at Leo Burnett Advertising in Chicago as a storyboard comp artist.\n\nFields continued painting on his own time, and began sending out samples of his work; \"Dragon\" magazine was among the clients those who were interested in his work. Fields painted his first cover for \"Dragon\" in 1988, for issue #142. He applied to TSR's art department soon after and was hired. \"I went from freelancing, completely on my own, to sitting in a room with the likes of Clyde Caldwell, Brom, Tony Szczudlo, Robh Ruppel, Dana Knutson, Randy Post, and Todd Lockwood. I just sort of stopped and thought, 'Wow, I've arrived.'\" Fields worked on scenes from worlds such as Forgotten Realms, and even Ravenloft, saying \"It was fun doing the Gothic horror stuff. In some cases, I think I took it further than other artists. I put a lot more blood in there.\"\n\nHis work was represented in the 1996 collection \"The Art of TSR: Colossal Cards\". Critic Joseph Szadkowski of \"The Washington Times\" singled out Fields's work \"Dragon Claw\" as \"stunning\", and later named the collection as the year's \"Best Trading Card Release Based on Fantasy Art\". Archangel Entertainment released a book of his artwork in 1999, entitled \"The Art of Fred Fields\".\n\nIn May 2010, artwork by Fields appeared as part of the \"Lucid Daydreams\" Exhibition at Gallery Provocateur in Chicago.\n\nFred Fields has had his art appear in various \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game books and their associated novels throughout the 1990s, as well as in other games such as \"Shadowrun\". His artwork has appeared on numerous \"D&D\" covers, such as \"Greyhawk Ruins\" and \"Book of Artifacts\".\n\nFields has illustrated cards for the \"\" collectible card game.\n\n"}

It is available since October 15, 2013 and is the third installment of the Deponia trilogy.\n\nAnti-hero Rufus still lives on the planet Deponia which is nothing more than a dump. He still wishes to become an inhabitant of Elysium, the flying city. Furthermore, he wants to stop the Organon. This military organization deceived the Elysian government by telling them Deponia is not inhabited any more and it would be better to blow up the planet. Rufus gets help from pirate Bozo, the Elysium girl Goal and the resistance.\n\nEn route to the upper ascension station via Bozo's cruiser, Rufus and Goal get stuck on an Organon cruiser behind them. While trying to save Goal, Rufus meets Barry, his biggest fan who wants to watch Rufus in action. Rufus frees Goal, destroying Bozo's cruiser in the process.\n\nRufus, Goal, Doc and Bozo are forced to continue their trip to the upper ascension station in Porta Fisco by foot. They overnight in a hotel. There, Doc and Bozo set up a lab so the three Goal personalities can be finally merged. Doc and Bozo deceive Rufus by telling him he must look for an important object (of which they think does not exist).\n\nMeanwhile, Argus sends Cletus and Opperbot on a mission to find Goal after they noticed they captured Donna instead of Goal. Rufus finds out Cletus has the important object in his room. Once in possession he returns to the lab but it seems the operation is already finished with success. A furious Rufus leaves the lab and runs into Argus who just arrived with Donna. After some hide-and-seek, Rufus (currently wearing Cletus' clothes) can convince Argus he is Cletus \"(Rufus and Cletus are look-alikes)\". A disguised Goal claims to be Donna. The plan works and Argus takes them to the last Organon-cruiser in Porta Fisco.\n\nAboard the cruiser, Rufus removes his disguise before being warned about the cameras in the room. He attempts to erase the footage and Goal is taken to be interrogated by Argus in the process. Rufus sneaks in inside a torture bot as Argus reveals his plan to conquer Elysium and wants Goal by his side. Much to Goal and Rufus' surprise, Argus removes his helmet to reveal he also looks just like Rufus. Rufus tries to free Goal by pushing random buttons but ends up injecting her with a lethal shot. As she dies, she admits her love for Rufus. Angered, Argus has the bot (not knowing Rufus is inside) thrown overboard.\n\nRufus ends up in a room similar to the tutorial of each game. He believes the room is Hell due to the repeated process of being killed by the crusher and returning to the room. Further investigation reveals the room is actually a cloning facility. Rufus manages to get past the machinery to find a man resembling Death. Rufus follows the man and finds out his name is Hermes. Hermes admits that he is responsible for the situation Rufus finds himself in. He discovered Utopia and got the idea to make Elysium to fly there. He thought up the idea to destroy Deponia to power Elysium, having forgotten that people still live there. He also created a line of clone workers to do the work. Hermes explains that Rufus, Cletus, and Argus are the last living prototypes of the clones. Rufus becomes infuriated and vandalizes the facility. Hermes becomes depressed and kills himself.\n\nSuddenly, a dead woman falls out of the sky. Rufus recognizes Goal and wants to ask Hermes if there is a way to clone her. However, Hermes just committed suicide so Rufus first has to clone him. Once succeeded Goal is also cloned. However, she returns as a baby and falls in the drain. Rufus has three problems which must be solved at same time: to rescue baby Goal, to prevent the invasion of the Organon in Elysium and to prevent Deponia to be blown up. That's why he clones himself twice which means there are now three \"Ruffi\".\n\nOne Rufus ends up aboard the last Organon-cruiser while the other two end up in the resistance headquarters. They find the Captain Seagull is still alive and is the new leader. He's planning to fire a cannon at Elysium to prevent Deponia from being destroyed. One Rufus convinces him to hold off the attack until he can age Goal back to an adult. Seagull is really only allowing it hoping Rufus will fail and finally acknowledge how much of a failure Seagull thinks he is. Rufus ages baby Goal but she is in fact revealed to be a clone of Donna rather than Goal. Seagull demands Rufus gives up and resorts to threatening one clone with a gun while the other points out Rufus' faults. Rufus' deceased adoptive mother is mentioned pushing Seagull to fire the gun. The other resistance members intervene and the shot instead hits the other clone. Rufus carries his wounded clone to an escape vehicle but accidentally backs it into the cannon preventing it from being fired.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rufus on the cruiser has been working with Cletus, (whom he mistakes for one of the other Rufus clones). He makes the discovery that Goal was saved after the lethal injection incident. She's thrown from the cruiser and Rufus follows her on Opperbot. At the headquarters, Rufus is mourning the death of the other Rufus. Seagull prepares to kill Rufus when the Rufus riding Opperbot crashes into him killing them both. The last remaining Rufus reunites with Goal and apologizes to her and everyone for having doomed them all. However, Goal convinces everyone to give Rufus another chance pointing out it's thanks to him Deponia has not yet been destroyed. The resistance looks to Rufus for one last crazy idea. Rufus decides they will all cram into the vehicle inside the cannon and fire it at the cruiser.\n\nThe plan succeeds although Rufus is seen as Argus and taken to Ulysses, the leader of the Organon. Rufus is surprised when it turns out Ulysses is the father of Goal. Ulysses still has the intention to blow up Deponia which will also destroy the Organon cruiser. Ulysses thinks his daughter is in Elysium. Rufus can prove the opposite is true. However, the irreversible process for the detonation already started.\n\nRufus convinces Argus and Cletus to cooperate in order to destroy the bomb. This succeeds, but the three get stuck in the rotor which balances the cruiser. They are found by Goal who can only rescue one of them. She decides only to rescue Rufus but as the three wear the same outfit she does not know who Rufus actually is.\n\nUltimately, Rufus tells Goal that Cletus is actually Rufus and lets go to fall back to Deponia. Goal saves Cletus while Barry follows Rufus down, congratulating him for his selfless action and for saving everyone.\n\nGoal takes “Rufus” to the council of Elysium. The council is concerned: due to the new situation Elysium is overpopulated and there are not enough resources. That's why they have the intention to destroy Elysium and move back to Deponia. Goal tells the council to listen to the advice of \"Rufus\". Cletus decides to give up his old identity and to live as Rufus as from now. Goal then leaves the scene and goes to a perch overlooking Deponia. She sighs hinting that she knew she picked Cletus over Rufus. It is not revealed whether the real Rufus survived the fall or not.\n\nGerman publication \"Golem.de\" declared \"Goodbye Deponia\" a commercial hit. The game debuted in first place on the GfK Entertainment Charts' weekly computer game sales rankings, and sold 10,000 units in its first seven days across Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Half of these sales came from online stores such as Steam. Carsten Fichtelmann of Daedalic Entertainment noted that these numbers were \"a record for us\", and that they marked the first time in 15 years that an adventure game had reached first place on the German market's weekly sales charts. However, he criticized brick and mortar retailers for understocking the game and \"driv[ing] customers to digital purchases, or to mail-order companies like Amazon\". According to Daedalic, \"Goodbye Deponia\" also achieved strong international sales in its opening week.\n\n\"Goodbye Deponia\" was well received by critics. As of October 2015, it holds an 80/100 Metacritic score from 34 reviews, and a 74.24% ranking at GameRankings from 16 reviews. Adventure Gamers writes as its verdict about \"Goodbye Deponia\": \"The \"Deponia\" trilogy turns out to be very good at goodbyes. If you enjoy LucasArts-style comedic games, this series – and especially the final game – will provide hours of tongue-in-cheek unconventionality.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "330773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330773", "title": "J. Stuart Blackton", "text": "J. Stuart Blackton\n\nJames Stuart Blackton (January 5, 1875 – August 13, 1941) was a British-American film producer and director of the silent era. One of the pioneers of motion pictures, he founded Vitagraph Studios in 1897. He was one of the first filmmakers to use the techniques of stop-motion and drawn animation, is considered a father of American animation, and was the first to bring many classic plays and books to the screen. Blackton was also the commodore of the Motorboat Club of America and the Atlantic Yacht Club.\n\nJames Stuart Blackton was born on January 5, 1875, in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to Henry Blacktin and Jessie Stuart. He emigrated with his family to the United States in 1885 and changed the family name to Blackton.\n\nHe worked as a reporter and illustrator for the \"New York Evening World\", and performed regularly on stage with conjuror Albert Smith. In 1896, Thomas Edison publicly demonstrated the Vitascope, one of the first film projectors, and Blackton was sent to interview Edison and provide drawings of how his films were made. Eager for good publicity, Edison took Blackton to his Black Maria, the special cabin he used to do his filming, and created a film on the spot of Blackton doing a lightning portrait of Edison. The inventor did such a good job selling the art of moviemaking that he talked Blackton and partner Smith into buying a print of the new film, as well as prints of nine other films, plus a Vitascope to show them to paying audiences.\nThe new act was a great success, despite the various things Blackton and Smith were doing between the Edison films. The next step was to start making films of their own. In this way the American Vitagraph Company was born.\n\nDuring this period, J. Stuart Blackton ran the Vitagraph studio, and produced, directed, and wrote its films. He even starred in some of his films, playing the comic strip character \"Happy Hooligan\" in a series of shorts. Since profits were constantly increasing, Blackton felt that he could try any idea that sprang to his head, and in a series of films Blackton developed the concepts of animation.\n\nThe first of his animation films is \"The Enchanted Drawing\", with a copyright date of 1900 but probably made at least a year earlier. In this film, Blackton sketches a face, a bottle of wine and a glass, a top hat, and a cigar. During the film he appears to remove the wine, glass, hat, and cigar as real objects, and the face appears to react. The \"animation\" here is of the stop-action variety, where the camera is stopped, a single change is made, and the camera is then started again. The process was first used by Georges Méliès and others.\n\nThe transition to stop-motion was apparently accidental, and occurred around 1905. According to Albert Smith, one day the crew was filming a complex series of stop-action effects on the roof while steam from the building's generator was billowing in the background. On playing the film back, Smith noticed the odd effect created by the steam puffs scooting across the screen and decided to reproduce it deliberately. A few films (some of which are lost) use this effect to represent invisible ghosts, or to have toys come to life. In 1906, Blackton directed \"Humorous Phases of Funny Faces\", which uses stop-motion as well as stick puppetry to produce a series of effects. After Blackton's hand draws two faces on a chalkboard, they appear to come to life and engage in antics. Most of the film uses live action effects instead of animation, but nevertheless this film had a huge effect in stimulating the creation of animated films in America. In Europe, the same effect was had from \"The Haunted Hotel\" (1907), another Vitagraph short directed by Blackton. \"The Haunted Hotel\" was mostly live-action, about a tourist spending the night in an inn run by invisible spirits. Most of the effects are also live-action (wires and such), but one scene of a dinner making itself was done using stop-motion, and was presented in a tight close-up that allowed budding animators to study it for technique.\n\nBlackton made another animated film that has survived, 1907's \"Lightning Sketches\", but it has nothing to add to the art of animation. In 1908 he made the first American film version of \"Romeo and Juliet\", filmed in New York City's Central Park and \"The Thieving Hand\", filmed in Flatbush, Brooklyn. By 1909, Blackton was too absorbed in the business of running Vitagraph to have time for filmmaking. He came to regard his animation experiments in particular as being rather juvenile (they receive no mention in his unpublished autobiography).\n\nStuart Blackton believed that the US should join the Allies involved in World War I overseas and in 1915 produced \"The Battle Cry of Peace\". Former President Theodore Roosevelt was one of the film's staunchest supporters and convinced Gen. Leonard Wood to loan Blackton an entire regiment of marines to use as extras. Upon its release, the film generated a controversy rivaling that of \"Birth of a Nation\" because it was considered as militaristic propaganda.\n\nBlackton left Vitagraph to go independent in 1917, but returned in 1923 as junior partner to Albert Smith. In 1925, Smith sold the company to Warner Brothers for more than $1 million.\n\nBlackton did quite well with his share until the Stock Market Crash of 1929, which destroyed his savings and made him bankrupt in 1931. He spent his last years on the road, showing his old films and lecturing about the days of silent movies. His daughter Violet Virginia Blackton (1910–1965) married writer Cornell Woolrich in 1930 but their marriage was annulled in 1933.\n\nHe married actress Evangeline Russell de Rippeteau in 1936.\n\nBlackton died August 13, 1941, a few days after he suffered a fractured skull after being hit by a car while crossing the street with his son. At the time of his death he was working for Hal Roach on experiments to improve color process backgrounds. Blackton was cremated and interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "572647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=572647", "title": "Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals", "text": "Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals\n\nLufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals, known as in Japan, and as Lufia in Europe and Australia, is a role-playing video game with puzzle elements developed by Neverland and published in Japan in 1995 by Taito, and in North America and Europe in 1996 by Natsume and Nintendo respectively, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nThe game is a prequel to \"Lufia & the Fortress of Doom\". It follows the story of the first main character's ancestor, Maxim, and explains the origins of the war between mankind and a group of gods called the Sinistrals. \"Lufia II\" made a number of changes from the first game. Dungeons no longer have random encounters and there are hundreds of puzzles throughout the game, ranging from simple to extremely challenging. It also introduced new skills, such as a variety of weapons that could be used to stun monsters or solve puzzles, and IP attacks. In 2010, Square Enix released a re-imagining of the original game titled \"\".\n\nIn \"Lufia II\", characters walk around an over world map, enter dungeons, fight monsters, buy or find new equipment and spells, and set out on a quest to save the world. The player's party supports up to four characters at once, along with a Capsule Monster. There are various forms of transportation which the player may utilize in order to travel faster than walking, these include; warping, a spell learned early in the game; a boat, modified by Lexis into a submarine and later a blimp. Various casino games are accessible later in the game; these include Pachinco Slot, Black Jack, Slot Machine, Stud Poker, and Action Bingo.\n\nIn dungeons, monsters appear on the map, and can be avoided if the player wishes. Motion in dungeons is also turn-based, and monsters do not move unless the player does. Maxim gains a number of tools and weapons for use in dungeons (similar to \"The Legend of Zelda\" titles), such as a bow and arrow, bombs and a hookshot; these, along with his sword, will stun monsters temporarily and interact with obstacles. Finally, dungeons place great emphasis on puzzles. On the world map, monsters are encountered randomly.\n\nAside from the RPG standards of \"Fight,\" \"Use Item\" and \"Use Magic,\" characters also have access to IP Skills, which are attached to weapons, armor and accessories. Each character's IP bar fills when he or she takes damage, and is depleted when an available IP skill is invoked. IP Skills take varying amounts of charge to activate. Players can freely wear and customize their characters with different varying sets of these weapons and armor for different IP skill effects and apply them while utilizing tactics during battles. Also, IP Skills themselves cannot be customized, sometimes forcing the player to choose between a newer and stronger piece of gear, or an older, weaker one that has a useful IP Skill.\n\nCapsule monsters are special creatures which the player may only find on specific locations of the world. Once a Capsule monster is found, the party acquires a fifth, computer controlled member. These monsters can be fed items and equipment, and once they are satiated they evolve to a different form, up to a fifth and definitive form, labeled M. Seven of them exist, and each Capsule monster belongs to a different element (Neutral, Light, Wind, Water, Dark, Fire and Soil), and has a different set of skills.\n\nThe Ancient Cave, a randomly generated dungeon composed of 99 floors, is presented to the player as a side-quest in the town of Gruberik. Every time the player enters the cave, a new layout is generated, similar to the roguelike genre. Within the cave, the characters are downgraded to zero experience points and stripped of nearly all equipment and items. The player must proceed through the cave's floors, collecting equipment, finding magic spells and increasing levels, with the objective of reaching the Ancient Cave's final floor. There are three ways of exiting the cave: by dying, by reaching its bottom or by finding and using an item exclusive to the cave, named \"providence\". Within the cave lie two kinds of chests, blue and red. Red chests contain items which can only be used inside the cave for the duration of the playing session. As soon as the player leaves the cave, all items from red chests disappear, except for \"Iris Treasures,\" which cannot be equipped and serve only as collectibles. The rare blue chests contains items which can be used outside the cave and brought back to the cave on subsequent journeys. Some items that can be found in blue chests can also be found by other means, such as monster drops. These can also be taken in and out of the Ancient Cave just as if they were found in blue chests. The bottom floor of the inn in Gruberik serves as a storage for these items.\n\nThe game is a prequel, set ninety-nine years before \"Lufia & the Fortress of Doom\", which tells the story of how the Sinistrals first appeared in the world and the battles fought against them. The story is centered around the hero Maxim, a swordsman from the town of Elcid who is born with a natural ability to fight and is destined to destroy the Sinistrals. Throughout his journey, he meets other warriors who are able to confront the Sinistrals as well.\n\nThe game's protagonist is Maxim, a talented swordsman from the town of Elcid. Little about his past is mentioned in the game, but the game begins to follow him when a mysterious woman named Iris tells him that he is to go on a journey.\n\nThroughout the game, Maxim is joined by other talented warriors or 'Heroes of Legend' such as Tia, his childhood friend, who has a romantic interest in Maxim; Guy, a wandering warrior who joins Maxim after he rescued his sister; Dekar, the powerful bodyguard of Prince Alex of Bound Kingdom; Lexis, a brilliant inventor; Artea, an elven bowman; and Selan, commander of the Parcelyte army who becomes Maxim's wife in mid-story.\n\nThe game's antagonists are the Sinistrals, a group of four godlike beings bent on world domination. They are led by Daos, the Sinistral of Terror, who seeks an ultimate weapon to use against the people of the world. His three subordinates are Gades, the Sinistral of Destruction, who is credited with the destruction of two entire cities; Amon, the Sinistral of Chaos, who is known to be a brilliant tactician; and Erim, the Sinistral of Death.\n\nThe North American release of the game has a few graphical and textual glitches which were corrected in the European version. The European versions were released in English, German, Spanish and Dutch for distribution in Australia, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands respectively. The Australian version was released in 1997, one year after the North American version. Both the European and Australian releases of the game were titled \"Lufia\", not \"Lufia 2\", and included no subtitles because \"Lufia & the Fortress of Doom\" was never released in Europe and Australia.\n\nThe game has an aggregate review score of 80% on GameRankings. On release, \"Famitsu\" gave the game a score of 30 out of 40, while it received a perfect score of 10 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. Scary Larry of \"GamePro\" praised the game's heavy puzzle element, but criticized that the battles are easy, the graphics are subpar, and the music and sound effects are boringly generic. He concluded that the game is unexceptional, and in particular pales against the recently released \"Super Mario RPG\", but makes a decent holdover for gamers waiting for the next great RPG.\n\nAn action-RPG remake of \"Lufia II\" for the Nintendo DS was developed by Neverland, with much of the staff of \"Lufia II\" involved in the project, and released in 2010. As in the original game, it features dungeons that focus heavily on puzzle-solving, but unlike the original, the gameplay is now oriented towards action, with the player controlling Maxim directly in battle and switching between characters by tapping his or her portrait on the bottom screen. The story also differs heavily in many points and received several additions.\n\n"}

It is accomplished by striking a note on one of the bars of the instrument while the pedal is depressed and then using the head of the same or another mallet to stop the vibrations of the bar without raising the pedal.\n\nThere are many benefits of being proficient in this technique as a vibraphonist. As it allows a player to hold out one chord and add or subtract any individual pitch desired, a vibist can transition between chords much more smoothly than a pianist who cannot stop a string from vibrating without reaching inside the instrument when the pedal is down.

As the gambler's wealth and available time jointly approach infinity, his probability of eventually flipping heads approaches 1, which makes the martingale betting strategy seem like a sure thing. However, the exponential growth of the bets eventually bankrupts its users due to finite bankrolls. Stopped Brownian motion, which is a martingale process, can be used to model the trajectory of such games.\n\nThe concept of martingale in probability theory was introduced by Paul Lévy in 1934, though he did not name it. The term \"martingale\" was introduced later by , who also extended the definition to continuous martingales. Much of the original development of the theory was done by Joseph Leo Doob among others. Part of the motivation for that work was to show the impossibility of successful betting strategies.\n\nA basic definition of a discrete-time martingale is a discrete-time stochastic process (i.e., a sequence of random variables) \"X\", \"X\", \"X\", ... that satisfies for any time \"n\",\n\nThat is, the conditional expected value of the next observation, given all the past observations, is equal to the most recent observation.\n\nMore generally, a sequence \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\" ... is said to be a martingale with respect to another sequence \"X\", \"X\", \"X\" ... if for all \"n\"\n\nSimilarly, a continuous-time martingale with respect to the stochastic process \"X\" is a stochastic process \"Y\" such that for all \"t\"\n\nThis expresses the property that the conditional expectation of an observation at time \"t\", given all the observations up to time formula_7, is equal to the observation at time \"s\" (of course, provided that \"s\" ≤ \"t\"). Note that the second property implies that formula_8 is measurable with respect to formula_9.\n\nIn full generality, a stochastic process formula_10 is a martingale with respect to a filtration formula_11 and probability measure P if\n\nIt is important to note that the property of being a martingale involves both the filtration \"and\" the probability measure (with respect to which the expectations are taken). It is possible that \"Y\" could be a martingale with respect to one measure but not another one; the Girsanov theorem offers a way to find a measure with respect to which an Itō process is a martingale.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two popular generalizations of a martingale that also include cases when the current observation \"X\" is not necessarily equal to the future conditional expectation \"E\"[\"X\"|\"X\"...,\"X\"] but instead an upper or lower bound on the conditional expectation. These definitions reflect a relationship between martingale theory and potential theory, which is the study of harmonic functions. Just as a continuous-time martingale satisfies \"E\"[\"X\"|{\"X\" : τ≤s}] − \"X\" = 0 ∀\"s\" ≤ \"t\", a harmonic function \"f\" satisfies the partial differential equation Δ\"f\" = 0 where Δ is the Laplacian operator. Given a Brownian motion process \"W\" and a harmonic function \"f\", the resulting process \"f\"(\"W\") is also a martingale.\n\n\nA stopping time with respect to a sequence of random variables \"X\", \"X\", \"X\", ... is a random variable τ with the property that for each \"t\", the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = \"t\" depends only on the values of \"X\", \"X\", \"X\", ..., \"X\". The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time \"t\", you can look at the sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop. An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the gambling table, which might be a function of his previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can't choose to go or stay based on the outcome of games that haven't been played yet.\n\nIn some contexts the concept of \"stopping time\" is defined by requiring only that the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = \"t\" is probabilistically independent of \"X\", \"X\", ... but not that it is completely determined by the history of the process up to time \"t\". That is a weaker condition than the one appearing in the paragraph above, but is strong enough to serve in some of the proofs in which stopping times are used.\n\nOne of the basic properties of martingales is that, if formula_25 is a (sub-/super-) martingale and formula_26 is a stopping time, then the corresponding stopped process formula_27 defined by formula_28 is also a (sub-/super-) martingale.\n\nThe concept of a stopped martingale leads to a series of important theorems, including, for example, the optional stopping theorem which states that, under certain conditions, the expected value of a martingale at a stopping time is equal to its initial value.\n\n"}

The community focuses on celebrity gossip and pop culture with most of its posts aggregated from other gossip blogs. The site formed a partnership with pop culture blog network Buzz Media in July 2010 that was not renewed a year later.\n\nThe blog boasts over 300,000 page views daily according to Popmatters, although it has considerably decreased in recent years. When LiveJournal increased the comment limit on posts from 5000 to 10,000 comments, ONTD contained the first post to reach this new limit.\n\nThe community was originally created in 2004 by teenagers Erin Lang, Bri Draffen and Breniecia Reuben. Lang maintains that after her mother died in 2009 she was denied access to the site and lost control to the current moderators Brenden Delzer and Elizabeth Carter.\n\nThe community publishes an average of 100 member posts per day, with most posts getting between 100 and 500 comments on average. The community moderators post a weekly post called \"Free for All Friday\" (or \"FFAF\") which allows members to post off-topic comments. These free-for-all posts have often been expanded to include community discussion posts for important pop culture events such as the Academy Awards, the Olympics (known as \"Free for All Olympics\" or \"FFAO\" posts) and \"Saturday Night Live\" viewing posts.\n\nIn addition to members submitting the posts themselves, ONTD relies heavily on user participation in the comments section, where members can express their opinions on posts. Members often illustrate their reaction to a particular news item by posting an animated GIF image which represents their feelings. After the death of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009, according to MSNBC, \"users expressed their collective grief by posting a Fantasia Barrino GIF, in which the \"American Idol\" star wails and flails her arms wildly,\" while other users expressed concern over the continued use of a popular GIF taken from the music video \"Thriller\" featuring a scene of Jackson eating popcorn, an image that is frequently posted on the community in anticipation of a controversial or \"flame-worthy topic.\"\n\nOh No They Didn't's popularity has resulted in a series of spin-off communities which follow the same format, but with a different or specialized topic, such as ontd_political for politics. A comprehensive list of other communities is available here.\n\nONTD won the Best Gossip Blog award in the 2008 Weblog Awards, beating out other popular celebrity blogs such as D-Listed, Perez Hilton and TMZ, with a whopping 44% of the vote.\n\nONTD has been noted in \"O, the Oprah Magazine\", cited in \"Life & Style\", and artist Lily Allen referenced the online community in the March 2009 issue of \"Playboy Magazine\".\n\nThe Swedish newspaper \"Metro\" described the community as \"Gossip on steroids.\" The paper also noted that with a high volume of posts, the reader would \"find a lot of highlights, and often before newspapers get their hands on it\". The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote that the \"scandal-mongering community overflows with interactive snark\" and encouraged the reader to \"imagine a gossip clearinghouse run by teenagers with bad attitudes and sharp tongues\". \"The A.V. Club\" cited ONTD as a \"favorite time-wasting website\" and wrote that \"the comments section can sometimes be more amusing than the posts themselves\". In December 2009, the users of ONTD were derisively referred to as \"jackals\" because the stories posted on the blog are taken from other sources. In response, the users embraced the term and repeatedly used the term in later posts, as well as manipulating their icons to include photographs of the animals.\n\nThe Village Voice called the community a \"psychopathic celebrity news/gossip wire-of-sorts\" and its users \"a community of pathologically obsessive celebrity gossip sadomasochists.\"\n\nMembers of the community often use acronyms such as TY (\"thank you\"), BB (\"baby\") and IAWTC (\"I agree with this comment\"). The devoted followers of celebrities – such as Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga – are nicknamed \"stans\" after the Eminem song \"Stan\". In FFAF (free for all Friday) posts, members are encouraged by moderators to ask any questions or to voice any comments or concerns about the site, as well as posting off-topic comments freely.\n\nONTD was the first community to break the news of Jamie Lynn Spears' pregnancy, after leaking \"OK! Magazine\"'s unpublished front page cover, and was the first to report that Kirk Acevedo had announced via his Facebook status update that he had been fired from the Fox drama, \"Fringe\".\n\nWhen the rumors of Jon from Jon and Kate Gosselin's infidelity started appearing in February 2009, a photo of Jon out on town was posted on ONTD, which showed him posing with two young women in a local bar. National gossip magazines picked up the news, and a screen grab of ONTD could be seen in \"Star\" and \"US Weekly\".\n\nThe most scandalous and notable events are often given nicknames to distinguish them in future posts, such as the January 2008 hospitalization of Britney Spears, which was dubbed \"Hostage Brituation '08\" by the community's members. This nickname was later picked up and used by \"Rolling Stone\". The abuse case between singers Rihanna and Chris Brown was dubbed \"Domestic Disturbia '09\" by the community's members, and the community was also credited with starting a meme (\"Gokey is a douche\") connected to some friends of \"American Idol\" contestant Danny Gokey's negative comments and pictures regarding fellow contestant Adam Lambert. The forced removal of \"#gokeyisadouche\" from Twitter's trending topics list prompted a discussion on Twitter's censorship.\n\nThe community was also responsible for a hoax that claimed actress Betty White had died. After a post titled \"Renner, Just Happy to Be Here\" was approved to the community, the original poster edited the post to show a screen grab of a TMZ article claiming White had died. Users displayed shock and confusion, before slowly realizing the article was a fake when not only did the source link just go to TMZ's main website, but the article mentioned \"possibilities of foul play and drug abuse, and grandchildren that Betty White does not have.\" Community moderators deleted the post within 40 minutes, but not before \"Betty White\" became a Twitter trending topic. Once the hoax was discovered, fans urged each other to tweet #BettyWhiteFacts and other positive messages about White instead of spreading further death rumours.\n\nAnother notable hoax involved a fake Twitter screenshot of Michael Lohan saying his daughter Lindsay Lohan had an affair with Tommy Mottola when she was 17, and that she had HIV. Though the post was quickly deleted, Perez Hilton reported on the screenshot as if it were true and other gossip sites followed. Michael believed that the screenshot was real and that someone had hacked his Twitter account, while Lindsay refused to believe her father was innocent, stating \"He's a grown man and has done the exact same things on TV/interviews, why wouldn't he lie on Twitter, and everywhere else!\" The moderators of ONTD later apologized for the scandal, while stating that they were \"pretty appalled to learn that NONE of the other gossip or news sites that posted the story bothered to check for accuracy and have yet to post a retraction or apology for spreading such a vicious rumor.\" \n\nIn January 2009, ONTD became the first LiveJournal community to surpass 16,777,216 (2) comments. This exceeded LiveJournal's previously unknown limit on comments. This resulted in almost a week of downtime for the community, while LiveJournal worked to fix the issue. A second community, ontd, was created and members posted and commented there until the issue was fixed.\n\nOh No They Didn't was briefly suspended due to an explosion in usage following the death of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009. The amount of traffic the community received brought all of LiveJournal's servers down, resulting in downtime for the entire domain. During this time, members migrated temporarily to ontd once again.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, Oh No They Didn't blacked out for 12 hours, in protest of SOPA. The decision was left up to the users, who voted in support of the site's blackout.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3420992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3420992", "title": "Psychological thriller", "text": "Psychological thriller\n\nPsychological thriller is a thriller narrative which emphasizes the unstable or delusional psychological states of its characters. In terms of context and convention, it is a subgenre of the broader ranging thriller narrative structure, with similarities to Gothic and detective fiction in the sense of sometimes having a \"dissolving sense of reality\". It is often told through the viewpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted mental perceptions and focusing on the complex and often tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters. Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of mystery, drama, action, and paranoia. Not to be confused with psychological horror, which involves more terror than psychosomatic themes.\n\nPeter Hutchings states varied films have been labeled psychological thrillers, but it usually refers to \"narratives with domesticated settings in which action is suppressed and where thrills are provided instead via investigations of the psychologies of the principal characters.\" A distinguishing characteristic of a psychological thriller is it emphasizes the mental states of its characters: their perceptions, thoughts, distortions, and general struggle to grasp reality.\n\nAccording to director John Madden, psychological thrillers focus on story, character development, choice, and moral conflict; fear and anxiety drive the psychological tension in unpredictable ways. Madden stated their lack of spectacle and strong emphasis on character led to their decline in Hollywood popularity. Psychological thrillers are suspenseful by exploiting uncertainty over characters' motives, honesty, and how they see the world. Films can also cause discomfort in audiences by privileging them with information they wish to share with the characters; guilty characters may suffer similar distress by virtue of their knowledge.\n\nHowever, James N. Frey defines psychological thrillers as a style, rather than a subgenre; Frey states good thrillers focus on the psychology of their antagonists and build suspense slowly through ambiguity. Creators and/or film distributors or publishers who seek to distance themselves from the negative connotations of horror often categorize their work as a psychological thriller. The same situation can occur when critics label a work to be a psychological thriller in order to elevate its perceived literary value.\n\n\nMany psychological thrillers have emerged over the past years, all in various media (film, literature, radio, etc.). Despite these very different forms of representation, general trends have appeared throughout the narratives. Some of these consistent themes include:\n\n\nIn psychological thrillers, characters often have to battle an inner struggle. Amnesia is a common plot device used to explore these questions. Character may be threatened with death, be forced to deal with the deaths of others, or fake their own deaths. Psychological thrillers can be complex, and reviewers may recommend a second or third viewing to \"decipher its secrets.\" Common elements may include stock characters, such as a hardboiled detective and serial killer, involved in a cat and mouse game. Sensation novels, examples of early psychological thrillers, were considered to be socially irresponsible due to their themes of sex and violence. These novels, among others, were inspired by the exploits of real-life detective Jack Whicher. Water, especially floods, is frequently used to represent the unconscious mind, such as in \"What Lies Beneath\" and \"In Dreams\". Psychological thrillers may not always be concerned with plausibility. Peter Hutchings defines the giallo, an Italian subgenre of psychological thrillers, as violent murder mysteries that focus on style and spectacle over rationality. According to Peter B. Flint of \"The New York Times\", detractors of Alfred Hitchcock accused him of \"relying on slick tricks, illogical story lines and wild coincidences\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26226", "title": "Rhyme", "text": "Rhyme\n\nA rhyme is a repetition of similar sounds (usually, the exact same sound) in the final stressed syllables (and any following syllables) of two or more words. Most often, this kind of \"perfect\" rhyming is consciously used for effect in the final positions of lines of poems and songs. Less strictly speaking, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word \"rhyme\" has come to be sometimes used as a shorthand term for any brief poem, such as a rhyming couplet or nursery rhyme.\n\nThe word derives from Old French \"rime\" or \"ryme\", which may be derived from Old Frankish \"*rīm\", a Germanic term meaning \"series, sequence\" attested in Old English (Old English \"rīm\" meaning \"enumeration, series, numeral\") and Old High German \"rīm\", ultimately cognate to Old Irish \"rím\", Greek ' \"arithmos\" \"number\". Alternatively, the Old French words may derive from Latin \"rhythmus\", from Greek ' (\"rhythmos\", rhythm).\n\nThe spelling \"rhyme\" (from original \"rime\") was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period from a learned (but perhaps etymologically incorrect) association with Latin \"rhythmus\". The older spelling \"rime\" survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling; cf. \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of linguistics and phonology for which \"rime/rhyme\" is used to refer to the nucleus and coda of a syllable. Some prefer to spell it \"rime\" to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see syllable rime).\n\nRhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. It also serves as a powerful mnemonic device, facilitating memorization. The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example William Shakespeare often used a rhyming couplet to mark off the end of a scene in a play.\n\nThe word \"rhyme\" can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a perfect rhyme. Examples are \"sight\" and \"flight\", \"deign\" and \"gain\", \"madness\" and \"sadness\".\n\nPerfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme, which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable.\n\n\nIn the general sense, \"general rhyme\" can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:\n\n\nIdentical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry; but are valued more highly in other literatures such as, for example, \"rime riche\" in French poetry.\n\nThough homophones and homonyms satisfy the first condition for rhyming—that is, that the stressed vowel sound is the same—they do not satisfy the second: that the preceding consonant be different. As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.\n\nIf the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all. An example of such a \"super-rhyme\" or \"more than perfect rhyme\" is the \"identical rhyme\", in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in \"gun\" and \"begun\". Punning rhymes, such as \"bare\" and \"bear\" are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, it is called a \"holorhyme\" (\"For I scream/For ice cream\").\n\nIn poetics these would be considered \"identity\", rather than rhyme.\n\nEye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently. Examples in English are \"cough\", \"bough\", and \"love\", \"move\".\n\nSome early written poetry appears to contain these, but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost.\n\nMind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to rhyming slang, but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, “this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour,” a mind rhyme has occurred.\n\nRhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse:\n\nA rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem.\n\nIn many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes.\n\nThe earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese Shi Jing (ca. 10th century BC). Rhyme is also occasionally used in the Bible. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not usually rhyme, but rhyme was used very occasionally. For instance, Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem \"Cui dono lepidum novum libellum\". The ancient Greeks knew rhyme, and rhymes in \"The Wasps\" by Aristophanes are noted by a translator.\n\nAccording to some archaic sources, Irish literature introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, but that is a disputed claim. In the 7th century, the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. Also in the 7th century, rhyme was used in the Qur'an. The leonine verse is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century.\n\nRhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas.\n\nSince languages change over time, lines that rhymed in the past may no longer rhyme in today's language, and it may not be clear how one would pronounce the words so that they rhyme:\nAlthough historically valid, \"Should we really sing 'harmonious jine'?\"\n\nRhyming in the Celtic Languages takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Brian Ó Cuív sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period: the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme. Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme: they need not be identical, but must belong to the same class. Thus 'b' and 'd' can rhyme (both being 'voiced plosives'), as can 'bh' and 'l' (which are both 'voiced continuants') but 'l', a 'voiced continuant', cannot rhyme with 'ph', a 'voiceless continuant'. Furthermore, \"for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one.\" In the post-Classical period, these rules fell into desuetude, and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices, as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song \"Bríd Óg Ní Mháille\":\nHere the vowels are the same, but the consonants, although both palatalized, do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme.\n\nBesides the vowel/consonant aspect of rhyming, Chinese rhymes often include tone quality (that is, tonal contour) as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme.\n\nUse of rhyme in Classical Chinese poetry typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets, with end-rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet.\n\nAnother important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past varieties of Chinese, such as Middle Chinese.\n\nOld English poetry is mostly alliterative verse. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is The Rhyming Poem.\n\nAs stress is important in English, lexical stress is one of the factors that affects the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme. Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical.\n\nSome words in English, such as \"orange\" and \"silver\", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever writer can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming \"orange\" with combinations of words like \"door hinge\" or with lesser-known words like \"Blorenge\" – a hill in Wales – or the surname Gorringe), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a synonym (\"orange\" could become \"amber\", while \"silver\" could become a combination of \"bright and argent\").\n\nOne view of rhyme in English is from John Milton's preface to \"Paradise Lost\":\nA more tempered view is taken by W. H. Auden in The Dyer's Hand:\nForced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of doggerel.\n\nIn French poetry, unlike in English, it is common to have \"identical rhymes\", in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants (\"consonnes d'appui\") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, \"flour\" and \"flower\", would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones \"doigt\" and \"doit\" or \"point\" (\"point\") and \"point\" (\"not\") is not only acceptable but quite common.\n\nRhymes are sometimes classified into the categories \"rime pauvre\" (\"poor rhyme\"), \"rime suffisante\" (\"sufficient rhyme\"), \"rime riche\" (\"rich rhyme\") and \"rime richissime\" (\"very rich rhyme\"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme \"tu\" with \"vu\" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme \"pas\" with \"bras\" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and \"tante\" with \"attente\" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute \"e\" in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.\n\n\"Holorime\" is an extreme example of \"rime richissime\" spanning an entire verse. Alphonse Allais was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from Marc Monnier:\nClassical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way.\n\nFrench spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced, and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification. They are encountered in almost all of the pre-20th-century French verse texts, but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century.\n\nThe most important \"silent\" letter is the \"mute e\". In spoken French today, final \"e\" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. \"Joue\" could rhyme with \"boue\", but not with \"trou\". Rhyming words ending with this silent \"e\" were said to make up a \"double rhyme\", while words not ending with this silent \"e\" made up a \"single rhyme\". It was a principle of stanza-formation that single and double rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. Virtually all 17th-century French plays in verse alternate single and double alexandrine couplets.\n\nThe now-silent final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were traditionally an integral part of the rhyme, such that \"pont\" rhymed with \"vont\" but not with \"long\"; but spelling and pronunciation did not coincide exactly—\"pont\" also rhymed with \"rond\". There are a few rules that govern most word-final consonants in archaic French pronunciation:\n\nAncient Greek poetry seldom if ever uses rhyme. Modern Greek poetry uses it extensively.\n\nAncient Hebrew rarely employed rhyme, e.g. in Exodus 29 35: ועשית לאהרן ולבניו כָּכה, ככל אשר צויתי אֹתָכה (the identical part in both rhyming words being / 'axa/ ). Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the Jewish liturgical poetry written in the Byzantine empire era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of piyyuts that have been discovered in the Cairo Geniza. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the Syriac Christianity (written in Aramaic), and through this mediation introduced into Latin poetry and then into all other languages of Europe..\n\nIn Latin rhetoric and poetry homeoteleuton and alliteration were frequently used devices.\n\nTail rhyme was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by Cicero:\nBut tail rhyme was not used as a prominent structural feature of Latin poetry until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early Middle Ages. This is the Latin hymn \"Dies Irae\":\nMedieval poetry may mix Latin and vernacular languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed macaronic.\n\nPortuguese classifies rhymes in the following manner:\n\n\nRhyme was introduced into Russian poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Rhyme depends on a vowel and adjacent consonant (which may include the semivowel \"Short I\"). Vowel pairs rhyme - even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced. Early 18th century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.\n\nIn Polish literature rhyme was used from the beginning. Unrhymed verse was never popular, although sometimes it was sometimes imitated form Latin. Homer's, Virgil's and even Milton's epic poems were furnished with rhymes by Polish translators. Because of paroxytonic accentuation in Polish, feminine rhymes always prevailed. Rules of Polish rhyme were established in 16th century. Then only feminine rhymes were allowed in syllabic verse system. Together with introducing syllabo-accentual metres, masculine rhymes began to occur in Polish poetry. They were most popular at the end of 19th century. The most frequent rhyme scheme in Old Polish (16th - 18th centuries) was couplet AABBCCDD..., but Polish poets, having perfect knowledge of Italian language and literature, experimented with other schemes, among others ottava rima (ABABABCC) and sonnet (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD or ABBA ABBA CDCD EE).\nThe metre of Mickiewicz's sonnet is the Polish alexandrine (tridecasyllable, in Polish \"trzynastozgłoskowiec\"): 13(7+6) and its rhymes are feminine: [anu] and [odzi].\n\nRhymes were widely spread in the Arabian peninsula around the 6th century, in letters, poems and songs, as well as long, rhyming qasidas . In addition, the Koran uses a form of rhymed prose named saj'.\n\nPatterns of rich rhyme (\"prāsa\") play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the \"pada\" (metrical foot): \"ādiprāsa\" (first syllable), \"dvitīyākṣara prāsa\" (second syllable), \"antyaprāsa\" (final syllable) etc.\n\nThere are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called \"etukai\" (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line.\n\nThe other rhyme and related patterns are called \"mōnai\" (alliteration), \"toṭai\" (epiphora) and \"iraṭṭai kiḷavi\" (parallelism).\n\nSome classical Tamil poetry forms, such as \"veṇpā\", have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar.\n\nRhymes are used in Vietnamese to produce similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:\n\nNghèo như con mèo\n<br>/ŋɛu ɲɯ kɔn mɛu/ \n<br>\"Poor as a cat\"\n<br>\n\nCompare the above Vietnamese example, which is a \"rhyming\" simile, to the English phrase \"(as) poor as a church mouse\", which is only a \"semantic\" simile.\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to BioWare's \"\" and was released for the Xbox on December 6, 2004, for Microsoft Windows on February 8, 2005, and OS X and Linux on July 21, 2015. Like its predecessor, it is set in the \"Star Wars\" universe 4,000 years before the events of the film \"\" and is based on the d20 System developed by Wizards of the Coast. The game uses the Odyssey Engine, which was originally used in \"Knights of the Old Republic\". The plot first started being written before the original \"Knights of the Old Republic\" was released, and development began in October 2003, after BioWare offered Obsidian their \"Star Wars\" license due to being confident in their previous work.\n\n\"Knights of the Old Republic II\" starts five years after the events of the first game and follows the story of The Exile, a Jedi Knight who was exiled from the Jedi Order. During this time, the Jedi Order has been almost completely wiped out by the Sith. The game begins with the protagonist waking up from unconsciousness on an asteroid mining facility. After he or she escapes with the help of their party members, they find the person who exiled them ten years ago, who sends the protagonist on a mission to seek out the remaining Jedi to fight against the Sith.\n\nThe game's critical reception upon its release was generally positive; praise was given to the story, characters, and writing, which were noted to be more grey than the original \"Knights of the Old Republic\". However, the game received criticism for being too similar to its predecessor in terms of graphics and gameplay systems. GameSpy named one of the game's party members, Kreia, the best video game character of 2005, and the game was included in the book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\".\n\n\"Knights of the Old Republic II\" is a role-playing video game played from a third-person view that features pausable real-time combat. Combat and interactions with the environment and non-player characters in \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" are based on the d20 System as in \"\". The game starts with a character creation screen with several choices to make, and there is also an option of letting the game do it automatically. There are 30 new Force powers, which are manifestations of the Force, in \"Knights of the Old Republic II\". Like its predecessor, the game has several minigames, including swoop bike racing and a card game called Pazaak. The interface has been streamlined from the original game and party management has been made easier; for example, the player can switch between two selected weapon sets in the menu. As in the first game, the player can choose to align with either the light side or the dark side. Choosing dialogue options that are respectful and empathetic gives the protagonist light side points, while options that are egotistic and evil result in dark side points.\n\nThe combat of \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" is identical to its predecessor. Several new lightsaber forms were added to the game. Each of them is useful for a different situation. For example, one is best for enemies using blaster weapons, while another would be good for recovering from using Force powers. The player can use a variety of melee and ranged weapons, including swords and firearms. Fighting unarmed is also an option. A new addition to the game is \"prestige classes\", add-ons to the Jedi classes that were established in \"Knights of the Old Republic\". They allow the player character to practice in lightsaber combat or Force powers, depending on player choice.\n\nThe player can travel with up to two party members at a time, which gain experience points at the same rate as the player character. Equipment and perks for party characters can be selected for different statistical effects or abilities. Players can loot corpses and various environmental objects. The protagonist also has the ability to \"influence\" their party members; by doing things that impress them, the player increases their influence with them. Depending on the level of influence, party members may support the player character unconditionally or turn against the protagonist. The player can also exploit high influence by drawing party members to either the light side or the dark side, and some characters can even be trained to use the Force.\n\nThe game takes place five years after the events of \"Knights of the Old Republic\" and 4,000 years before \"\", in a time when the Jedi have been nearly exterminated by the Sith. The player's character, a former Jedi Knight exiled from the Jedi Order, is referred to as \"The Exile\" or \"Jedi Exile\". Throughout the game, the Exile restores their connection to the Force while, with the help of non-playable companions, setting out to stop the Sith. The player makes choices that turn the Exile to either the light side or the dark side of the Force, and they travel to six planets to either help or hinder the Republic's efforts to bring peace and stability to the galaxy.\n\nNew playable locations in \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" include Telos, Onderon and its moon Dxun, Nar Shaddaa, Malachor V, the Peragus Mining Facility, and various starships such as the hijacked Republic cruiser \"Harbinger\", the Sith cruiser \"Ravager\", and Goto's yacht orbiting Nar Shaddaa. Two planets featured in the original game, Korriban and Dantooine, are revisited, both with ravaged buildings and intensified problems. The \"Ebon Hawk\", the main character's ship in the first game, is also the player's transportation in \"Knights of the Old Republic II\".\n\nThe Exile's backstory reveals that the character served under Revan during the Mandalorian Wars and ordered the activation of a devastating weapon in the climactic battle over Malachor V. The deaths that ensued created such a substantial \"wound\" in the Force that the character was forced to sever their connection to the Force to survive, and the Jedi Council ordered the character exiled from the Jedi Order. As the game progresses, the Jedi Exile rebuilds a connection to the Force and creates unusually strong Force Bonds with other characters and places, while unknowingly sapping Force powers.\n\nAmong the characters who join the Jedi Exile are Kreia, who acts as the Exile's mentor; pilot and former Sith assassin Atton Rand; technician and Mandalorian War veteran Bao-Dur and his droid remote; the criminal droid G0-T0; and the Sith apprentice Visas Marr. T3-M4 and Canderous Ordo (now identified as \"Mandalore\"), both featured in the first game, also join the Exile's team. Other characters join the Exile's party under certain conditions. HK-47, who appears in the first game, joins the quest if the Exile collects and uses the parts necessary to reactivate him. Depending on the player's alignment, the Exile will either be joined by the bounty hunter Mira (light side or neutral) or by her rival, a Wookiee bounty hunter known as Hanharr (dark side). Depending on the player's gender, the Exile will either be joined by Mical the Disciple (female) or Brianna the Handmaiden (male).\n\nThe game features three main antagonists: Darth Traya, a mysterious assailant who remains in the dark through most of the game; , an undead Sith Lord with a murderous hatred for Jedi; and , a Sith Lord whose physical being was destroyed due to his immense affinity to the Force.\n\nWhile hiding on the \"Harbinger\", a Republic cruiser, the Exile is sedated by HK-50, an assassin droid, to be delivered to a crime syndicate called the Exchange, who have put out a bounty on live Jedi. The Exile is rescued by Kreia, with whom the Exile forms a Force Bond with, and the droid T3-M4 on the \"Ebon Hawk\", and the three flee the \"Harbinger\" as it is hijacked by a squad of Sith assassins. However, their ship is damaged during the escape by the \"Harbinger\"s gunfire, and they eventually arrive at the Peragus Mining Facility. Teaming up with smuggler Atton Rand, the group escapes to the planet Telos IV. While hiding out on Telos, they encounter Atris, a surviving member of the Jedi Council who sentenced the protagonist to exile ten years prior. After settling a dispute regarding the Exile's past sentence, Atris forms an uneasy alliance with them, instructing them to seek out other surviving Jedi in order to rally against the Sith. The Exile then travels to four worlds to find reclusive Jedi Masters and either beg for their aid or kill them in revenge for being exiled, depending on player choice. As the Exile continues their journey, they are joined by several individuals in their quest.\n\nAfter finding all the Masters, the Exile travels back to Dantooine and learns that the countless deaths at Malachor V resulted in the Exile unconsciously giving up their connection to the Force, which then became the teachings of the new Sith. If the player aided the Jedi Masters, they prepare to strip the Exile of their Force connection permanently, as the Masters fear that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force, but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution. If the player killed the Jedi Masters, Kreia attacks the Exile and leaves. Tracking Kreia to Telos, the Exile fights and defeats a corrupted Atris, from whom it is learned that Kreia plans to strengthen a massive wound in the Force made ten years prior. This wound had been created by the Exile during the Mandalorian Wars, when they activated a superweapon in order to end the battle on the planet Malachor V, causing mass death and destruction. Before following her to Malachor V, where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya, the Exile stops a Sith invasion of Telos, defeating one of Traya's former apprentices, the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. On Malachor V, the Exile is separated from their companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the planet's surface and the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm. On the final floor of the academy, the Exile kills the Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet's core.\n\nThe Exile defeats the Sith Lord, but before Traya dies, she delivers a prophetic vision of the future pertaining to the player's companions and the worlds that were visited over the course of the story. Depending on the Exile's alignment, they either order the destruction of Malachor V, escaping before it is destroyed, and travel into the Unknown Regions in search of Revan (light side), or remain on Malachor V as the new Dark Lord of the Sith (dark side).\n\n\"Knights of the Old Republic II\" was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to BioWare's \"Knights of the Old Republic\", and it uses the same Odyssey Engine as the original game. BioWare suggested that Obsidian should be offered the \"Knights of the Old Republic\" license due to their familiarity with Obsidian's past work and the good relationship between the two developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development schedule for the sequel to be too tight. The game was released in PC and Xbox versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in October 2003. The overview of the game's story was originally drafted before the first \"Knights of the Old Republic\" was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write \"Knights of the Old Republic II\", lead designer Chris Avellone tried to learn as much about the \"Star Wars\" universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first \"Knights of the Old Republic\" and the original \"Star Wars\" films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized one of the things that made \"Knights of the Old Republic\" great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.\n\n\"Knights of the Old Republic II\" uses the same d20 System as the first \"Knights of the Old Republic\" with some changes, and the level cap has also been removed. For the most part, the team didn't want to redo any of the design elements from the first game, as they felt that there was no need to change anything that had already proved successful; instead, they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon them in a way that retained the base style of \"Knights of the Old Republic\". Obsidian put much work into the game's graphics, including the appearances of non-player characters. Other technological improvements include the lighting and weather effects, in addition to increasing the level sizes. \"Knights of the Old Republic II\"s lead artist was Aaron Meyers; he decided which people would join the art team after looking through \"tons of applications, resumes, and demo reels\", and he said that he was pleased with the number of people who wanted to work for Obsidian. Meyers also complained about the short deadline the development team had to deal with. Obsidian's COO, Chris Parker, said that the schedule set for the development team was \"extremely aggressive\", and that the team felt a lot of pressure because they were \"making a sequel to the game of the year for 2003\".\n\nFor the music, the development team felt that symphony orchestra would work best for \"Knights of the Old Republic II\". The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey, who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's theme, Darth Sion's theme and Darth Nihilus's theme (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's theme from \"The Return of the Jedi\"). He also created a theme for the main character, which is heard occasionally when he or she experiences internal conflict. The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle. The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams' main \"Star Wars\" theme that was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.\n\nWhen Obsidian was preparing to present \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" at E3 2004, they tried to fit as much information as they could, saying that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished a few days before the event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.\n\nWhen looking back at \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" in a 2013 interview, Avellone said that because of LucasArts forcing Obsidian to finish the game in a short time frame of 14 to 16 months, the game ended up being in an \"unfinished\" state. However, Avellone said that Obsidian was at fault for this due to not cutting out enough things; he noted that all minigames should have been removed, and also said that there were too many in-engine cutscenes. Obsidian's co-founder, Feargus Urquhart, said that the game was originally going to be released in 2005, but it was later moved up to December 2004 after E3; according to him, Obsidian had to choose between \"get[ting] in trouble or get[ting] it done\". Due to this, several cuts had to be made; one of the most major was the droid planet M4-78, which was entirely removed from the game after the 2004 E3 event when the team realized that they wouldn't be able to fit it into the schedule. M4-78's designer, Kevin Saunders, explained that he moved assets from that planet to Nar Shaddaa's yacht level in order to complete it on time, which was prior also likely to be cut from the game.\n\nThe Xbox version of \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" went gold on November 23, 2004; it was later released on December 6, 2004 in the United States, and the PC version was released on February 8, 2005. In Europe, the game was released simultaneously for both platforms on February 11. The game was later re-released in August 2012 on the digital distribution platform, Steam, and in January 2015 on GOG.com. On July 21, 2015, OS X and Linux versions were released along with new support for Steam Workshop and other Steamworks features, controller input, and modern widescreen resolutions up to 5K. Backward compatibility for the Xbox One was announced in April 2018.\n\nAlong with several official patches, a fan-released unofficial patch by a modding community fixed around 500 remaining bugs, along with restoring most of the content that was cut from the game. There were also methods found by the community for improving compatibility on modern PC operating systems.\n\nAccording to The NPD Group, \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" sold 458,000 copies in North America during the month of December 2004. It entered their chart for the month at number 11, and at number 3 on the Xbox-only chart. After its North American release on Windows, it debuted at number 2 on the PC chart for the month of February. In the United Kingdom, the game debuted at the top of the weekly chart, beating Blizzard Entertainment's much-anticipated online game \"World of Warcraft\", which was released in the same week. Eurogamer reported that in the UK \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" sold much more in its first week than the first game, which the website speculates was helped by the former's simultaneous release on Windows and Xbox in PAL regions, as opposed to the latter's initial Xbox-only release. During 2005 alone, the Xbox version sold more than 60,000 copies in the region.\n\nBy early 2006, \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" had sold almost 1.5 million copies. Its sales in the United States alone reached 1.275 million by 2008.\n\n\"Knights of the Old Republic II\" was met with positive reception upon its release; on Metacritic, it has an aggregate score of 85/100 and 86/100 on the PC and Xbox versions respectively, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the site. IGN said that there is a bulk of pressure involved with developing the sequel to a game from a different developer which won several \"Game of the Year\" awards, and that Obsidian delivered. The review also said that it won't disappoint fans of the original game and that it is mostly similar to it in terms of the model. \"GamePro\" praised both the first and second \"Knights of the Old Republic\" and said that the second game continues the series' tradition of not fixing what is not broken. GameSpot echoed this statement, also saying that both the good things and the shortcomings from the first game are present in \"Knights of the Old Republic II\".\n\nGameSpy compared the game to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" from the original \"Star Wars\" film trilogy in that it is the best of the series in terms of story, and also said that the game has the best story in a video game since \"\". 1UP.com wrote that Obsidian surpassed the original \"Knights of the Old Republic\" in terms of the writing, saying that the plot is more consistent, the dialogue is edgier and the moral choices are more significant; \"Computer Gaming World\" agreed, writing, \"your decision making, as you pursue a light or dark path, is more ambiguous, with more unexpected consequences\". \"Eurogamer\" said that compared to the original game, \"Knights of the Old Republic II\"s plot is \"far more grey\". The review also said that planets are \"better developed and paced\". GameZone wrote that the game is a \"Must Buy\" for people who like well-written characters and story.\n\nThe combat was generally well-received, with some reviewers noting that it is mostly unchanged from the original \"Knights of the Old Republic\". GameSpot compared the combat from the first \"Knights of the Old Republic\" to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first \"Knights of the Old Republic\" to the second, but that this is a good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original \"Knights of the Old Republic\".\n\nGameSpot criticized \"Knights of the Old Republic II\"s graphics, calling them \"lackluster\". GameSpy's reviewer felt that the game's graphics were disappointing, calling them \"a little dated\" and \"half-baked\". The reviewer further criticized the graphics for looking the same as they were in the first game of the series, saying that they could only be considered \"good\" during the release of that game. GameZone said that the game looks exactly the same as the original \"Knights of the Old Republic\" and that it doesn't compare to the majority of mainstream games released at the time. GameSpy called the music in the game \"excellent\"; however, the reviewer noted that some of it is re-used from the first game of the series. The GameSpy reviewer also said that while the majority of the voice-acting is good, there are \"a few more examples of bad voice-acting\" than in the first \"Knights of the Old Republic\". GameZone said that the \"top-notch\" voice acting complements the game's very well-written dialogue, and also praised the game's sound effects.\n\nThe game was criticized for its glitches; several players reported having problems with pathfinding bugs. 1UP.com's reviewer condemned \"Knights of the Old Republic II\" for having the same bugs and technical issues as in the first game, saying that his party \"still had a tendency to warp and skip around the map at times\", and he also criticized the pathfinding in the game. GameSpy said that the game's bugs are \"hard to forgive\", and that these issues didn't occur in the first \"Knights of the Old Republic\". In a different article, GameSpy said that the game is incomplete, and attributed this to its rushed deadline.\n\nGameSpy called Kreia the best video game character of 2005, saying that she was \"easily the most intriguing, complicated, enigmatic, well-designed and nuanced character in a video game this year\". In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\".\n\n"}

It typically features repetition and antithesis. The term originated in the theatre of Ancient Greece, though many dramatists since have used the technique. Etymologically it derives from the Greek \"stikhos\" (\"row, line of verse\") + \"muthos\" (\"speech, talk\").\n\nStichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of dramatic dialogue where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.\n\nStichomythia originated in Greek drama. Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response. J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtly in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.\n\nSenecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca's tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.\n\nRenaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans. Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.\n\nModern theatre rarely uses verse, so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.\n\nIn terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments. While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character's line interrupts the other's.\n\nIn terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.\n\nA short example from R. C. Jebb's translation of \"Antigone\": the scene is an argument between Ismene and her sister Antigone.\nFor further examples from \"Antigone\", consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive .\n\nISMENE: And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? <br>\nANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. <br>\nISMENE: Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? <br>\nANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, 'tis with pain that I mock thee. <br>\nISMENE: Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? <br>\nANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. <br>\nISMENE: Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? <br>\nANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. <br>\nISMENE: At least thy choice was not made without my protest. <br>\nANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.<br>\n\"Richard III\", Act I, scene ii.

Don Diègue (an old man, the hero's father) has been appointed the prince's tutor, a post that the Count (\"le Comte\") wanted.\nLE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.<br>\nDON DIÈGUE: Que l'a gagné sur vous l'avoit mieux merité.<br>\nLE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l'exercer en est bien le plus digne.<br>\nDON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n'est pas un bon signe.<br>\nLE COMTE: Vous l'avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.<br>\nDON DIÈGUE: L'éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.<br>\nLE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.<br>\nDON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.<br>\nLE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n'était dû qu'à mon bras.<br>\nDON DIÈGUE: Qui n'a pu l'obtenir ne le méritoit pas.<br>\nLE COMTE: Ne le méritoit pas! Moi?<br>\nDON DIÈGUE: Vous.<br>\nLE COMTE: Ton impudence,<br>\nTéméraire viellard, aura son récompense. [\"Il lui donne un soufflet\"\n\nIn the scene in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera \"The Marriage of Figaro\", libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte, where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro's mother, she repeats her disbelief (\"Sua madre?\", that is, \"his mother?\") to each character and is reassured in the same words. A critic has called that \"the merriest and most congenial form imaginable\" of stichomythia. For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by Andrea Maffei for Giuseppe Verdi's \"I masnadieri\" has been called \"musical stichomythia\", though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:\nAMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t'ha diviso?<br>\nCARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l'inchiesta crudel!<br>\nAMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.<br>\nCARLO: Beato se chiuso m'avesse l'avel!<br>\nAMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?<br>\nCARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!<br>\nAMALIA: Anch'io, derelitta, ti piansi lung'anni.<br>\nCARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?\n\nExamples from musicals are \"I Remember it Well\" (lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, first version in the Broadway musical \"Love Life\", second in the film \"Gigi\") and \"Anything You Can Do\" (by Irving Berlin, from \"Annie Get Your Gun\"). Another is from \"The Last Supper\" in \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:\nJesus: Why don't you go do it?<br>\nJudas: You want me to do it!<br>\nJesus: Hurry, they're waiting<br>\nJudas: If you knew why I do it...<br>\nJesus: I don't care why you do it<br>\nJudas: To think I admired you,<br>\nfor now I despise you<br>\nJesus: You liar—you Judas<br>\nIn the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a \"witty exchange of one-liners\" and associated with the film noir characters Jeff Bailey in \"Out of the Past\", Sam Spade, and Philip Marlowe. Another film-noir example is in \"Double Indemnity\" (dialog by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.\nDietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren't you?<br>\nNeff: Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea,\nDietrichson: There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.<br>\nNeff: How fast was I going officer?<br>\nDietrichson: I'd say around 90.<br>\nNeff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?<br>\nDietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?<br>\nNeff: Suppose it doesn't take?<br>\nDietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?<br>\nNeff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?<br>\nDietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder?<br>\nNeff: That tears it!<br>\n"}

{"id": "35521162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35521162", "title": "Treatment of bereavement through music therapy", "text": "Treatment of bereavement through music therapy\n\nBereavement, as defined by Webster, is the state of being bereaved or deprived of something or someone. The DSM-IV TR lists bereavement as a mental health diagnosis when the focus of clinical attention is related to the loss of a loved one and when symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder are present for up to two months. A number of treatments for bereavement have been used and evaluated, but music therapy models have been found to be the most successful in treating grief and bereavement (Rosner, Kruse & Hagl, 2010).\n\nMusic therapy practice is working together with clients, through music, to promote healthy change (Bruscia, 1998; Abrams, 2010). The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has defined the practice of music therapy as \"a behavioral science concerned with changing unhealthy behaviors and replacing them with more adaptive ones through the use of musical stimuli\" (Davis, Gfeller & Thaut, 2008).\n\nThe use of music to soothe grief has been used since the time of David and King Saul. In I Samuel, David plays the Lyre in order to make King Saul feel relieved and better. It has since been used all over the world for treatment of various issues, though the first recorded use of official \"music therapy\" was in 1789 - an article titled \"Music Physically Considered\" by an unknown author was found in \"Columbian Magazine\". The creation and expansion of music therapy as a treatment modality thrived in the early to mid 1900's and while a number of organizations were created, none survived for long. It wasn't until 1950 that the National Association for Music Therapy was founded in New York that clinical training and certification requirements were created. In 1971, the American Association for Music Therapy was created, though at that time called the Urban Federation of Music Therapists. The Certification Board for Music Therapists was created in 1983 which strengthened the practice of music therapy and the trust that it was given. In 1998, the American Music Therapy Association was formed out of a merger between National and American Associations and is now the single largest music therapy organization in the world (American music therapy, 1998–2011). More about the history along with general information and application of music therapy can be found on the American Music Therapy Association website.\n\nThough music therapy practice employs a large number of intervention techniques, some of the most commonly used interventions include improvisation, therapeutic singing, therapeutic instrumental music playing, music-facilitated reminiscence and life review, songwriting, music-facilitated relaxation, and lyric analysis. While there has been no conclusive research done on the comparison of interventions (Jones, 2005; Silverman, 2008; Silverman & Marcionetti, 2004), the use of particular interventions is individualized to each client based upon thorough assessment of needs, and the effectiveness of treatment may not rely on the type of intervention (Silverman, 2009).\n\nImprovisation in music therapy allows for clients to make up, or alter, music as they see fit. While improvisation is an intervention in a methodical practice, it does allow for some freedom of expression, which is what it is often used for. Improvisation has several other clinical goals as well, which can also be found on the Improvisation in music therapy page, such as: facilitating verbal and nonverbal communication, self-exploration, creating intimacy, teamwork, developing creativity, and improving cognitive skills (Bruscia, 1998). Building on these goals, R. Keith Botello and Dr. Robert E. Krout (2008) took steps to design a cognitive behavioral application of improvisation to assess and improve communication in couples. Further research is needed before the use of improvisation is conclusively proven to be effective in this application, but there were positive signs in this study of its use.\n\nSinging or playing an instrument is often used to help clients express their thoughts and feelings in a more structured manner than improvisation and can also allow participation with only limited knowledge of music. Singing in a group can facilitate a sense of community and can also be used as group ritual to structure a theme of the group or of treatment (Krout, 2005). In a one-time bereavement support group, songs that were specifically composed by music therapists for this group to meet the goals of the program. The songs were sung by the group which appeared to result in the facilitation and growth of connectedness within the group. While not a substitute for long-term counseling, this one-time support group showed that sing-alongs can be powerful in providing support and connectedness in a group, especially when the songs were composed to incorporate desired themes and context.\n\nThough lyric analysis is often and widely used, research that compares music therapy intervention has been inconclusive up to this point. Dr. Michael Silverman (2009) completed a study on lyric analysis and found it to be the third most used type of intervention. Music Therapists use lyric analysis in a variety of ways, but typically lyric analysis is used to facilitate dialogue with clients based on the lyrics, which can then lead to discussion that addresses the goals of therapy (Freed, 1987). Dr. Silverman also noted that the song that therapists found most effective in lyric analysis was \"Lean on Me\" by Bill Withers. Other popular choices were the songs \"I am a Rock,\" \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"Concrete Angel,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Help,\" and \"Let It Be.\" The choice of song is often based around the material and issues listed in the song, but therapists have stated they also choose songs based on their clients' preferences, and on their own personal tastes in music (Silverman, 2009).\n\nAt the moment, bereavement is listed as its own diagnosis in the DSM-IV TR, but proposed changes in the DSM-V may impact the way bereavement is diagnosed. The DSM-IV TR states the following about bereavement:\n\nIt has become well known in the music therapy field that music can be an effective tool in the treatment of grief and bereavement but Francesca Albergato-Muterspaw (2009) looked at how music actually played a role in the healing from grief. In her study, three primary themes presented themselves from the interviews and observation of the participants. She found firstly that, music has a significant connection with emotion. Music can be used to express oneself, keep a client distracted when there is a need for distraction, and can help clients reflect on themselves and past experiences leading to changes in identity. Secondly, a sense of community, culture, and spirituality was found when music was used in treatment. Employing the ides of community, culture, and spirituality have shown to be vital in the process of dealing with grief so using music to elicit these concepts makes it a powerful tool indeed. Lastly, it was found that music was important to clients as a way to give tribute to the deceased. On top of these areas of note, it was also discussed that the participants had a better understanding of each other - more so than they had simply by talking with each other (Albergato-Muterspaw, 2009). It appears that music allows for context and meta messages to be more easily and successfully communicated between a group, an important point for therapists in any field, and also especially important when working with the bereaved. In 2008, Kathryn Lindenfelser and colleagues looked at the experiences parents of terminally ill children had with music therapy. They found that music therapy was effective in altering perceptions in the midst of adversity, was a strong component of remembrance, provided a multifaceted treatment, and as the other study also mentioned, increased communication and expression in both the adults and children (Lindenfelser Grocke & McFerran, 2008). In a separate study that explored the effects of music therapy on pain in children and families, it was found that music therapy can be used to reduce physical pain and anxiety, enhance relaxation, and promote positive moods and compliance. There was also an inverse relationship found between music therapy and behavioral distress (Whitehead-Pleaux, Baryza & Sheridan, 2007). Since bereavement is diagnosed when elements of depression are found, and since music therapy has shown to be effective in enhancing mood and lowering distress, one could conclude that elements of music therapy could also be effective in the treatment of depression and other adjustment disorders, though further research would need to be done to make that conclusion.\n\nMusic therapy, like many forms of therapy, has the potential to be a highly culturally sensitive one. Empathy in general is an important aspect of any mental health and the same is true for music therapy, as is cultural awareness. It's the added complexity to cultural empathy that comes from adding music that provides both the greater risk and potential to provide exceptional culturally sensitive therapy (Valentino, 2006). An extensive knowledge of a culture is really needed to provide this effective treatment as providing culturally sensitive music therapy goes beyond knowing the language of speech, the country, or even some background about the culture. Simply choosing music that is from the same country of origin or that has the same spoken language is not effective for providing music therapy as, similar to the United States, music genres vary as do the messages each piece of music sends. Also, different cultures view and use music in various ways and may not always be the same as how the therapist views and uses music. There do tend to be misconceptions in the field, however, even in the practitioners of music therapy. It was actually found in one study, that 82% of therapists thought that choosing songs in a client's native language would automatically be appropriate and only 13% of therapists thought that their cross-cultural training was adequate (Valentino, 2006) so it does appear that though music therapy has potential, the field could be better served with some further cross-cultural training. Melody Schwantes and her colleagues wrote an article that describes the effective use of the Mexican \"corrido\" in a bereavement group of Mexican migrant farm workers (Schwantes, Wigram, Lipscomb & Richards, 2011). This support group was dealing with the loss of two of their coworkers after an accident they were in and so the corrido, a song form traditionally used for telling stories of the deceased. An important element that was also mentioned was that songwriting has shown to be a large cultural artifact in many cultures, and that there are many subtle messages and thoughts provided in songs that would otherwise be hard to identify. Lastly, the authors of this study stated that \"Given the position and importance of songs in all cultures, the example in this therapeutic process demonstrates the powerful nature of lyrics and music to contain and express difficult and often unspoken feelings\" (Schwantes \"et al.\", 2011).\n\nIn this day and age, providing evidence-based practice is becoming more and more important and music therapy has been continuously critiqued and regulated in order to provide that desired evidence-based practice. A number of research studies and meta-analyses have been conducted on, or included, music therapy and all have found that music therapy has at least some promising effects, especially when used for the treatment of grief and bereavement. The AMTA has largely supported the advancement of music therapy through research that would promote evidenced-based practice. With the definition of evidence-based health care as \"the conscientious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients or the delivery of health services, current best evidence is up-to-date information from relevant, valid research about the effects of different forms of health care, the potential for harm from exposure to particular agents, the accuracy of diagnostic tests, and the predictive power of prognostic factors\" (Cochrane, 1972).\n\nBoth qualitative and quantitative studies have been completed and both have provided evidence to support music therapy in the use of bereavement treatment. One study that evaluated a number of treatment approaches found that only music therapy had significant positive outcomes where the others showed little improvement in participants (Rosner,Kruse & Hagl, 2010). Furthermore, a pilot study, which consisted of an experimental and control group, examined the effects of music therapy on mood and behaviors in the home and school communities. It was found that there was a significant change in grief symptoms and behaviors with the experimental group in the home, but conversely found that there was no significant change in the experimental group in the school community, despite the fact that mean scores on the Depression Self-Rating Index and the Behavior Rating Index decreased (Hilliard, 2001). Yet another study completed by Russel Hilliard (2007), looked at the effects of Orff-based music therapy and social work groups on childhood grief symptoms and behaviors. Using a control group that consisted of wait-listed clients, and employing the Behavior Rating Index for Children and the bereavement Group Questionnaire for Parents and Guardians as measurement tools, it was found that children who were in the music therapy group showed significant improvement in grief symptoms and also showed some improvement in behaviors compared to the control group, whereas the social work group also showed significant improvement in both grief and behaviors compared to the control group. The study concludes with support for music therapy as a medium from bereavement groups for children (Hilliard, 2007).\n\nThough there has been research done on music therapy, and though the use of it has been evaluated, there remain a number of limitations in these studies and further research should be completed before absolute conclusions are made, though the results of using music therapy in the treatment have consistently shown to be positive.\n\nAlbergato-Muterspaw, Francesca.
