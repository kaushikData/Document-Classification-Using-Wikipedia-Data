The game was released for the PlayStation 3 in Japan on August 19, 2010.\n\nA new dynamic shooting mode called Chase Mode has been added to the game. This mode is similar to arcade shooters wherein the player's machine moves on rails and leaves the targeting weapons for the player to control. Each chase mode section precedes a boss battle; the examples released so far include the battle against the Behemoth from \"Full Metal Panic!\" and the battle against Nora Polyansky from \"Macross Zero\". A new ability called Burst Attack appears in this installment. Burst attack is available to all units, and is a special charge attack that changes depending on what machine is being used.\n\nThis is the first title in the \"A.C.E.\" series that allows to swap pilots between machines (excluding the Shin Getter team in \"\"), though only for Universal Century mecha (those from Zeta Gundam, Crossbone Gundam and Genesis of Aquarion), in which pilot changing is a major plot point and constantly used.\n\nRather than integrating different series into one or two unified universes like previous titles of the series, \"A.C.E.: R\" presents each featured series as independent timelines, with the series' main characters proceeding with their own stories before the events of the game.\n\nThe main events of the game itself revolve around an original timeline again completely independent of all other featured series. In this timeline humanity has expanded beyond the Solar system, with planet Area becoming one of those resulting colonies. But somewhere along the line the Seasons, androids originally built to help the colonists settling on Area, rebelled against their human companions. Leading a robotic army collectively known as the Icon, the Seasons successfully wiped out the humans on planet Area, but there is one last trick up the colonists' sleeves: they made a data copy out of one of the Seasons androids and entrusted it, named Autumn-4, with genetic seeds of themselves as well as a trans-atmospheric battleship Ark Alpha. The intention was for Autumn-4 to take the gene seeds as far away from the Seasons' grip as possible so that the now-deceased colonists can be reborn on a safe world. Soon after commencement of Autumn-4's mission, however, Ark Alpha was intercepted by a fleet of Icon warships led by Winter-1, head of the Seasons. Overwhelmed by the numerically-superior enemies and in desperation, Autumn-4 activated a device within Ark Alpha called V-Drive, which has the ability to create a blackhole-like portal to parallel universes: it worked, with Brunhilde emerging from the portal and repulsing the Icon fleet, but also unintentionally caused characters from other timelines to be transported to planet Area as well. To make the matter worse, the energy discharged by Brunhilde in the process affected Autumn-4's memory circuits and corrupted her record of the event, leaving her unable to explain to all the people who now find themselves stranded in a foreign universe as to what has transpired.\n\nNevertheless, feeling responsible for their plight, Autumn-4 decides to find out what happened and how to return them to their home worlds while enlisting their help in finding a way through the robotic army of the Seasons, who would shoot first and never ask questions much later.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the background music is instrumental, though the game includes a BGM editor that allows for replacing music during gameplay and cutscenes with music from the PlayStation 3's hard drive. Acid Black Cherry will provide the themes for \"A.C.E.: R\". The opening theme is named \"Re:Birth\". There are two separate releases planned for this single. The first includes the title song \"Re:Birth\" and was released on August 18. The second release is planned for October, and includes a game edit version of \"Re:Birth\" as well as three additional songs that Acid Black Cherry created for Another Century's Episode R.\n\nThe game has sold up to 245,301 units and is ranked by \"Famitsu\" sales as #47 in its top 100 charts of 2010.\n"}

In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 that gave free-to-air broadcasters essentially first refusal to certain sporting event broadcasting rights. The anti-siphoning list is a list of events, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the relevant Minister, be available free to the general public. To effect this 'freedom', the \"Broadcasting Services Act 1992\" includes a licence condition on pay TV providers that prohibits them from acquiring anti-siphoning events unless a national broadcaster or a network of commercial television broadcasters have the right to televise the events. This prohibition drops away a certain period before the event starts. The current anti-siphoning rules also prohibit national television broadcasters and commercial television broadcasters from premiering listed events on digital multi-channels. Listed events may be shown on digital multi-channels if they have already been broadcast, or are simultaneously broadcast on the broadcaster's main channel.\nThe anti-siphoning list came into effect in 2006. The relevant Minister has the power to add, amend or remove events from the list. Currently, only sporting events are listed, even though the \"Broadcasting Services Act 1992\" does not limit the types of events that can be listed. There are currently ten sport types (e.g. tennis, soccer, rugby league) on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. Before the end of 2009, the Federal Government conducted a review of the anti-siphoning scheme, with the Minister proposing changes to the scheme.\nThese changes can not come into effect until amending legislation is passed through the Australian Parliament.\nAfter the broadcasting deals were announced with Cricket Australia, Seven Network and Fox Cricket, Men’s ODIs and T20s will be live and exclusively broadcast on Foxtel.\n\nThe most accurate and up to date anti-siphoning list is available on the comlaw website \nGenerally, the following events are anti-siphoning events:\n\nSporting events are added and removed from the list from time to time. For example, in 2017, the English FA Cup final, finals of the Wimbledon Championships and the US Open, international netball matches, and a number of golf events were removed from the list.\n\nSports broadcasting contracts in Australia\n\n"}

It was published by Neko Entertainment / Big Ben Interactive in Europe and by Graffiti Entertainment / O~3 Entertainment in North America. The music was composed by Frédéric \"Elmobo\" Motte. It was released for the Game Boy Advance on December 14, 2006.\n\nThe player controls a warrior who is mysteriously amnesiac and has been experimented on by demonic creatures. Players can move the character around the game's environments freely, jump around platforms, and fight enemies dynamically. Killed enemies turn to stone, which can then be moved around and used to solve puzzles. When the player's character is wounded, he transforms into a demonic monster, which improves his fighting capabilities.\n\nThe game does not feature any way to save the player's progress, which had been a standard feature of video games for many years by 2006. Instead, the game relies on passwords to allow the player to return to the game where they had left off when they last turned off the console.\n\nThe game received mixed and negative reviews. Most critics considered the gameplay to be \"simple\" and \"familiar\", but the stone-pushing puzzles to be \"unimaginative\", unoriginal, and repetitive.\n\nSome reviewers considered the graphics and design to be \"charming and varied\", easy to discern (in contrast to \"\"), but many judged the presentation to be \"drab\", \"grainy\" and \"muddy\". The game's smooth framerate and special effects have received praise, as have the intricate boss battles.\n\nSeveral reviewers have noted that controlling the character from the game's isometric 3D perspective was very difficult and \"unintuitive\" because of the rigidity of a directional pad and the difficulty in judging depth. Multiple critics have praised the game's length (estimated between 8 and 15 hours), which is considered good for a portable game. The translation's poor quality has also been criticized.\n\n\"Back to Stone\" was heavily criticized almost unanimously for its lack of saving functionality, instead relying on a password-based system to track the player's progress, which was seen as a \"cumbersome\" flaw for a game on a handheld console, as well as \"stupefying\", \"unforgivable\" and \"inexcusably archaic\" when compared to other games released in this era.\n\n"}

She toured widely in the United States in the 1890s, becoming \"one of the most famous and wealthy entertainers of her day\".\n\nShe was born into a poor family in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England. Official records give her birth name as Betsey Bonehill. She appeared in the 1860s as a double act with her sister Marion. After cropping her hair, she became well known as a \"principal boy\" actor in local pantomimes, before moving to London and appearing as a male impersonator and performer of \"coster songs\" in theatres in the 1870s and 1880s. Many of her songs were written by Arthur West, a friend of Charlie Chaplin. In 1877 she married Louis Abrahams, and had two daughters and a son with him.\n\nWhile she was appearing in London, American vaudeville impresario Tony Pastor persuaded her to travel to the United States to perform. She first appeared in Pastor's Theatre, on 14th Street, Manhattan, in 1889. The \"New York Times\" described her as \"lithe and frisky, strident as to voice and nimble as to feet... [S]he is as much at home in masculine garb as if to the manner born.\" According to her local obituary, \"her success was immediate and her male impersonations were the theatrical sensation of the winter. Her beauty, cheerful personality and her entire freedom from vulgarity were new then in male impersonation.\" Her song \"Comrades\", which she performed as a newsboy, was a success, and she toured widely in the United States.\n\nShe remained in the United States for most of the next decade, bringing her family with her; a British music hall manager said that \"she had sold out to the mighty dollar\". In 1890 she married for the second time, to an American, William Smith (known professionally as William Seeley), who was several years her junior; they had a son. She performed in the musical \"Little Christopher\", and another show, \"Playmates\", written by her husband, before returning to vaudeville as the head of her own traveling company which toured across the United States. She was sometimes billed as \"England's Gem\", and as \"England's Favorite Comedy Cantatrice\". One reviewer described her as \"the best character singer ever imported to these shores\". Her style as a male impersonator was adopted by later artists such as Vesta Tilley and Hetty King.\n\nThe company included her husband and son Jack (from her first marriage), who performed together as a musical comedy act, Seeley and West. The company also toured in Britain, Europe, South America, and South Africa, from where they had to escape at the start of the Boer War. Bessie Bonehill settled with her family around 1896 on a run-down 600-acre estate, Deer Hill Farm, at Sayville on Long Island, which they developed as a family home.\n\nShe started a tour in England in 1901, but fell ill from what was later diagnosed as stomach cancer. She died on 21 August 1902 at Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire at the age of 47. She was buried (as Betsey Smith) at Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth.\n\n\nFirst marriage\n\nBessie Bonehill was first married to Louis William Abraham (approx. 1857 Manchester, England – 21 April 1890 Bow, London). They married September 20, 1877, in Shoreditch, London at Saint Leonard's Church. From that marriage they had three children:\n\nSecond Marriage\n\nAfter the death of her first husband, Bonehill married William Robert Smith (1862 – 29 March 1929 Manhattan, New York), professionally known as \"W.R.

It was founded in 1964 by Richard Hoggart, its first director. From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a major role in developing the field of cultural studies.\n\nThe Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'. After its first director, Richard Hoggart departed in 1968, the Centre was led by Stuart Hall (1969-1979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (1980-1987). The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the \"Americanization\" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism. Drawing on a variety of influences (feminism, structuralism, Marxism - - especially the work of Louis Althusser and Antonio Gramsci, sociology, critical race theory, and post-structuralism), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes. The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988. \nThe Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. Stuart Hall, who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal \"Encoding/Decoding\" model here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on \"mugging\" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in the 1980s. Other noted Centre books include 'Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies'; 'Resistance through Rituals'; 'The Empire Strikes Back'; 'Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality'.\n\nRichard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media, cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.\n\nGraduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: Paul Gilroy (King's College London) theorist of culture and race, Angela McRobbie (Goldsmiths) theorist of consumption, femininity and popular culture, Celia Lury (Goldsmiths) feminist theory and consumption, Jackie Stacey (University of Manchester), film, cancer culture and science in culture, Sarah Franklin (LSE) science as culture, Debbie Epstein (University of Cardiff), education, childhood and youth studies, sexuality and popular culture, Peter Redman (The Open University) masculinities, psychoanalytic theory, Mary Jane Kehily (The Open University) childhood and youth studies, Joyce Canaan (City University, Birmingham) cultures of higher education, Anoop Nayak (Newcastle University) geographies of race, Deborah Lynn Steinberg (Warwick University) science cultures, sexuality and popular culture, Hilary Pilkington (Warwick University) Russia and youth subcultures, Sue Wright (Danish Pedagogic University) cultures of higher education, Hazel Carby (Yale) race and literature, David Parker (Nottingham University), Mica Nava (University of East London) media studies, Graham Dawson (University of Brighton) historical cultural studies, Chris Griffin (Bath University) girls and youth cultures, and Adrian Kear (Aberystwith University) performance studies and psychoanalysis, Kevin J. Brehony (Roehampton University) historical studies of educational ideologies.\n\nEmpirical researchers included David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon, who produced \"The Nationwide Project\" at the Centre. Dorothy Hobson's research about the reception of \"Crossroads\" was based on her MA dissertation. Another important empirical researcher is Paul Willis, who received his PhD from the CCCS in 1972 and stayed as a researcher there until 1981.\n\nIn later years, on the dissolution of the Centre and formation of the Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS), Sadie Plant, noted cybertheorist and feminist (author of \"Zeroes + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture\"), taught there, as did Jorge Larrain, the well-known Chilean sociologist and cultural historian, author of \"Identity and Modernity in Latin America\" and John Gabriel, sociologist of race. Frank Webster, a Sociologist with interests in Information Society issues and sympathy for the 'cultural turn', joined the newly formed Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology in 1999, but left for City University London when the department was abruptly closed in 2002.\n\nThe new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of \"inexperienced 'macho management.'\" Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be \"retained\" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left. There were protests against the decision to close Cultural Studies and Sociology from around the world and the University received much adverse criticism.\n\nIn April 2002, according to student testimonies, rumors began to circulate that the Department was going to be closed down because it had received a \"very bad\" 3a mark in a recent Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). Despite assurances as to the contrary, on June 21, 2002, right after the end of term, staff members received emails informing them of a decision that had already been taken to close down the Department. The decision was to be ratified on June 26.\n\nStudents and staff began a campaign to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press (see links below) and sparked numerous letters of support from former alumni all over the world. The main argument of the campaigners was that the Department was being closed down because of economic pressures relating to the public funding of British universities in accordance with RAE marks. The Department of Cultural Studies was a top money-making unit inside the School of Social Sciences.\n\nAdditionally, concerns were expressed that the Department was being \"belatedly punished\" for its political radicalism, as one journalist put it. Indeed, the unreservedly leftwing Department's long history of conflict with the University's administration was well known to all who had studied at the University of Birmingham between the 1960s and the 1980s.\n\nOf the four staff members who were \"retained\", one was attached to the Department of Social Policy, one to the Department of English, and one to the Institute of European Studies. The remaining ten staff members were invited to retire voluntarily in return for a severance package (one year's pay).\n\nProfessor David Marsh, a political sociologist from the Department of Political Science and International Studies (POLSIS), was drafted in as temporary head of a new Department of Sociology, with Cultural Studies dropped from the title. Further posts were created in Sociology during 2003.\n\nThe Department had been top of the Guardian league table for Sociology before its closure and it continues to excel in this poll. The Department was recently ranked fourth in Guardian league tables for Sociology.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the establishment of CCCS came in 2014. To mark this occasion, academics at the University of Birmingham– in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, Stuart Hall and Michael Green, created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.\n\nAlec Gordon, The Genesis of Radical Cultural Studies: Contribution to a Reconstruction of Cultural Studies as Counter-Intellectual Critique [The Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, University of Birmingham, England, 1963-1975]\nUnpublished Ph.D thesis, University of Leeds, June 1988. \n\n"}

As the founder of Pathé Frères, its roots lie in 1896 Paris, France, when Pathé and his brothers, pioneered the development of the moving image. Pathé adopted the national emblem of France, the cockerel, as the trademark for his company. After the company, now called Compagnie Générale des Éstablissements Pathé Frères Phonographes & Cinématographes, invented the cinema newsreel with \"Pathé-Journal\". \n\nThe son of a butcher shop owner, Charles Morand Pathé was born at Chevry-Cossigny, in the Seine-et-Marne \"département\" of France. His father, Jacques Pathé and mother, Thérèse-Émélie Kech were butchers by trade, and ran a delicatessen first in Chevry-Cossigny, and later in Vincennes. Charles had three brothers and two sisters.\n\nPathé left school at 14 to work as an apprentice butcher, at rue de Charenton, Paris. After military service, in 1889, at 25, he began working as a meat merchant but soon took his savings, and with the help of his brothers and his sister, embarked for Buenos Aires, Argentina, with the aim of setting up in business.\n\nPathé tried to establish himself in various trades including a laundry service based on industrial washing machines that turned out to be unsuccessful. His life was unsettled and Pathé was forced to change jobs frequently. After a final failure of trying to deal in exotic parrots, when he and his business partner were stricken with yellow fever, Pathé returned to France in poor health.\n\nAt age 30, Pathé married lle Foy in Paris, and worked as a clerk, drawing a meager salary.\n\nBack in Vincennes, in August 1894, Pathé saw the phonograph invented by Thomas Edison, demonstrated at the town fair. He immediately embraced the sound recording technology, purchasing examples of Edison machines to resell. In 1896, with his brothers Émile, Théophile and Jacques, Pathé founded Société Pathé Frères (Pathé Brothers) in Paris, a company that manufactured and sold phonographs and phonograph cylinders, with Émile at his head.\n\nWhile in London, Pathé saw the Edison Kinetoscope and decided to expand the Pathé company's business to distributing cinema projection equipment, and with the acquisition of Eastman Kodak patent rights in Europe, a licence for film stock in theatres throughout France. Pathé films were rented out, for a maximum of four months, a more lucrative business than selling the product. A modest first factory had been installed in 1896 at Vincennes. The first films of the Société Pathé Frères such as \"Le Passage à niveau à Joinville le Pont\" and \"L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de Bel-Air\" were produced, under Pathé's guidance. For several years, however, the success of the phonograph business underwrote the success of the cinema company.\n\nOn 28 December 1897, Société Pathé Frères was re-capitalised and set up as a combination of production, film laboratories, technical services and distribution of films. From 1902 to 1904, Pathé opened branches in Europe and in the United States, with their trademark Gallic cock logo created in 1905, recognized as heralding one of the world's most significant filmmakers. In 1906, Pathé Frères began to establish a global enterprise with Segundo de Chomón founded the Spanish branch in Barcelona, and four years later Pathé entered the US market with Pathé-America, based in New Jersey, branch offices in other countries followed.\n\nFrom its origin, Pathé Frères began using the camera developed by Lumière brothers' patents and then set about to design an improved studio camera and to make their own film stock. From 1901, Pathé teamed up with director and later manager Ferdinand Zecca who oversaw the creation and production of original Pathé Frères films. From 1905 on, the company employed specialized studio staff: screenwriters, directors, cinematographers and other technicians.\n\nZecca explored many themes from the mundane to the fantastic. In \"À la conquête de l'air\" (1901), a strange flying machine, called \"Fend-l'air\", was seen flying over the rooftops of Belleville. By using trick photography, the one-minute short was notable in being the first aviation film, predating the flight by the Wright Brothers by two years.\n\nZecca also pioneered one of the first crime dramas, \"Histoire d'un crime\" (1901), stylistically innovative in its use of superimposition. The story was of a man condemned to death, awaiting execution with his crimes appearing on his cell wall. The film is an early example of flashbacks as a film device. Other films included comedies, trick films or fairy tales, such as \"Les Sept châteaux du Diable\", both 1901, and \"La Belle au bois dormant\" in 1902, as well as social dramas like \"Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme\" (1902), \"Au pays noir\" (1905) and reconstructions of actual events, the most famous being \"La Catastrophe de la Martinique\" (1902).\n\nZecca acted in many of his films. At the end of 1906, assisted by the Spaniard Segundo de Chomón's photography and special effects, Zecca continued to experiment. He co-directed \"La Vie et la passion de Jésus Christ\" (1903), which, at a running time of 44 minutes, was one of the first feature-length films about Jesus. He started filming in colour, with second \"Vie et Passion de N.S. Jésus Christ\", shot in four parts with 38 scenes, 990 metres long, which was finished in 1907.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1907, Zecca oversaw the production of hundreds of Pathé films from many important Pathé directors including Nonguet Lucien, Gaston Velle, Albert Capellani, Louis J. Gasnier, André Heuzé and Henri Pouctal. Zecca also acted, directed, produced, and, on occasion, wrote films. After Pathé bought the rights to Star films, Zecca started editing films by George Méliès. Film production went from 70 titles in 1901 to 500 in 1903; after 1906, the mass film production gradually eased as longer films were produced.\n\nPathé Frères filmed numerous short subjects, the majority of which are sensational criminal adventures, melodramatic love stories, and comedies. In 1909 Pathé produced his first feature or \"long film,\" \"Les Misérables\", a four-reel screen version of the novel by Victor Hugo. That same year he created the Pathé Gazette in France (called Pathé News in the U.S. set up in 1910 and in the U.K. (now British Pathé) in 1911), which was an internationally popular newsreel until 1956. .\n\nIn 1912, Pathé appointed Alfred Machin to develop the first studio films at Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Château Karreveld, Belgium. In 1914, Pathé Frères studios in the United States released the first episodes of \"The Perils of Pauline\", one of the earliest and best remembered screen serials. The company also began publishing the screen magazine \"Pathé Pictorial\". When Pathé Exchange was spun off from its French parent company in 1921, with a controlling stake held by Merrill Lynch, Charles Pathé stayed on as a director of the American firm.\n\nIn 1929, Charles Pathé sold out his interest in his businesses and retired to Monaco. He died there on Christmas Day 1957, one day before his 94th birthday.\n\n"}

Two or more fictional characters are often combined into a single character in the course of an adaptation of a work for a different medium, as in adapting a novel in the course of authoring a screenplay for a film. A composite character may be modeled on historical or biographical figures. An amalgamation or amalgam, when used to refer to a fictional character or place, refers to one that was created by combining, or is perceived to be a combination, of several other previously existing characters or locations. To emphasize the origin of their creations, authors or artists may use amalgamated names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating composite characters in journalism is considered a misrepresentation of facts and, without appropriate notice to the reader, unethical. Some writers who are considered journalists or who describe them selves as journalists have on occasion used composite characters.\n\n\nPlaces may be amalgamated in fiction by taking districts, landmarks, or characters of existing locations, or previously created locations of another work of fiction. Thus, a sample fictional city could contain the Eiffel Tower a block away from the Forbidden City, where Bill Gates may be living after having bought a nearby clacks tower from Albus Dumbledore. Usually, if the author or artist desires the city to be more believable, he or she will amalgam it only from real places, whereas if the story is more fantastic, fictional places may be better.\n\nAn author or artist may choose to amalgamate a city rather than imagining all of its aspects from scratch in order to be humorous by referencing other works and/or real places, or to avoid having to name his or her city altogether, such as when shooting a film in several existing cities, while the city portrayed is supposed not to exist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25179257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25179257", "title": "Dance in Cuba", "text": "Dance in Cuba\n\nCuban culture encompasses a wide range of dance forms. The island's indigenous people performed rituals known as areíto, which included dancing, although little information is known about such ceremonies. After the colonization of Cuba by the Spanish Kingdom, European dance forms were introduced such as the French contredanse, which gave rise to the Cuban contradanza. Contradanza itself spawned a series of ballroom dances between the 19th and 20th centuries, including the danzón, mambo and cha-cha-cha. Rural dances of European origin, such as the zapateo and styles associated with punto guajiro also became established by the 19th century, and in the 20th century son became very popular. In addition, numerous dance traditions were brought by black slaves from West Africa and the Congo basin, giving rise to religious dances such as Santería, yuka and abakuá, as well as secular forms such as rumba. Many of these dance elements from European dance and religious dances were fused together to form the basis of la técnica cubana. Cuban music also contributed to the emergence of Latin dance styles in the United States, namely rhumba (ballroom rumba) and salsa.\n\nDanzón is the official musical genre and dance of Cuba. It is also an active musical form in Mexico and is still beloved in Puerto Rico. The danzón evolved from the Cuban contradanza (also known as the habanera). In Cuba, these dances were influenced by African rhythmic and dance styles and so became a genuine fusion of European and African influences.\n\nThe danzón developed in 1879, and has been an important root for Cuban music up to today. Its precursor is the habanera, which is a creolized Cuban dance form. The danzón was developed, according to one's point of view, by either Manuel Saumell or Miguel Faílde in Matanzas.\n\nThe form of danzón created by Miguel Faílde in 1879 (\"Las alturas de Simpson\"), begins with an introduction (four bars) and \"paseo\" (four bars), which are repeated and followed by a 16-bar melody. The introduction and \"paseo\" again repeat before a second melody is played. The dancers do not dance during these sections: they choose partners, stroll onto the dance floor, and begin to dance at precisely the same moment: the fourth beat of bar four of the paseo, which has a distinctive percussion pattern that's hard to miss. When the introduction is repeated the dancers stop, chat, flirt, greet their friends, and start again, right on time as the paseo finishes.\n\nEarly danzón was played by groups called \"orquestas típicas\", which were based on wind instruments. They had several brass instruments (cornet, valve trombone, ophicleide), a clarinet or two, a violin or two and tympani (kettle drums). At the beginning of the 20th century, the lighter and somewhat more elegant sound of the \"charanga\" emerged (see Early Cuban bands). Initially, they were small orchestra of two violins, a cello, flute, timbales, güiro, and doublebass. Charanga and típicas competed with each other for years, but after 1930 it was clear that the days of the típica were over.\n\nMambo is a musical form and dance style that developed originally in Cuba, with further significant developments by Cuban musicians in Mexico and the USA. The word \"mambo\" means \"conversation with the gods\" in Kikongo, the language spoken by Kongo slaves taken to Cuba. Modern mambo began with a song called \"Mambo\" written in 1938 by brothers Orestes and Cachao López. The song was a danzón, a dance form descended from European social dances like the English country dance, French contredanse, and Spanish contradanza. It was backed by rhythms derived from African folk music.\n\nThe cha-cha-cha, or simply cha-cha, is the name of a dance of Cuban origin. It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrín in 1953. This rhythm was developed from the danzón by a syncopation of the fourth beat. The name is onomatopoeic, derived from the rhythm of the güiro (scraper) and the shuffling of the dancers' feet.\n\nStyles of cha-cha-cha dance may differ in the place of the chasse in the rhythmical structure. The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha-cha count is \"two, three, chachacha\" or \"four-and-one, two, three\". The dance does not start on the first beat of a bar, though it can start with a transfer of weight to the lead's right.\n\nNevertheless, many social dancers count \"one, two, cha-cha-cha\" and may find it difficult to make the adjustment to the \"correct\" timing of the dance.\n\nThe Cuban bolero dance originated in Santiago de Cuba in the last quarter of the 19th century; it does \"not\" owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name. In the 19th century there grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar.\n\nPepe Sánchez is known as the father of the \"trova\" style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.\n\nThe Cuban bolero has traveled to Mexico and the rest of Latin America after its conception, where it became part of their repertoires. Some of the bolero's leading composers have come from nearby countries, most especially the prolific Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández; another example is Mexico's Agustín Lara. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are listed under Trova.\n\nSalsa dancing originated in New York in the mid-1970s. It evolved from earlier dance forms such as Cha cha cha and Mambo which were popular in New York, and incorporated elements of Swing dancing and Hustle, as well as elements of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Caribbean dances such as Guaguanco and Pachanga. In many styles of salsa dancing, as a dancer changes weight by stepping, the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes. Weight shifts cause the hips to move. Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated. The Cuban Casino style of salsa dancing involves significant movement above the waist, with up-and-down shoulder movements and shifting of the ribcage.\n\nThe arms are used by the \"lead\" dancer to communicate or signal the \"follower,\" either in \"open\" or \"closed\" position. The open position requires the two dancers to hold one or both hands, especially for moves that involve turns, putting arms behind the back, or moving around each other, to name a few examples. In the closed position, the leader puts the right hand on the follower's back, while the follower puts the left hand on the leader's shoulder.\n\nCuba has ballet schools across the country. The Cuban National Ballet School \"(Escuela Nacional Cubana de Ballet)\" in Havana, with approximately 3,000 students is the biggest ballet school in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba. It is directed by Ramona de Sáa. The Cuban National Ballet is also a renowned ballet company located in Havana.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3298757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3298757", "title": "Documentary theatre", "text": "Documentary theatre\n\nDocumentary theatre is theatre that uses pre-existing documentary material (such as newspapers, government reports, interviews, journals, and correspondences) as source material for stories about real events and people, frequently without altering the text in performance. The genre typically includes or is referred to as verbatim theatre, investigative theatre, theatre of fact, theatre of witness, autobiographical theatre, and ethnodrama.\n\nWhile fact-based drama has been traced back to Ancient Greece and Phrynichus' production of \"The Capture of Miletus in\" 492 BC, contemporary documentary theatre is rooted in theatrical practices developed in Eastern Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. In the years after the Russian Revolution, the USSR's Department of Agitation and Propaganda employed theatre troupes known as the Blue Blouses (so called because they wore factory workers' overalls) to stage current events for a largely illiterate population. The Blue Blouses dramatized news items and current events through song, dance, and staging, and by 1924 these performances were standardized into the form of the \"zhivaya gazeta\" or living newspaper. \n\nMeanwhile, in Germany, Erwin Piscator was experimenting with incorporating documentary film footage and other primary source material into his \"mass spectacles\" and in 1925 wrote \"In Spite of Everything\", a piece derived entirely from contemporary political documents and often sited as the beginning of the first period of modern documentary drama. In this and other early works, Piscator sought to depict the \"absolute truth\" and focused on the presentation of factual material in montage and collage form rather than the internal lives of the characters.\n\nDocumentary theatre spread west during the 1930s. In England, the form was employed by left-leaning political theatre groups like the Unity Theatre, which presented both documentary and historical dramas in order to expose the truths of the common man, frequently combining fiction and reality to achieve truth. Unity Theatre's documentary shows focused on the living newspaper aesthetic of Eastern Europe, although their first piece \"Busmen\" (1938) combined abstract and stylized design aesthetics culled from expressionist and constructivist genres with naturalistic dialogue.\n\nIn the United States, the form was adapted by Hallie Flanagan Davis and Morris Watson into the large-scale Living Newspapers of the Federal Theatre Project. Initially conceived as an \"animated newsreel,\" the form evolved into its own theatrical genre, using spectacle and vaudeville techniques in addition to agitprop and Piscatorian conventions to tackle issues such as labor, housing, and agriculture. Often, they included characters like Little Man and Loudspeaker to stand in and speak for and to the audience during the action, fusing fact with dramatic symbol and clarifying the narrative arc. These plays, like later iterations of documentary theatre, were frequently communally created, often by groups of newspaper writers and theatre artists. The end of the Federal Theatre Project in 1939 brought documentary theatre in the United States to a halt until the early 1960s.\n\nWhile the documentary theatre of the 1930s stressed the involvement of the audience, much of the work of the 1960s into the 1970s was influenced by Bertolt Brecht's distancing of the audience through aesthetic practices in order to question dominant ideologies. The work of this era focused more intensely on new or alternative perspectives of historical events by restructuring the documents to raise questions about perceived reality. In Germany, these documentary plays focused mainly on the aftermath of Nazism and genocide. Many of them used transcripts from tribunals, such as \"In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer\" by Heinar Kippart and Peter Weiss' \"The Investigation.\" In his \"Notes on the Contemporary Theatre,\" Weiss details 14 components of documentary theatre, stating that \"the strength of the documentary theatre resides in its ability to arrange fragments of reality into a usable model,\" and that the artistic power of the genre comes from a partisan interpretation and presentation of factual material. He also detailed the sources for documentary theatre, including \"minutes of proceeding, files, letters, statistical tables, stock-exchange communiques, presentations of balance-sheets of banks and industrial undertakings, official commentaries, speeches, interviews, statements by well-known personalities, press, radio, photo, or film reporting of events and all the other media bearing witness to the present.\"\n\nThis type of documentary drama was exported to Israel and the Middle East by Nola Chilton, whose theatre of testimony focused on marginalized groups in the area and later influenced the work of American practitioners. During this period of time, however, the American genre became more overtly political with plays such as Martin Duberman's \"In White America\", a piece based in Living Newspaper techniques of narration and song, presented by the Free Southern Theatre, a company that sought to make theatre for black audiences in the south. Plays also became more experimental, leading to documentary-style performances, as artists like Joseph Chaikin and The Open theatre used historical documents as source material for improvisations (\"Viet Rock\") or Luis Valdez combining verbatim text from newspapers, transcripts, and correspondence with a fictionalized story and characters in \"Zoot Suit\".\n\nIn England, meanwhile, the use of tape-recorded testimony to generate script became a hallmark of the Stoke Local Documentary Method, developed by Peter Cheeseman. In his many plays, including \"Fight for Shelton Bar\" (1977), \"Hands Up, For You the War Is Ended!\" (1971), Cheeseman focused on the exact transcription of recorded interviews, and is one of the earliest pioneers of the sub-genre verbatim theatre. The theories of Cheeseman and other British practitioners of verbatim theatre informed much of American documentary theatre of the late 20th-century.\n\nThe focus on individuals within the context of historical events that permeated the documentary theatre of the 1960s and 1970s paved the way for artist- and individual-centric documentary theatre in the 1980s and 1990s. During this period of time, the focus shifted even further away from broad historical presentations to focus more specifically on how identity shaped personal relationships with major events. The seminal works of this period, which highlight the work of the artist as interpreter of the factual material, include one-person shows such as Anna Deavere Smith's \"Fires in the Mirror\" (1992), collectively created shows like Tectonic Theatre Project's \"The Laramie Project\" (2000), and playwright-driven work like Anne Nelson's \"The Guys\" (2001) and Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen's \"The Exonerated\" (2002). In Eastern Europe, new German documentary theatre also focused on the importance of the artist as interpreter through the development of media-driven non-narrative creations of auteur directors like Hans-Werner Kroesinger.\n\nContemporary documentary theatre is defined by its privileging of subjectivity over universality and questioning of the definition of truth in an age where digital and physical realities collide. Many contemporary practitioners reject the term \"documentary theatre\" in favor of more equivocal labels like \"investigative theatre\" that allow for more leeway in the artistic interpretation of reality and moves away from the original concept of the artist as moral arbiter of the truth. Just as Piscator utilized the new media of film and projection to enhance his productions, so contemporary documentary theatre continues to rely on new media to explore the increasingly fuzzy line between reality and representation of reality. Similarly, documentary theatre continues to rely on a democratic process of interview gathering and multiple artistic perspectives to create new narratives. This has led to a proliferation of plays, both verbatim and fictionalized, that focus on the stories of refugees and migrants that use interviews and workshops as the starting point for narrative plays.\n\nVerbatim theatre is a form of documented theatre in which plays are constructed from the precise words spoken by people interviewed about a particular event or topic.\n\nThe playwright interviews people who are connected to the topic that is the play's focus and then uses their testimony to construct the play. In this way, the playwright seeks to present a degree of objectivity akin to that represented by news reporting. Such plays are focused on politics, disasters, sporting and other social events.\n\nA verbatim (word-for-word) style of theatre uses the real words from interviewees to construct the play. Campion Decent, Australian playwright and author of the verbatim theatre play \"Embers\", said it is “not written in a traditional sense… but is... conceived, collected and collated”.\nit is a creative type of drama to help tell the story of what actually happened. Verbatim theatre exists as conceived in the United Kingdom; whereas, in the United States verbatim theatre is not distinguished and, thus, is lumped into the broader genre that is documentary theatre. Therefore, the plays, movies and TV listed below – as verbatim theatre – authored by playwrights living and writing in the United States should be considered as documentary theatre.\n\nAmerican actress/playwright Anna Deavere Smith has been described as a pioneer of verbatim theatre due to two of her one-woman plays in the early 1990s: \"Fires in the Mirror\" (1992), about the 1991 Crown Heights riot, and \"\" (1994), about the 1992 Los Angeles riots. For both plays, she conducted interviews with numerous people connected to the events, then fashioned the plays out of the interview transcripts.\n\nHigh-profile pieces of verbatim theatre include \"The Laramie Project\" by Moises Kaufman & Tectonic Theater and its sequel, \"The Laramie Project-Ten Years Later\", both about the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming in 1998; \"Talking to Terrorists\" by Robin Soans, \"My Name is Rachel Corrie\" by Alan Rickman and Katharine Viner, \"Deep Cut\" by Philip Ralph and Katharine Viner, \"The Permanent Way\" by David Hare and \"Counted\" (2010) by LookLeftLookRight. Unusually, \"London Road\" (2011) by Alecky Blythe and Adam Cork, is a verbatim musical, in which the verbatim spoken text is coupled with music composed and sung to resemble the source interviews as closely as possible.\n\nMore recent examples of political verbatim theatre are Tess Berry-Hart's plays \"Someone To Blame\" (2012) and \"Sochi 2014\" (2014). In \"Someone To Blame\" (about the miscarriage of justice of teenager Sam Hallam ) the words were taken solely from witness statements, court transcripts, media headlines and interviews with those involved. \"Sochi 2014\" was created from interviews with various LGBT citizens in Russia after Vladimir Putin's anti-gay laws (see LGBT rights in Russia) in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics. \n\n\"Black Watch\" (2006) integrates interviews taken with members of the Black Watch with dramatized versions of their stories and dance pieces. The piece originated in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and was created by the National Theatre of Scotland and Gregory Burke. \"8\", a play by Dustin Lance Black, is an example that uses interviews and courtroom transcripts in order to reenact the legal argument and witness testimony of the \"Perry v. Schwarzenegger\" case.\n\nRecorded voice delivery is an extension of verbatim theatre in which actors have recorded interviews played back to them during the performance, allowing them to directly mimic the accents and manner of speech, as well as the words, of the people they portray. An example is \"Grandpa Sol and Lily's Grandma Rosie\" by Lana Schwarcz, in which Schwarz portrays the residents of a retirement home via puppetry and playback of interviews via iPod.\n\nIn 2012, the Welsh National Theatre put on a play about money problems between the different social classes named \"sgint\". It was the first Welsh-language verbatim play.\n\nIn November 2013 and again in 2014, JW3, a Jewish Cultural Centre in Finchley Road, London presented the verbatim play 'Listen, we're Family' by Matthew Lloyd and Kerry Shale. Shale played one of the roles with Debby Chazen, Jennifer Stoller, and Tom Berish.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term was introduced by Maskin and Tirole (1988) in a theoretical setting featuring two firms bidding sequentially and where the winner captures the full market.\n\nA price cycle has the following phases: \n\nIt can be debated whether Edgeworth Cycles should be thought of as tacit collusion because it is a Markov Perfect equilibrium, but Maskin and Tirole write: \"Thus our model can be viewed as a theory of tacit collusion.\" (p. 592).\n\nEdgeworth cycles have been reported in gasoline markets in many countries. Because the cycles tend to occur frequently, weekly average prices found in government reports will generally mask the cycling. Wang (2012) emphasizes the role of price commitment in facilitating price cycles: without price commitment, the dynamic game becomes one of simultaneous move and here, the cycles are no longer a Markov Perfect equilibrium but rely on, e.g., supergame arguments.\n\nEdgeworth cycles are distinguished from both sticky pricing and cost-based pricing. Sticky prices are typically found in markets with less aggressive price competition, so there are fewer or no cycles. Purely cost-based pricing occurs when retailers mark up from wholesale costs, so costs follow wholesale variations closely.\n\nThere is a separate literature, which has explored conditions under which price cycles like the ones observed gasoline markets and found that consumer search models can rationalize cycling under various conditions. Here, the intuition is that there is a small subset of consumers that are not informed about prices and therefore will buy from a firm regardless of the price charged. Once prices get low enough, a firm may find it optimal to charge a high price and exploit this small loyal segment rather than trying to win the whole market.\n\n\n\n"}

It was used in a situation when a host wanted to treat a guest in a recreational way. It moves in a straight line for a set distance, moving its feet as if walking, and then bows its head. This signals that the tea is for drinking, and the doll stops when the cup is removed. When it is replaced, the robot raises its head, turns around and returns to where it came from. It is typically powered by a wound spring made of whalebone, and the actions are controlled by a set of cams and levers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1074424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1074424", "title": "Lou Pearlman", "text": "Lou Pearlman\n\nLouis Jay Pearlman (June 19, 1954 – August 19, 2016) was an American record producer and fraudster. He was the manager of successful 1990s boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. In 2006, he was accused of running one of the largest and longest-running Ponzi schemes in history, leaving more than $300 million in debts. After being apprehended, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding. In 2008, Pearlman was convicted and sentenced to up to 25 years in prison. He died in federal custody in 2016.\n\nPearlman was born and raised in Flushing, New York, the only child of Jewish parents, Hy Pearlman, who ran a dry cleaning business, and Reenie Pearlman, a school lunchroom aide. He was a first cousin of musician Art Garfunkel. His home at Mitchell Gardens Apartments was located across from Flushing Airport, where he and childhood friend Alan Gross would watch blimps take off and land. According to his autobiography, which he titled \"Bands, Brands, & Billions\", it was during this period that he used his position on his school newspaper to earn credentials and get his first ride in a blimp. This is disputed by Gross, who claims he was the school reporter, and allowed Pearlman to tag along.\n\nHis cousin Garfunkel's fame and wealth helped fire Pearlman's own interest in the music business. As a teenager he managed a band, but when success in music proved elusive, he turned his attention to aviation. During his first year as a student at Queens College, Pearlman wrote a business plan for a class project based on the idea of a helicopter taxi service in New York City. By the late 1970s, he had launched the business based on his business plan, starting with one helicopter. He persuaded German businessman Theodor Wüllenkemper to train him on blimps and subsequently spent some time at Wüllenkemper's facilities in Germany learning about the airships.\n\nReturning to the United States, Pearlman formed Airship Enterprises Ltd, which leased a blimp to Jordache before actually owning one. He used the funds from Jordache to construct a blimp, which promptly crashed. The two parties sued each other, and seven years later Pearlman was awarded $2.5 million in damages. On the advice of a friend, Pearlman started a new company, Airship International, taking it public to raise the $3 million he needed to purchase a blimp, claiming (falsely) that he had a partnership with Wüllenkemper. He leased the blimp to McDonald's for advertising.\n\nHe then relocated Airship International to Orlando, Florida in July 1991, where he signed MetLife and SeaWorld as clients for his blimps. Airship International suffered when one of its clients left and three of the aircraft crashed. The company's stock, which had once been pumped up to $6 a share, dropped to a price of 3 cents a share, and the company was shut down:\nPearlman became fascinated with the success of the New Kids on the Block, who had made hundreds of millions of dollars in record, tour and merchandise sales. He started Trans Continental Records with the intent of mimicking their boy-band business model. The label's first band, the Backstreet Boys, consisted of five unknown performers selected by Pearlman in a $3 million talent search. Management duties were assigned to a former New Kids on the Block manager, Johnny Wright, and his wife Donna. The Backstreet Boys became the best-selling boy band of all time, with record sales of 130 million, hitting gold, platinum, and diamond in 45 different countries. Pearlman and the Wright then repeated this formula almost exactly with the band *NSYNC, which sold over 70 million records globally.\n\nWith these two major successes under his belt, Pearlman had become a music mogul. Other boy bands managed by Pearlman were O-Town (created during the ABC–MTV reality TV series \"Making the Band\"), LFO, Take 5, Natural and US5, as well as the girl group Innosense (with Britney Spears in the very beginning as a short-term member), co-managed with Lynn Harless (the mother of *NSYNC band member Justin Timberlake). Other artists on the Trans Continental label included Aaron Carter, Jordan Knight, Smilez & Southstar and C-Note. Pearlman also owned a large entertainment complex in Orlando, including a recording studio he called Trans Continental Studios, and a dance studio by Disney World named \"O-Town.\" In 2002, Pearlman and Wes Smith co-wrote \"Bands, Brands and Billions: My Top 10 Rules for Making Any Business Go Platinum.\"\n\nLou Pearlman also was an officer at TAG Entertainment. This independent film company produced some low-budget, yet profitable, movies, and DVDs.\n\nWith the exception of US5, all of the musical acts who worked with Pearlman sued him in Federal Court for misrepresentation and fraud. All cases against Pearlman have either been won by those who have brought lawsuits against him, or have been settled out of court.\n\nThe members of Backstreet Boys were the first to file a lawsuit against Pearlman, feeling that their contract—under which Pearlman collected as both manager and producer—was unfair, since Pearlman was also paid as a sixth member of the Backstreet Boys (i.e., one-sixth of the band's own income). The band's dissatisfaction began when member Brian Littrell hired a lawyer to determine why the group had received only $300,000 for all of their work, while Pearlman and his record company had made millions. Fellow boy band *NSYNC was having similar issues with Pearlman, and its members soon followed suit.\n\nAt the age of 14, pop star Aaron Carter filed a lawsuit in 2002 that accused Pearlman and Trans Continental Records of cheating him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars and of racketeering in a deliberate pattern of criminal activity. This suit was later settled out of court.\n\nIn September 2002, Pearlman purchased Mark Tolner's internet-based talent company, \"Options Talent Group\" f/k/a \"Sector Communications,\" which had previously named \"Emodel\" and \"Studio 58\" and would then go through several names including \"Trans Continental Talent,\" \"TCT,\" \"Wilhelmina Scouting Network\" or \"WSN,\" \"Web Style Network,\" \"Fashion Rock\", and \"Talent Rock.\" Regardless of the name, all incarnations were based on the business model used by Emodel founder Ayman \"Alec\" Difrawi (aka Alec Defrawy), himself a convicted con-man, who played a principal role in running Options / TCT / WSN and setting up Fashion Rock. The companies received unfavorable press attention, ranging from questions about their business practices to outright declarations that they were scams.\n\nAfter Hotjobs and Monster.com pulled over a thousand of the company's job ads from their boards, they were further advertised on the Difrawi-founded \"Industry Magazine\" website. The Better Business Bureau's opinion about Options / TCT / WSN was negative, citing a \"pattern of complaints concerning misrepresentation in selling practices.\" The New York State Consumer Protection Board issued an alert, naming it the largest example they had found of a photo mill scam (in which agencies force models to shoot portfolios with photographers on their own payrolls), and a state senator called it trying \"to make a quick, dishonest dollar.\"\n\nThe San Francisco labor commissioner declared it in violation of California law, and several state agencies were reported to be investigating it. In Florida, around 2,000 complaints were filed with the then-Attorney General Charlie Crist and the Better Business Bureau, and an investigation was started by Assistant AG Dowd. However, no charges were filed, as the newly appointed Assistant AG MacGregor was unable to find \"any substantial violations\" and the company had declared bankruptcy, \"leaving no deep pockets to collect damages from.\"\n\nBy June 2004, Fashion Rock, LLC had filed a civil suit for defamation against some who had criticized Pearlman's talent businesses. The case was dismissed and closed in 2006. One of the accused, Canadian consumer-fraud expert Les Henderson, successfully pursued a libel lawsuit against Pearlman, Tolner, El-Difrawi and several others.\n\nFashion Rock, LLC lived on until February 2, 2007, when its assets were sold in Pearlman's bankruptcy proceeding. Difrawi continued filing lawsuits that all got and was most recently running Expand, Inc. dba Softrock.org aka Employer Network, from the same address as former TCT.\n\nIn 2006, investigators discovered Pearlman had perpetrated a long-running Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of more than $300 million. For more than 20 years, Pearlman had enticed individuals and banks to invest in Trans Continental Airlines Travel Services Inc. and Trans Continental Airlines Inc., both of which existed only on paper. Pearlman used falsified Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, AIG and Lloyd's of London documents to win investors' confidence in his \"Employee Investment Savings Account\" program, and he used fake financial statements created by the fictitious accounting firm Cohen and Siegel to secure bank loans.\n\nIn February 2007, Florida regulators announced that Pearlman's Trans Continental Savings Program was indeed a massive fraud, and the state took possession of the company. Most of the at least $95 million which was collected from investors was gone. Orange County Circuit Judge Renee Roche ordered Pearlman and two of his associates, Robert Fischetti and Michael Crudelle, to bring back to the United States \"any assets taken abroad which were derived from illegal transactions.\"\n\nFollowing a flight from officials over the course of which he had been reported seen in Israel and Germany, Pearlman was arrested in Indonesia on June 14, 2007 after being spotted by a German tourist couple.\nHe was living in a tourist hotel in Nusa Dua in Bali. Pearlman had been seen in Orlando in late January 2007, in early February in Germany, including an appearance on German television on February 1. Reportedly he was also seen in Russia, Belarus, Israel, Spain, Panama, and Brazil. In early February, an attorney in Florida received a letter from Pearlman sent from Bali.\nPearlman was then indicted by a federal grand jury on June 27, 2007. Specifically, Pearlman was charged with three counts of bank fraud, one count of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud.\n\nFive days before his sentencing, Pearlman requested a telephone and an Internet connection two days a week to continue to promote bands. U. S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp rejected the request. On May 21, 2008, Sharp sentenced Pearlman to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding. Pearlman could reduce his prison time by one month for every million dollars he helped a bankruptcy trustee recover. He also ordered individual investors to be paid before institutions in distributing any eventual assets.\n\nPearlman and his companies were forced into involuntary bankruptcy in March 2007. Trustees and lenders auctioned off Pearlman's assets and personal belongings through eBay and a traditional bankruptcy auction. Church Street Station, a historic train station in downtown Orlando which Pearlman had purchased in 2002, was sold at a bankruptcy auction in April 2007 for $34 million. Several of Pearlman's belongings, including his college degrees, were purchased by \"The A.V. Club\" journalist and film critic Nathan Rabin during the eBay auction.\n\nIn 2007, \"Vanity Fair\" magazine published an article \"Mad About The Boys\" detailing extensive allegations that Pearlman molested some of his charges. Pearlman publicly addressed the allegations in a 2014 prison interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\" magazine, claiming they were unsubstantiated, and that he had never been accused of such by anyone he had helped succeed. \"Vanity Fair\", Pearlman claimed, had only interviewed \"people that had a grudge.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted Pearlman's \"well-documented track record of robbing his artists blind\" and rumours of his predilection for \"buff, blond boys in his entourage\", while a ten-year relationship with a former nurse, Tammie Hilton, remained unconsummated. \"He was very religious,\" Hilton said. However, in a 2009 interview with Howard Stern, the former lead singer of band LFO, Rich Cronin, said that he had only received a fraction of the money owed to him from record sales, and claimed that Pearlman had \"wanted to bang everyone\", and had attempted to seduce him multiple times. Cronin also alleged that those who did oblige Pearlman were looked after.\n\nCronin's assertions were not necessarily backed by fellow band members. Brad Fischetti, who continued to refer to Lou Pearlman as a friend, expressed sadness at the news of his arrest, imprisonment, and death. As of late November 2011, Nick Carter had not confirmed his mother's statements regarding Pearlman, and in a later interview, when asked if true, he chose his words carefully when he spoke, but he seemed to hint that bitterness might be a motivating factor for the sexual gossip. In an interview conducted by the Orlando \"Sentinel,\" openly gay former *NSYNC member Lance Bass, when asked about the \"Vanity Fair\" article, stated that Pearlman had never behaved inappropriately with them.\n\nIn 2008, Pearlman began his prison sentence with a projected release date of March 24, 2029. However, he suffered a stroke in 2010 while incarcerated. Pearlman died, while still in custody at the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami, Florida, on August 19, 2016, from cardiac arrest, that followed an infection of the interline of the heart valve. Pearlman had surgery to replace a heart valve a few weeks before his death. The prison took him to a hospital where he was scheduled for another surgery and he ultimately died. He was buried ten days later on August 29, 2016 in the family burial area. He was 62 years old.\n\n\n"}

It is also commonly used to refer to single scenes within the film to represent the film. \"Mise-en-scène\" has been called film criticism's \"grand undefined term\".\n\nWhen applied to the cinema, \"mise-en-scène\" refers to everything that appears before the camera and its arrangement—composition, sets, props, actors, costumes, and lighting. The \"mise-en-scène\", along with the cinematography and editing of a film, influence the verisimilitude or believability of a film in the eyes of its viewers. The various elements of design help express a film's vision by generating a sense of time and space, as well as setting a mood, and sometimes suggesting a character's state of mind. \"Mise-en-scène\" also includes the composition, which consists of the positioning and movement of actors, as well as objects, in the shot. These are all the areas overseen by the director. One of the most important people that collaborates with the director is the production designer. These two work closely to perfect all of the aspects of the \"mise-en-scène\" a considerable amount of time before the actual photography even begins. The production designer is generally responsible for the general look of the movie, leading various departments that are in charge of individual sets, locations, props, and costumes, among other things. Andre Bazin, a well-known French film critic and film theorist, describes the mise-en-scene aesthetic as emphasizing choreographed movement within the scene rather than through editing.\n\nBecause of its relationship to shot blocking, \"mise-en-scène\" is also a term sometimes used among professional screenwriters to indicate descriptive (action) paragraphs between the dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1547826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1547826", "title": "Mother Nature", "text": "Mother Nature\n\nMother Nature (sometimes known as Mother Earth or the Earth-Mother) is a common personification of nature that focuses on the life-giving and nurturing aspects of nature by embodying it, in the form of the mother.\n\nThe word \"nature\" comes from the Latin word, \"natura\", meaning birth or character (see nature (innate)). In English its first recorded use (in the sense of the entirety of the phenomena of the world) was in 1266 A.D.. \"Natura\", and the personification of Mother Nature, was widely popular in the Middle Ages. As a concept, seated between the properly divine and the human, it can be traced to Ancient Greece, though Earth (or \"Eorthe\" in the Old English period) may have been personified as a goddess. The Norse also had a goddess called Jord (or \"Earth\").\n\nThe earliest written usage is in Mycenaean Greek- \"Ma-ka\" (transliterated as \"ma-ga\"), \"Mother Gaia\", written in Linear B syllabic script (13th or 12th century BC). The various myths of nature goddesses such as Inanna/Ishtar (myths and hymns attested on Mesopotamian tablets as early as the 3rd millennium BC) show that the personification of the creative and nurturing sides of nature as female deities has deep roots. In Greece, the pre-Socratic philosophers had \"invented\" nature when they abstracted the entirety of phenomena of the world as singular: \"physis\", and this was inherited by Aristotle. Later medieval Christian thinkers did not see nature as inclusive of everything, but thought that she had been created by God; her place lay on earth, below the unchanging heavens and moon. Nature lay somewhere in the center, with agents above her (angels), and below her (demons and hell). For the medieval mind she was only a personification, not a goddess.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Persephone, daughter of Demeter (goddess of the harvest), was abducted by Hades (god of the dead), and taken to the underworld as his queen. Demeter was so distraught that no crops would grow and the \"entire human race [would] have perished of cruel, biting hunger if Zeus had not been concerned\" (Larousse 152). Zeus forced Hades to return Persephone to her mother, but while in the underworld, Persephone had eaten pomegranate seeds, the food of the dead and thus, she must spend part of each year with Hades in the underworld. Demeter's grief for her daughter in the realm of the dead, is reflected in the barren winter months and her joy when Persephone returns is reflected in the bountiful summer months.\n\nRoman Epicurean poet Lucretius opens his didactic poem \"De rerum natura\" by addressing Venus as a veritable mother of nature. Lucretius uses Venus as \"a personified symbol for the generative aspect of nature\". This largely has to do with the nature of Lucretius' work, which presents a nontheistic understanding of the world that eschews superstition.\n\nAlgonquian legend says that \"beneath the clouds lives the Earth-Mother from whom is derived the Water of Life, who at her bosom feeds plants, animals and human\" (Larousse 428). She is also known as Nokomis, the Grandmother.\n\nIn Inca mythology, \"Mama Pacha\" or \"Pachamama\" is a fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting. Pachamama is usually translated as \"Mother Earth\" but a more literal translation would be \"Mother Universe\" (in Aymara and Quechua mama = mother / pacha = world, space-time or the universe). Pachamama and her husband, Inti, are the most benevolent deities and are worshiped in parts of the Andean mountain ranges (stretching from present day Ecuador to Chile and Argentina).\n\nIn the Southeast Asian Indochina countries of Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, earth (terra firma) is personified as Phra Mae Thorani, but her role in Buddhist mythology differs considerably from that of Mother Nature. In the Malay Archipelago, that role is filled by Dewi Sri, \"The Rice-mother in the East Indies\".\n\n"}

One actor plays the front end, including the horse's head and its front legs, in a more-or-less upright posture and with a reasonable field of view afforded by eye holes in the horse's head. The other actor, playing the rear end of the animal, must bend at the waist so that his torso is horizontal like that of a horse, and put his arms around the waist of the first actor. He can see little, although there are normally eye holes in the bottom part of the horse's torso to enable him to see where he is putting his feet and to enable him to breathe.\n\nThe progenitors of the pantomime horse costume were the centaur and the ass, costumes used in ancient Greek and Roman revels, which carried on to \"commedia dell'arte\" shows. However, the two-person comic variant of the horse or donkey costume was introduced in the late 19th century. It remained popular throughout the mid-20th century, becoming an \"icon of comedy\" that entered into the British imagination and the English language.\n\nThe \"grandfather\" of the modern pantomime horse was the Blondin Donkey, introduced at the Royal Holborn theatre in 1885 by the acrobatic Griffiths brothers, Fred and Joe, and named after the tightrope walker who was famous for crossing Niagara Falls naked. A different horse known as Pogo the Performing Horse and worn by a father-and-son team became a popular panto feature and appeared at the London Coliseum in 1923.\n\nPanto horse costumes range from low-cost, \"ready-to-wear\" fabric versions to more complex puppet suits that have moving features operated with special wires from within. The most basic costumes have a sheet-like body that is draped over the wearers, while professional costumes have a closed body that often contains a padded frame to conform it to a certain shape. These costumes usually separate into two halves with a sealable seam down the middle of the body.\n\nOther types of similar costumes include pantomime cows, zebras and camels. Many modern-day pantomime horses are used in charity \"horse\" races, such as the London Pantomime Horse Race in Greenwich, London, an annual world-famous race-day event.\n\nPantomime horses and pantomime cows feature in Christmas pantomimes, mainly in the United Kingdom. A skilled pair of performers can dance as a pantomime horse. Pantomime horses feature prominently in an episode of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" titled \"Blood, Devastation, Death, War and Horror\". In the \"Merchant Banker\" sketch, two pantomime horses are forced to fight to the death for their job. Another sketch features a pantomime horse as a James Bond-esque secret agent, chasing its enemy around the world in cars, rickshaws, and even riding actual horses. The episode also features a pantomime goose and a pantomime dame Princess Margaret, which later appeared in the video for the George Harrison song \"Crackerbox Palace\".\n\nA song on British pop group Suede's eponymous debut album is called \"Pantomime Horse\".\n\nThe American late-night talk-show host Craig Ferguson has a recurring sketch with a pantomime horse named after Secretariat that originally appeared every time a doorbell rang, accompanied by a frenzied dance performed by onlookers who rapidly and repeatedly extend their arms. The horse first appeared on October 11, 2010. When the program moved to a new studio, an on-set stable was built for Secretariat. This pantomime Secretariat has begun to appear on other CBS programs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4122547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4122547", "title": "Paper Chase (game)", "text": "Paper Chase (game)\n\nPaper Chase (also known as Hare and Hounds or Chalk Chase) is a racing game played outdoors (best played within a wood or even a shrubbery maze) with any number of players. At the start of the game, one person is designated the 'hare' and everyone else in the group are the 'hounds'. The 'hare' starts off ahead of everyone else leaving behind themselves a trail of paper shreds (or chalk marks in an urban environment) which represents the scent of the hare. Just as scent is carried on the wind, so too are the bits of paper, sometimes making for a difficult game. After some designated time, the hounds must chase after the hare and attempt to catch them before they reach the ending point of the race. It is generally done over a long distance, but shorter courses can be set. If the hare makes it to the finish line, they get to choose the next hare, or to be the hare themselves. Similarly, the person who catches the hare gets to choose the next hare.\n\nA game called \"Hunt the Fox\" or \"Hunt the Hare\" had been played in English schools at least since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare appears to make reference to it in \"Hamlet\", when he eludes the guards at Elsinore he cries \"Hide, fox, and all after\". Around 1800 the game was organised at Shrewsbury School into an outdoor game called \"the Hunt\" or \"the Hounds\", to prepare the young gentlemen for their future pastime of fox hunting. The two runners making the trail with paper were called \"foxes\", those chasing them were called \"hounds\". Hare coursing rather than fox hunting was used as an analogy when the game spread to Bath School, so the trail-makers were called \"hares\". This term was made popular by the paper chase scene in \"Tom Brown's School Days\" and is still used in modern hashing and in club names like Thames Hare and Hounds, but Shrewsbury continues to use fox hunting terms as evidenced in \"The Way of All Flesh\" by Samuel Butler (see below) - \"in this case the hare was a couple of boys who were called foxes\". The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819. The club officers are the Huntsman, Senior and Junior Whips whilst the runners are Hounds, who start most races paired into \"couples\"; the winner of a race is said to \"kill\". The main inter-house cross-country races are still called the Junior and Senior Paperchase, although no paper is dropped and urban development means the historical course can no longer be followed.\n\n\"Tom Brown's School Days\" by Thomas Hughes published in 1857 depicted a meet by the Big-Side Hare and Hounds. Students busily tore up old newspapers copybooks and magazines into small pieces to fill four large bags with the paper ‘scent’. Forty or fifty boys gathered and two good runners were chosen as hares who carried the bags and started across the fields laying the trail. When scent (paper) was located the member of the pack calls \"Forward!\" - hashers now call “ON! ON!”. Members of the pack worked together finding scent and straining to keep up.\n\nIn chapter 39 of his semi-autobiographical novel \"The Way of All Flesh\" of 1903, Samuel Butler describes a school based on his alma mater of Shrewsbury. The main protagonist's favourite recreation is running with \"the Hounds\" so \"a run of six or seven miles across country was no more than he was used to\".\n\nIn the book \"The Railway Children,\" written by Edith Nesbit in 1906, the children observe a game of paper chase. The book was made into a television series four times and into a movie twice, the most recent of which was in 2000.\n\nIn the novel \"Daddy Long Legs,\" written in 1912 by Jean Webster, the girls play a game of paper chase where the hares cheat: they leave a paper trail indicating they entered a locked barn through a high window, while in actuality they went around the building.\n\nIn by H.P. Lovecraft's novella \"At the Mountains of Madness\", first published in 1936, the narrator references the game when using paper to blaze a trail through an unexplored city: \"Fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate.\"\n\nIn the 1946 Orson Welles movie, \"The Stranger,\" Rankin's students are in the midst of a paper chase through the woods as Rankin kills his former colleague. Rankin mis-directs the \"hounds\" to keep them from finding the body by moving the shreds of paper.\n\nIn the 1954 memoir by Vyvyan Holland, \"Son of Oscar Wilde,\" he describes playing paper chase at Neuenheim College in Heidelberg, Germany in 1896. \"[W]hen the river was frozen and the snow lay thick upon the ground, so that it was impossible either to row or to play football, paper chases were organised by the master in charge of games. No form of exercise is quite so utterly pointless and boring as a paper chase, and we used to try to slink off and get lost and find our way home by ourselves; though this, if discovered, was apt to lead to a painful interview with the games master.\"\n\nIn the 1975 Disney movie, \"One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing,\" the nannies notice a trail of paper scraps on the ground while trying to hide a dinosaur skeleton in a wood. They remark that it must be a paper chase at which point a group of school boys crash through the wood following the trail.\n\nHash House Harriers\n"}

The \"Unlimited Points System\" deliver the kind of non-stop, thrilling action for which fans are now clamoring.\n\nIn this system, points be awarded for specific action and activity. One point be given for a clear strike, takedown, near submission, full mont or back mount position, clear control on the ground, and aggression. Five points be awarded for a knock down.\n\nPenalties be assessed by the referee. A yellow card for fouls incur a five-point deduction. A blue card worth a two-point deduction be introduced for the purpose of eliminating stalling and avoidance, standing and on the ground.\n\nThe Road FC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure named \"Case\".\n\nThe Road FC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl.

The game features texture mapped polygon-modelled tracks and cars.\n\nSoftware rendering is used in the game, due to the game's release before the widespread adoption of 3D graphics cards, unlike \"Screamer\"s three sequels \"Screamer 2\", \"Screamer Rally\" and \"Screamer 4x4\", that all utilized 3D hardware (in the case of \"Screamer 2\", after a patch was released.

He noted that the computer-controlled opponents follow a fixed course, and would even crash full speed into the player car rather than deviate from that course, but did not feel this was a bad thing. He gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" was also pleased with the graphics, selection of vehicles, and numerous modes. He praised the game for being more accessible than most racers, allowing players to begin racing without having to figure out the car's technical aspects, though he also criticized it as being \"simplistic\". He scored it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding that \"There may not be a lot to it, but the graphics, playability, and selection of cars with their different qualities make it a title worthy of a look.\"\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" nominated \"Screamer\" as the best racing game of 2001, but ultimately gave the award to \"NASCAR Racing 4\".\n\nAn advertisement for the game, showing a burnt-out car wreckage with the slogan \"Every Christmas the roads are full of mad men.

The film's cast includes Bill Pullman, Andie MacDowell, Gabriel Byrne, Traci Lind, Rosalind Chao, and Loren Dean, among others. It also features a soundtrack marked with the signature sounds of Wenders regulars Jon Hassell, Ry Cooder, and Bono. The film was praised by a select few critics for its cinematography, but performed poorly in the box office. It was entered into the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe movie had a budget of $5 million, but only received $386,673 in its domestic box office.\n\nLike many other of Wenders' American movies, the film was shot in multiple locations, for instance the Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park and the Santa Monica Pier.\n\nA scene in the film shows a live recreation of the painting \"Nighthawks\" by Edward Hopper.\n\nMovie producer Mike Max meditates on the paranoia of fear of attack, in the movie business and life in general, as his wife Page announces she is leaving him. He receives a document via email from a NASA employee he met earlier at a conference. Before opening it he is kidnapped and almost killed, a scene captured by surveillance cameras and witnessed by computer scientist Ray Bering on surveillance footage scene in his laboratory at the Griffith Observatory. However, it soon turns out the two men have been shot, Max has escaped and now is accused of killing them. He takes shelter with, and goes to work for, the Mexican gardeners who find him and they help him investigate who is trying to kill him and why. Bering, who originally sent Max the email and recognized Max in the surveillance footage, has a conversation with an intelligence agent who makes it clear that anyone who gets in the way of a new “anti-crime” satellite surveillance program not yet approved by Congress will be dealt with terminally. Detective Dean Brock suspects Max is not a killer and on a tip meets with Bering, who is assassinated by a gunshot as they begin to speak. Max gives up his business and money to his wife and the movie ends as he meditates on how a real attack has freed him from paranoia.\n\n\n\"The End of Violence\" received some negative reviews from critics. It currently holds a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. Writing in Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston (critic) observed: \"Many of Wenders's best films have been road movies and \"Violence\" qualifies as one thanks to all the time the characters spend on L.A.'s freeways. Like Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\" (which it resembles in a lot of ways), it cleverly exploits its Southern California locale and offers a truly challenging analysis of American life.\"\n\n\n"}

Burns gathered together stand-up comics and a hypnotist by placing many ads in the \"Tokyo Classifieds\" (now called \"The Metropolis\"), calling for performers. The first show was held at the Tokyo American Club, and the second at the British Club in Ebisu, Tokyo. Roughly around the same time a separate group called the Tokyo Cynics started an all stand-up comedy show in the Takadanobaba area at a bar called The Fiddler.\n\nBy about 1998, Burns was no longer involved, and from that time up until the mid-2000s the group was run first by Nick Abrahams, then Michael Naishtut, who had been independently performing improv comedy in Tokyo, and Chris Wells, one of the founding members of TCS. Naishtut was also hosting the \"Tokyo Cynics\" shows, and the two groups were effectively merged. Around the same time, the name was changed to the \"Tokyo Comedy Store\".\n\nSince then, the Tokyo Comedy Store has held multiple shows every month at various venues. Venues come and go, and so over the year shows have come and gone, or moved locations, but there are usually between three and six shows running at any one time. Some shows involve stand-up, some involve improv, and some involve both. The cornerstone show is held on the last Friday of every month and features stand-up comedians in the first half. The second half of the show consists of entirely improvised comedy by \"Spontaneous Confabulation\" (known as \"Spontaneous Confusion\" until 2010), the resident improv troupe. The show usually ends with music-based improvisation.\n\nCurrently the titular head of the Tokyo Comedy Store is Chris Wells, who also runs the cornerstone show at the Crocodile live-house in Shibuya, attracting audiences of around 100, the vast majority of whom are non-Japanese. Other shows around Tokyo are organized by Dave Gutteridge, who since the early 2000s has been a show runner, performer, and administrator of the website.\n\nAt about the same time the Tokyo Comedy Store was first founded, Jun Imai started to teach improvisation classes for Japanese performers and stage improv performances as \"in the moment\". In 2004, he brought the In The Moment improv troupe to TCS and produced the first ITM + TCS shows, which were based entirely on improvised comedy. These became known as TCSj (Tokyo Comedy Store Japanese), and the group performed twice a month in the same venue as the English version through 2011. TCSj cut down on their shows in 2012, and now perform several times a year at the Crocodile and other venues. Although it features the same type of improvised scenes as the English show does, it has several different show formats with different casts. Currently TCSj has a cast of over 40 improvisors.\n\nA documentary film about the Tokyo Comedy Store was made and released on in 2008. The film is a narrative account of director Brian C. Anderson's experience performing with the stand-up comedians of the Tokyo Comedy Store. Anderson's film explores the differences between Eastern and Western styles of comedy, and showcases various acts he encounters as he progresses as a stand-up comedian in Tokyo. Anderson made the film while stationed overseas in the United States Air Force.\n\n"}

Although sometimes the utility pulls cable, he or she is more than just a cableperson. The utility is a jack of all trades, assisting in setting up, operating and maintaining the running order of equipment, often acting as a second boom operator, or even second mixer, and also repairing and servicing equipment such as cables and hardware as necessary. As both mixer and boom operator(s) may be busy with their tasks at any given time, the utility may also apply or adjust personal microphones or actors' wireless transmitters, may move microphones or assist in running cables, and may liaise with other departments on issues such as noise minimisation and set lockdown.\n\nA utility may start their career as some form of trainee and move on to utility as their competency increases, or may start as a utility if their experience and knowledge permits. Utilities typically move on to become boom operators or mixers themselves, taking over roles in the sound department previously held by their superiors. In studio based television production, the route for promotion from sound assistant is to sound technician/operator, and finally to sound supervisor. Formal qualifications are not specified for technicians in studio environments, although employers typically look for basic numeracy and literacy, and a solid foundation in maths and physics. Many applicants have A levels/H grades or have taken courses to certificate, diploma or degree level, such as ft2 (Freelance Film and Television Training). As the film and big budget narrative television industries are typically less corporate in nature than studio based television, utility technicians may have no training other than their experience from simply working in the sound department.\nA utility sound technician typical makes between $20-$60 an hour with overtime after 8 hours and double time after 12 hours. This varies depending on their exact role and production budget. Usually the production sound mixer will hire boom operator(s) and utility technicians that they know and trust, although one may be provided by the production in some cases.\n"}

By some definitions, a WOM is a memory device which can be written but never read. Initially there seemed to be no practical use for a memory circuit from which data could not be retrieved. The concept is still often used as a joke or a euphemism for a failed memory device. \n\nThe first use of the term is generally attributed to Signetics in 1972. Signetics published some \"write-only memory\" literature as the result of an inside practical joke, which is frequently referenced within the electronics industry, a staple of software engineering lexicons, and included in collections of the best hoaxes.\n\nThe datasheet was created \"as a lark\" by Signetics engineer John G 'Jack' Curtis and was inspired by a fictitious and humorous vacuum tube datasheet from the 1940s. It was seen as \"an icebreaker\" and was deliberately included in the Signetics catalog.\n\nRoy L Twitty, a Signetics PR person, released a tongue-in-cheek press release touting the WOM on April 1, 1973.\n\nInstead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 \"fully encoded, 9046×N, Random Access, write-only-memory\" data sheet included meaningless diagrams of \"bit capacity vs. Temp.\", \"Iff vs. Vff\", \"Number of pins remaining vs. number of socket insertions\", and \"AQL vs. selling price\". The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC V (vacuum tube filament) supply, a +10 V (double the V of standard TTL logic of the day), and V of 0±2% volt (i.e. ground). It was specified to run between 0 and −70°C.\n\nIn 1982, Apple published their official \"Apple IIe Reference Manual\" (part number A2L2005), which included two references to write-only memory:\n\nOn page 233:\n\nOn page 250:\n\nIn 1995 \"Computer Contradictionary\" book, it reports EWOM, or Erasable Write-Only Memory (an analogy of EPROM), a memory copyrighted by IBM (Irish Business Machines), which allows the data to be written into and then erased from, for memory re-use.\n\nWith the explosive growth of the amount of video data available both online and in private use, there emerged a common joke that video tapes and other video media are \"write only memory\", because without efficient means of search and retrieval for video data archives, very little is viewed after recording.\n\nThe 25120 WOM joined a family of equally-useless parts made before and since. These include the dark bulb, dark-emitting diode, WAS gate, and Inoperational Amplifier. Grandparents were the Umac 606 Infernal Anode Phantasatron and the Electrovoice Rearaxial Softspeaker. Note that the Phantastron (not Phantasatron) is a real, if obsolete, circuit for generating precision sawtooth waves.\n\n"}
