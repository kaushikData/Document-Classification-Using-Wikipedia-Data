Hofstadter describes an ambigram as a \"calligraphic design that manages to squeeze two different readings into the selfsame set of curves.\" Different ambigram artists (sometimes called \"ambigramists\") may create completely different ambigrams from the same word or words, differing in both style and form.\n\nThe earliest known non-natural ambigram dates to 1893 by artist Peter Newell. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of invertible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when turned upside down. The last page in his book \"Topsys & Turvys\" contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In \"Topsys & Turvys Number 2\" (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nThe Verbeek strip \"The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins\" used ambigrams in 3 consecutive strips in March,1904, but otherwise the format of this strip prevented the use of word balloons.\n\nFrom June to September, 1908, the British monthly \"The Strand\" published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"Curiosities\" column. Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words. Mitchell T. Lavin, whose \"chump\" was published in June, wrote, \"I think it is in the only word in the English language which has this peculiarity,\" while Clarence Williams wrote, about his \"Bet\" ambigram, \"Possibly B is the only letter of the alphabet that will produce such an interesting anomaly.\"\n\nIn 1969, Raymond Loewy designed the rotational NEW MAN ambigram logo, which is still in use today. The mirror ambigram DeLorean Motor Company logo was first used in 1975.\n\nJohn Langdon and Scott Kim also each believed that they had invented ambigrams in the 1970s. Langdon and Kim are probably the two artists who have been most responsible for the popularization of ambigrams. John Langdon produced the first mirror image logo \"Starship\" in 1975. Robert Petrick, who designed the invertible \"Angel\" logo in 1976, was also an early influence on ambigrams.\n\nThe earliest known published reference to the term \"ambigram\" was by Hofstadter, who attributed the origin of the word to conversations among a small group of friends during 1983–1984. The original 1979 edition of Hofstadter's \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" featured two 3-D ambigrams on the cover.\n\nAmbigrams became more popular as a result of Dan Brown incorporating John Langdon's designs into the plot of his bestseller, \"Angels & Demons\", and the DVD release of the \"Angels & Demons\" movie contains a bonus chapter called \"This is an Ambigram\". Langdon also produced the ambigram that was used for some versions of the book's cover. Brown used the name Robert Langdon for the hero in his novels as an homage to John Langdon.\n\nIn music, the Grateful Dead have used ambigrams several times, including on their albums \"Aoxomoxoa\" and \"American Beauty\".\n\nIn the first series of the British show \"Trick or Treat\", the show's host and creator Derren Brown uses cards with rotational ambigrams. These cards can read either 'Trick' or 'Treat'.\n\nAlthough the words spelled by most ambigrams are relatively short in length, one DVD cover for \"The Princess Bride\" movie creates a rotational ambigram out of two words: \"Princess Bride,\" whether viewed right side up or upside down.\n\nIn 2015 iSmart's logo on one of its travel chargers went viral because the brand's name turned out to be a natural ambigram that read \"+Jews!\" upside down. The company noted that \"...we learned a powerful lesson of what not to do when creating a logo.”\n<ref name=\"iSmart/Jews!\"></ref>\n\nAmbigrams are exercises in graphic design that play with optical illusions, symmetry and visual perception. Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their form and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no universal guidelines for creating ambigrams, and there are different ways of approaching problems. A number of books suggest methods for creation (including \"WordPlay\" and \"Eye Twisters\").\n\nComputerized methods to automatically create ambigrams have been developed. The earliest, the 'Ambimatic' created in 1996, was letter-based and used a database of 351 letter glyphs in which each letter was mapped to another. This generator could only map a word to itself or to another word that was the same length: because of this, most of the generated ambigrams were of poor quality.\nHowever, the Ambimatic has been almost completely taken down (it was available on Ambigram.com, but they deleted that site and it is now a redirect to FlipScript.com), it's only available as an app for Android. In 2007, software developer Mark Hunter developed the ambigram generator at FlipScript.com (and licensed to other companies). It uses a more complex method of creating ambigrams, with a database containing more than 5 million curves, and multiple lettering styles.\nIn 2016, software developer Saransh Kejriwal composed a tutorial on designing rotational ambigrams, wherein he demonstrated a technique to count the number of vertical lines in the individual letters of the word to find the point of symmetry of the ambigram, which he called the Line technique.\n\nAmbigrams have also been called, among other things:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53253", "title": "Balducci levitation", "text": "Balducci levitation\n\nThe Balducci levitation is a levitation illusion first described by Ed Balducci. Its inventor is unknown. It is an impromptu magic trick, which has been popularized by many magicians, such as David Roth, Paul Harris, and David Blaine.\n\nThe performer stands at an angle facing away from the spectators. The performer appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. The effect generally does not last for more than five seconds. The performer's feet return to the ground, and the effect is complete.\n\nOther methods of levitation allow for greater heights, longer durations, and better viewing angles (see definition of angles from List of conjuring terms) for performance; however, most of these methods can only be performed on a stage because they require special equipment or setups (such as wires). The Balducci levitation requires no preparation of any kind, and so it can be performed impromptu – anytime, anywhere. Although variations have been made to improve the illusion of genuine levitation, they are generally harder to perform, and some require gimmicks or setups that make them less practical than the Balducci levitation.\n\nLike many magic effects, this illusion relies mostly on subtle misdirection and acting on the part of the performer.\n\nThese psychological subtleties increase the probability that spectators will believe the illusion:\n\nThese physical subtleties make the levitation seem more amazing:\n\nThe effects of these subtleties can be seen in David Blaine's television performances of this illusion. For example, one spectator is asked how high Blaine levitated. She gestures a height that is obviously a few inches higher than the illusion is capable of producing, demonstrating that subtleties can often cause a spectator's interpretation of an effect to be better than the effect itself.\n\nThe magician positions himself at an angle to his audience, a little distance away, in such a way that the audience can only see the rearward portion of one foot and most of the other foot – concealing the toe end of the \"far\" (upstage) foot. The audience group must be small enough that they can be grouped close together. The magician, with the rearward portion of his feet held together, lifts the \"near\" foot off the ground, standing on only the front part of his \"far\" foot (the one which is partially concealed) while lifting the rearward part of the \"far\" foot and all of the \"near\" foot and keeping his ankles together. The audience sees only one foot and the heel of the other (the \"far\" foot), which appear to rise off the floor. The hidden part of the \"far\" (upstage) foot supports the weight of the magician as he appears to levitate one or two inches.\n\nSimply put: the magician stands on the front of one foot, while raising the one foot and the visible part of his other foot, blocking the view of the front of the supporting foot with the other foot and rear part of the supporting foot.\n\nThe \"reverse Balducci\" illusion is similar to the Balducci illusion, but the magician faces towards the audience at a 90-degree angle rather than facing away. The magician slowly stands on the heel of his \"far\" foot as he lifts his \"near\" foot and the front of the \"far\" foot. To improve the appearance of the effect, the magician will try to maintain the near foot parallel to the ground.\n\nAnother variation that is sometimes shown on TV shows is done by performing a normal \"Balducci\", filming the audience reaction, then later returning and performing the illusion with the aid of wires to get more height or to get a shot from the front or underneath. These shots will be edited into the footage of the original performance, thus allowing the levitation effect to be exaggerated, while still using genuine onlookers in the shot.\n\nThere is a principle in theatrical magic that \"the audience will often remember or describe an exaggerated effect\" – so the audience members may not notice the increased height caused by the \"faked second shot\" (if the additional height is not more than a few extra centimeters) when watching the combined footage later, believing that they are seeing a genuine recreation of the performance. This is even more likely if, during the original performance, cameras are positioned in the same place as those from which the \"faked\" footage was later shot.\n\nEd Balducci published the first known description of the illusion in July 1974 in \"The Pallbearer's Review\", (Volume 9, Number 9, pp 755) under the name \"Impromptu Levitation.\" Balducci ended his description by saying, \"Originator unknown. It was shown to me many years ago by one of the Harmonicats, a cousin of mine, Erwin Levine, known as the Baron.\"\n\nDespite Balducci's disclaimer, the illusion has since been known as the \"Balducci levitation\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25234447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25234447", "title": "Biograph girl", "text": "Biograph girl\n\nBiograph Girl was a phrase associated with two early-20th-century actresses, Florence Lawrence and Mary Pickford, who made black-and-white silent films with the Biograph Company. At that time, all studios refused to give actors on-screen film credit; they did not want them to gain public celebrity status and command higher salaries. This had already happened with stage actors, and the studios did not want to repeat the trend on film.\n\nBecause the actors were mainly anonymous, the public and news media began to call the popular actress Florence Lawrence the \"Biograph girl\". In 1910, Lawrence was lured away from Biograph by Carl Laemmle when he started his new Independent Motion Picture Company, known as IMP (he later founded Universal Studios in 1913). Laemmle wanted Lawrence to be his star attraction so he offered her more money ($250 a week) and marquee billing—something Biograph did not allow at the time. She signed on with him; Laemmle had rumors of her death circulated in the press and later took out advertisements criticizing the same rumors. This publicity, timed with the release of her first IMP film \"The Broken Oath\" (1910), made her a household name. She quickly became the first film star with celebrity status, and the first person to receive billing on the credits of her film. From then on, other actors slowly began to receive billing credit on film.\n\nAfter Lawrence left Biograph, Mary Pickford began gaining in popularity with the studio and was soon nicknamed the new \"Biograph Girl\" until she, too, received billing credits in her films.\n\nCoincidentally, both Lawrence and Pickford were both originally from Ontario, Canada; Pickford was from Toronto, and Lawrence from Hamilton. As well, both were raised by their mothers, as their fathers died within a week of each other (in unrelated accidents) in February 1898. \n"}

Avatar also publishes an associated magazine, \"Bleeding Cool\".\n\nBleeding Cool has a reputation within the industry for spreading previously secretive information far and wide. John Cunningham, VP Content Strategy at DC Entertainment, told DC All Access presenter Tiffany Smith on stage at San Diego Comic-Con, on whether she could reveal some information, \"It was on Bleeding Cool this morning. The whole world knows.\" In 2015 Marvel Senior Vice President of Publishing and Executive Editor Tom Brevoort referred to Bleeding Cool when talking about the revelation that Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter had personally intervened to cancel the Fantastic Four comics in his dispute with Fox Studios, saying \"Seriously, if there wasn't a website stirring all of this stuff up, can you honestly say that you would even have noticed anything here?\"\n\nAmong Bleeding Cool's features are a power list detailing the most influential people in the comics industry.\n\nIn 2012, Bleeding Cool was the first to report on sexual harassment accusations leveled against DC Comics editor Eddie Berganza, beginning with an incident at WonderCon in Anaheim, California. Though that initial article was a blind item that did not name the victim or accused, four years later, Bleeding Cool named Berganza when it accused him of sexual harassment, and detailed how he had risen in the ranks at DC even after the accusations became known to his employers. This was followed by a November 2017 BuzzFeed report on accusations leveled against Berganza by several women that led to his termination from DC.\n\nIn November 2017, Bleeding Cool broke the story that writer/editor C.B. Cebulski, who had recently been promoted to Editor in Chief of Marvel Comics, had written a number of Japanese-themed stories for Marvel in 2003 and 2004 under the pseudonym Akira Yoshida, which led to accusations of cultural appropriation, yellowfacing, and \"Orientalist profiteering\".\n\nBleeding Cool was nominated for the \"Favourite Comics Related Website\" Eagle Award in 2010 and 2011 and won in 2012.

The game was released on January 29, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release dates to be announced later. The game runs on Unreal Engine 3.\n\nThe game allows the player to control Shelly \"Bombshell\" Harrison, a Colonel in the Global Defense Force. Her career is abruptly brought to an end after an event titled \"the Washington Incident\", which caused her to lose her arm and her team. Shelly is then offered a new contract by a private military contractor and offered a second chance and a new mechanical arm.\n\nThe game was conceived during Gearbox Software's lawsuit against Interceptor regarding the video game \"Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction\". Interceptor was working on the game for the PlayStation 4 and PC, however due to a lawsuit by Gearbox Software, the game's name was changed to \"Bombshell\" and the main character was changed to Shelly Harrison who was originally meant to play a supporting role in the Duke Nukem game. In April 2014, a website NoGumNeeded.com was launched by Interceptor Entertainment that showed a countdown. The game was revealed with the title \"Bombshell\" in development for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on May 14, 2014 along with a trailer and was scheduled to be released in 2015. Some details about the gameplay and the protagonist Shelly \"Bombshell\" Harrison were revealed in the announcement. It was also announced that the game utilised the Unreal Engine and it will launch with modding tools. Due to the negative reception to the trailer, 3D Realms started the development of the game from scratch. The gameplay trailer was released on March 2, 2015 during Game Developers Conference. The E3 2015 trailer was released on June 25, 2015. On July 23, a ten-minute long video showing gameplay of the game was released during QuakeCon 2015. On August 27, a game trailer of the boss battle against \"Zeroth Guardian\" was released during PAX Prime 2015. In January 2016, the game's voice cast was announced, including Valerie Arem as Bombshell and Duke Nukem voice actor Jon St. John as Professor Jadus Heskel. The release of the Windows version of the game was delayed to January 29, 2016 so as to give additional time for the developer to fix bugs.\n\nGameSpot awarded it a score of 2.0 out of 10, calling it a \"buggy, bland game with some of the worst writing you’re likely to hear in some time.\" Hardcore Gamer rated the game a 2 out of 5 saying \"What once began as something that had potential to become a so-stupid-it's-awesome classic ended up being merely... well, it isn't even really that stupid as a whole, just dull.\" PC Gamer awarded it 30%, saying \"An [action role-playing game] with weak combat and too many bugs, \"Bombshell\" isn't worth your click-click-clicks.\" IGN rated the game 6.9 out of 10 saying the game \"\"Bombshell\" is a fast-paced, energetic, deliberately absurd action shooter that's mostly competent at everything it tries to do\". Leo Espada of GoneWithTheWin rated it 6/10 and stated, \"Bombshell features a solid core of combat mechanics, visual design, and a genius soundtrack. It is light on the RPG side, with little depth to sink your teeth into\". It has a score of 44% on Metacritic.\n\nA prequel for Harrison's story, entitled \"Ion Maiden\" is in development by Voidpoint and a demo preview of it was released in 2018 by 3D Realms.

It was conceived as an unofficial installment in the \"Chrono\" series, set between the events of \"Chrono Trigger\" and its sequel \"Chrono Cross\".\n\nThe game, as a ROM hack, runs on the \"Chrono Trigger\" game engine and has gameplay similar to the original. It is based five years after the events of \"Chrono Trigger\" and features all the playable characters from the original game, who come together across different time periods to fight an enemy attempting to change the past. The plot includes elements from both official games. \"Crimson Echoes\" concludes by setting up several plot points that were used in \"Chrono Cross\".\n\nThe project was in development from 2004–09, with 98% of the game completed. The game reportedly totaled around 35 hours of play time, and had ten alternate endings. A few weeks prior to the expected released date, Square Enix sent the developers a cease-and-desist letter for knowingly violating Square Enix's intellectual property, which led to the cancellation of the project. This cancellation was widely reported in the gaming press, who were largely sympathetic to the project. Despite its cancellation, versions of the game ranging from an alpha to a release candidate have since been leaked onto the internet and can be played through to the end.\n\nAs \"Crimson Echoes\" runs on the \"Chrono Trigger\" game engine, the gameplay is similar to that of the original title. Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. Each character and enemy has a certain number of hit points that are reduced by successful attacks and can be restored through potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. It also uses the Active Time Battle 2.0 system from the first game. The game features new maps, graphics and sprites. New minigames were designed to reward players with items and equipment, including a \"Coliseum\" battle mode based on that of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and a casino featuring luck-based games.\n\n\"Crimson Echoes\" features all the playable characters of the original game, and is set five years after the events of \"Chrono Trigger\". Crono and Marle are junior regents of the Kingdom of Guardia; Lucca continues her scientific endeavors. The three struggle to ease tensions with Porre, which has modernized its military and seeks to end Guardia's economic hegemony. Frog lives in 605 A.D., restored to his human form, though this was not implemented before the cease and desist letter. Magus searches for Schala in the still-frozen 11,995 B.C., and feuds with Dalton, obsessed with finding artifacts from the lost Kingdom of Zeal. Ayla dwells in 64,999,995 B.C., and has given birth to her tribe's successor. Robo assists the Guru of Reason, Belthasar, who has established a clandestine temporal research facility named Chronopolis in 2305 A.D. Belthasar claims it will be a guardian of time to ensure a threat such as Lavos will never arise. He nonetheless harbors darker wishes to leave a grand legacy in history, and is almost recklessly pragmatic. He fixes the Epoch during the story's course, which returns as the Neo-Epoch (akin to its design in \"Chrono Cross\").\n\nThe main villain of \"Crimson Echoes\" is King Zeal, revived by Lavos through the Frozen Flame. Confused and saddened by the loss of his kingdom, he is easily manipulated by Lavos, who uses him to attempt revenge on Crono and his friends. He later learns of his deception, and seeks to dominate Lavos and recreate his kingdom through unmatched temporal power. While under Lavos's influence, he recruits Dalton and Kasmir to his cause. Kasmir is an illusionist who served under Magus in the Mystic War. King Zeal gives him the Masamune, and he assumes leadership of the Mystics after 600 A.D. Other foes come from the Reptite timeline, an alternate universe temporarily brought into existence by King Zeal's meddling. They number the Dragon God—a Reptite artificial intelligence created in an alternate timeline—and the Xamoltan time travelers, who were used by King Zeal and survive into the restored human world. The party also visit 1 A.D., the era of the founding of Guardia. There, they meet Cedric the Executor, the ruthless first King of Guardia, as well as Antaeus, the ancestor of Porre.\n\nThe game begins as Crono, Marle, and Lucca attend a political meeting between the Kingdom of Guardia and Porre. An assassin attacks; the party pursues him to the Denadoro Mts., where Lucca's prototype Time Egg backfires and sends them to the future. They find Belthasar there, who has established a research facility called Chronopolis. He warns of a new threat to the timeline, and sends the party to the Ocean Palace ruins of 11,995 B.C. to investigate. They find Magus, still searching for Schala and feuding with Dalton. They confront a mysterious villain who resurrects Schala and robs the early Masamune, still embedded in the husk of the Mammon Machine. Its theft changes history, causing the Mystics' war in the Middle Ages to drag on another 50 years, led by the illusionist Kasmir. The party retrieve Frog (named Glenn in \"Crimson Echoes\") from 605 A.D. and meet with Belthasar.\n\nHe explains the mysterious villain was King Zeal, somehow alive and in possession of the Frozen Flame, a shard of Lavos with incredible powers. Melchior takes up residence in Chronopolis to aid the fight against him. The party goes to 64,999,995 B.C. to find the Dragon's Tooth, an enchanted totem that will assist Chronopolis. King Zeal confronts them at the old Lavos impact crater, scattering them through time and unleashing the \"Atash Kedah\", a destructive spell that changes history. Marle awakens in 1 A.D. to discover Reptites have survived the long ice age, and war with humanity for control of the planet. Lucca and Robo arrive in 2305 A.D., awaking in the midst of a futuristic Reptite civilization. They ally with rebellious, sentient robots and venture to Dinopolis, the equivalent of Chronopolis in this timeline. They destroy the Vision Serpent, an artificial intelligence created to administrate the world. Crono, Magus, and Glenn awaken in 1005 A.D., and assault the earlier Dinopolis, where Reptite time travelers from 2305 A.D. have come to conduct research on the past. The party use the temporal technology in place to return to 64,999,995 B.C. and stop the Atash Kedah spell, restoring the human timeline.\n\nMarle awakens in 1 A.D. once more, this time witnessing her ancestor, Cedric Guardia, brutally unify the world with the Frozen Flame. A ubiquitous agent from Chronopolis—code-named 12—brings her back to the future. The party learn that the Reptite time travelers—named Cakulha, Coyopa, and Yaluk—survived the human world's restoration, and had been manipulated by King Zeal. The party fix the Mystic War by retrieving the Masamune from Kasmir and putting it back in antiquity. In 1005 A.D., new diplomatic talks are about to begin. Porre instead launches an assault, backed by King Zeal and Dalton, placed in Porre's high command by the king. King Guardia dies in the attack. The party venture to 11,995 B.C. once more with Schala, intent on striking the Frozen Flame in antiquity to lure out King Zeal. This unleashes wild energies, and the party must overcome individual mental assaults by the Flame. King Zeal retreats, and the energies cause Schala to fall into the Darkness Beyond Time, a temporal netherworld. Unsuccessful, the party seek out Gaspar tens of millions of years in the past (known as the Dreamtime), where he's gone to witness the birth of the planet's consciousness. King Zeal attacks them there; Crono falls near the rifts of the forming planet and is partly infused with its natal awareness. The party learn that King Zeal's ultimate goal is to resurrect the Kingdom of Zeal in 11,995 B.C.\n\nThe party return to antiquity and defeat Dalton. King Zeal nears the fruition of his plan, but Melchior and Belthasar enter the time period to dissuade him. King Zeal leaves the Sun Stone, the trigger for the revival of Zeal, with a follower and walks to the North Cape. He reveals that Lavos survived defeat in \"Chrono Trigger\" and clung to life in the Darkness Beyond Time. He used the Frozen Flame to revive King Zeal, manipulating him to take revenge on the heroes. He is now merging with Schala, as he has done with all the other \"Arbiters\" who have used the Frozen Flame throughout history. Lavos calls King Zeal, intending to merge with him as well and evolve to become the Dream Devourer (as seen in \"Chrono Trigger DS\"). The party convince Zeal's followers not to activate the Sun Stone, and pursue Zeal to the Darkness Beyond Time. King Zeal confronts them once more, revealing his will is stronger than that of Lavos; he'll merge, but become the dominant personality within the Dream Devourer and create a new Zeal using its vast power. The party defeat him and return to Chronopolis. They notice the planet's Gates are closing again, and depart to their homes, promising to stay in touch. Belthasar meanwhile reveals he has the Frozen Flame, which activates and informs him that Lavos is still alive and will become the Time Devourer, the enemy of \"Chrono Cross\". It challenges Belthasar to a grand game, and he begins drawing up plans for Project Kid. The game closes with King Zeal, shown to be alive and imprisoned by Magus in 11,995 B.C., who forces him to teach advanced temporal magic.\n\nThe \"Crimson Echoes\" project was launched by ZeaLitY in 2004. The development team, dubbed Kajar Laboratories, primarily consisted of members of the \"Chrono\" fansite Chrono Compendium. The team was led by a game director, Agent 12, and two co-directors, ZeaLitY and Chrono'99. To create a story that was compatible with \"Chrono Trigger\" and \"Chrono Cross\", the team took full advantage of the Chrono Compendium's encyclopedia and the fandom's knowledge and analysis of the series.\n\nThe game took the form of a ROM hack of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of \"Chrono Trigger\". It was coded using \"Chrono Trigger\" ROM editing software, and was meant to be played on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. The finished game was intended to be released as a patch file in the IPS (International Patching System) format, so as to avoid illegal distribution of a full \"Chrono Trigger\" ROM.\n\nThe project lasted four and a half years, with a planned release date of May 31, 2009. However, Square Enix sent ZeaLitY and Agent 12 a cease-and-desist letter on May 8, 2009 for trademark and copyright infringement, ordering that the team stop development and cancel all ROM hacking activities, including translation and distribution of all their other projects that were in progress or already released. The letter noted that ZeaLitY and Agent 12 risked being sued for \"up to $150,000 per work\" in damages. At the time of the cancellation, the game was \"around 98% complete\"; it allegedly featured 23 story chapters adding up to roughly 35 hours of gameplay and ten alternate endings.\n\nShortly after the project received the cease and desist letter, an alpha version of the patch was leaked on the internet. ZeaLitY expressed his disapproval and embarrassment on the Crimson Echoes website, noting that the alpha version was extremely buggy and lacked many of the improvements made in the beta version. In January 2011, a more complete beta version was leaked which could be played from beginning to end, believed to be the final build of the project prior to cancellation. Also, \"Chrono Trigger: Flames of Eternity\" was forked from an Crimson Echoes around 2010 with the aim to fully complete the game's development, switching from using the earlier version as a base to the latest released version. Development was ongoing until June 2017.\n\nKajar Laboratories complied with the cease-and-desist letter and all traces of \"Crimson Echoes\" were removed from the Chrono Compendium. CNET senior associate editor Eric Franklin noted that it was \"sad to see four and a half years of work go spinning down the drain\", stating: \"I feel for the fans who were anticipating this.\" 1UP.com called the project \"ambitious,\" noting that \"This wasn't just some fly-by-night hack.\" Earnest Cavalli, from Wired, stated: \"I fully understand Square Enix's desire to protect its properties, but that doesn't make this any less depressing. The game looked quite good (if obviously derivative).\" The project's cancellation was also reported by gaming journalists in the Netherlands, France, and Japan. In February 2010, GamesRadar included the game in an article about the \"10 fan games that shouldn't be ceased or desisted\".\n\nKeith Stuart, from \"The Guardian\", pointed out the contrast between Square Enix's policy and that of companies like Valve, which officially adopted the \"Half-Life\" fan mods \"Counter-Strike\" and \"Day of Defeat\", and Vivendi Universal Games, which granted a licence to the \"King's Quest\" fan game \"The Silver Lining\". He noted that since \"Crimson Echoes\" was a ROM hack, it was in a \"trickier area of copy protection law\" than those other projects, but felt that its release would have had next to no commercial impact since the game was to be distributed as an IPS patch rather than a ROM image. Finally, he noted that an official port of the fangame to the Nintendo DS or WiiWare would have had more \"marketing benefits\" for Square Enix.\n\n"}

Julie Hamelin, because of her important contribution to the company, is also considered as one of the cofounders.\n\nSince 2004, Cirque Éloize' headquarters and creation studio are located in Old Montreal, inside the former Dalhousie Station, a historical building where the National circus school of Montreal was based from 1989 to 2003, and also where the company's founders studied.\n\nCirque Éloize creates shows destined for indoor tours and sometimes for the big top. At other times, it creates custom shows for the Dalhousie Station, or for client chosen venues.\n\nCirque Éloize has carried out more than 5 000 performances in over 550 cities and 50 countries. Its repertoire is composed of 15 key shows, and it has performed in excess of 1 600 custom-made shows across the world. The company has reached more than 3 million spectators.\n\nThe company has roughly a hundred employees spread between its headquarters, tour shows and special international events.\n\n\"Éloize\" means \"heat lightning\" in Acadian French (\"éclair de chaleur\" in Standard French). The word appears to come from Saintongese language (of western France), but has appeared at least once (spelled \"eloise\") in a book written by Montaigne in classical French.\n\nIt is used in Acadia and in the Magdalen Islands; islands from which the artists of the first Cirque Éloize troupe were all natives of. The thunderbolt depicts their acrobatic and spectacular side and the heat, their humanity that wishes to touch the heart and soul.\n\nDaniel Cyr, cofounder of Cirque Éloize, invented the Cyr Wheel and popularized it by obtaining a silver medal with his act at the Festival mondial du cirque de demain in 2003. The Cyr Wheel has since then been present in the majority of Cirque Éloize' creations. Having become an entire discipline of its own, the technique is now taught in many professional schools and used by numerous artists from various countries.\n\nCirque Éloize designs, creates and produces tailored concepts and events for corporate, private or governmental clients in its Dalhousie Station venues, and across the world. More than 1 600 custom-made events have been carried around the globe, in varying contexts and locations.\n\nIn 2006, Cirque Éloize collaborated in the Turin Winter Olympic Games Closing Ceremony, in 2012, in the inauguration of the Jaeger-Lecoultre boutique at Place Vendôme Paris. and in 2016, in l'Heure Bleue, an exclusive show presented all summer long as part of Montreal city's 375th anniversary festivities. Cirque Éloize was a featured company at the first edition of the Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque in 2015. Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal will present an outdoor event along with Cirque Eloize in August 2018 based on symphonic suite Scheherazade.\n\nStaged by Emmanuel Guillaume, \"Hotel\", is Cirque Éloize' 25th anniversary creation. The premiere will take place at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in August 2018.\n\nNezha tells the story of a young orphan abandoned on a mysterious island. Rightful heir of the Red Flags, she will have to face her destiny to become, in her own way, the most fearsome pirate of all time.\n\nThis family-friendly show, staged by Frédéric Bélanger, combines dance, acrobatics, martial arts and visual projections under the roof of an exterior amphitheater. Presented at the Shawinigan Cité de l'Énergie, Nezha is Cirque Éloize' first semi-permanent show. It premiered on July 5, 2018.\n\nInspired by the Far West's heritage, Saloon is animated by an original score written and produced by Éloi Painchaud, including excerpts from Patsy Cline and Johnny Cash classics. Throughout the comedy infused chapters, 11 artists, three of which are musicians, bring the western age back to life with the help of dance, song and acrobatics.\n\nThe canadian premiere of the show took place at the St-Tite Western Festival in 2016.\n\nSaloon's staging is done by Emmanuel Guillaume, scenography and accessories by Francis Farley, lighting by Francis Hamel, costumes by Sarah Balleux, choreography by Annie St-Pierre, soundscape by Colin Gagné and makeup by Virginie Bachand.\n\nCreated in 2012, \"Cirkopolis\" is a show staged by Jeannot Painchaud and the choreographer Dave St-Pierre. Cirkopolis inspires itself from the aesthetics of the Fritz Lang film, \"Metropolis\". The scenographer, Robert Massicotte, videographer, Alexis Laurence, costume creator, Liz Vandal, lighting designer, Nicolas Descôteaux, acrobatics designer, Krzysztof Soroczynski and the composer Stéphan Boucher are the other main creators of the show. On stage, 11 artists defy monotony and push the limits imposed by a mill town with lashes of absurd comedy, animated chaos and bursts of colors.\n\nCirkopolis became, in 2018, the first show in Saudi Arabia to present women on stage in front of an audience composed both of men and women.\n\n2014 : Drama Desk Awards, NY, USA\n\n\nStaged by Jeannot Painchaud, \"iD\" unites cicrus arts with urban dances such as B-boying, breakdancing and hip-hop. The scenographer, Robert Massicotte, videographer, Alexis Laurence, costume designer, Linda Brunelle, lighting designer, Nicolas Descôteaux, acrobatics designer Krzysztof Soroczynski and the composers, Jean-Phi Goncalves and Alex McMahon, are the other main creators of the show. 15 artists were present on stage, exploring a total of 13 different acrobatic disciplines.\n\nIn July 2010, iD is presented as the opening show for the first Montréal Complètement Cirque festival. Seen by million of spectators, in October 2016 iD celebrates its thousandth performance in London.\n\n2010 : Montreal Arts Council\n\n\nLe Music-Hall de la Baronne was created in collaboration with the Montréal Complètement Cirque Festival. Staged by Denis Bouchard, the cabaret type show was presented in Montreal during the Montreal Complètement Cirque festival in July 2013.\n\nWritten and staged by Daniele Finzi Pasca, this Cirque Éloize and Teatro Sunil coproduction is the last chapter of the Trilogie du Ciel (Nomade, Rain, Nebbia). Signifying \" fog \" in italian, the show broaches the dream and imaginary world.\n\nNebbia was designed by the same creative team as the two previous shows.\n\nCreated in 2004, \"Rain – comme une pluie dans tes yeux\" is the second chapter of the Trilogie du Ciel. Produced by Cirque Éloize and staged by Daniele Finzi Pasca, the show addresses the themes of childhood, freedom and family and is animated by an original staging where contemporary circus arts, theatre, music and dance intertwine. RAIN gives an exhibition of various circus disciplines: jugglery, banquine, Russian bar, clown, Cyr wheel, teeterboard, tightrope, contortion, aerial silk and hoop. Twelve artists from all corners of the world each embody their own character on stage, thus revealing their personal sensitivity and fragility.\n\nRAIN has cumulated more than 980 performances and traveled across 179 cities and 20 countries. RAIN presents an original soundtrack composed by Maria Bonzanigo and Lucie Cauchon, costumes designed by Mérédith Caron, a scenography by Guillaume Lord and lighting by Martin Labrecque.\n\n2006 : Drama Desk Awards, NY, USA\n\n\n2005 : Association de gestion théâtrale\n\n\n2005: In review – San Francisco Chronicle Theater Robert Hurwitt\n\n\nTYPO is a show produced by Cirque Éloize, staged and performed by Jamie Adkins.\n\nCreated in 2002 and staged by Daniele Finzi Pasca, Nomade\" – La nuit, ciel est plus grand] –, is Cirque Éloize' fourth creation and the first chapter of the Trilogie du Ciel. In this show, song, music, dance and acrobatics are used to discuss the vagabond spirit of man and his quest for adventure. The trip is carried out from dusk until dawn to create infinite possibilities; at night, the sky is endless.\n\nLucie Cauchon's compositions are inspired by tzigane music, a reference that transpires and influences the theatricality. The costumes, by Mérédith Caron, are simple or sumptuous depending on the scene and participate in an aesthetic dominated by a certain sobriety, just like Martin Labrecque's lighting and Guillaume Lord's scenography.\n\nNOMADE was presented in multiple theaters and international festivals, surpassing 700 total performance.\n\nIn 2007, it represented the province of Quebec and dominated the billboard for three weeks during the Universal Forum of Cultures in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\n2005: Gémeaux Awards\n\n\n2005: Gemini Awards\n\n\n2006: Yorkton short film Festival\n\n\nIn 1999, on the initiative of the Lanaudière International Festival, Cirque Éloize produced \"Cirque Orchestra\", its third creation.\n\nSharing the stage with a symphonic orchestra, this production meshed circus arts, contemporary dance and classical music, under an Alain Francoeur stage production.\n\nCirque Orchestra tells the story of a dissident musician that leaves his orchestra to join a world of fantasy where he wishes to learn to fly.\n\n2003: Gemini Awards\n\n\n2003: Gémeaux Awards\n\n\n\"Excentricus\" is Cirque Éloize' second creation. This show's success, which united numerous scenic arts, can be summed up in four words: heart, warmth, talent and generosity. Far from the predictable parade of circus performances, the 17 artists – acrobats, jugglers, comedians, trapeze artists and musicians – storm the stage to evolve in a rich and subtle tango of emotions.\n\nAcclaimed by the public and critics, \"Excentricus\" was presented over 500 times in performance venues all over the world as well as in prestigious international scenic arts festivals such as the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, the Israël Festival in Jerusalem, the Hong Kong Festival in China, the Iberoamericano Teatro Festival of Bogota in Colombia and the Recklinghausen Festival in Germany. The show was also performed in many parts of United States through the Performing Arts Center network and the National Scenes network in France.\n\n2002: Gémeaux Awards\n\n\nCirque Éloize is the troupe's first show, at the time composed of seven madelinot artists who were still students of the National Circus School: Jeannot Painchaud, Daniel Cyr, Jano Chiasson, Robert Bourgeois, Damien Boudreau, Sylvette Boudreau et Alain Boudreau.\n\nCombining dance and acrobatics, the show is created in the Station Dalhousie spaces, in Montreal, and then presented in the Magdalen Islands on the 11th and 12 August 1993 in the context of CFIM's 10th anniversary, a local community radio.\n\nThree version of the eponymous show would be created between 1991 and 1994. The first two would be made as part of a collective work involving all the artists in the process, under the direction of Jeannot Painchaud and with Catherine Archambault in care of staging and choreographies. Pierre Boileau joins the team for the third version's staging which would lead the troupe to its first major breakthrough in the american market. The inauguration of the New Victory Theater on the 42nd street on Broadway, followed by a three week series of representations, thereby marking the beginning of a grand journey.\n\nIn 2003, Cirque Éloize created the first circus arts festival in America: La Semaine des Arts du Cirque. Taking place in the Magdalen Islands, three summer editions of the festival were produced in total. Cirque Éloize is also cofounder of the Montréal Complètement Cirque festival.\n\nIn 2006, the company created the Éloize Foundation which has a three-fold mission: promote social reintegration of youth in difficulty, encourage youth to pursue superior or specialized studies and to contribute in the development of scenic arts. Artcirq, an organisation putting its passion for circus at the service of Inuit youth, is based in Igloolik, Nunavut, Canada, and is the first group to benefit from this support.\n\nCirque Éloize and Zone3 worked in collaboration during the production of \"La Vie Est Un Cirque's\" four seasons. Broadcast in 2012, the series \"La Vie Est Un Cirque's\" IV was nominated at the Gémeaux Awards in the Best Variety or Scenic Arts Serie category (Michel Bissonnette, Louise Jobin, André Larin, Vincent Leduc, Brigitte Lemonde, Zone3) as well as in the Best Photographic or Lighting Direction category under comedy and all varieties category (Jean Amyot, Zone3) for its \" L'évolution du Tango \" episode. The serie was shot in Cirque Éloize' studio, which was also in charge of the artistic direction, casting and staging of the six episodes.\n\nUnder the invitation of the Chief Director and Curator, Nathalie Bondil, Jeannot Painchaud is chosen as one of the 20 artists participating in the \"Big Bang : carte blanche à la créativité\" exposition which was presented at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts from November 6, 2011 to January 22, 2012.\n\nIn 2014, Jeannot Painchaud was responsible for the artistic direction of the \"Paris en Scène 1889-1914\" exposition, presented from June 2013 until February 2014 at the Musée de la civilisation of Quebec. \"Paris en scène 1889-1914\" earned the Prix Excellence — Groupe institutionnel 1 attributed by the Société des musées québécois (SMQ).\n\n"}

{"id": "8192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8192", "title": "Detective fiction", "text": "Detective fiction\n\nDetective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective—either professional, amateur or retired—investigates a crime, often murder. The detective genre began around the same time as speculative fiction and other genre fiction in the mid-nineteenth century and has remained extremely popular, particularly in novels. Some of the most famous heroes of detective fiction include C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot. Juvenile stories featuring The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and The Boxcar Children have also remained in print for several decades.\n\nSome scholars, such as R. H. Pfeiffer, have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of (the Protestant Bible locates this story within the apocrypha), the account told by two witnesses broke down when Daniel cross-examines them. In response, author Julian Symons has argued that \"those who search for fragments of detection in the Bible and Herodotus are looking only for puzzles\" and that these puzzles are not detective stories. In the play \"Oedipus Rex\" by Ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, the protagonist discovers the truth about his origins after questioning various witnesses. Although \"Oedipus's enquiry is based on supernatural, pre-rational methods that are evident in most narratives of crime until the development of Enlightenment thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\", this narrative has \"all of the central characteristics and formal elements of the detective story, including a mystery surrounding a murder, a closed circle of suspects, and the gradual uncovering of a hidden past.\"\n\nThe oldest known example of a detective story was \"The Three Apples\", one of the tales narrated by Scheherazade in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"). In this story, a fisherman discovered a heavy, locked chest along the Tigris river, which he then sold to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid. When Harun broke open the chest, he discovered the body of a young woman who had been cut into pieces. Harun then orders his vizier, Ja'far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and to find the murderer within three days, or be executed if he fails in his assignment. Suspense is generated through multiple plot twists that occur as the story progressed. WIth these characteristics this may be considered an archetype for detective fiction.\n\nThe main difference between Ja'far (\"The Three Apples\") and later fictional detectives, such as Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, is that Ja'far has no actual desire to solve the case. The whodunit mystery is solved when the murderer himself confessed his crime. This in turn lead to another assignment in which Ja'far has to find the culprit who instigated the murder within three days or else be executed. Ja'far again fails to find the culprit before the deadline, but owing to chance, he discovers a key item. In the end, he manages to solve the case through reasoning in order to prevent his own execution.\n\nGong'an fiction (, literally：\"case records of a public law court\") is the earliest known genre of Chinese detective fiction.\n\nSome well-known stories include the Yuan Dynasty story \"Circle of Chalk\" (Chinese: 灰闌記), the Ming Dynasty story collection \"Bao Gong An\" (Chinese: 包公案) and the 18th century \"Di Gong An\" (Chinese: 狄公案) story collection. The latter was translated into English as \"Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee\" by Dutch sinologist Robert Van Gulik, who then used the style and characters to write the original Judge Dee series.\n\nThe hero/detective of these novels was typically a traditional judge or similar official based on historical personages such as Judge Bao (Bao Qingtian) or Judge Dee (Di Renjie). Although the historical characters may have lived in an earlier period (such as the Song or Tang dynasty) most stories are written in the later Ming or Qing Dynasty period.\n\nThese novels differ from the Western style tradition in several points as described by Van Gulik:\n\nVan Gulik chose \"Di Gong An\" to translate because in his view it was closer to the Western literary style and more likely to appeal to non-Chinese readers.\n\nOne notable fact is that a number of Gong An works may have been lost or destroyed during the Literary Inquisitions and the wars in ancient China. Moreover, in the traditional Chinese culture, this genre was low-prestige, and therefore was less worthy of preservation than works such as philosophy or poetry. Only little or incomplete case volumes can be found; for example, the only copy of Di Gong An was found at a second-hand book store in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of detective fiction in Western Literature is Voltaire's \"Zadig\" (1748), which features a main character who performs feats of analysis. \"Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams\" (1794) by William Godwin portrays the law as protecting the murderer and destroying the innocent. Thomas Skinner Sturr's anonymous \"Richmond, or stories in the life of a Bow Street officer\" was published in London in 1827; the Danish crime story \"The Rector of Veilbye\" by Steen Steensen Blicher was written in 1829; and the Norwegian crime novel \"Mordet paa Maskinbygger Roolfsen\" (\"The Murder of Engine Maker Roolfsen\") by Maurits Hansen was published in December 1839.\n\n\"Das Fräulein von Scuderi\" is an 1819 short story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, in which Mlle de Scudery establishes the innocence of the police's favorite suspect in the murder of a jeweller. This story is sometimes cited as the first detective story and as a direct influence on Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841). Also suggested as a possible influence on Poe is ‘The Secret Cell’, a short story published in September 1837 by William Evans Burton. It has been suggested that this story may have been known to Poe, who in 1839 worked for Burton. The story was about a London policeman who solves the mystery of a kidnapped girl. Burton’s fictional detective relied on practical methods such as dogged legwork, knowledge of the underworld and undercover surveillance, rather than brilliance of imagination or intellect.\n\nDetective fiction in the English-speaking world is considered to have begun in 1841 with the publication of Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", featuring \"the first fictional detective, the eccentric and brilliant C. Auguste Dupin\". When the character first appeared, the word detective did not even exist. However, the character's name, \"Dupin\", originated from the English word dupe or deception. Poe devised a \"plot formula that's been successful ever since, give or take a few shifting variables.\" Poe followed with further Auguste Dupin tales: \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" in 1843 and \"The Purloined Letter\" in 1845.\n\nPoe referred to his stories as \"tales of ratiocination\". In stories such as these, the primary concern of the plot is ascertaining truth, and the usual means of obtaining the truth is a complex and mysterious process combining intuitive logic, astute observation, and perspicacious inference. \"Early detective stories tended to follow an investigating protagonist from the first scene to the last, making the unravelling a practical rather than emotional matter.\" \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" is particularly interesting because it is a barely fictionalized account based on Poe's theory of what happened to the real-life Mary Cecilia Rogers.\n\nÉmile Gaboriau was a pioneer of the detective fiction genre in France. In \"Monsieur Lecoq\" (1868), the title character is adept at disguise, a key characteristic of detectives. Gaboriau's writing is also considered to contain the first example of a detective minutely examining a crime scene for clues.\nAnother early example of a whodunit is a subplot in the novel \"Bleak House\" (1853) by Charles Dickens. The conniving lawyer Tulkinghorn is killed in his office late one night, and the crime is investigated by Inspector Bucket of the Metropolitan police force. Numerous characters appeared on the staircase leading to Tulkinghorn's office that night, some of them in disguise, and Inspector Bucket must penetrate these mysteries to identify the murderer. Dickens also left a novel unfinished at his death, \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\".\nDickens's protégé, Wilkie Collins (1824–1889)—sometimes referred to as the \"grandfather of English detective fiction\"—is credited with the first great mystery novel, \"The Woman in White\". T. S. Eliot called Collins's novel \"The Moonstone\" (1868) \"the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels... in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe\", and Dorothy L. Sayers called it \"probably the very finest detective story ever written\". \"The Moonstone\" contains a number of ideas that have established in the genre several classic features of the 20th century detective story:\n\nAlthough \"The Moonstone\" is usually seen as the first detective novel, there are other contenders for the honor. A number of critics suggest that the lesser known \"Notting Hill Mystery\" (1862–63), written by the pseudonymous \"Charles Felix\" (later identified as Charles Warren Adams), preceded it by a number of years and first used techniques that would come to define the genre.\n\nLiterary critics Chris Willis and Kate Watson consider Mary Elizabeth Braddon's first book, the even earlier \"The Trail of the Serpent\" (1861), the first British detective novel. The novel \"features an unusual and innovative detective figure, Mr. Peters, who is lower class and mute, and who is initially dismissed both by the text and its characters.\" Braddon's later and better-remembered work, \"Aurora Floyd\" (printed in 1863 novel form, but serialized in 1862-63), also features a compelling detective in the person of Detective Grimstone of Scotland Yard.\n\nTom Taylor's melodrama \"The Ticket-of-Leave Man\", an adaptation of \"Léonard\" by Édouard Brisbarre and Eugène Nus, appeared in 1863, introducing Hawkshaw the Detective. In short, it is difficult to establish who was the first to write the English-language detective novel, as various authors were exploring the theme simultaneously.\n\nIn 1887, Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, arguably the most famous of all fictional detectives. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original fiction detective (he was influenced by Poe's Dupin and Gaboriau's Lecoq), his name has become a byword for the part. Conan Doyle stated that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest observations. A brilliant London-based \"consulting detective\" residing at 221B Baker Street, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skillful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, and all but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson.\n\nThe period between World War I and World War II (the 1920s and 1930s) is generally referred to as the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. During this period, a number of very popular writers emerged, including mostly British but also a notable subset of American and New Zealand writers. Female writers constituted a major portion of notable Golden Age writers. Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, Margery Allingham, and Ngaio Marsh were particularly famous female writers of this time. Apart from Ngaio Marsh (a New Zealander), they were all British.\n\nVarious conventions of the detective genre were standardized during the Golden Age, and in 1929, some of them were codified by writer Ronald Knox in his 'Decalogue' of rules for detective fiction. One of his rules was to avoid supernatural elements so that the focus remained on the mystery itself. Knox has contended that a detective story \"must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.\" Another common convention in Golden Age detective stories involved an outsider — sometimes a salaried investigator or a police officer, but often a gifted amateur — investigating a murder committed in a closed environment by one of a limited number of suspects.\n\nThe most widespread subgenre of the detective novel became the whodunit (or whodunnit, short for \"who done it?\"). In this subgenre, great ingenuity may be exercised in narrating the crime, usually a homicide, and the subsequent investigation. This objective was to conceal the identity of the criminal from the reader until the end of the book, when the method and culprit are both revealed. According to scholars Carole Kismaric and Marvi Heiferman, \"The golden age of detective fiction began with high-class amateur detectives sniffing out murderers lurking in rose gardens, down country lanes, and in picturesque villages. Many conventions of the detective-fiction genre evolved in this era, as numerous writers — from populist entertainers to respected poets — tried their hands at mystery stories.\"\n\nJohn Dickson Carr — who also wrote as Carter Dickson — used the “puzzle” approach in his writing which was characterized by including a complex puzzle for the reader to try to unravel. He created ingenious and seemingly impossible plots and is regarded as the master of the \"locked room mystery\". Two of Carr’s most famous works are \"The Case of Constant Suicides\" (1941) and \"The Hollow Man\" (1935). Another author, Cecil Street — who also wrote as John Rhode — wrote of a detective, Dr. Priestley, who specialised in elaborate technical devices. In the United States, the whodunit subgenre was adopted and extended by Rex Stout and Ellery Queen, along with others. The emphasis on formal rules during the Golden Age produced great works, albeit with highly standardized form. The most successful novels of this time included “an original and exciting plot; distinction in the writing, a vivid sense of place, a memorable and compelling hero and the ability to draw the reader into their comforting and highly individual world.”\n\nA whodunit or whodunnit (a colloquial elision of \"Who [has] done it?\" or \"Who did it?\") is a complex, plot-driven variety of the detective story in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The \"whodunit\" flourished during the so-called \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction, between 1920 and 1950, when it was the predominant mode of crime writing.\n\nAgatha Christie is not only the most famous Golden Age writer, but also considered one of the most famous authors of all genres of all time. At the time of her death in 1976, “she was the best-selling novelist in history.”\n\nMany of the most popular books of the Golden Age were written by Agatha Christie. She produced long series of books featuring detective characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, amongst others. Her use of basing her stories on complex puzzles, “combined with her stereotyped characters and picturesque middle-class settings”, is credited for her success. Christie's works include \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1934), \"Death on the Nile\" (1937), and \"And Then There Were None\" (1939).\n\nEdogawa Rampo is the first Japanese modern mystery writer and the founder of the Detective Story Club in Japan. Rampo was an admirer of western mystery writers. He gained his fame in early 1920s, when he began to bring to the genre many bizarre, erotic and even fantastic elements. This is partly because of the social tension before World War II. In 1957, Seicho Matsumoto received the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for his short story \"The Face\" (\"顔\" \"kao\"). \"The Face\" and Matsumoto's subsequent works began the \"social school\" (社会派 \"shakai ha\") within the genre, which emphasized social realism, described crimes in an ordinary setting and sets motives within a wider context of social injustice and political corruption. Since the 1980s, a \"new orthodox school\" (新本格派 \"shin honkaku ha\") has surfaced. It demands restoration of the classic rules of detective fiction and the use of more self-reflective elements. Famous authors of this movement include Soji Shimada, Yukito Ayatsuji, Rintaro Norizuki, Alice Arisugawa, Kaoru Kitamura and Taku Ashibe.\n\nThrough China’s Golden Age of crime fiction (1900-1949), translations of Western classics, and native Chinese detective fictions circulated within the country.\n\nCheng Xiaoqing had first encountered Conan Doyle’s highly popular stories as an adolescent. In the ensuing years, he played a major role in rendering them first into classical and later into vernacular Chinese. Cheng Xiaoqing’s translated works from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced China to a new type of narrative style. Western detective fiction that was translated often emphasized “individuality, equality, and the importance of knowledge” , appealing to China that it was the time for opening their eyes to the rest of the world.\n\nThis style began China’s interest in popular crime fiction, and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own crime fiction novel, \"Sherlock in Shanghai\". In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle’s style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction. Famed as the “Oriental Sherlock Holmes”, the duo Huo Sang and Bao Lang become counterparts to Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson characters.\n\nEspecially in the United States, detective fiction emerged in the 1960s, and gained prominence in later decades, as a way for authors to bring stories about various subcultures to mainstream audiences. One scholar wrote about the detective novels of Tony Hillerman, set among the Native American population around New Mexico, \"many American readers have probably gotten more insight into traditional Navajo culture from his detective stories than from any other recent books.\" Other notable writers who have explored regional and ethnic communities in their detective novels are Harry Kemelman, whose Rabbi Small series were set in the Conservative Jewish community of Massachusetts; Walter Mosley, whose Easy Rawlins books are set in the African American community of 1950s Los Angeles; and Sara Paretsky, whose V. I. Warshawski books have explored the various subcultures of Chicago.\n\nMartin Hewitt, created by British author Arthur Morrison in 1894, is one of the first examples of the modern style of fictional private detective. This character is described as an \"'Everyman' detective meant to challenge the detective-as-superman that Holmes represented.\"\n\nBy the late 1920s, Al Capone and the Mob were inspiring not only fear, but piquing mainstream curiosity about the American crime underworld. Popular pulp fiction magazines like \"Black Mask\" capitalized on this, as authors such as Carrol John Daly published violent stories that focused on the mayhem and injustice surrounding the criminals, not the circumstances behind the crime. Very often, no actual mystery even existed: the books simply revolved around justice being served to those who deserved harsh treatment, which was described in explicit detail.\" The overall theme these writers portrayed reflected \"the changing face of America itself.\"\n\nIn the 1930s, the private eye genre was adopted wholeheartedly by American writers. One of the primary contributors to this style was Dashiell Hammett with his famous private investigator character, Sam Spade. His style of crime fiction came to be known as \"hardboiled\", which is described as a genre that \"usually deals with criminal activity in a modern urban environment, a world of disconnected signs and anonymous strangers.\" \"Told in stark and sometimes elegant language through the unemotional eyes of new hero-detectives, these stories were an American phenomenon.\"\n\nIn the late 1930s, Raymond Chandler updated the form with his private detective Philip Marlowe, who brought a more intimate voice to the detective than the more distanced \"operative's report\" style of Hammett's Continental Op stories. Despite struggling through the task of plotting a story, his cadenced dialogue and cryptic narrations were musical, evoking the dark alleys and tough thugs, rich women and powerful men about whom he wrote. Several feature and television movies have been made about the Philip Marlowe character. James Hadley Chase wrote a few novels with private eyes as the main heroes, including \"Blonde's Requiem\" (1945), \"Lay Her Among the Lilies\" (1950), and \"Figure It Out for Yourself\" (1950). The heroes of these novels are typical private eyes, very similar to or plagiarizing Raymond Chandler's work.\n\nRoss Macdonald, pseudonym of Kenneth Millar, updated the form again with his detective Lew Archer. Archer, like Hammett's fictional heroes, was a camera eye, with hardly any known past. \"Turn Archer sideways, and he disappears,\" one reviewer wrote. Two of Macdonald's strengths were his use of psychology and his beautiful prose, which was full of imagery. Like other 'hardboiled' writers, Macdonald aimed to give an impression of realism in his work through violence, sex and confrontation. The 1966 movie \"Harper\" starring Paul Newman was based on the first Lew Archer story \"The Moving Target\" (1949). Newman reprised the role in \"The Drowning Pool\" in 1976.\n\nMichael Collins, pseudonym of Dennis Lynds, is generally considered the author who led the form into the Modern Age. His PI, Dan Fortune, was consistently involved in the same sort of David-and-Goliath stories that Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald wrote, but Collins took a sociological bent, exploring the meaning of his characters' places in society and the impact society had on people. Full of commentary and clipped prose, his books were more intimate than those of his predecessors, dramatizing that crime can happen in one's own living room.\n\nThe PI novel was a male-dominated field in which female authors seldom found publication until Marcia Muller, Sara Paretsky, and Sue Grafton were finally published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Each author's detective, also female, was brainy and physical and could hold her own. Their acceptance, and success, caused publishers to seek out other female authors.\n\nAn inverted detective story, also known as a \"howcatchem\", is a murder mystery fiction structure in which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator. The story then describes the detective's attempt to solve the mystery. There may also be subsidiary puzzles, such as why the crime was committed, and they are explained or resolved during the story. This format is the opposite of the more typical \"whodunit\", where all of the details of the perpetrator of the crime are not revealed until the story's climax.\n\nMany detective stories have police officers as the main characters. These stories may take a variety of forms, but many authors try to realistically depict the routine activities of a group of police officers who are frequently working on more than one case simultaneously. Some of these stories are whodunits; in others, the criminal is well known, and it is a case of getting enough evidence.\n\nIn the 1940s the police procedural evolved as a new style of detective fiction. Unlike the heroes of Christie, Chandler, and Spillane, the police detective was subject to error and was constrained by rules and regulations. As Gary Huasladen says in \"Places for Dead Bodies\", \"not all the clients were insatiable bombshells, and invariably there was life outside the job.\" The detective in the police procedural does the things police officers do to catch a criminal. Writers include Ed McBain, P. D. James, and Bartholomew Gill.\n\nThese works are set in a time period considered historical from the author's perspective, and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 20th century, many credit Ellis Peters's \"Cadfael Chronicles\" (1977–1994) for popularizing what would become known as the historical mystery.\n\n\"Cozy mysteries\" began in the late 20th century as a reinvention of the Golden Age whodunit; these novels generally shy away from violence and suspense and frequently feature female amateur detectives. Modern cozy mysteries are frequently, though not necessarily in either case, humorous and thematic (culinary mystery, animal mystery, quilting mystery, etc.)\n\nThis style features minimal violence, sex, and social relevance; a solution achieved by intellect or intuition rather than police procedure, with order restored in the end; honorable and well bred characters; and a setting in a closed community. Writers include Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Elizabeth Daly.\n\nAnother subgenre of detective fiction is the serial killer mystery, which might be thought of as an outcropping of the police procedural. There are early mystery novels in which a police force attempts to contend with the type of criminal known in the 1920s as a homicidal maniac, such as a few of the early novels of Philip Macdonald and Ellery Queen's \"Cat of Many Tails\". However, this sort of story became much more popular after the coining of the phrase \"serial killer\" in the 1970s and the publication of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" in 1988. These stories frequently show the activities of many members of a police force or government agency in their efforts to apprehend a killer who is selecting victims on some obscure basis. They are also often much more violent and suspenseful than other mysteries.\n\nThe legal thriller or courtroom novel is also related to detective fiction. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters. In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller as much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural. The legal thriller usually starts its business with the court proceedings following the closure of an investigation, often resulting in a new angle on the investigation, so as to bring about a final outcome different from the one originally devised by the investigators. In the legal thriller, court proceedings play a very active, if not to say decisive part in a case reaching its ultimate solution. Erle Stanley Gardner popularized the courtroom novel in the 20th century with his Perry Mason series. Contemporary authors of legal thrillers include Michael Connelly, Linda Fairstein, John Grisham, John Lescroat, Paul Levine, Lisa Scottoline, and Scott Turow.\n\nThe locked-room mystery is a subgenre of detective fiction in which a crime—almost always murder—is committed under circumstances which it was seemingly impossible for the perpetrator to commit the crime and/or evade detection in the course of getting in and out of the crime scene. The genre was established in the 19th century. Edgar Allen Poe’s \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841) is considered the first locked-room mystery; since then, other authors have used the scheme. The crime in question typically involves a crime scene with no indication as to how the intruder could have entered or left, i.e., a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the clues, and is encouraged to solve the mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic climax.\n\nOne of the most prolific writers of the railway detective genre is Keith Miles, who is also best known as Edward Marston. His \"Railway Detective\" series, published by Allison & Busby, is set in the mid-19th century, against the background of the \"Railway Age\". The cases, oftentimes linked with railways, unravel through the endeavors of two Scotland Yard detectives. To the end of 2017, there are sixteen titles in the series.\n\nEven if they do not mean to, advertisers, reviewers, scholars and aficionados sometimes give away details or parts of the plot, and sometimes—for example in the case of Mickey Spillane's novel \"I, the Jury\"—even the solution. After the credits of Billy Wilder's film \"Witness for the Prosecution\", the cinemagoers are asked not to talk to anyone about the plot so that future viewers will also be able to fully enjoy the unravelling of the mystery.\n\nFor series involving amateur detectives, their frequent encounters with crime often test the limits of plausibility. The character Miss Marple, for instance, dealt with an estimated two murders a year; De Andrea has described Marple's home town, the quiet little village of St. Mary Mead, as having \"put on a pageant of human depravity rivaled only by that of Sodom and Gomorrah\". Similarly, TV heroine Jessica Fletcher of \"Murder, She Wrote\" was confronted with bodies wherever she went, but most notably in her small hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine; \"The New York Times\" estimated that, by the end of the series' 12-year run, nearly 2% of the town's residents had been killed. It is arguably more convincing if police, forensic experts or similar professionals are made the protagonist of a series of crime novels.\n\nThe television series \"Monk\" has often made fun of this implausible frequency. The main character, Adrian Monk, is frequently accused of being a \"bad luck charm\" and a \"murder magnet\" as the result of the frequency with which murder happens in his vicinity.\n\nLikewise Kogoro Mori of the manga series \"Detective Conan\" got that kind of unflattering reputation. Although Mori is actually a private investigator with his own agency, the police never intentionally consult him as he stumbles from one crime scene to another.\n\nThe role and legitimacy of coincidence has frequently been the topic of heated arguments ever since Ronald A. Knox categorically stated that \"no accident must ever help the detective\" (Commandment No. 6 in his \"Decalogue\").\n\nTechnological progress has also rendered many plots implausible and antiquated. For example, the predominance of mobile phones, pagers, and PDAs has significantly altered the previously dangerous situations in which investigators traditionally might have found themselves.\n\nOne tactic that avoids the issue of technology altogether is the historical detective genre. As global interconnectedness makes legitimate suspense more difficult to achieve, several writers—including Elizabeth Peters, P. C. Doherty, Steven Saylor, and Lindsey Davis—have eschewed fabricating convoluted plots in order to manufacture tension, instead opting to set their characters in some former period. Such a strategy forces the protagonist to rely on more inventive means of investigation, lacking as they do the technological tools available to modern detectives.\n\nAs technology advances, so does the genre of crime fiction, as we now have the issue of cyber crime, or a crime that involves a computer and a network. There is also the new issue of cyberterrorism, which is being more frequently incorporated into modern crime fiction.\n\nSeveral authors have attempted to set forth a sort of list of “Detective Commandments” for prospective authors of the genre.\n\nAccording to \"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories,\" by Van Dine in 1928: \"The detective story is a kind of intellectual game. It is more—it is a sporting event. And for the writing of detective stories there are very definite laws—unwritten, perhaps, but nonetheless binding; and every respectable and self-respecting concocter of literary mysteries lives up to them. Herewith, then, is a sort of credo, based partly on the practice of all the great writers of detective stories, and partly on the promptings of the honest author's inner conscience.\" Ronald Knox wrote a set of \"Ten Commandments\" or \"Decalogue\" in 1929, see article on the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.\n\nA general consensus among crime fiction authors is there is a specific set of rules that must be applied for a novel to truly be considered part of the detective fiction genre. As noted in \"Introduction to the Analysis of Crime Fiction\", crime fiction from the past 100 years has generally contained 8 key rules to be a detective novel:\n\nSherlock Holmes is British detective fiction written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The first appearance of Sherlock Holmes is at “A study in Scarlet”. At first, Sherlock Holmes did not result massive success, however starting from 1891, after published Sherlock Holmes at “Strand Magazine”, it became unquestionably popular. After Sherlock Holmes, many detective stories followed Conan Doyle’s structure and also include characters which have Sherlock Holmes characteristics.\n\nSherlock Holmes has most huge fandom in detective fiction. Conan Doyle tried to kill Sherlock Holmes after twenty three stories, but because of people’s request, he had to continue writing Sherlock Holmes series. Today, Sherlock Holmes popularity became more obsessive since past. Sherlock Holmes is not only reference as one character from detective fiction but also influenced in many other area. For example, due to enormous fandom all around the world, TV series based on Sherlock Holmes have been created; title named as “Sherlock”. Because of Holmes, Conan Doyle was “well-known as Queen Victoria”.\n\nHercule Poirot is a fictional Belgian private detective, created by Agatha Christie. As the one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, he appeared in 33 novels, one play (\"Black Coffee\"), and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975. The stories are throughout the Hercule Poirot’s whole life in the UK, which he first appeared in \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\" (published in 1920) and died in \"Curtain\" (published in 1975), which is Agatha Christie’s last work. August 6, 1975, The New York Times published the obituary of Paolo's death and the cover of the newly published novel on the front page.\n\n\"Le Chevalier\" C. Auguste Dupin is a fictional character created by Edgar Allan Poe. Dupin made his first appearance in Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841), widely considered the first detective fiction story. He reappears in \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" (1842) and \"The Purloined Letter\" (1844).\n\nC. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction. The character served as the prototype for many that were created later, including Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle and Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie. Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\"\n\nEllery Queen is a fictional detective-hero, created by Manfred Bennington Lee (1905-1971), and Frederic Dannay (1905～1982), as well as a joint pseudonym for the cousins Dannay and Lee. Ellery Queen first appeared in \"The Roman Hat Mystery\" (1929), and was the hero of more than 30 novels and several short story collections, During the 1930s and much of the 1940s, that detective-hero was possibly the best known American fictional detective.\n\nMany detectives appear in more than one novel or story. Here is a list of a few debut and swansong stories:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1663283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1663283", "title": "Dialogus de oratoribus", "text": "Dialogus de oratoribus\n\nThe Dialogus de oratoribus is a short work attributed to Tacitus, in dialogue form, on the art of rhetoric. Its date of composition is unknown, though its dedication to Lucius Fabius Justus places its publication around 102 AD.\n\nThe dialogue itself, set in the 70s AD, follows the tradition of Cicero's speeches on philosophical and rhetorical arguments. It is set in the home of Curiatius Maternus, one of the speakers, to whom two leading lawyers of the day, Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus, have come to discuss a recent event; the fourth speaker, Gaius Vipstanus Messalla Gallus, arrives later. All four men are attested historical personages. The beginning of the work is a speech in defence of eloquence and poetry. It then deals with the decadence of oratory, for which the cause is said to be the decline of the education, both in the family and in the school, of the future orator. The education is not as accurate as it once was; the teachers are not prepared and a useless rhetoric often takes the place of the general culture.\n\nAfter a lacuna, the \"Dialogus\" ends with a speech delivered by Maternus reporting what some believe is Tacitus's opinion. Maternus thinks that great oratory was possible with the freedom from any power, more precisely in the anarchy, that characterized the Roman Republic during the civil wars. It became anachronistic and impracticable in the quiet and ordered society that resulted from the institution of the Roman Empire. The peace, warranted by the Empire, should be accepted without regret for a previous age that was more favorable to the wide spread of literacy and the growth of great personality.\n\nSome believe that at the base of all of Tacitus's work is the acceptance of the Empire as the only power able to save the state from the chaos of the civil wars. The Empire reduced the space of the orators and of the political men, but there is no viable alternative to it. Nevertheless, Tacitus does not accept the imperial government apathetically, and he shows, as in the \"Agricola\" the remaining possibility of making choices that are dignified and useful to the state.\n\nThe date of publication of the \"Dialogus\" is uncertain, but it was probably written after the \"Agricola\" and the \"Germania\". Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so much so that the its authenticity may be questioned, even if it is always grouped with the \"Agricola\" and the \"Germania\" in the manuscript tradition. The way of speaking in the \"Dialogus\" seems closer to the model of Cicero, refined but not prolix, which inspired the teaching of Quintilian; it lacks the incongruities that are typical of Tacitus's major historical works. It may have been written when Tacitus was young; its dedication to Fabius Iustus would thus give the date of publication, but not the date of writing. More probably, the unusually classical style may be explained by the fact that the \"Dialogus\" is a work of rhetoric. For this genre the structure, the language, and the style of Cicero were the usual models.\n\n"}
{"id": "400514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400514", "title": "Doctor of Musical Arts", "text": "Doctor of Musical Arts\n\nThe Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.) is a doctoral academic degree in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually music performance, music composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master's and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers. As a terminal degree, the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in musicology or music theory typically enter a Ph.D. program, rather than a D.M.A. program.\n\nThe degree is also abbreviated as DMA (without periods), D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D.. For the related degree Doctor of Music, the abbreviation is D.M. or D.Mus. For the related degree Doctor of Arts, the abbreviation D.A. is used.\n\nThe D.M.A. is widely available in the concentrations of performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title Doctor of Music (D.M. or D.Mus.) or Doctor of Arts (D.A.) or Doctor in Musical Studies (Ph.D.) instead of D.M.A. The D.M.A. degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the National Association of Schools of Music, who approved the first D.M.A. programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the D.M.A. Boston University offered its first D.M.A. program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into online music education by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a D.M.A. program (along with a Master of Music program) in music education.\n\nA large number of U.S. institutions offer the D.M.A. degree in the 2010s. The Ph.D. is generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written dissertation, regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a D.M.A. or Ph.D. Also, music education Ph.D. programs may include performance-oriented tracks. In composition, one may study for either the D.M.A. or the Ph.D., depending on the institution. The Ph.D. is the standard doctorate in music theory, musicology, music therapy, and ethnomusicology.\nA related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music (D.S.M.), also \"Sacrae Musica Doctor\" (S.M.D.), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting and organ performance. In the past, some seminaries titled the degree Doctor of Church Music (D.C.M.). Only one U.S. institution, Claremont Graduate University still offers the D.C.M. degree, in addition to the more typical D.M.A. The vast majority of U.S. seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a Master of Arts or Master of Sacred Music degree. A new program offered at Perkins School of Theology is the Doctor of Pastoral Music (D.P.M.). While more theology-based and housed within the Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a Master of Music (M.Mus.), Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.), Master of Church Music (M.C.M.), M.A. in Church Music or equivalent 48 semester hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music.\n\nD.M.A. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons or mentoring with a professor or instructor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many D.M.A. programs, all of the different D.M.A. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses. Many D.M.A. programs require students to pass a comprehensive exam on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory. The last stage of the D.M.A. degree is usually the completion of a thesis, dissertation, or research project and the performance of recitals, usually including at least one lecture-recital.\n\nSome programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing a D.M.A. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance.\n\nSome institutions permit D.M.A. students to do a sub-specialization in a field \"outside\" music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a D.M.A. in piano pedagogy may be able to do a sub-specialization in the university's department of psychology (e.g., on the psychology of learning and memory); a student completing a D.M.A. in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of computer engineering (e.g., in computer programming).\n\nWhile teaching experience is not an official part of most D.M.A. programs, most D.M.A. candidates will have the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree, either as a requirement of their scholarship/assistantship package or as a part-time employee of the university. D.M.A. students can teach in an area related to their D.M.A. program, or, if they have multiple skill areas (e.g., a person with an M.Mus. in piano performance who is doing a D.M.A. in composition), they may teach in another area.\n\nTo be admitted to a D.M.A. degree program, most institutions require a master's degree, such as a M.Mus. degree or an M.A. degree in music or an equivalent course of study, usually with a grade average of \"B+\" or higher. D.M.A. programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recital—i.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of styles—in addition to orchestral excerpts. Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings of live performances. Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school (or similar) teaching experience, and may further require an example of scholarly writing.\n\nNewly admitted D.M.A. students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history, theory, and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles gained in prior study. Advanced courses in these areas are not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed. Often, the knowledge of a second language – one of languages of major influence in music history (such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Russian) – is required to complete the degree. The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math, vocabulary, and analytical writing. While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships, it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university.\n\nAfter World War II, there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level. As was the case with many occupations, the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the U.S. Armed Forces. The G.I. Bill was an impetus for many opting for college, causing a spike in demand for college professors, across all disciplines, and a spike in enrollment. In music education, universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians, but many, including those of international rank, lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors. Post World War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities. The Nation's renowned conservatories, such as Juilliard and Curtis, at the time, saw no need for the degree – yet many alumni of those institutions, and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education.\n\nIn 1952, after six years of deliberation, the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work \"in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided.\" The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the American Council on Education. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees. The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953.\n\n\nThe Dean of the University of Rochester Eastman School of Music, Howard Harold Hanson (1896–1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high-profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree.\n\nIn 1953, he published a proposal for a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, PhD, professor of musicology at Columbia University.\n\nEarly Doctor of Musical Arts conferred\n\nNon-NASM institutions\n\nThe alumni of Music conservatories in the United States also seek positions at universities.

Billed as \"The Girl with the Million Dollar Smile\", she was one of the classic female blues singers popular in the 1920s.\n\nShe was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1895. Several members of her extended family were musicians; the drummer Paul Barbarin was her cousin. In 1913 she began touring in vaudeville with the performer and playwright Irvin C. Miller; they later married. In 1917 Bigeou appeared as a singer, dancer, and recitalist in the revue \"Broadway Rastus\", written by Miller, at the Standard Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Lafayette Theater in New York City, and the Orpheum Theater in Baltimore, Maryland. She recorded for OKeh Records in 1921 and 1923 and toured the Theater Owners Booking Association vaudeville circuit with the Billy King Company in 1923. From 1923 to 1925 and 1927 to 1930, she toured as a single act in the American South, Midwest, and Northeast.\n\nShe died in 1935 or 1936.\n\nThe blues writer Chris Smith said that Bigeou was \"a singer at the pop end of African-American entertainment\" and that she \"seems to have retired, aged only 35, to settle in New Orleans, where reports indicate that she died circa 1936\".\n\nAll of her recordings were reissued in 1996 by Document Records on the CD \"Esther Bigeou: Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order (1921–1923)\" (DODC-5489).\n\nRecorded in New York City for Okeh Records in October–November 1921:\n\nRecorded in New York City for Okeh Records in March 1923:\n\nRecorded in New York City for Okeh Records in December 1923:\n\n"}

Five playing cards are dealt to the player, while the dealer is dealt five cards face down and a sixth card face up. Both the player and the dealer make their best four-card hands. The dealer's advantages are in having an extra card and the fact that if the player folds, he will lose his ante, even if his hand turns out to be better than the dealer's.\n\nAfter seeing their cards and the dealer's face up card, the player can opt to fold the ante bet, in which case the player loses it, or play by betting 1-3 times their ante. Unlike Three Card Poker and some other games, the dealer always qualifies (plays). If the player ties or beats the dealer, the player is paid the amount bet. A bonus is paid if the player has a three of a kind (2-1 for the original ante bet only), straight flush (20-1), or four of a kind (25-1). This bonus is paid out even if the dealer's hand is better than the player's; however, in this situation, the player would still lose their ante and play bets. \n\nThe Aces Up bet depends solely on the player's hand. If the player has a pair of aces or better, they win, otherwise they lose. The dealer's hand is immaterial. The payout for a win can range from 1-1 for a pair of aces to 50-1 for four of a kind, the best possible hand. Various payout variations are possible, depending on the casino, resulting in a house edge ranging from 1.98% to 6.15%.\n\nThe possible four-card hands are (from best to worst): \n\n"}

{"id": "36476046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36476046", "title": "INK Entertainment", "text": "INK Entertainment\n\nINK Entertainment is a hospitality and entertainment company headquartered in Toronto that maintains various properties, mostly nightclubs and restaurants, as well as a country club, two annual music festivals, two talent agencies, and a hotel currently under construction. Most of its properties are located in Toronto (either in the city's Entertainment District, Fashion District or in its ritzy Yorkville neighbourhood), with a few others in Montreal, Niagara Falls, the Miami area, and Las Vegas.\n\nFounded and run by the Lebanese-born entrepreneur Charles Khabouth, INK currently owns and operates Toronto's Product nightclub, Dragonfly nightclub (on Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort grounds), Cube nightclub and La Société restaurant. Furthermore, Ink, in partnership with Nick Di Donato's Liberty Entertainment Group, is the parent company of Tattoo Queen West rock club and Spice Route bistro bar. Their partnership has since grown to include the Coral Gables Country Club located in south Miami, Florida. Ink has also teamed up with Lifetime Developments with the launch of Bisha Hotel & Residences, the newest private label hotel and residence brand to originate in Toronto since The Four Seasons in the 1960s.\n\nAs of October 1, 2016, the Sound Academy changed its name to REBEL and reopened, completely renovated. Ink Entertainment collaborated with Studio Munge to design the 45,000 square foot nightclub, with a 65-foot stage. The nightclub will be hosting multiple global artists such as DJ Snake, DVBBS, Tory Lanez, and Passenger (singer), among many other.\n\nCube, previously known as Ultra Supper Club from 2003 until 2012, is a nightclub located in downtown Toronto on Queen West near Spadina that can hold up to 650 people between its indoor lounge and rooftop patio. Catering to affluent 25-plus young professionals, Cube's black and gold interior is inspired by 1960s and 1970s design and features nostalgic retro detailing to reflect the cubist art and fashion of the time such as the 65-foot-long bar and handblown brass railings and sculptures.\n\nUltra Supper Club opened in December 2003 following an investment of over C$3 million by the INK Entertainment owner Charles Khabouth into year-long renovation of the space that previously housed the iconic BamBoo tropical-themed nightclub (co-owned by Richard O'Brien and Patti Habib) from July 1983 until its closing bash on 31 October 2002. Before BamBoo, during the 1970s, the building housed a laundromat and later a Wicker World shop. Khabouth reportedly got alerted that the building was for lease by the same real estate agent who almost 10 years earlier helped him turn RPM and the Warehouse into the Guvernment and Kool Haus. From the start Khabouth envisioned Ultra as an upscale restaurant and club that attracts Toronto's moneyed crowd (real estate barons, Bay Street moguls and leveraged-buyout specialists), much like his successful Stilife club at the corner of Richmond and Duncan Street did back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In pursuit of creating an exclusive spot, he spared little expense, including putting in fortress-like exterior doors from India that cost C$15,000 and another C$15,000 to install them because the entire building had to be reinforced. Run as Khabouth's partnership with Brenda Lowes and inspired by supper clubs in New York City and Montreal, Ultra was among the first Toronto venues to push that concept in addition to being an early adopter of the bottle service model.\n\nThe new club was an instant hit with its rooftop patio crowded every summer. Sleeker and much more upscale than BamBoo's ramshackle vibe, Ultra put more emphasis on food than a regular nightclub. Instead of live acts, its bookings mostly focused on DJs with the tables and chairs removed around 11pm to make room for dancing. Ultra's glamorous reputation further benefited from the media coverage of the steady stream of international celebrities dropping by such as David Beckham in August 2007, Paris Hilton with then-boyfriend Benji Madden in September 2008, Lindsay Lohan who got paid to show up accompanying then-girlfriend DJ Samantha Ronson in 2009 on the day of their engagement, Beyoncé, etc.\n\nIn February 2009, Ultra Supper Club underwent a bit of a makeover, dropping the 'Supper Club' from its name and adopting a new Asian fusion fare and cheaper menu offerings — all of which was seen to be initiated in response to the diminishing number of corporate events at the venue due to the global recession.\n\nBy early 2012, despite the club/restaurant being profitable, Khabouth had decided that Ultra ran its course, investing $1.8 million into the venue makeover and re-opening as Cube on 28 February 2012. With the restaurant aspect mostly dropped, Cube functions primarily as a nightclub — hosting glamorous, celebrity-packed TIFF parties and booking more high-profile big room house DJs for gigs such as Dubfire, Hardwell, and Victor Calderone. In August 2013, following that year's OVO Fest the club hosted an impromptu after-party for the festival performers including Drake, Lil Wayne, P. Diddy, Kanye West, Big Sean, French Montana, Mase, and TLC. Cube also continues with the practice of promoting parties around the presence of prominent pro athletes such as Chris Weidman who hosted an event at Cube in September 2013, one day ahead of UFC 165 in Toronto's Air Canada Centre.\n\nDragonfly Nightclub is built into the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort in Niagara Falls, Ontario with a capacity of up to 800. Spread over 12,000 square foot space, it features Asian themed decor invoking an ancient forbidden city.\n\nUniun opened on Adelaide Street West in November 2012, in the same space that previously housed the Devil's Martini nightclub, a popular destination for bachelorette parties that Khabouth bought several months earlier in July 2012, immediately initiating its complete makeover.\n\nThe club was in the news in late August 2013 after Justin Bieber stopped by with bodyguards and got involved in a melee after which he got hustled out by his security detail into a waiting SUV.\n\nSpice Route is an Asian themed bistro-bar located on King Street West, Toronto, Ontario that opened during spring 2008. It is run as a collaboration between Ink's Khabouth and Liberty's Nick Di Donato (owner of C Lounge and many other venues), two veteran moguls of the Toronto entertainment scene who after directly competing with one another for the city's upscale clientele throughout the 2000s via their respective properties Ultra Supper Club and C Lounge now joined forces in a venture also targeting ritzy young professionals. Spice Route can hold up to 500 guests over multiple rooms and an outdoor patio.\n\nLa Société is a 1920s-inspired Parisian-style eatery located on Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario that opened in June 2011. The restaurant includes two European-style terraces, and an outdoor patio. Located in the space previously occupied by the long-running Dynasty Chinese Cuisine dim sum restaurant, the C$4 million renovation that included installation of a 20 by 30 foot stained-glass ceiling (courtesy of Toronto's Solarium Design Group) took five months before La Société opened. It also included putting in a mosaic tile floor, which by itself cost almost C$400,000 and entailed flying in 27 workers. La Société draws inspiration from various brasseries and bistros, including Keith McNally's Balthazar restaurant in New York City's SoHo as well as Hôtel Costes in Paris on Place Vendôme in the city's 1st arrondissement, La Fontaine de Mars in 7th arrondissement, and Brasserie Bofinger in 4th arrondissement.\n\nDue to its location, opulence, and flair, La Société also invoked comparisons to the famous Toronto restaurant Bemelmans, a glamorous eatery owned and operated by Tom Kristenbrun that ran from 1977 until 1994 just up the street at 83 Bloor Street West. La Société opening party on Wednesday, 15 June 2011 brought out the Toronto glitterati from the city's business and media scenes, including Moses Znaimer, Roots Canada founder Michael Budman, architect and designer Dee Dee Taylor Eustace of Taylor Hannah Architect Inc., Kirk Pickersgill and Stephen Wong of Greta Constantine, Blake McGrath, Polly Shannon, Kevin Brauch, Jake Gold, Jian Ghomeshi, Seamus O'Regan, Melissa Grelo, and gossip columnists Shinan Govani, Bernadette Morra, and Suzanne Boyd. Within months of opening, La Société hosted various 2011 Toronto International Film Festival parties, including the closing one on 17 September 2011 that featured NKPR Inc's Natasha Koifman, Bill Nighy, Robert Lantos, Suzanne Rogers, Glenn Baxter, Yannick Bisson, George Stroumboulopoulos, Jian Ghomeshi, Ben Mulroney & Jessica Brownstein, Colin & Justin, Drew & Jonathan Scott, designer Kirk Pickersgill, Suzanne Boyd, and Shinan Govani.\n\nClassified as modern American-style gastropub with a saloon twist, Weslodge opened in mid-July 2012 on King Street West in Toronto's Fashion District as a partnership between INK Entertainment's Charles Khabouth and Icon Legacy Hospitality's Hanif Harji. During the Weslodge preparation stage, Khabouth, who was initially set to open it by himself, got introduced to Harji who was opening Patria next door and the two restaurateurs soon decided to go into business together on both venues. The restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Victory Condos building at 478 King Street West that was completed in 2011 and is co-owned by Toronto real estate developers Lifetime Developments (run by Mel Pearl and Sam Herzog) and BLVD Developments.\n\nDesigned by the Toronto-based Munge Leung interior design firm, Khabouth's and Harji's plan for Weslodge was attracting the Downtown Toronto urban crowd that doesn't spend much time in their condos, but rather likes to go out right after coming home from work. With its interior featuring imitations of taxidermy hunting trophies mounted on walls, in keeping with the Wild West and hunting themes, the restaurant's bartenders and servers wear gun holsters around their shoulders. Weslodge's kitchen is run by executive chef Stuart Cameron while its first chef du cuisine was Kanida Chey who joined from Claudio Aprile's Origin.\n\nThe restaurant was in the news in June 2015 due to its 24-year-old former pastry chef Kate Burnham who had been employed at the venue from July 2012 until January 2014, alleging to have been sexually harassed while working at Weslodge by three former bosses — day sous chef Dan Lidbury, chef du cuisine Kanida Chey, and night sous chef Colin Mercer. She filed an application with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, seeking C$225,000 in damages as well as formal apologies from each of her alleged harassers. After first appearing in the \"Toronto Star\" on Saturday, 13 June 2015, the story got a lot of attention, including from established Toronto restaurateur Jen Agg, owner of the Black Hoof, who in addition to supporting Burnham announced a conference named 'Kitchen Bitches: Smashing the Patriarchy One Plate at a Time'. All the media attention prompted INK Entertainment into releasing an official statement, posted on the company's Facebook page. The story received more national coverage in Canada via \"The Current\" radio programme hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti on CBC Radio One, sparking a debate on the poor workplace treatment of women in restaurant kitchens. Jen Agg's Kitchen Bitches conference was later held in Toronto in September 2015. Furthermore, the same month, Burnham's legal case against Weslodge got resolved through mediation as she agreed to a confidential settlement.\n\nAlso in September 2015, it was announced that the Weslodge Saloon brand would be expanding to the Gulf countries in early 2016 as part of a deal between Daman Investments PSC, a Dubai-based financial services company, and a consortium of partners including Harji's ICON Legacy Hospitality.\n\nPatria is another Khabouth-Harji King West restaurant collaboration, this one serving Spanish food. It opened in October 2012. Originally, only Harji was behind Patria, but soon after meeting Khabouth who was getting ready to open Weslodge next door, the two decided to join forces and run both venues in partnership with one another. Reportedly, they invested C$2.5 million into getting Patria off the ground, enlisting the Toronto-based Commute Home design company to do the restaurant's interior and getting chefs Stuart Cameron and Claudia Gibson to run the kitchen.\n\nEven before officially opening, the restaurant hosted 2012 TIFF events such as the \"Seven Psychopaths\" premiere party in September 2012 with Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Colin Farrell on hand. Much like other Khabouth's restaurants in Toronto, Patria continually attracts international movie stars and Hollywood celebrities via TIFF parties every September thereby ensuring press coverage and publicity for the restaurant.\n\nThe Toronto location of the popular Montreal restaurant Buonanotte opened in January 2013 courtesy of Khabouth's INK Entertainment that licensed the name and recipes from the original restaurant's owner Massimo \"Max\" Lecas who remains in charge of the new venue's management. It opened at 19 Mercer Street, the same location where Khabouth previously ran a Japanese cuisine restaurant named Ame in partnership with Michael and Guy Rubino. The original Buonanotte restaurant in Montreal has been in continual operation since 1991.\n\nByblos is a restaurant serving Eastern Mediterranean and Moroccan food, located on Duncan Street near King Street West inside the Storys building in Toronto's Entertainment District. Opened in March 2014, it is the third restaurant that Khabouth established in Toronto in partnership with Hanif Harji.\n\nOriginally envisioned as a fish and seafood eatery, its opening took place during a time when Toronto experienced a bit of a spike in restaurants serving Mediterranean and Middle Eastern (Middleterranean) fare, a trend that Khabouth and Harji took note of and decided to join. Most upscale among the string of such spots in Toronto that opened or expanded during the 2013-2014 period (Anthony Rose's Fat Pasha, Dr. Laffa, Me Va Me, District Oven, S. Lefkowitz, etc.), Byblos focuses on dishes from Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Lebanon as well as Morocco. Byblos' executive chef is Stuart Cameron who also oversees other Khabouth-Harji eateries such as Weslodge and Patria while its chef de cuisine is Jennifer Nickle who came over from Patria where she was a sous chef.\n\nByblos received near universal critical acclaim, getting enthusiastic reviews and accolades for its food blend and becoming perhaps the best-reviewed Khabouth restaurant ever.\n\nAs Byblos got established on Toronto's restaurant scene and following the successful launch of its second location in Miami Beach, it was announced in September 2015 that the Byblos brand would be expanding to the Gulf countries in early 2016 as part of a deal between Daman Investments PSC, a Dubai-based financial services company, and a consortium of partners including Harji's ICON Legacy Hospitality.\n\nFirst opening its doors in early September 2014 for that year's TIFF, high-end America Restaurant at the 31st floor of Toronto's Trump International Hotel and Tower didn't officially launch until almost October 2014. It thus replaced the glitzy Stock approximately nine months since its management had been taken over by Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants (O&B) in partnership with Khabouth. At the time of the ownership change, Stock, which opened during spring 2012 simultaneous with the Toronto Trump Tower's launch, had been in operation for some two and a half years.\n\nAfter their limited collaboration on snacks at the Cabana Pool Bar, America Restaurant thus marked a closer partnership between INK and O&B that began in December 2013 with an announcement of the two companies taking over all food operations at Trump International Hotel & Tower from Alex Shnaider's Talon International that developed the tower and then later also managed its two dining and drinking venues — Stock restaurant and Suits Lobby Lounge.\n\nThe new owners hired the Toronto firm II by IV Design, the same company that designed Stock, to now remodel the space. The redesign included doing away with Stock's black leather furniture, which Khabouth described as very \"manly\", and replacing it with \"a lot of velvet, a lot of velures, burgundies, blues and golds in order to make it a little more feminine friendly\". Hundreds of pieces of furniture were custom built off-site at a shop in Woodbridge, just outside Toronto, over the course of about four months. The actual remodeling work took place in late August and early September 2014 over just five days as the new owners rushed to be ready in time for Toronto International Film Festival. While Stock's physical bar remained relatively unchanged, the lounge area was completely revamped with new lighting, furniture and a DJ booth.\n\nThe spot relaunched as America Restaurant, a venue that's an eatery during daytime, but on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays functions as a supper club, turning into a nightclub with dancing and DJs past 11pm. When it came to the name, O&B and INK wanted \"something strong and unapologetic\" while for Khabouth, Donald Trump himself, \"the epitome of everything American\", was a source of inspiration. Bill Osborne, formerly of Bar Boulud in London and Canoe in Toronto, got hired to run America's kitchen, working under O&B executive chef Anthony Walsh.\n\nIn September 2014, before it was even open to the general public, America hosted \"The Imitation Game\" party attended by Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley as the movie played at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nIn late November 2014 America was subject of an extremely negative review by \"The Globe and Mail\" restaurant critic Chris Nuttall-Smith whose elaborate takedown went viral, garnering big reader reaction as well as attention from various other media outlets. In his zero-star assessment of America, Nutall-Smith referred to it as \"tacky, new-money restaurant\", eviscerating its bouncers, wait staff, bathroom attendant, hostesses, and even patrons; though praising its food. The scathing review reportedly led to the restaurant's entire front of house staff getting fired.\n\nAmerica received a four-star rating from the 2015 Forbes Travel Guide, placed in the same category as established Toronto dining spots Café Boulud Toronto, Canoe, One Restaurant, Scaramouche, Splendido, and TOCA.\n\nThe restaurant was in the news in late March 2015 after a Toronto resident (Darshan Dorka) claimed he got turned away at America along with a party of friends due to wearing turbans.\n\nAt the same time as the launch of America, the two partner entities opened The Calvin Bar in the hotel's lobby facing the southeast corner of Bay & Adelaide.\n\nStanding for New and Old, NAO is an Asian steakhouse on Avenue Road established by Khabouth and Harji that opened in November 2014.\n\nAfter getting announced in January 2015, Byblos Miami, an offshoot of Toronto's Byblos, opened in Miami Beach during late summer 2015. Another partnership between Khabouth and Harji, the Miami restaurant reportedly came on the heels of extensive research as the duo of Toronto restaurateurs aimed at minimizing surprises and risks of launching in the Miami market that they don't know very well.\n\nOpened in November 2015, Figo is the seventh Khabouth-Harji restaurant collaboration, their sixth in Toronto. Located on the south-west corner of Adelaide West & John in the recently built Pinnacle on Adelaide condo building that's owned by Pinnacle International, the eatery serves Italian cuisine. The partners hired Anna Chen (formerly of Lee and Scaramouche) to run Figo's kitchen as its executive chef.\n\nIn October 2011 Khabouth and Harji announced their purchase of the four-story Storys building at the corner of Duncan & Pearl in the heart of the Entertainment District, around the corner from Royal Alexandra Theater and TIFF Lightbox.\n\nAfter his 2012 takeover of the Sound Academy, Khabouth opened Cabana Pool Bar on 15 June 2013 on its patio. Spending C$5 million, he hired Ink's go-to interior designers Munge Leung to remake the outdoor space by installing 12 poolside white-tent cabanas and several dozen tables and couches all in an effort of appealing to the \"25-plus crowd that has traveled to the south of France, been to Miami, been to Vegas\".\n\nWith a daytime concept that's an extension of the bottle-service booths in Khabouth's nightclubs — the cost of renting a table, a couch, or a cabana for an entire day is from C$1,000 to C$2,500, an amount for which the patrons also get three bottles of liquor to start, a platter of snacks, and wristbands affording access to 10-20 people — Cabana Pool Bar became a big success right away, attracting more than 4,000 people a day on summer weekends if the weather is nice. Open during summer only from early to mid June until late September, Cabana shuts down by 11pm on weekends due to the residents of the neighbouring Toronto Island complaining about the noise from the patio. The venue is closed to the general public during summer weekdays though it is available for corporate bookings and functions. Light food offerings and snacks at the venue are handled by Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants, a Toronto-based hospitality company.\n\nCelebrity presence, a staple of Khabouth's nightclubs and restaurants, played a large part in Cabana Pool Bar's initial promotion as well — Justin Bieber, Drake, Milos Raonic, deadmau5, P. K. Subban, Phil Kessel, and Nazem Kadri were all on hand during its first summer in operation. Over the coming summers, Will Smith, in town filming \"Suicide Squad\", Dan Bilzerian, LeBron James, etc. made highly publicized appearances.\n\nBisha Hotel & Residences at 80 Blue Jays Way in Toronto's Entertainment District is a hotel and condominium project, currently under construction, executed as a joint venture between INK Entertainment hospitality company and Lifetime Developments real estate development company. It is a new private label hotel and residence brand named after INK founder, Charles Khabouth’s childhood nickname, Bisha. It was designed by award-winning \"Wallman Architects\" and \"Munge Leung Design Associates\" and will stand 41 stories tall when complete. The Bisha Presentation Centre has hosted many events including features by Sir Richard Branson and John Legend.\n\nVeld Music Festival takes place over a two-day weekend at Downsview Park in Toronto, Ontario. Organized annually by INK Entertainment.\n\nThe inaugural event took place on 4 and 5 August 2012, featuring some of the best stars and labels in electronic dance music. The inaugural headliners included deadmau5 and Avicii; the 2013 festival was headlined by deadmau5 and Above & Beyond. In 2014, the headliners were Calvin Harris, Armin van Buuren, and Iggy Azalea. Veld has featured performances by Oliver Heldens, Nero, Ingrosso, What So Not, DVBBS, Zedd, and Knife Party.\n\nOn 2 August 2015, the 2015 Veld festival of was cancelled due to a severe thunder storm warning.\n\nThe 2014 festival had two drug-related deaths — 20-year-old Annie Le of Toronto and 22-year-old Willard Amurao from the Greater Toronto Area, both of whom died after ingesting recreational drugs they had bought at the two-day event — as well as additional thirteen drug-related illnesses. Questions were raised about the circumstances of Amurao's death, prompting a Special Investigations Unit (Ontario's police watchdog) investigation due to him apparently being handcuffed by a Toronto police officer before receiving medical help. The police officer reportedly approached him after seeing him being carried by two men at which point the 22-year-old reportedly became violent and needed to be handcuffed. A month later, the Special Investigations Unit closed its investigation, concluding that Toronto police had \"nothing to do\" with Amurao's death, further stating the man was helped to an emergency medical area where he began to convulse and flail \"violently,\" and his movements prevented paramedics from treating him at which point a Toronto police officer handcuffed the man's hands to a stretcher so he could be treated while his one hand was later freed so that medication could be given to him. The SIU report also states the man was subsequently rushed to hospital and went into cardiac arrest en route at which point his remaining handcuffs were removed and the ambulance stopped, but he could not be revived by paramedics or hospital staff.\n\nIn reaction to the deaths, Toronto city councilor Giorgio Mammoliti released a statement saying festival organizers INK Entertainment, and INK chief executive Charles Khabouth were partially responsible for the deaths, \"due to their negligence and poor security measures\". Mammoliti's statement additionally blamed fellow councilors Gord Perks and Mike Layton for the deaths. Through its lawyer James Zibarras, INK Entertainment immediately demanded full retraction from Mammoliti, threatening legal action if one is not issued within 48 hours. On late Friday afternoon, 8 August 2014, almost a full day after the deadline set by INK's lawyer, Mammoliti formally retracted his earlier statement that blamed Khabouth and INK; the company didn't pursue legal action.\n\nWith its investigation focusing on party drugs from the very beginning, the Toronto police homicide squad investigation whose findings were announced almost a year later in late July 2015 concluded that the two drug-related deaths were accidental. The police also announced plans of installing so-called \"amnesty boxes\" at the 2015 Veld where attendees can deposit drugs without any legal consequences. The 2015 edition of Veld was subsequently cancelled due to a severe thunder storm warning.\n\nStilife was an upscale Toronto nightclub that ran from 1987 until 1995 in a 1920s six-storey brick building at the southwest corner of Richmond and Duncan Streets. Opening in October 1987 in the building's basement with a dirt floor, it was run in very hands-on fashion by young entrepreneur Charles Khabouth who leased the 6,000 square foot space at an extremely cheap rate of C$4 per square foot. Despite being located in a then-deserted part of Toronto's former Garment District, Stilife quickly managed to develop an image of exclusivity, becoming a favourite hangout for Toronto's posh crowd. The club was populated by attractive, well-heeled patrons that had to pass a strict door policy designed to attract glamorous, high-income clientele.\n\nSoon after opening Stilife, Khabouth sold Club Z, a Yonge and Wellesley area club that was his first entrepreneurial effort in the hospitality industry, in order to fully concentrate on his ambitious new venue. In complete contrast to Club Z that was open to anyone who wanted to dance, Khabouth went out of his way to make every single aspect of Stilife exclusive. The goal was attracting a more mature, sophisticated, and free-spending urban crowd rather than settling for suburban youth that many downtown Toronto clubs catered to at the time. Inspired by the look of the recently opened Diamond club at Sherbourne Street whose interior differed significantly from the standard brass-and-mirrors decor of the numerous clubs in the city, Khabouth devoted particular attention to his new venue's interior design. He hired Toronto-based Yabu Pushelberg design studio (consisting of George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg who would go on to achieve international renown, but were still largely unknown outside of the city) to come up with ideas for the club's interior. They traveled to New York City for inspiration, ending up with dark, sculptured aesthetic and edgy, industrial design, which featured a heavy use of polished steel, concrete, and mosaic tile. The chain walls created by long chains hanging off the club's ceiling were a particularly big draw. Furthermore, Stilife's core interior elements referenced Art Deco, Salvador Dalí, and \"Blade Runner\".\n\nIn addition to attracting the rich of Toronto, Stilife soon gained a reputation as a celebrity hangout with notable guests such as Madonna (dropped by in late May 1990 during her Blond Ambition World Tour), George Michael, and Prince further fueling its success and enhancing its status.\n\nIn terms of the music played, Stilife covered a wide range of sounds and themed nights. Many Toronto DJs worked the venue, but two left their mark especially — Richard Vermeulen who was the resident on Tuesdays for most of the club's run and JC Sunshine whose residency was Fridays. Vermeulen particularly proved adept at combining genres, spinning an eclectic mix that covered the range from Ted Nugent's \"Stranglehold\" over to James Brown, disco, funk, and hard rock, until Bomb the Bass' \"Beat Dis\", Eric B. & Rakim's \"Paid in Full\", and Baby Ford's \"Oochy Coochy\". DJ Mark Oliver joined Stilife in 1990 after the closure of Tazmanian Ballroom and became resident on Mondays that were popular with voguing gay men; for Oliver this marked the beginning of a long collaboration with Khabouth and Ink that would later continue in his other clubs.\n\nBy early 1990s numerous new nightclubs opened along Richmond Street West and Adelaide Street West as well as in adjoining streets within the area bound by Front St., Queen Street West, Bathurst St., and Simcoe St. all of which was a consequence of low rent in the said area and Khabouth's success with Stilife there. Among them were: Go-Go (a three-level superclub opened by the Ballinger brothers in 1990 across the street from Stilife at the north-west corner of Richmond & Duncan), 23 Hop (a minimalist all-ages club opened by Wesley Thuro during summer 1990 in a warehouse down the street from Stilife at 318 Richmond that would soon become a catalyst for the Toronto rave scene), Venus, Klub Max (a huge venue started in 1990 by Nick DiDonato and Angelo Belluz in a heritage building on Peter St. just south of King Street West that previously housed DiDonato's P.M. Toronto sports bar and restaurant), LimeLight (in 1993 by businessman Zisi Konstantinou at 250 Adelaide Street West near the corner with Duncan Street), My Apartment (a club in an old shoe factory building at 81 Peter Street playing Top 40 music), and Club 606. At the same time, Khabouth for his part attempted, and mostly failed, to expand into fine dining with his involvement in several restaurants — Boa Cafe, Oceans, Acrobat, and Bellair Cafe — quickly ending, either via him pulling out of the venture or the venues folding. Most of those restaurants were in the Yorkville upscale neighbourhood where in 1992 he also opened Skorpio nightclub that closed by 1994. In late 1995 after eight years of successful operation, Khabouth sold Stilife, describing the decision as being motivated by his desire to expand and the inability to do so at the Richmond and Duncan location due to space, capacity, and ceiling height constraints.\n\nRight away in 1995, Fluid nightclub opened at the location vacated by Stilife. The new club was also successful, continuing until 2009 including a slight mid-2000s makeover and re-branding as Fluid Lounge. In February 2010 Pop Nightclub opened in the same location, but folded quickly. Over the coming decades Khabouth has occasionally organized one-off Stilife retro parties in Toronto under the 'A Return To Stilife' moniker.\n\nIn late 1989, emboldened by the rapid success of his Stilife nightclub, 27-year-old Charles Khabouth opened Oceans restaurant in the same building as a companion piece, attempting to transfer some of the nightclub's sexy upscale vibe into the dining setting. He recruited celebrity chef Greg Couillard and the restaurant even got featured on the \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" TV show. However, things quickly started to unravel and by July 1990 Couillard quit, taking most of the kitchen staff with him. His replacement was Susur Lee, another high-profile chef, but he only lasted a few weeks. The restaurant got merged into Stilife by year's end.\n\nThe high-profile failure of Oceans got Khabouth a bit of a tarnished reputation on the Toronto entertainment scene that followed him in various forms throughout subsequent decades as far as his involvement with dining is concerned — the charge that food is secondary in his restaurants. Joanne Kates, \"The Globe and Mail\" food critic at the time, claimed \"Khabouth never intended the food to be important at Oceans\", further stating that the restaurant imploded \"once he realized he couldn't run it as a club and efficiently make money\". Khabouth identified the inability of celebrity chefs to subordinate as the main reason for Oceans failure: \"I had a hard time working with some of these chefs. With celebrity chefs, it's like you work for them\".\n\nOpened in Yorkville in October 1989 as a collaboration between Khabouth (at the time owner of successful upscale nightclub Stilife) and fellow young Lebanese-Canadian Rony Hitti, Boa Café was a venue that brought fine dining and club culture together.\n\nHitti, who studied finance and politics at York University while DJing at various Toronto clubs during the 1980s befriended Khabouth at Stilife. Traveling to Montreal together, the two went to a place called Lola's Paradise and thought Toronto could use a similar venue — a late-night dining spot catering to the Stilife crowd that had very few eating options after the 1 a.m. last call. They found a spot at 25 Bellair Street that previously housed a daytime coffee shop and after extensive renovations opened Boa Café to much fanfare in October 1989 as 50/50 partners. Chic and trendy, Boa served food and drinks from noon until late night five days a week. Though the venue received plenty of positive notices in local press, it faced financial problems in its first year. These issues coincided with the problems Khabouth was experiencing with Stilife due to the Oceans restaurant that he opened as an adjoining piece in the same building. The relationship between Hitti and Khabouth soured and by 1991 the two decided to go their separate ways.\n\nHitti took over the venue, reorganized it by making it more focused on food than drinking. It continued running with much success until 1998.\n\nDespite his continued success with Stilife nightclub in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Khabouth experienced trouble expanding into the dining aspect of the hospitality industry with his involvement in two high-profile restaurants - Boa Café and Oceans - quickly turning sour.\n\nAlmost immediately, Khabouth jumped into another high-profile project, again in Yorkville, but this time in partnership with established Toronto restaurateur Franco Prevedello. Following numerous delays and C$1.4 million in renovations, they opened Acrobat in June 1992 at 1221 Bay Street, catering to upscale Yorkville clientele with a restaurant-nightclub hybrid. However, their relationship quickly soured and Khabouth got out of the venture the same year, selling his share to Prevedello. Apparently, they weren't seeing eye to eye due to Khabouth wanting to make Acrobat a supper club where people dined and danced while Prevedello was only interested in the dining part. The restaurant continued under Prevedello until 1994.\n\nThe famous Bellair Café in Yorkville at 100 Cumberland St. had been closed for four years when Khabouth decided to revive it in 1995. It first opened in 1981 under the ownership of famous Toronto restaurateur and nightclub owner Tom Kristenbrun who had by this time already been involved with the El Mocambo live music venue and the upscale Bemelmans restaurant. Like Bemelmans, Kristenbrun's other fine dining Yorkville menu, nearby Bellair Café also became a place to see and be seen, attracting local stars like Bryan Adams as well as visiting celebrities such as Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, and Robert Altman, especially during The Festival of Festivals (later renamed the Toronto International Film Festival). The celebrity practice of starting the evening off with a cocktail party at Bellair Café before going to their movie's gala opening and afterwards winding up at The Copa nightclub for dancing became well established at the festival.\n\nIn 1991, Kristenbrun, who in the meantime opened and established additional lucrative fine dining properties such as Rhodes near Yonge & St. Clair and Bistro 990 on Bay & Wellesley, got out of the Bellair Café venture and the venue closed.\n\nIn 1995, Khabouth (who had already established himself as the owner of influential Stilife nightclub and was in the process of taking over the RPM nightclub, but nevertheless also had a recent string of failed fine dining ventures) decided to try again by resuscitating the famous Bellair Café at the same spot. Staying with the same upscale concept, Bellair under Khabouth continued to attract celebrities as well as movie industry movers and shakers such as Harvey Weinstein. It closed less than two years later in 1997, this time for good. Right away, a new restaurant, Sassafraz, opened at Bellair's spot and also went on to become very popular.\n\nThe Guvernment was the name of a nightclub complex in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1996, it was incarnated from the former RPM nightclub, which closed its doors after ten years at the same location. Kool Haus was often used as a venue for concerts and live performances. In 2008, The Guvernment was voted #8 nightclub in the world in DJMag's Top 100 Clubs. Additional concept rooms included Haven, The Gallery, Surface, Chroma and the rooftop patio, Skybar. The complex was located directly across from Lake Ontario, in downtown Toronto. The Guvernment / KoolHaus complex was Canada’s largest and longest running entertainment complex, with a capacity of over 5000. This complex hosted Tiësto, Coldplay, Deadmau5, Avicii, Afrojack, Bob Dylan, Lady Gaga, David Guetta, Common, N.E.R.D, The Black Eyed Peas, Armin Van Buuren, and many more over the years. Popular events held in this complex included \"Decadence\" and \"Labour of Love\".\n\nThe Guvernment and Koolhaus Entertainment Complex closed its doors on January 31, 2015 and is expected to be replaced by a mixed-use project.\n\nJapanese cuisine restaurant Ame opened in September 2009 on 19 Mercer Street in the Toronto Entertainment District as a collaboration between Khabouth and the Rubino brothers (Michael and Guy) at the spot where the Rubinos had previously for almost ten years co-owned and operated Rain, a club-like pan-Asian restaurant. Rain closed down in January 2009 for modest renovations as the Rubinos planned on adding a sushi and sashimi bar and quickly re-opening. However, in the meantime, they went into business with Ink's Charles Khabouth who convinced them to completely change up the concept. The venue thus re-opened with a new name (Ame), new concept (high end Japanese food), new completely renovated space, and Khabouth as the new business partner.\n\nIn October 2010, Ame held a lavish one-year anniversary party. In June 2011 a re-zoning application was submitted to the City of Toronto from a real estate developer wishing to build a residential condominium building on the plot currently occupied by two old buildings, specifically units from 15 to 35 Mercer Street including Ame at the time. The application was eventually rejected.\n\nAme closed in August 2011 with Michael Rubino attributing its failure to a \"difference in vision\" between him and Khabouth. After renovations that lasted through the second part of 2012, Khabouth opened Buonanotte at the same location in January 2013 as a licensed offshoot of the eponymous Montreal restaurant.\n\nBriscola opened in February 2011 at 501 College St. near Palmerston Boulevard in Little Italy as a collaboration between Khabouth and Syrian-born Toufik Sarwa at the same spot where Sarwa's short-lived Cinq 01 previously operated.\n\nHowever, Briscola also turned out to have very short lifespan, closing in 2012. By June 2012 Mexican restaurant La Carnita co-owned by Andrew Richmond and Amin Todai opened in its spot.\n\nAfter getting introduced to one another in 2011, Ink's Charles Khabouth and Icon Legacy's Hanif Harji forged a business collaboration that began with their October 2011 purchase of the Storys building and continued by opening two restaurants on King West in 2012 — Weslodge Saloon and Patria. By summer 2013 they were ready to launch yet another joint venue — The Cocktail Parlor at Storys, a cocktail lounge on the second floor of the building they acquired almost two years prior.\n\nInspired by a bar called The Aviary in Chicago, The Cocktail Parlour featured an extensive 60-cocktail menu along with snacks overseen by executive chef Stuart Cameron who simultaneously performed the same duties at Weslodge and Patria, the other two Khabouth-Harji venues at the time along with decor that referenced the prohibition era as well as 1920s and 1930s in general. With its opening timed for the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, The Cocktail Parlor hosted numerous celebrity parties in its first month of operation.\n\nWith the March 2014 launch of Byblos restaurant on the Storys building ground floor, The Cocktail Parlor soon closed permanently.\n\nProduct, previously known as This is London until late 2012, was a multilevel nightclub featuring numerous bars, various private lounges, and a ladies spa all with a capacity of 1,200 people. It was set in a renovated 1936 warehouse at 364 Richmond Street West near the corner of Richmond West & Peter in Toronto's Entertainment District.\n\nThe 364 Richmond West building first got converted into a nightclub in 2000. After four years of operation, the venue got acquired by INK Entertainment in 2004. Having gone through several names already, the nightlife venue eventually became known as This is London. INK's idea for the offering of This is London was combining electronic music with Toronto's mid-to-late 2000s upscale scene. To that end, a steady stream of celebrities including Paris Hilton, Jon Jones, Michael Sorrentino, Usher, Kardinal Offishall, etc. came through the club's doors. On the musical side, Fridays at the club, billed as Soho Fridays, proved popular — featuring numerous house music acts such as Deniz Koyu, Kaskade, Moby, DJ AM, Chus & Ceballos, Morgan Page, Mark Knight, Fedde le Grand, Steve Aoki, Carl Cox, Benny Benassi, etc.\n\nBy late 2012, This is London re-branded to Product.\n\nFrom mid 2014, Barcode, night spot with capacity of 450 people, opened on the upper level of Product nightclub. Product closed in late May 2015 with the remaining parties moved to the Polson Pier complex, specifically the Solarium venue that was for these occasions billed as Barcode by the Lake. The reason for Product's closing had to do with the overall trend of residential condos and office buildings being built in the area; after the 364 Richmond West building found itself next to a commercial and office space, the building's landlord offered to buy the nightclub out of its remaining lease.\n\nIn December 2014, Città opened in the CityPlace neighbourhood as a three-way partnership between INK's Khabouth, ICON's Harji, and Adam Brown, the owner of Fox & Fiddle pub franchise in Toronto. Located on the ground floor of a Concord Pacific condo tower at 92 Fort York Blvd and serving casual Italian cuisine, the owners' initial idea was to treat the 80-seat venue with a 100-person patio as a base to be grown over time into a franchise with a possible second location at Adelaide West & John already under construction. They hired Ben Heaton who previously worked at Claudio Aprile's Colborne Lane and Mark McEwan's ONE to be Città's first executive chef. The partners also brought on David Mattachioni, a 14-year veteran of the Terroni company, to train the staff and run Città's pizza oven as well as head baker Carlo Lazzarino also of Terroni.\n\nEarly reviews focused on Città's decor being more modest than other \"luxe, spare-no-expense design\" Khabouth-Harji eateries and its food not being top-notch when compared with \"Old World cooking throughout the city\". The restaurant tried to generate some buzz by hosting promotions such as a September 2015 pop-up from prominent Brooklyn hipster pizzeria Roberta's, however, Città continually struggled for patrons compared to other CityPlace neighbourhood eateries like Hunter's Landing. With the same trio of Khabouth, Harji, and Brown opening Figo in November 2015 at Adelaide West & John, site once touted as Città's potential second location, Città's days looked to be numbered. The restaurant closed in late December 2015 with further news about its owners hiring chef Guillermo Herbertson of Barsa Taberna to develop a new Mexican-inspired restaurant concept for an April 2016 opening at the same location focusing largely on inexpensive snack and finger foods.\n\nTattoo, previously known as Tattoo Queen West and Tattoo Rock Parlour, was a nightclub and live performance venue.\n\nIt opened in December 2007 as Tattoo Rock Parlour via INK's partnership with Nick Di Donato's Liberty Entertainment Group and King Street tattoo shop Black Line Studios. Its co-owners Khabouth and Di Donato reportedly spent C$2.5 million on renovating the space before the launch. Initially advertised as Canada's only tattoo parlor and bar, Tattoo included a two-level event space that could hold over 400 people. Compared to other Queen West rock clubs such as Velvet Underground and the longstanding Bovine Sex Club, Tattoo was going more for designer décor. Its location at 567 Queen Street West was previously, from 1993 until 2004, occupied by the Di Donato-owned Left Bank nightclub (with Crystal Room lounge bar inside it).\n\nInitially, Tattoo offered a food menu with items ranging from mac-and-cheese to steak.\n\nShifting between live bands and DJ nights, Tattoo has hosted live performances from the likes of Dragonette (performed the 2008 New Year's concert on 31 December 2007), The Killers, Nickelback, Broken Social Scene (performed on 24 September 2008 as part of the inaugural Verge Music Awards), and M.I.A. (performed on 3 May 2014 as part of Canadian Music Week). Additionally, it welcomed various celebrities via either event after parties or paid appearances such as Avril Lavigne, Gene Simmons (hosted a party on 14 September 2010 during TIFF), Drew Barrymore (attended \"Whip It\" after-party on 13 September 2009), and Slash (stopped by with bodyguards and partied on 10 September 2010 as part of a paid appearance following a live concert at Kool Haus, another one of Khabouth's venues).\n\nINK sold the venue during spring 2016.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13156099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13156099", "title": "Lapa, Rio de Janeiro", "text": "Lapa, Rio de Janeiro\n\nLapa is a neighborhood in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. It is located in the centre of Rio and is famous for its historical monuments and nightlife.\n\nThe neighborhood is home to the Arcos da Lapa, an impressive aqueduct constructed in the mid-18th century by colonial authorities. Another important historical attraction is the Passeio Público, the first public park of the city, built in the 1780s.\n\nSince the early 1950s, Lapa has been known for its lively cultural life where there is a concentration of many restaurants and bars where Brazilian artists and intellectuals would meet. It was, and still is, famous for its many restaurants, bars and clubs where the various forms of Brazilian music can be appreciated, like the \"Asa Branca\" bar and the \"Fundição Progresso\". The Sala Cecília Meireles, an important venue for chamber music, is also located in Lapa.\n\nThe neighborhood of Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, known as the cradle of bohemian Rio is also famous for its architecture, starting with the Arcos - known as the Arcos da Lapa, constructed to act as conduit in the days of colonial Brazil and now serve as a signal for the cable cars that climb the hill of Santa Teresa.\n\nThe Carioca Aqueduct is considered the architectural work of greater importance of Old Rio and one of the main symbols of the city. The impressive Roman-style building is 17.6 meters high, 270 meters long and 42 arches that connect the neighborhood of Santa Teresa to Morro de Santo Antônio. The Carioca Aqueduct was built in 1723, during the colonial Brazil, and was intended to lead water from the Carioca river height Morro do Desterro, on Santa Teresa for the Morro de Santo Antônio. The work would help solve the problem of water shortage in the city. Problem that was already old. Studies to bring the waters of the Carioca river to the city began in the early years of the seventeenth century, but the works of installing water pipes in Rio de Janeiro did not start until a century later.\n\nIn recent times the landscape of Lapa has been significantly amended. Where was the Square of the Brazilian armed forces (a square attached to the arches) today there is a huge Circo Voador. Arches Street, which crosses the aqueduct, was via a building occupied by trees, including the Progress Casting, which is now a venue. The neighborhood is born at the end of the south, where the road of glory becomes Rua da Lapa. Also on the border of Santa Teresa, climbing its slopes and the small neighborhood of Fátima.\n\nIn an attempt to rescue the vocation of the residential district was created the Movement \"I am from Lapa\". Inspired by the famous advertising campaign \"I love NY\", who helped revitalize the American city that was in decline in the 1970s, the movement seeks to rescue the pride of saying \"I'm from Lapa \". With government support and participation of the majority of shops in Lapa, the \"I am from Lapa\" was spread around town, but with few effective achievements in the area of security, rehabilitation of the homeless and combating crime, old complaints from residents public authorities.\n\nWith the population density in other regions of the city and increased traffic, the neighborhood, which holds the headquarters and administrative buildings for many large companies (Petrobras, BNDES, etc..) As well as numerous commercial buildings of high standard on Chile Avenue (Ventura I and II, etc..), has also attracted the attention of residents of the north, south and west of Rio de Janeiro, eager to live close to work, downtown, escaping from traffic jams. Therefore, newly launched residential projects providing comprehensive infrastructure or structure apart-hotel (Viva Lapa, Cores da Lapa, etc..) Have exhausted their sales in full release, which clearly shows the pent-up demand for housing in standard high in the neighborhood.\n\nReference point for lovers of nightlife, one of the striking features of the neighborhood is the harmony that living with the most diverse urban tribes. Since the 1950s, when it began to be called the \"Montmartre Carioca\", Lapa attracted intellectuals, artists, politicians and especially the people of Rio, who come together to celebrate the samba, forró, MPB (música popular brasileira), choro and more recently, electronic music and rock.\n\nFor the major pathways, Mem de Sá, Rua do Riachuelo Street and Lavradio, spread attractions such as the Sala Cecilia Meireles, who is considered one of the best concert of chamber music existing in Rio.\n\nThe Public Promenade, the National School of Music, the Church of Our Lady of Lapa do Desterro and the Escadaria Selarón are references to the tourist who wants to see a sample of the architecture of old Rio.\n\nAs highlights of the night, there are the famous Asa Branca, the main stronghold of forró, bars Seed, where there have been artists such as Teresa and the group Casuarina, Ernesto, Coffee Cultural Sacrilege beyond the River and Scenarium Carioca da Gema, where absolute reign wheels samba. Recently opened the gaff Lapa 40 Graus, in Brook Street next to the traditional Democratic Club, which had space for the dance, the samba, choro and gaff. \nFor the public that prefers electronic music and rock concerts, there is the Progress and Casting Flying Circus, opened in 2004. There is also a plethora of bars and venues that cater to all tastes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9492809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9492809", "title": "Le Grand David", "text": "Le Grand David\n\nOn February 20, 2012, Le Grand David and His Spectacular Magic Company celebrated its 35th anniversary. The company was then the longest consecutively running stage magic show in the world, according to Guinness World Records. Marco the Magi (Cesareo Pelaez) started the show in the 1970s. The family-oriented stage magic show ran most Sundays at the Cabot Street Cinema Theatre and some Thursdays at the Larcom Theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts through the Spring of 2012.\n\nOn February 20, 1977, with little advance publicity, \"Le Grand David and his own Spectacular Magic Company\" made its debut on the stage of the Cabot Street Cinema Theatre, and ran for 35 years. In 1985, the Le Grand David Company opened a second two-hour spectacle of magic, music, comedy, and dance at Beverly's other antique playhouse, the Larcom Theatre. The two productions showcase: over 1000 costumes, 700 entrances and exits, 100 classic illusions, 45 backdrops, 35 years in a small town, 4 hours of stage magic, and 2 antique theaters. The shows were produced, directed, designed and choreographed by Marco the Magi.\n\nIn the spring of 2012 it was announced that \n\nAn auction of props, artwork, bronzes and memorabilia was held on February 23, 2014. With over 200 items available, the auction was conducted by Kaminski Auctioneers.\n\nMarco the Magi (Cesareo Pelaez, October 16, 1932 - March 24, 2012) is billed as the troupe’s founder, producer, director, designer, and choreographer. He was also a star in both productions. He began to organize his troupe in the early 1970s and brought it to Beverly. The aging Cabot Cinema became available in 1976, and the company Marco already had been forming acquired the playhouse outright. A biography of Cesareo Pelaez (Wonderful Surprises, author Avrom Surath) was published in April 2007 (second, updated edition in March 2012) relating Pelaez's early experiences growing up in Cuba, his work with noted psychologist Abraham Maslow, his founding Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company, and his ongoing work with the company to 2012, the year of his death.\n\nLe Grand David (David Bull) began as an apprentice to Marco in the early 1970s, and is a generation younger than Marco. According to magic historian Stuart Cramer, “Le Grand David is an extraordinarily skillful magician and showman. He adds youth, verve, and graceful motion to a show filled with color and action. David’s manipulation of the Zombie [floating silver ball] is the best I have ever even the immortal Neil Foster’s.” (MAGICOL: A Journal of the Magic Collectors’ Association, November, 1993)\n\nBy 1976, the Cabot Cinema seemed on the downslope of its career, offering last-run movies for pocket change. A corporation called White Horse Productions was formed to buy and renovate it. Spearheading the project was the man now known as Marco the Magi, aided by business and artistic friends. The Cabot was kept open as a movie house, renamed the Cabot Street Cinema Theatre with a revamped film program.\n\nMeanwhile, the troupe undertook a concentrated effort to restore her full stage, which lay thick with the dust of fifty years’ disuse. Office space above Cabot Street was transformed into workshops for carpenters, painters, and seamstresses. The hundreds of props and scenic elements turned out during six months’ work were gradually put into play in after-hours rehearsals. An entertainment calendar published every two weeks began announcing the debut of a stage attraction just after holiday time 1976.\n\nOn a day remembered for heavy snow and a sizable, receptive house, Le Grand David and his own Spectacular Magic Company premiered Sunday, February 20, 1977. Headed by Marco and his one-time apprentice David, the company of several dozen performers gave weekly Sunday matinée performances until mid-May. Then a second Sunday show was added, at 8:15 p.m. By mid-summer even this schedule was not enough to meet demand. “The Whirlwind of Enchantment” offered eighteen shows in a fortnight. Boston-area theatergoers and the regional media were beginning to catch wind of Beverly’s enchantment.\n\nIt would be three years before the story went international, carried around the globe by the likes of TIME and Smithsonian magazines and an enthralled magic press. Robert Lund (1920–1995), founder and curator of the American Museum of Magic in Marshall, Michigan, dubbed it “the finest magic show in the world today.”\n\nThe Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company soon became a cultural institution. Seven performances at the White House in Washington, D.C., over 40 cover stories in magic periodicals followed. Robert Lund wrote, “Of all the practitioners of the presto trade in the U.S., none has better credentials to the title of America’s national magic company than Le Grand David.” The esteemed British magic historian and collector Dr. Edwin Dawes called the Beverly bafflers “magicdom’s most incredible venture.”\n\nBuilding on the success of the Cabot effort, the Le Grand David Spectacular Magic Company purchased the Larcom Theatre, just four blocks away, in 1984 and launched a restoration project that dwarfed their previous Cabot Street Cinema Theatre restoration . The Larcom received a balcony-to-boiler-room renovation. In October 1985 the Le Grand David troupe premiered a second resident production of conjuring, music, comedy and dance “in the style and tradition of the turn of the last century.” \"An Anthology of Stage Magic\" continues to play there.\n\nIn 1995, the Le Grand David Company opened an expanded wing adjoining the original Larcom structure. The new wing includes: the Grand Salon lobby appointed in oak, marble, and brass, rehearsal place, three galleries of Le Grand David apparatus and poster artwork, a library, a meeting room, a guest suite, and a caretaker's apartment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31588507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31588507", "title": "Media Practice Model", "text": "Media Practice Model\n\nThe Media Practice Model is a media effects model used within the area of mass communication. This model was developed by Jeanne R. Steele and Jane D. Brown in 1995, and it takes a practice perspective which means that it focuses on everyday activities and routines of media consumption. This theoretical framework was developed to better understand what drives teenagers to pick one media source over another, and what factors play a role in this decision. The Media Practice Model emphasizes the constant interaction between consumers and the media, and focuses on the dialectical aspect of this interaction, suggesting that it is the adolescents’ individual characteristics, environment and daily practices that allow the media to have stronger or weaker effects on them (Steele & Brown, 1995).\n\nThe model was developed based on a study that progressed from 1987 through 1993, and used a variety of methods such as daily journals, in-depth interviews, self-administered questionnaires and “room touring” to understand, as the Steele and Brown call it, the adolescents’ “room culture.” This environment was chosen based on the facts that adolescents’ bedrooms are usually cluttered with different media materials and sources, as well as the fact that this is a place where adolescents spend a good part of their day. This is also a place that provides an intimate environment where adolescents can experiment with possible selves (Markus & Nurius, 1986). The Media Practice Model was based on the findings of this first study, and the incorporation of other media effects theories such as Selective Exposure Theory, Uses and Gratifications, Framing, Cultivation theory, and Emotional Conditioning.\n\nThe Media Practice Model proposed by Steele and Brown has the concepts of selection, interaction and application as the three main components, but also takes into account one’s identity and lived experience. Identity formation is the key component of this model and it represents the main task of adolescent formation (Steele & Brown, 1995). It is believed that adolescents’ sense of who they are influences their interactions with the media, and those interactions in turn influence their sense of who they are, in what Steele and Brown call an ongoing process of cultural production and reproduction. The theoretical perspective of “lived through experience” (Vygotsky, 1978), also takes into account the developmental stage, the sociocultural differences based on gender, class, and race, as well as other factors such as religious beliefs, interactions within one’s neighborhood, school, family, friends circle, and so on. This concept of “lived experience” emphasizes the idea that adolescents’ interaction with the media does not happen in a vacuum. It is argued that the continuous dialectal relationship between the other four components of the Media Practice Model, selection, interaction, application, and identity, all occur within the context of “lived experience (Steele & Brown, 1995).” \n\nSelection, within the Media Practice Model, is simply defined as the act of choosing among media related alternatives (Steele & Brown, 1995). Selection is influenced by motivations, which in turn affects attention to the media selected. In this context, the concept of motivation is defined based on previous theories such as selective exposure and uses and gratifications theory. This means that a teenager’s motivation to attend to certain media might be based on affective, behavioral, cognitive and instrumental needs, or it could also simply be a result of habituation (Steele & Brown, 1995). As far as factoring in “lived experience”, in their initial study Steele and Brown found that selection is also influenced by gender and race. Thus, boys were more likely to be more interested in media that dealt with sports, and this was also reflected in how their rooms were decorated. Also, an African-American girl was more interested in magazines and certain types of music that reflected her ethnic heritage. \n\nInteraction is defined as the cognitive, affective, and behavioral engagement with the media that produces cultural meanings, which are affected by adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of the media content. In terms of practice, interaction was conceptually defined as what is actually happening at the moment adolescent use the media (Steele & Brown, 1995). As noted in the definition, adolescents can interact with the media on different levels such as cognitive (processing information), affective (arousal), or behavioral (dancing, channel surfing, etc.). However, researchers in communication have been more concerned with the cognitive and affective interactions, and adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of media content are clearly more closely related to those two types of interactions.\n\nThe concept of “lived experience” was shown to have a role in the interaction component of the model as well. As found by Steele and Brown, racial understanding, class and gender also affected how teenagers interpreted and evaluated the messages conveyed by the media.\n\nApplication is defined as the concrete ways in which adolescents use media in their everyday lives (Steele & Brown, 1995). The Media Practice Model looks at two different types of application: appropriation and incorporation.\n\nBased on reviewers’ critiques that the concepts of incorporation and appropriation are one and the same thing, and also based on a new study performed in 1999, Steele slightly revised this component of the Media Practice Model. Based on the study, Steele noticed that within the application component of the model, a new factor stood out: resistance. Resistance was defined as “teens’ practice of using media to open up a space for combating the status quo (Steele, 1999).” This suggests that when adolescents feel marginalized they engage with media that go against the dominant culture. This way they become fans of movies that depict drug usage, are graphically violent or show sexually explicit material, or start listening to less culturally popular genres of music such as hard rock or heavy metal (Steele, 1999). \nBesides contributing to the Media Practice Model through the discussed revision to the application component, Steele’s (1999) study also provided more depth to the “lived experience” component. It demonstrated more explicitly how one’s race, gender, and developmental stage plays an important role in their media practices and choices. Also, while acknowledging the importance of media content, this study puts more emphasis on media practice rather than on media content or media effects.\n\nSince it was first introduced by Steele and Brown in 1995, and then revised in 1999 by Steele, the Media Practice Model has been used by other researchers in different contexts; however, this model has experienced modest popularity. One of the main drawbacks of this model is its general scope and simplified description of media use. Even so, this model allows for the integration of a whole multitude of variables within its main components, and offers scholars the possibility to use it for more in-depth investigative purposes if desired.\n"}
{"id": "2535952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2535952", "title": "Minchiate", "text": "Minchiate\n\nMinchiate is an early 16th-century card game, originating in Florence, Italy. It is no longer widely played. \"Minchiate\" can also refer to the special deck of 97 playing cards used in the game. The deck is closely related to the tarot cards, but contains an expanded suit of trumps. The game was similar to but more complex than tarocchi. The minchiate represents a Florentine variant on the original game.\n\nFlorence is one of the contenders for the birthplace of tarot. The earliest reference to tarot cards, then known as trionfi, is dated to 1440 when a notary in Florence recorded the transfer of two decks to Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta.\n\nThe word \"minchiate\" comes from a dialect word meaning \"nonsense\" or \"trifle\", derived from \"mencla,\" the vulgar form of \"mentula\", a Latin word for \"phallus\". The word \"minchione\" is attested in Italian as meaning \"fool\", and \"minchionare\" means \"to laugh at\" someone. The intended meaning may be \"the game of the fool\", considering that the card \"The Fool\", also called \"The Excuse\", features prominently in the game play of all tarot games. In tarocchini, \"sminchiate\" is a signal used to communicate to a teammate.\n\nThe earliest reference to minchiate is found in a 1466 letter by Luigi Pulci to Lorenzo de' Medici. However, this game was believed to be played by a 78-card deck as evidenced by the Rosenwald sheets, uncut sheets of Florentine tarots dated from 1480 to 1500. There are two other differences from 97-card minchiate. First, in 97-card minchiate the sequence for some of the lower trumps goes from lowest to highest: Fortitude, Justice, Wheel, and Chariot. In the Rosenwald ordering it is Justice, Fortitude, Chariot, and Wheel. Second, the Rosenwald sheets contains the Popess as the second trump which is not found in the 97-card deck. In a Florentine song written around 1500, the trumps in a tarot deck were listed as almost exactly as the Rosenwald sheets with the exception of the missing Popess which likely means that this card was dropped from the deck by that time. The song also ranks the other trumps as Fortitude, Justice, Chariot, and Wheel, which suggests it is a transitional stage from the Rosenwald sheets to the 97-card deck's order.\n\n97-card minchiate was first known as \"germini\", after the Gemini (XXXV) card, the highest of the newly introduced trumps. The earliest record of germini dates to 1506. This deck was created by inserting the 20 new trumps as a single block between trump 15 and The Star, which is now trump 36. The new deck proved so much more popular that the 77-card deck ceased production and the older name of minchiate was transferred over to the larger deck during the 17th century. The game spread from Florence to the rest of Italy and France during that century. In Sicily, it was called \"gallerini\" while in Liguria it was known as \"ganellini\" but the rules used in these regions are lost save for cryptic references that they were quite different from the Florentine game. All surviving rules are derived from the type played in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States.\n\nBy the 18th century, minchiate had overtaken the original game of tarot in popularity in Italy. Paolo Minucci published a commentary on the game in 1676, and the game is described in detail by Romain Merlin in \"Origine des cartes à jouer\", published in Paris in 1869. It was also known in Germany during the late 18th century. The game was still played in Genoa in the 1930s, but its popularity declined in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nThe minchiate deck differs from other tarot decks in several features. The first and most obvious difference is that the trumps have almost doubled in number; there are 40 trumps in the minchiate, in addition to the unnumbered card the Madman, The Fool or the excuse. Minchiate uses additive Roman numerals for its trumps. Due to the large number of trumps, players generally called them by their number with the exception of the \"arie\".\n\nMinchiate decks come in two standard patterns, earlier and later, which coexisted for almost two centuries. Earlier Minchiate dates from the early 16th century or even the late 15th century. There are the four standard Latin suits of swords, batons, coins, and cups; these contain pip cards from ace to ten, and four face cards: a jack, a knight, a queen, and a king. In the minchiate deck, however, in the suits of cups and coins, the \"knaves\" or \"pages\" (Italian \"fanti\") have been replaced by \"maids\" (\"fantine\"). The knights, mounted figures in the tarot of Marseilles and similar designs, are centaurs or sphinxes in many minchiate decks. The suits follow the Portuguese pattern with the exception of the batons which follows the northern Italian suit-system. This pattern died out around 1900.\n\nThe Republic of Lucca produced their own version of Minchiate decks which were very similar to the ones used in nearby Florence but with several graphical differences. Kings are seated under arches, knights are humans riding horses, all knaves are male, and the Fool is playing with a dog. This pattern died out in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe Later Minchiate pattern appeared around the early 18th century as a luxury edition. In this version, the eight highest trumps lose their red backgrounds. Around 1820, this pattern was redesigned to give it a flatter, plainer appearance with changes to a quarter of the trump and court cards while restoring the red background to the high trumps. This pattern survived in Liguria until the 1930s.\n\nThe trumps of the minchiate deck, and their corresponding tarot of Marseilles cards and the esoteric Rider-Waite tarot deck are:\nBy comparing the Rosenwald sheet with 16th century trump lists, the Popess (II) was likely dropped in the late 15th century which shifted every trump above the first down one rank. The Empress, Emperor, and Pope became the new II, III, and IIII respectively, the latter now wearing a secular crown as opposed to a papal tiara. Since the five lowest trumps were collectively known as the \"papi\" (popes), Love was added to this group after its demotion. The identification of middle \"papi\" was largely forgotten for centuries as players generally called cards by their number (pope 2, pope 3, etc.) French writer Romain Merlin (1869) is the only source that called trumps II, III, and IIII the Grand Duke, Western Emperor, and Eastern Emperor.\n\nJustice, Fortitude, and Temperance were three classical \"cardinal virtues\" depicted in the more familiar tarot trumps. The minchiate supplies the remaining cardinal virtue — Prudence — and inserts them with the three theological virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity. The only other deck to have the theological virtues was the Cary-Yale deck. This is the only deck to include all seven virtues.\n\nMinchiate is a southern tarot pattern so it shares many qualities with the Bolognese and Sicilian tarots as opposed to the western patterns like the tarot of Marseilles. While the Tower is called The House of God in the Marseilles tarot, it is called the House of the Devil or Hellmouth in the minchiate deck and it depicts a nude woman fleeing a burning building. The Moon depicts an astrologer studying the moon instead of the tarot of Marseilles howling dogs and lobster. The card corresponding to the Hermit is often called Time, or the Hunchback; it depicts an elderly man on crutches with an hourglass in the background. Like other southern decks, the final card in the series is not the World, but Judgement. The minchiate completes the series by adding all the zodiac signs (in random order) and the four classical elements.\n\nThe eight highest ranking trumps have a red background while the top five (the \"arie\") are unnumbered. A 98th card was made for some decks. It is a trump with a red background and is also unnumbered like the \"arie\". It depicts a nude woman running in a wheel, probably representing Fortuna. While 98-card decks were mentioned as being played in Sicily during the early 18th century, only a few examples from Genoa survive. It is uncertain how this card ranked and how it affected the versicole sequences in the game. Also unknown is how it relates to the 98-card version of the Minchiate Francesi described below.\n\nEducational decks were produced in Florence during the 18th century. Instead of the usual figures and pips, each card would have text explaining a certain topic. One history deck has each suit teaching the history of Assyria, Persia, Greece, or Rome with the trumps teaching myths and legends. Geography decks contained maps of the known world.\n\nThe Minchiate Francesi, also called Minchiate de Poilly after its attribution to engraver François de Poilly (1623–93) and his son (1666-1741) who had the same name, refer to 3 different French decks utilizing the same set of engravings. The first has 42 numbered trumps, the second has 40 numbered trumps and Momus as an unnumbered card and lacks the first's \"Le Chaos\" card, the third has 21 numbered trumps and Momus as an unnumbered card. The intended game for the first deck is unknown, but the second appears to be intended to be played like the Italian Minchiate while the third deck appears to be intended for ordinary Tarot (despite still being called a Minchiate deck). The order of the motifs for the two latter decks have been rearranged compared to the first deck to more closely resemble their Italian counterparts. All three decks have the same 56 plain suit cards with French suits with each suit representing a different continent; spades for Africa, hearts for Europe, clubs for the Americas, and diamonds for Asia. The engravings share motifs with both the Italian Minchiate and the Tarot Nouveau as well as taking unique motifs from Roman Mythology.\n\n98 cards with 42 trumps order:\n\n\n97 cards with 40 trumps and Fool order:\n\n\n78 cards with 21 trumps and Fool order:\n\n\nMysterious French suited decks produced by Piatnik of Vienna around 1930 also featured forty trumps. It resembles the Industrie und Glück decks used for Central European tarock. Like the 54-card Industrie und Glück pattern, the plain suits consists of only 32 cards while the 40 trumps feature rustic genre scenes. With the \"Sküs\" (the Fool), the total number of cards is 73. Compounding the mystery is that the packaging is in French. Industrie und Glück type decks are not known to have a community of players in any French speaking country while the game of Minchiate is thought to have been restricted to only a few players in Genoa by the 1930s.\n\nMinchiate can be played by two to four players with the most common version played by four players divided into two partnerships. The game, like other tarot games, is a trick taking game in which points are scored by capturing certain cards and sets of cards. As in most tarot games, the pip cards in cups and coins are in reverse order and play is counter-clockwise. The lowest five trumps were called \"papi\" (\"popes\") while the highest five trumps (Star, Moon, Sun, World, Trumpets) were called \"arie\" (\"airs\") and have a special high scoring value in the game. Minchiate is similar in many ways to tarocchini played in Bologna. In these games, combinations (melds) of cards are more important than the value of individual cards.\n\nThe last trick is worth 10 points. Trump 29 is a unique card, by itself it is worth nothing but when used in combinations (\"versicole\"), it is worth 5 points. \"Versicole\" are formed through a sequence of three or more of consecutive point cards. In addition, there are four irregular \"versicole\":\n\n\nAll \"versicole\" have to be declared at the beginning of the game. At the end of the round, each team will assemble \"versicole\" from their captured tricks. Trumps 1, 3, 13, 20, 28, 30-33, and 38 are considered valuable cards because they are required to form some \"versicole\" or to deny the opposition the same. The Fool can be added to every \"versicola\".\n\nThe minchiate deck was also used to play two games that don't use normal tarot rules, \"Al Palio\" and \"A sei tocchi\".\n\nThis is the simplest version of the game; it was not considered serious but only as an introduction to the more complex four player versions. Jetons are used to keep track of scoring. The dealer gives 25 cards to his opponent and himself. His opponent leads the first trick but instead of letting the dealer play, she declares any meld she has and scores. The dealer then declares his melds and scores. Each takes back their own cards and the dealer finishes the first trick. Players must follow suit. If they are unable to do so, they must play a trump. If unable to play a trump, then any card can be discarded. The winner of each trick immediately scores from the captured cards and leads to the next trick.\n\nThe Fool excuses the player from following suit, it can neither capture nor be captured. The player gives a worthless card from his trick pile in exchange to his opponent.\n\nAt the end of the round, each player adds to their running total the captured cards, melds from the captured cards, and the last trick bonus. The player who has captured more than 25 cards gets a bonus point for each extra card. The two players then compare their sums with the loser having to pay the winner the difference.\n\nAlthough no divination system using this pack of cards ever existed in previous centuries, and because of this allegorical and cosmological content, in recent years tarot occultists have proposed systems of divination and cartomancy that use the minchiate deck. In Charles Godfrey Leland's book 1890 book \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", an incantation is given that mentions the use of \"40 cards\", which are renamed in the spell as 40 gods who are being invoked to compel the goddess Laverna to do the caster's bidding. Paul Huson has speculated that these 40 cards are the 40 trumps of the minchiate deck. He has also pointed out that Leland's book \"Etruscan-Roman Remains in Popular Tradition\" (1892) contains a spell that is cast with \"tarocco\" cards, to invoke Janus.\n\nSpanish publisher \"Ediciones del Prado\" reproduced a deck from 1790 in 2004. Artist Constante Constantini (died 2006), through Italian publisher Solleone, has published \"Minchiate Fiorentine\", a modern redrawing of a woodcut design in 1980.\n\nThe Italian publisher \"Lo Scarabeo\" offers a reproduction of the \"Antiche Minchiate Etruria\", an engraved minchiate deck that originally appeared in 1725 but has added Roman numerals to the \"arie\". The Italian publisher \"Il Meneghello\" also made a reproduction of the same deck as \"Minchiate Fiorentine Etruria\". It leaves the \"arie\" unnumbered and reproduces the tax stamp on trump 30.\n\n\"Il Meneghello\" also made a reproduction, in regular and mini sizes, of the \"Minchiate Fiorentine\", a woodcut minchiate deck that originally appeared circa 1820.\n\nSolleone reproduced this deck in 1986.\n\nThe late tarot artist Brian Williams (died 2002) published a modern edition of the minchiate deck, which accompanies his book referenced below.\n\nConstantini also produced \"Nuove Minchiate Fiorentine\" with Solleone in 1981. Unlike the earlier deck, this one is based on his own personal style.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "288469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288469", "title": "Novelty song", "text": "Novelty song\n\nA novelty song is a comical or nonsensical song, performed principally for its comical effect. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music. The other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nNovelty songs are often a parody or humor song, and may apply to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance or TV programme. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical. For example, the 1966 novelty song \"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!\" has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a snare drum and tambourine.\n\nA book on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is \"The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)\", written by The KLF. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with \"Doctorin' the Tardis\", a 1988 dance remix mashup of the \"Doctor Who\" theme music released under the name of 'The Timelords.' It argued that (at the time) achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through market research, sampling and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove.\n\nNovelty songs were a major staple of Tin Pan Alley from its start in the late 19th century. They continued to proliferate in the early years of the 20th century, some rising to be among the biggest hits of the era. Varieties included songs with an unusual gimmick, such as the stuttering in \"K-K-K-Katy\" or the playful boop-boop-a-doops of \"I Wanna Be Loved By You\", which made a star out of Helen Kane and inspired the creation of Betty Boop; silly lyrics like \"Yes! We Have No Bananas\"; playful songs with a bit of double entendre, such as \"Don't Put a Tax on All the Beautiful Girls\"; and invocations of foreign lands with emphasis on general feel of exoticism rather than geographic or anthropological accuracy, such as \"Oh By Jingo!\", \"The Sheik of Araby\", and \"The Yodeling Chinaman\". These songs were perfect for the medium of Vaudeville, and performers such as Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker became well-known for such songs. Zez Confrey's 1920s instrumental compositions, which involved gimmicky approaches (such as \"Kitten on the Keys\") or maniacally rapid tempos (\"Dizzy Fingers\"), were popular enough to start a fad of novelty piano pieces that lasted through the decade.\n\nA 1940s novelty song was Spike Jones' 1942 \"Der Fuehrer's Face\", which included raspberries in its chorus. Tex Williams's \"Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)\" topped the \"Billboard\" best-sellers chart for six weeks and the country music chart for 16 weeks in 1947 and 1948. The 1953 #1 single \"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\" became notable both for its extensive airplay and the backlash from listeners who found it increasingly annoying. Satirists such as Stan Freberg and Tom Lehrer used novelty songs to poke fun at contemporary pop culture in the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nIn 1951, Frank Sinatra was paired in a CBS television special with TV personality Dagmar. Mitch Miller at Columbia Records became intrigued with the pairing and compelled songwriter Dick Manning to compose a song for the two of them. The result was \"Mama Will Bark\", a novelty song performed by Sinatra with interspersed spoken statements by Dagmar, saying things like \"mama will bark\", \"mama will spank\", and \"papa will spank\". The recording even includes the sound of a dog yowling. It is regarded by both music scholars and Sinatra enthusiasts to be perhaps the worst song he ever recorded. Sinatra would in fact record a few others before he left Columbia and joined Capitol Records in 1952.\n\nDickie Goodman faced a lawsuit for his 1956 novelty song \"The Flying Saucer\", which sampled snippets of contemporary hits without permission and arranged them to resemble interviews with an alien landing on Earth. Goodman released more hit singles in the same vein for the next two decades. \n\nAmong the more far out songs of this genre was the two released in 1956 by Nervous Norvus, \"Transfusion\" and \"Ape Call\". \n\nThe Coasters had novelty songs such as \"Charlie Brown\" and \"Yakety Yak\". \"Yakety Yak\" became a #1 single on July 21, 1958, and is the only novelty song (#346) included in the Songs of the Century. \"Lucky Ladybug\" by Billy and Lillie was popular in December 1958. Lonnie Donegan's 1959 cover of the 1924 novelty song \"Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)\" was a transatlantic hit, reaching #5 on the \"Billboard\" charts two years after its release; it was one of the earliest top-5 hits to come from the United Kingdom in the rock era, preceding the British Invasion.\n\nThree songs using a sped-up recording technique became #1 hits in the United States in 1958-59: David Seville's \"Witch Doctor\" and Ragtime Cowboy Joe, Sheb Wooley's \"The Purple People Eater\", and Seville's \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", which used a speeded-up voice technique to simulate three chipmunks' voices. The technique (which Dickie Goodman had also used on \"The Flying Saucer\") would inspire a number of other knockoffs, including The Nutty Squirrels and Russ Regan's one-off group Dancer, Prancer and Nervous.\n\nIn 1960, 16-year-old Brian Hyland had a novelty hit with the song \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\", by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss, which topped the \"Billboard\" single chart. The Trashmen reached the top 5 with \"Surfin' Bird\", a surf rock medley of two novelty songs originally recorded by The Rivingtons. In 1964, the Grammy for Best Country and Western Album was awarded to Roger Miller. Miller was known to sing novelty songs.\n\nIn 1965, \"A Windmill in Old Amsterdam\", a song written by Ted Dicks and Myles Rudge, became a UK hit for Ronnie Hilton. The song spent a total of 13 weeks on the UK Singles Chart peaking at No. 23 in the chart of 17 February 1965. The song's composers were granted an Ivor Novello Award in 1966 for the Year’s Outstanding Novelty Composition.\n\nChuck Berry's \"My Ding-a-Ling\" reached #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1972, and Ray Stevens, known for such novelty hits as \"Ahab the Arab\", \"Gitarzan\", and \"Mississippi Squirrel Revival\", had a #1 hit with \"The Streak\" in 1974. Comedy act Cheech & Chong recorded a number of musical bits that can be classified as novelty songs, including \"Basketball Jones\"(1973) and \"Earache My Eye\" (1974). Other novelty songs in the '70s are Jimmy Castor Bunch \"King Kong\"(1975), Rick Dees' \"Disco Duck\" (1976) and The Fools' \"Psycho Chicken\" (1978). \"Weird Al\" Yankovic would emerge as one of the most prolific parody acts of all time in the 1980s, with a career that would span four decades; he would join Cliff Richard in being one of the few acts to have at least one top-40 hit in the U.S. in four consecutive decades (1950s through the 1980s for Richard, 1980s to 2010s for Yankovic).\n\nRandy Brooks wrote a Christmas novelty song and it was originally recorded by then husband-wife recording duo Elmo Shropshire and his wife Patsy in 1979, called \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\". It tells the tragic-comic story of a family grandmother who meets her end on Christmas Eve. After having drunk too much eggnog and forgetting to take her medicine, she staggers out of her family's house late Christmas Eve. She is mauled over by Santa Claus' entourage, and found dead at the scene the next morning. \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" is perhaps the only hit Christmas novelty song which has had continuous popularity since circa 1980.\n\nAn underground novelty music scene began to emerge in the 1960s, beginning with the homosexually themed songs of Camp Records and the racist humor of Johnny Rebel, then in the 1970s and 1980s with X-rated albums by David Allan Coe and Clarence \"Blowfly\" Reid.\n\nNovelty songs have been popular in the UK as well. In 1991, \"The Stonk\" novelty song raised over £100,000 for the Comic Relief charity. In 1993, \"Mr Blobby\" became the second novelty song to reach the coveted Christmas number one slot in the UK, following Benny Hill's 1971 chart-topper \"Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)\". Many popular children's TV characters would try to claim the Christmas number one spot after this. In 1997, the Teletubbies who reached number one the previous week failed to gain it with their single \"Say Eh-oh!\". They came second in the charts to The Spice Girls second of three consecutive Christmas number ones, with \"Too Much\". Later on at the turn of the millennium, Bob the Builder was successful in achieving a Christmas number one in 2000, with \"Can We Fix It?\". However, Bob the Builder did have another number one single a year later with a cover of Lou Bega's \"Mambo No.5\", and also had another less successful single in 2008 with \"Big Fish Little Fish\".\n\nSome novelty music draws its appeal from its unintentional novelty; so-called \"outsider musicians\" with little or no formal musical training often will produce comical results (see for instance, Florence Foster Jenkins, Mrs. Miller, the Portsmouth Sinfonia, The Shaggs and William Hung).\n\nAfter the fictitious composer P.D.Q. Bach repeatedly won the \"Best Comedy Album\" Grammy from 1990 to 1993, the category was changed to \"Best \"Spoken\" Comedy Album\". When \"Best Comedy Album\" was reinstated in 2004, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic won for \"Poodle Hat\".\n\nNovelty songs were popular on U.S. radio throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where it was not uncommon for novelty songs to break into the top 40. Freeform and album-oriented rock stations made use of novelty songs; some of the best-known work from Frank Zappa, for instance, is his extensive body of mostly adult-oriented novelty music. Zappa had \"Dancing Fool\", \"Disco Boy\". Beginning in 1970, Dr. Demento's nationally syndicated radio show gave novelty songs an outlet for much of the country; this lasted through the mid-2000s, when the show (mirroring trends in the genre) faded in popularity until its terrestrial cancellation in June 2010. \n\nIn the 21st century, novelty songs had found a new audience online; the hit song \"The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)\" by Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis was featured on the kids compilation album \"So Fresh Pop Party 13\" in 2014. \nLikewise, British comedian Michael Dapaah's 2017 hit \"Man's Not Hot\", which depicts a man who refuses to take off his jacket, received widespread attention and inspired countless memes as a result of its success.\n\n\n"}

The preceptor had supreme control of his brethren and was only answerable to the grand master of his particular order. A preceptory's main focus would be its church and accommodation for the brethren.\n\nExamples include the Hospitaller Torphichen Preceptory in West Lothian, Scotland; West Peckham Preceptory in West Peckham, England and the Templar Aslackby Preceptory in Lincolnshire, Keele Preceptory in Staffordshire and Temple, Midlothian.\n\nWithin modern-day Freemasonry the preceptor is the head of a lodge of instruction. Such lodges operate within a geographical area and provide training in the performance of the order's ritual for members of the order. The preceptor is an elected position and is usually a Freemason who has spent several years as a director of ceremonies in his local lodge and is considered an expert in the ritual of the order.\n\nIn English Freemasonry, the Preceptor of the lodge is usually appointed by the Master. His main responsibility is to prompt those masons who have forgotten their words. Some lodges, and some preceptors, take his theoretical status as a teacher more seriously than others.\n\nMusically, the title preceptor usually refers to a monk responsible for making music in a monastery. He trained the monks in the traditions of plainchant for daily services and prayers.\n\nSome North American universities have a special student position called preceptor. Preceptors are student volunteers who assist the staff professor and teaching assistants of a large lecture class by helping design certain lessons and holding his or her own office hours and review sessions. In some cases, volunteers are required to take an outside class focused on leadership development, where the final grade is determined by both the lecture professor and leadership development teacher. Thus, the preceptor earns credit for his or her preceptorship. It is considered a good leadership experience and reflects well on the student in his or her transcript. Preceptor can also refer to a paid student grader.\n\nAt some universities, including Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford, \"preceptors\" are not students at all but faculty members teaching courses in writing, music, mathematics, languages, and the life sciences. In some departments they are not tenured faculty but rather non-ladder faculty (generally PhDs) who help administer and run the course, especially with the larger ones. Harvard preceptors, who teach introductory writing, have included \"New Yorker\" staff writer George Packer, novelist Tom Perrotta, former \"Globe\" music critic Richard Dyer and poet Dan Chiasson. At Columbia University, on the other hand, \"preceptors\" are senior graduate students who, along with senior faculty, teach courses on \"Literature Humanities\" and \"Contemporary Civilization\". The title is also used to refer to teaching assistants at Princeton, who are typically graduate students.\n\nAt Elon University School of Law, a preceptor is an attorney who mentors two or three first-year law students.\n\nIn medicine, allied health, midwifery, paramedicine, pharmacy and nursing education, a preceptor is a skilled practitioner or faculty member who supervises students in a clinical setting to allow practical experience with patients.\n\n"}

{"id": "3675296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3675296", "title": "Scottish sword dances", "text": "Scottish sword dances\n\nPerformance of sword dances in the folklore of Scotland is recorded from as early as the 15th century.\n\nRelated customs are found in the Welsh and English Morris dance, in Austria, Germany, Flanders, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Romania.\nAs a part of the traditional Scottish intangible heritage, the performance of the Sword Dance has been recorded as early as the 15th century. It is normally recognised as the war dance with some ceremonial sense in the Scottish Royal court during that period. The old kings and clan chiefs organised the Highland Games as a method to choose their best men at arms, and the discipline required to perform the Highland dances allowed men to demonstrate their strength, stamina, and agility. The earliest reference also mentioned that the dance is often accompanied with the music of bagpipes. The basic rule requires the dancer to cross two swords on the ground in an \"X\" shape and to dance around and within the 4 quarters of it.\n\nThe earliest reference to these dances in Scotland is mentioned in the \"Scotichronicon\", compiled in Scotland by Walter Bower in the 1440s. The passage regards Alexander III and his second marriage to the French lady Yolande de Dreux at Jedburgh in Roxburghshire on 14 October 1285.\nAt the head of this procession were the skilled musicians with many sorts of pipe music including the wailing music of bagpipes, and behind them others splendidly performing a war-dance with intricate weaving in and out. Bringing up the rear was a figure regarding whom it was difficult to decide whether it was a man or an apparition. It seemed to glide like a ghost rather than walk on feet. When it looked as if he would disappear from everyone's sight, the whole frenzied procession halted, the song died away, the music faded, and the dancing contingent froze suddenly and unexpectedly.\nIn 1573, Scottish mercenaries are said to have performed a Scottish Sword dance before the Swedish King, John III, at a banquet held in Stockholm Castle. The dance, \"a natural feature of the festivities,\" was used as part of a plot to assassinate the King, where the conspirators were able to bare their weapons without arousing suspicion. Fortunately for the King, at the decisive moment the agreed signal was never given.\n\n\"Sword dance and Hieland Dances\" were included at a reception for Anne of Denmark at Edinburgh in 1589 and a mixture of sword dance and acrobatics were performed before James VI in 1617 and again for Charles I in 1633, by the Incorporation of Skinners and Glovers of Perth:\nHis Majesty’s chair being set upon the wall next to the Water of Tay whereupon was a floating stage of timber clad about with birks, upon the which for His Majesty’s welcome and entry thirteen of our brethren of this calling of Glovers with green caps, silver strings, red ribbons, white shoes and bells upon their legs, shearing rapiers in their hands and all other abulzements, danced our sword dance with many difficult knots and allapallajesse, five being under and five above upon their shoulders, three of them dancing through their feet and about them, drinking wine and breaking glasses. Which (God be praised) was acted and done without hurt or skaith to any.\n\nMany of the Highland dances now lost were once performed with traditional weapons that included the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, a combination of targe and dirk, and the flail.\n\nThe old Skye dancing song, \"Bualidh mi u an sa chean\" (\"Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann\" \"I will break your head\"), may indicate some form of weapon play to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, \"for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop.\"\n\nC.N. McIntyre North describes a clockwise-moving Sword Dance in his 1880 \"Book of the Club of True Highlanders\". McIntyre North describes nine steps. The first step beats the rhythm in time with the tune \"Gillie Calliun\" [sic].\n\nA combative sword dance called the Highland Dirk Dance still exists and is often linked to the sword dance or dances called \"Macinorsair\" (\"Mac an Fhòrsair\"), the \"Broad Sword Exercise\" or the \"Bruicheath\" (Battle Dance). These dances are mentioned in a number of sources, and may have been performed in a variety of different forms, by two performers in a duelling form and as a solo routine.\n\nThis tradition was gradually kept in the Highlander Regiments with some changing rules. To prepare for the Sword Dance, a soldier should lay two swords on the ground in the form of an X, he would then proceed to dance a complex series of steps and movements between and around the swords to the sound of the bagpipes. The dance itself can be performed with more than one individual. This tradition of exhibition and competitive dancing carried on into the 21st century. It was performed at a Regimental Highland Games C1930s. Four swords are laid on the dance floor in a cross shape. The dancer then performs a number of intricate dance steps across and around the sword blades, keeping their backs straight, arms raised, and hands in a particular shape. Throughout the decades, this style of dance became an integral part of the performance of the pipes and drums band when it went on tour to various countries around the world. Highland country dancing (often a less formal style of dance) was also encouraged within the Regiment.\nActually, the weapon in the traditional sword dance is not only the basket-hilted broadsword. In the book “Highland and Traditional Scottish Dances”, Mr. MacLellan has mentioned when his father was living on Loch Fyneside in Argyll, designed the Foursome Dance over swords as a counter to the Lochaber Dance, which was initially danced over Lochaber axes. The Broadsword indicated the basket-hilted sword worn by officers of Highland Regiments and sometimes miscalled the Claymore, which is a large two-handed weapon. The original version of the Broadswords Dance is described in Mr. MacLellan’s book, and the steps, four strathspey and one quick–time, and drill for marching on and off a dancing stage are simpler and less elaborate than those seen in some present day forms of the dance. It is not an “Old Thyme” dance and it is not Regimental in origin.\n\nDue to the popularity, it encouraged the recovery of traditional prestige on influence in Highland Dancing culture and competition. It increased more training and intensive preparation, or students amongst students attending the Piping Course in Edinburgh, or schoolboys from Queen Victoria School performing at the Royal Tournament in London and the Festival Tattoo in Edinburgh, due to the Highland Dancing interest.To inspire schoolboys to join the events, the school provided special instruction of Highland Dancing. In the south of England, highland and Scottish country dancing caused a wave of enthusiasm to sweep over the Service Establishments. Many officers of Highland Brigade supported the dancing, and it was taught at the Joint Service Staff College, the Army Staff College, the Royal Navy College, and the Royal Military Academy. The only “fortress” holding out against this Scottish “investment” is the R.A.F. Staff College.\n\nThe Highland dancers of Regimental Headquarter---Sgt.Oliver, Cpls,Yule and Eliott and Pte.Ferguson---gained notable successes at the Games at Oban on 15 September . The Regimental Foursome won the Alasdair Maclean Challenge Cup for Regimental Reel Dancing, beating the Gordon Highlanders’ and the Highlander Light Infantry Foursomes. Cpl.Yule won the Poltalloch Cup, presented by Colonel George Malcolm, for the non-professional dancer serving in the Armed Forces who obtained the highest aggregate of marks in the four individual dancing competitions. This was the first year of competition for the Cup.\n\nThe Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing has published its Manual on the technique and performance of the traditional Highland dances, individual and foursome. This is a comprehensive guide, with illustrations of basic positions, movements, and steps. The organisation and conduct of competitions in Highland dancing are also dealt with within the book.\n\nA Society has been formed to stimulate interest in the playing of the Highland Bagpipe, to create enthusiasm for Highland Dancing, and so raise the level of performance of both these arts in the units of the Regiment.\nThe aims of the Society are:--\nA. To assist in the training of pipers and Highland dancers generally in the Regiment, and to watch their progress throughout their Regimental career.\nB. To standardise settings for pipe music throughout the Regiment.\nC. To assist pipe presidents in all ways possible in their duties, both technical and administrative, in order to maintain the highest standard of piping and dancing in the Regiment.\nD. To train judges in piping and dancing for the benefit of Regimental and National competition.\nA Regimental Committee, representative of all the Battalions of the Regiment, is required to develop the policy of the Society.\n\n\nIllustration from The Book of the Club of True Highlanders showing step patterns and timing of the Sword Dance: http://www.electricscotland.com/history/club/club2%20084.jpg\n"}

In the 1930s there were already experiments though. In the Netherlands, the television market is divided between a number of commercial networks, such as RTL Nederland, and a system of public broadcasters sharing three channels, NPO 1, NPO 2, and NPO 3. Imported programmes (except those for children), as well as news interviews with responses in a foreign language, are almost always shown in their original language, with subtitles.\n\nIn the Netherlands, television can be watched analog or digital (the latter with the option of HDTV or 3D). Over 2013, 78.3% of Dutch viewers received television digitally. Analogue television is only available via some cable operators and some fiber to the home providers, since the Dutch government ended analogue reception via airwaves in 2006. Dutch largest cable company Ziggo began to phase out the analogue signal in 2018. Watching digital television is possible through a variety of ways, the most common being:\n\nWhich television channels can be received is heavily dependent on the operator and in most cases also the channel package that is paid for. However, there is a small selection of channels that every operator must carry. Since 2014, these are the following channels:\n\nThe Netherlands has three nationwide channels for publicly funded television (NPO). These channels can only make a fixed maximum amount of money from commercials. These commercials never interrupt broadcasts, and are only shown in between shows. The broadcasting organisations that use these channels are basically representative of the Dutch society. Every broadcasting company has members and the number of members gives them a status that is connected to the number of hours of broadcasting. If you are planning to 'go public' on Dutch television you need to have 50.000 members and something new to add to the existing broadcasting conglomerate. Granting or refusal of entry is decided politically on the guidance of public opinion.\n\nIn 2005 there was a sharp political debate over government plans to cut funding to public broadcasters and to abolish statutory broadcaster NPS.\n\nThe three national television channels are:\n\nThe five digital television channels that are provided by the Nederlandse Publieke Omroep organisation, are:\n\nThere is also an international public channel:\n\nMost regions and provinces have their own television channel as well. These also receive government funding:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following (international) commercial channels broadcast localized versions of their programs:\n\n\nWhile there are many localised versions of international channels meant for the Dutch market, many television providers also broadcast 'domestic television' networks as part of the basic subscription package. Other 'domestic' channels may be received as part of extended packages. Many basic subscriptions include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Netherlands customers can receive high-definition television channels by cable or satellite. There is no terrestrial HD service available at the moment. Although KPN is switching its digital terrestrial television platform to the DVB-T2 HEVC standard, making HD possibile in the future. The first trials with high-definition television in the Netherlands began in 2006 with the broadcast of the 2006 World Cup in HD. After the trial the larger cable companies continued a HD service with a small number of channels such as National Geographic Channel HD, Discovery HD Showcase, History HD, Film1 HD and Sport1 HD. The demand for HD was low because no Dutch network had made the move to HD, already broadcasting in widescreen and the quality of the standard-definition PAL signal was good enough for most people.\n\nSince the 2006 trials none of the main Dutch networks made the move to HD. This changed in the summer of 2008 when from 1 June 2008 until 24 August 2008, the Netherlands Public Broadcasting (NPO) organisations made their primary channel, Nederland 1 temporary available in HD. This made it possible to broadcast Euro 2008, the 2008 Tour de France, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in HD and additionally allowed them to test their systems before the scheduled launch of their permanent HD service in early 2009. The NPO planned to launch their permanent HD service with HD versions of their three channels Nederland 1, Nederland 2, and Nederland 3. Most of the programming in the early stages consisted of upscaled material from their SD channels as in time more programs will became available in HD. Technicolor Netherlands, the company responsible for the technical realisation of the broadcasts of the NPOs television and radio channels, began the summer 2008 test broadcast of Nederland 1 1 HD in 720p/50 as the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) recommends. During the test period an additional 1080i/25 version of the channel was made available to the cable companies because of quality complaints from viewers. In 2009 the NPO decided to adopt the 1080i/25 HD standard.\n\nThe main commercial broadcasting organizations in the Netherlands the SBS Broadcasting Group (NET 5, SBS 6, Veronica) and the channels of RTL Nederland folowed in HD via cable and satellite, using the same HD standard as the NPO.\n\nThe first television channels in 4K UHD officially launched in the Netherlands in 2017. In April 2017 satellite provider CanalDigitaal added Insight TV 4K UHD in its channel line-up. After more than a year of testing KPN launched ultra-high-definition television on 1 July 2017, with Xite 4K and Hispasat 4K TV. Eurosport 4K launched in the Netherlands on 5 June 2018. NPO 1 launched its first trials with ultra-high-definition television through KPN, CanalDigitaal and some minor networks on 14 June 2018, using the HLG-standard.\n\n\nTo serve those who have another native language than Dutch, there are few television channels in the Netherlands broadcasting in one of the regional languages of The Netherlands. Those broadcasting in English usually target an international audience as well. Most of these channels broadcast through the internet only or have a very limited broadcasting area, with Omrop Fryslân as most notable exception. These channels are:\n\n\n"}

Gaffigan stars as a fictionalized version of himself as a stand-up comedian raising five children in a two-bedroom New York City apartment. An 11-episode first season debuted on July 15, 2015. On August 31, 2015, TV Land renewed the series for a 12-episode second season, which premiered on June 19, 2016.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan announced that the series would not be returning for a third season so they could spend more time with their kids.\n\n\nComedians Chris Rock, Dave Attell, Bill Burr, Hannibal Buress, John Mulaney, Whitney Cummings, Jim Norton, Will Ferrell and political personality Joe Scarborough make guest appearances as fictional versions of themselves, as do TV personality Jimmy Fallon and actors Steve Buscemi, Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane and Alec Baldwin. Macaulay Culkin makes multiple cameo appearances as himself holding different low-income jobs and appearing on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\".\n\nNBC first showed interest in the show, but eventually passed. CBS previously tried twice to develop Jim Gaffigan's semi-autobiographical series. While still in talks with NBC, Jeannie would have played herself in the show, however CBS decided to cast someone—a decision she agreed with—and she joined in casting the role. The network ordered a pilot episode in January 2013, at which time Mira Sorvino was attached to play Gaffigan's wife, with Christian Barillas and Tongayi Chirisa in supporting roles. CBS passed on the series in May 2013 and instead planned to redevelop it for the 2014-15 television season. The series was recast with new cast members Williams, Goldberg and Black. CBS passed on the series in May 2014, and Sony Pictures Television began shopping it to other networks. It was announced in July 2014 that TV Land had ordered the series and, unlike previous networks, granted the Gaffigans full creative control. Jim Gaffigan said of the announcement: \"I am thrilled that TV Land is giving us this opportunity to do this show that Peter, Jeannie and I have been fine-tuning for three years.\" TV Land president Larry W. Jones said the series was perfect for its target audience of Generation Xers who are raising families. Jones said: \"We love Jim Gaffigan's brand of humor. The second we saw this show we knew we wanted it on TV Land.\"\n\nThe series is partially based on the real lives of Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, who have five children and live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City. The age differences between the children were shortened for the television show, and Jeannie said, \"The TV kids are sort of a snapshot of an earlier time in our lives when they were all younger\". Episodes are built around actual incidents they've experienced. Other regular topics of Jim Gaffigan's stand-up comedy are part of the series, particularly his love of food. Jeannie said the list of props for the show is \"almost 90 percent food ... which I thought was pretty funny\".\n\nAlthough Jim will play a comedian, a conscious decision was made not to regularly intersperse the narrative with his stand-up comedy, like in such popular shows as \"Seinfeld\" and \"Louie\". He said of this decision: \"I want this to be more about what happens off the stage. ... 'Stand-up comedian' is an occupation and, like our pilot, we're evolving into a much more mature show.\" Jim Gaffigan and Peter Tolan wrote the pilot together. The rest of the series is written by Jim and his wife Jeannie.\n\nJeff Lowell was the showrunner for Season 1 \"The Jim Gaffigan Show\", and served as an executive producer along with Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, Jim's real-life wife, a fictional version of whom will also appear in the show. Jeannie took over the showrunner position for Season 2. Alex Murray and Sandy Wernick will also be executive producers.\n\nProduction on the single-camera series began in 2015. Filming occurred at such New York City locations as Katz's Delicatessen and the Gotham Comedy Club. The set is an exact replica of their former apartment, set on a soundstage.\n\nComedy Central, a cable network owned by TV Land parent company Viacom, will air episodes of the series one week after they debut. New episodes are simulcast on Nick at Nite. Episodes are available on video on demand on cable outlets and for streaming on Hulu (with a paid subscription) three weeks after airing on TV Land.\n\nIn Canada, \"The Jim Gaffigan Show\" airs on The Comedy Network. The show debuted on the network on December 1, 2015.\n\nEarly critical reviews were largely positive, with mixed comparisons to the show \"Louie\". Grading the show with an \"A\", Diane Werts with \"Newsday\" called the show \"This summer's must-see comedy smash,\" adding, \"I can't remember laughing out loud so consistently at a situation comedy maybe, um, ever.\" In an overall favorable review, \"The New York Times\" called the show \"quite funny.\" TV critic Ken Tucker said the show \"gets better with each episode.\" Some critics found the show too sterile. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said \"Gaffigan's good-naturedness is pleasant, if not particularly interesting.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\", giving the show a \"B-\", said it was mostly \"stray one-liners and stilted semi-riffs. Imagine a less nourishing \"Louie\" or \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\".\" \"The Washington Post\" remarked that, while \"Gaffigan has perfected his shtick...It works as a stage presence, but not so much as a TV character.\"\n\nDespite an overall positive critical reception, Jim and Jeannie decided not to pursue a third season. In a statement released on Jim Gaffigan's Twitter, he announced that \"the time commitment to make the quality of show we wanted was taking us away from our most important project, our five children.\" \n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n"}

{"id": "2560314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2560314", "title": "The Mirror (1975 film)", "text": "The Mirror (1975 film)\n\nMirror (; known in the United States as \"The Mirror\") is a 1975 Russian art film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. It is loosely autobiographical, unconventionally structured, and incorporates poems composed and read by the director's father, Arseny Tarkovsky. The film features Margarita Terekhova, Ignat Daniltsev, Alla Demidova, Anatoli Solonitsyn, Tarkovsky's wife Larisa Tarkovskaya and his mother Maria Vishnyakova. Innokenty Smoktunovsky provides voiceover and Eduard Artemyev the incidental music and sound effects.\n\n\"Mirror\" is structured in the form of a nonlinear narrative. It unfolds as an organic flow of memories recalled by a dying poet (based on Tarkovsky's own father Arseny, who in reality would outlive his son by three years) of key moments in his life both with respect to his immediate family as well as that of the Russian people as a whole during the tumultuous events of the twentieth century. In an effort to represent these themes visually, the film combines contemporary scenes with childhood memories, dreams, and newsreel footage. Its cinematography slips, often unpredictably, between color, black-and-white, and sepia. The film's loose flow of visually oneiric images, combined with its rich – and often symbolic – imagery has been compared with the stream of consciousness technique in modernist literature.\n\nThe main concept of \"Mirror\" dates as far back as 1964. Over the years Tarkovsky wrote several screenplay variants, at times working with Aleksandr Misharin. Their mutually developed script initially was not approved by the film committee of Goskino, and it was only after several years of waiting that Tarkovsky would be allowed to realize the project. At various times the script was known under different names, most notably \"Confession\" and \"A White, White Day\". The completed film was initially rejected by Goskino, and after some delay was given only limited release in the Soviet Union.\n\n\"Mirror\" initially polarized critics and audiences, with many considering its narrative to be incomprehensible. The work has grown in reputation since its release, and ranked nineteenth in \"Sight & Sound\"'s 2012 critics' poll of the best films ever made, and ninth in the directors' poll. It has also found favor with many Russians for whom it remains their most beloved of Tarkovsky's works.\n\n\"Mirror\" depicts the thoughts, emotions and memories of Alexei, or Alyosha (Ignat Daniltsev), and the world around him as a child, adolescent, and forty-year-old. The adult Alexei is only briefly glimpsed, but is present as a voice-over in some scenes including substantial dialogue. The structure of the film is discontinuous and nonchronological, without a conventional plot, and combines incidents, dreams and memories along with some news-reel footage. The film switches among three different time-frames: prewar (1935), war-time (1940s), and postwar (1960s or '70s).\n\n\"Mirror\" draws heavily on Tarkovsky's own childhood. Memories such as the evacuation from Moscow to the countryside during the war, a withdrawn father and his own mother, who actually worked as a proof-reader at a printing press, feature prominently.\n\nThe film opens with Alexei's adolescent son Ignat (also played by Ignat Daniltsev) switching on a television and watching the examination of a stammerer by a physician. After the opening titles roll, a scene is set in the countryside during prewar times in which Alexei's mother Maria (Margarita Terekhova) — also called Masha and Marusya — talks with a doctor (Anatoli Solonitsyn) who chances to be passing by. The exterior and interior of Alexei's grandfather's country house are seen. The young Alexei, his mother and sister watch as the family barn burns down. In a dream sequence Maria is washing her hair. Now in the postwar time-frame, Alexei is heard talking with his mother Maria on the phone while rooms of an apartment are seen. Switching back to the prewar time-frame, Maria is seen rushing frantically to her work-place as a proof-reader at a printing press. She is worrying about a mistake she may have overlooked, but is comforted by her colleague Liza (Alla Demidova), who then abruptly reduces her to tears with withering criticism. Back in postwar time, Alexei quarrels with his wife, Natalia (also played by Margarita Terekhova), who has divorced him and is living with their son Ignat. This is followed by news-reel scenes from the Spanish Civil War and of a balloon ascent in the U.S.S.R. In the next scene, set in Alexei's apartment, Ignat meets with a strange woman (Tamara Ogorodnikova) sitting at a table. At her request, Ignat reads a passage from a letter by Pushkin and receives a telephone call from his father Alexei. The strange woman vanishes mysteriously. Switching to war-time, the adolescent Alexei is seen undergoing rifle training with a dour instructor, intercut with news-reel footage of World War II and the Sino-Soviet border conflict. The reunion of Alexei and his sister with their father (Oleg Yankovsky) at war's end is shown. The film then returns to the quarrel between Alexei and his wife Natalia in the postwar sequence. Switching again to prewar time, vistas of the country house and surrounding countryside are followed by a dreamlike sequence showing a levitating Maria. The film then moves to the postwar time, showing Alexei apparently on his death-bed with a mysterious malady. The final scene plays in the prewar time-frame, showing a pregnant mother, Maria, intercut with scenes showing Maria young and old. (Old Maria is played by Tarkovsky's own mother, Maria Vishnyakova.)\n\nN.B. Several of the characters are played by the same actors.\n\nThe concept of \"Mirror\" dates as far back as 1964, when Tarkovsky wrote down his idea for a film about the dreams and memories of a man, though without the man appearing on screen as he would in a conventional film. The first episodes of \"Mirror\" were written while Tarkovsky was working on \"Andrei Rublev\". These episodes were published as a short story under the title \"A White Day\" in 1970. The title was taken from a 1942 poem by his father, Arseny Tarkovsky. In 1968, after having finished \"Andrei Rublev\", Tarkovsky went to the cinematographer's resort in Repino intending to write the script for \"The Mirror\" together with Aleksandr Misharin. This script was titled \"Confession\" and was proposed to the film committee at Goskino. Although it contained popular themes – for example, a heroic mother, the war, and patriotism – the proposal was turned down. The main reason was most likely the complex and unconventional nature of the script. Moreover, Tarkovsky and Misharin clearly stated that they did not know what the final form of the film would be – this was to be determined in the process of filming.\n\nWith the script being turned down by the film committee, Tarkovsky went on to make the film \"Solaris\". But his diary entries show that he was still eager to make the film. Finally, the script was approved by the new head of Goskino, Filipp Ermash in the summer of 1973. Tarkovsky was given a budget of 622,000 Soviet ruble and 7500 metres (24,606 feet) of Kodak film, corresponding to 110 minutes, or roughly three takes assuming a film length of 3000 metres (10,000 feet).\n\nSeveral versions of the script for \"Mirror\" exist, as Tarkovsky constantly rewrote parts of the script, with the latest variant of the script written in 1974 while he was in Italy. One scene that was in the script but that was removed during shooting was an interview with his mother. Tarkovsky wanted to use a hidden camera to interview her on the pretext that it was research for the film. This scene was one of the main reasons why Vadim Yusov, who was the camera-man for all of Tarkovsky's previous films refused to work with him on this film. At various times, the script and the film was known under the titles \"Confession\", \"Redemption\", \"Martyrology\", \"Why are you standing so far away?\", \"The Raging Stream\" and \"A White, White Day\" (sometimes also translated as \"A Bright, Bright Day\".). Only while filming Tarkovsky decided to finally title the film \"Mirror\". (The final film does indeed feature several mirrors with some scenes shot in reflection.)\n\nA poster of Tarkovsky's 1966 film \"Andrei Rublev\" is seen on a wall. \"Mirror\" thus forms the third part, together with Tarkovsky's previous film \"Solaris\" which was made in 1972 and which references Andrei Rublev by having an icon made by him being placed in the main character's room, in a series of three films by Tarkovsky referencing Andrei Rublev.\n\nInitially, Tarkovsky considered Alla Demidova and Swedish actress Bibi Andersson for the role of the mother. In the end Margarita Terekhova was chosen.\n\nPrincipal photography began in late July 1973 and ended in March 1974. Outdoor scenes were shot in Tutshkovo near Moscow and the indoor scenes were shot at the Mosfilm studio. The naturalist style of the film required Margarita Terekhova to forego makeup completely.\n\nThe completed film was initially rejected by Filipp Ermash, the head of Goskino in July 1974. One reason given was that the film is incomprehensible. Tarkovsky was infuriated about this rejection and even toyed with the idea of going abroad and making a film outside the Soviet Union. \"Mirror\" was ultimately approved by Goskino without any changes in fall 1974.\n\n\"Mirror\" never had an official premiere and had only a limited, second category release with only 73 copies. Although it was officially announced for September 1975, it was shown as early as March 1975.\n\nWhen Mosfilm critics were asked in November 1974 to evaluate \"Mirror\", responses were divided. Some viewed it as a major work that would be better understood upon the analysis of future generations; others dismissed it as an unfocused failure and believed that even more cultured viewers would find its story opaque. This resulted in a very limited distribution. Many audience members walked out of theatrical screenings, but those who approved of the work were ardent in their praise. In a 1975 article for \"The New York Times\", James F. Clarity reported that \"in the first round of published reviews, in which some of Mr. Tarkovsky's fellow film makers evaluated his new work, there is much praise, tempered with criticism of some parts of the film.\" Goskino did not allow it to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival. The managing director of the festival, Maurice Bessy, was sympathetic to Tarkovsky. Upon hearing that \"Mirror\" would not be allowed to be shown in Cannes, he unsuccessfully threatened not to take any other Soviet film.\n\n\"Mirror\" is now frequently listed among the greatest films of all time. In a 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" directors' poll, \"Mirror\" ranked as the 9th greatest film of all time. In a parallel poll by film critics, the film ranks at No. 19. In 2012, Will Self argued that it remains 'the most beautiful film ever made'. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" called it \"a startling piece of film-making\" and described many of its images as \"transcendentally brilliant\". In the British Film Institute, the film is billed as \"a work of cumulative, rhythmic effect\" and its unconventional narrative is credited with having \"pioneered a poetic and richly allusive form.\" Director Michael Haneke voted for \"Mirror\" in the 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" directors' poll, and later said that he has seen the picture at least 25 times.\n\nWhile highly acclaimed, \"Mirror\" continues to be viewed as enigmatic, and has been considered a plotless film. Natasha Synessios wrote that it is closer in structure to a musical piece than a narrative film, noting that Tarkovsky himself \"always maintained that he used the laws of music as the film's organisational principle...emphasis placed not on the \"logic\", but the \"form\", of the flow of events.\" Critic Antti Alanen billed the film as a \"space odyssey into the interior of the psyche\" and Tarkovsky's \"In Search of Lost Time\". Howard Hampton argued that the work's central subject is \"the inescapable persistence of the past.\"\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "34526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34526", "title": "Zoetrope", "text": "Zoetrope\n\nA zoetrope is one of several pre-film animation devices that produce the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion.\n\nThe name \"zoetrope\" was composed from the Greek root words ζωή \"zoe\", \"life\" and τρόπος \"tropos\", \"turning\" as a transliteration of \"wheel of life\".\nThe term was coined by inventor William George Horner.\n\nThe zoetrope consists of a cylinder with cuts vertically in the sides. On the inner surface of the cylinder is a band with images from a set of sequenced pictures. As the cylinder spins, the user looks through the slits at the pictures across. The scanning of the slits keeps the pictures from simply blurring together, and the user sees a rapid succession of images, producing the illusion of motion. From the late 19th century, devices working on similar principles have been developed, named analogously as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes, with traditional zoetropes referred to as \"cylindrical zoetropes\" if distinction is needed.\n\nThe zoetrope works on the same principle as its predecessor, the phenakistoscope, but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time. Instead of being radially arrayed on a disc, the sequence of pictures depicting phases of motion is on a paper strip. For viewing, this is placed against the inner surface of the lower part of an open-topped metal drum, the upper part of which is provided with a vertical viewing slit across from each picture. The drum, on a spindle base, is spun. The faster the drum is spun, the smoother the animation appears.\n\nAn earthenware bowl from Iran, over 5000 years old, could be considered a predecessor of the zoetrope. This bowl is decorated in a series of images portraying a goat jumping toward a tree and eating its leaves. The images are sequential and seem evenly distributed around the bowl, but the bowl would have to rotate quite fast and steady as a stroboscopic effect is needed for the images to appear as an animation. It remains very uncertain if the artist who created the bowl actually intended to create an animation.\n\nAccording to a 4th-century Chinese historical text, the 1st-century BCE Chinese Han craftsman Ding Huan created a lamp with a circular band with images of birds and animals that moved \"quite naturally\" when the heat of the lamp caused the band to rotate. However, it is unclear whether this really created the illusion of motion or whether the account was an interpretation of the spatial movement of the pictures of animals.\nPossibly the same device was referred to as \"umbrella lamp\" and mentioned as \"a variety of zoetrope\" which \"may well have originated in China\" by historian of Chinese technology Joseph Needham. It had pictures painted on thin panes of paper or mica on the sides of a light cylindrical canopy bearing vanes at the top. When placed over a lamp it would give an impression of movement of animals or men. Needham mentions several other descriptions of figures moving after the lighting of a candle or lamp, but some of these have a semi-fabulous context or can be compared to heat operated carousel toys. It is possible that all these early Chinese examples were actually the same as, or very similar to, the \"trotting horse lamp\" [走馬燈] known in China since before 1000 CE. This is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes or painted figures attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The moving silhouettes are projected on the thin paper sides of the lantern. Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected iron wire. None of these lamps are known to have featured sequential substitution of images depicting motion and thus don't display animation in the way that the zoetrope does.\nJohn Bate described a simple device in his 1634 book \"The Mysteries of Nature and Art\". It consisted of \"a light card, with several images set upon it\" fastened on the four spokes of a wheel which was turned around by heat inside a glass or horn cylinder, \"so that you would think the immages to bee living creatures by their motion\". The description seems rather close to a simple four-phase animation device depicted and described in Henry V. Hopwood's 1899 book \"Living Pictures\" (see picture). Hopwood gave no name, date or any additional information for this toy that rotated when blown upon. A similar device inside a small zoetrope drum with four slits, was marketed around 1900 by a Parisian company as \"L'Animateur\" (or \"The Animator\"). However, Bate's device as it is seen in the accompanying illustration seems not to have actually animated the images, but rather to have moved the images around spatially.\n\nSimon Stampfer, one of the inventors of the phenakistiscope animation disc (or \"stroboscope discs\" as he called them), suggested in July 1833 in a pamphlet that the sequence of images for the stroboscopic animation could be placed on either a disc, a cylinder or a looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers. Stampfer chose to publish his invention in the shape of a disc.\n\nAfter taking notice of Joseph Plateau's invention of the phénakisticope (published in London as \"phantasmascope\") British mathematician William George Horner thought up a cylindrical variation and published details about its mathematical principles in January 1834. He called his device the \"Dædaleum\", as a reference to the Greek myth of Daedalus. Horner's revolving drum had viewing slits between the pictures, instead of above as the later zoetrope variations would have. Horner planned to publish the dædaleum with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it \"met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures\".\n\nDuring the next three decades the phénakisticope remained the more common animation device, while relatively few experimental variations followed the idea of Horner's dædaleum or Stampfer's stroboscopic cylinder. Most of the zoetrope-like devices created between 1833 and 1865 were intended for viewing photographic sequences, often with a stereoscopic effect. These included Johann Nepomuk Czermak's Stereophoroskop, about which he published an article in 1855. On 27 February 1860 Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices. This included a version that used an endless band of pictures running between two spools that was to be intermittently lit by an electric spark. Desvignes' \"Mimoscope\", received an Honourable Mention \"for ingenuity of construction\" at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. It could \"exhibit drawings, models, single or stereoscopic photographs, so as to animate animal movements, or that of machinery, showing various other illusions.\" Desvignes \"employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success.\" The horizontal slits (like in Czermak's Stereophoroskop) allowed a much improved view, with both eyes, of the opposite pictures.\n\nWilliam Ensign Lincoln invented the definitive zoetrope in 1865 when he was circa 18 years old and a sophomore at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's patented version had the viewing slits on a level \"above\" the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln sent a model to color lithographers and board game manufacturers Milton Bradley and Co. Some shop owners advertised the zoetrope in American newspapers in December 1866. The instrument was first patented in the U.K. on 6 March 1867 under no. 629 by Henry Watson Hallett (as a communication to him by Milton Bradley). In the United States it was patented as the \"Zoëtrope\" on April 23, 1867 by William E. Lincoln – as an assignor to Milton Bradley. Over the years Milton Bradley released at least seven numbered series with twelve zoetrope strips each, as well as a set of twelve strips by Professor Robert Hallowell Richards showing the gradual transformations from one isometric form to another, and one separately available strip showing the progress of the Grecian bend (a woman morphing into a camel). The London Stereoscopic & Photographic Company was licensed as the British publisher and repeated most of the Milton Bradley animations, while adding a set of twelve animations by famous British illustrator George Cruikshank in 1870.\n\nIn 1868 James Clerk Maxwell had an improved zoetrope constructed. Instead of slits it used concave lenses with a focal length equaling the diameter of the cylinder. The virtual image was thus seen in the centre and appeared much more sharp and steady than in the original zoetrope. Maxwell drew several strips that mostly demonstrated subjects relating to physics, like the vibrations of a harp string or Helmholtz's vortex rings threading through each other. An article about the \"Zootrope perfectionné\" was published in French scientific magazine \"Le Cosmos\" in 1869, but the device was never marketed. Maxwell's original zoetrope and some strips are kept in the collection of the Cavendish Museum in Cambridge.\n\nA linear zoetrope consists of an opaque linear screen with thin vertical slits in it. Behind each slit is an image, often illuminated. A motion picture is seen by moving past the display.\n\nLinear zoetropes have several differences compared to cylindrical zoetropes due to their different geometries. Linear zoetropes can have arbitrarily long animations and can cause images to appear wider than their actual sizes.\n\nLinear zoetrope-like advertising was in use in Japan in the early 1990s, for example on the line between the Narita airport and central Tokyo.\n\nIn September 1980, independent filmmaker Bill Brand installed a type of linear zoetrope he called the \"Masstransiscope\" in an unused subway platform at the former Myrtle Avenue station on the New York City Subway. It consists of a wall with 228 slits; behind each slit is a hand-painted panel, and riders of passing trains see a motion picture. After falling into a state of disrepair, the \"Masstransiscope\" was restored in late 2008. Since then, a variety of artists and advertisers have begun to use subway tunnel walls to produce a zoetrope effect when viewed from moving trains.\n\nJoshua Spodek, as an astrophysics graduate student, conceived of and led the development of a class of linear zoetropes that saw the zoetrope's first commercial success in over a century. A display of his design debuted in September 2001 in the Atlanta subway system tunnel and showed an advertisement to riders moving past. The display is internally lit and nearly long, with an animation lasting around 20 seconds. His design soon appeared, both commercially and artistically, in subway systems around North America, Asia, and Europe.\n\nIn April 2006, the Washington Metro installed advertisement zoetropes between the Metro Center and Gallery Place subway stations. A similar advertisement was installed on the PATH train in New Jersey, between the World Trade Center and Exchange Place stations.\n\nAt around the same time, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system installed a zoetrope-type advertisement between the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations which could be viewed by commuters traveling in either direction. The BART ads are still visible, though they are changed infrequently: a particular ad may remain up for several months before being replaced.\n\nThe New York City Subway hosted two digital linear zoetropes through its Arts for Transit program. One, \"Bryant Park in Motion\", was installed in 2010 at the Bryant Park subway station, and was created by Spodek and students at New York University's Tisch School of Arts' Interactive Telecommunications Program. The other, \"Union Square in Motion\", was installed in 2011 by Spodek and students and alumni from Parsons the New School for Design's Art, Media, and Technology program in the Union Square station.\n\nThe Kiev Metro (in Kiev, Ukraine) also featured an advertisement about 2008 for Life mobile telephone carrier in one of its subway tunnels that featured the zoetrope effect. It was quickly taken down.\n\nIn Mexico City, Mexico, an advertisement for the Honda Civic featuring a zoetrope effect was placed in one of the Line 2 tunnels.\n\nThe Zurich Airport Skymetro features a linear zoetrope.\n\n3D zoetropes apply the same principle to three-dimensional models. This variation was suggested by several inventors including Étienne-Jules Marey, who in 1887 used a large zoetrope to animate a series of plaster models based on his chronophotographs of birds in flight. Modern equivalents normally dispense with the slitted drum and instead use a rapidly flashing strobe light to illuminate the models, producing much clearer and sharper distortion-free results. The models are mounted on a rotating base and the light flashes on and off within an extremely small fraction of a second as each successive model passes the same spot. The stroboscopic effect makes each seem to be a single animated object. By allowing the rotation speed to be slightly out of synchronization with the strobe, the animated objects can be made to appear to also move slowly forwards or backwards, according to how much faster or slower each rotation is than the corresponding series of strobe flashes.\n\nThe Ghibli Museum in Tokyo, Japan hosts a 3D zoetrope featuring characters from the animated movie \"My Neighbour Totoro.\" The zoetrope is accompanied by an explanatory display, and is part of an exhibit explaining the principles of animation and historical devices.\n\nPixar created a 3D zoetrope inspired by Ghibli's for its touring exhibition, which first showed at the Museum of Modern Art and features characters from \"Toy Story\". Two more 3D zoetropes have been created by Pixar, both featuring 360-degree viewing. One was installed at Disney California Adventure, sister park to Disneyland, but has since been moved to The Walt Disney Studios Lot in Burbank, CA. The other is installed at Hong Kong Disneyland. The original \"Toy Story\" zoetrope still travels worldwide and has been shown in: London, England, Edinburgh, Melbourne, Seoul, Helsinki, Monterrey, Taipei, Kaohsiung (Taiwan), Singapore; Shanghai, Hamburg and Amsterdam.\n\nThis zoetrope is created by the British artist Mat Collishaw and is inspired by a painting by Ippolito Scarsella of The Massacre of Innocents. The work, named \"All things Fall\", presented during the solo exhibition \"Black Mirror\" at Galleria Borghese in Rome is made of steel, aluminium, plaster, resin, lit by LED lights and powered by an electric motor. Of his work, Collishaw says: \"The zoetrope literally repeats characters to create an overwhelming orgy of violence that is simultaneously appalling and compelling.\" It was originally designed in three dimensions. Each model figure was 3D printed in ABS printing. The ABS material is a special strong plastic used in this additive prototype systems called FDM.\n\nOver the period 2002–2016, Peter Hudson and the makers at Spin Art, LLC, have created multiple interactive 3D stroboscopic zoetrope art installations. This began with \"Sisyphish\" (2002), a human powered zoetrope that used strobe light to animate human figures swimming on a large rotating disk. Sisyphish, sometimes called the Playa Swimmers, was originally unveiled at the arts and culture event, Burning Man, in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada.\n\nPeter has since created stroboscopic zoetropes from 2004 to present including: \"Deeper\" (2004), \"Homouroboros\" (2007), \"Tantalus\" (2008), and \"Charon\", which toured Europe and the United Kingdom in summer of 2012. The \"Charon\" zoetrope is built to resemble and rotate in the same kinetic fashion as a ferris wheel, stands at 32 feet high, weighs 8 tons and features twenty rowing skeleton figures representing the mythological character, Charon, who carries souls of the newly deceased across the river Styx.\n\nThe most recent zoetrope creation is entitled \"Eternal Return\", took two years to build, and was unveiled in 2014 in the Black Rock Desert. Peter Hudson's zoetropes are based in San Francisco are exhibited at various festivals and special events in the United States and internationally throughout the year.\n\nA \"Great Zoetrope\" with \"life-size figures\" turned by a gas engine was installed in the Crystal Palace in London at least from late 1867 to spring 1868.\nIn 2008, Artem Limited, a UK visual effects house, built a 10-meter wide, 10-metric ton zoetrope for Sony, called the BRAVIA-drome, to promote Sony's motion interpolation technology. It features 64 images of the Brazilian footballer Kaká. This has been declared the largest zoetrope in the world by \"Guinness World Records\".\n\nÉmile Reynaud's 1877 praxinoscope was an improvement on the zoetrope that became popular toward the end of the 19th century. It replaced the zoetrope's narrow viewing slits with an inner circle of mirrors that intermittently reflected the images.\n\nSoon after the zoetrope became popular, the flip book was introduced in 1868. With its simplicity and compactness, along with its more tactile qualities, the flip book has stayed relatively popular. A disadvantage of the flip book can be seen in the fact that the animation stops rather quickly, while the zoetrope can display animation as a continuous loop.\n\nEadward Muybridge published his first chronophotography pictures in 1878. These sequential pictures were soon mounted in zoetropes by several people (including Muybridge himself) and were also published as strips for the zoetrope in the 1880s. This paved the way for the development of motion pictures. Muybridge's own Zoopraxiscope (1879) was an early moving image projector and one of several inventions made before the breakthrough in 1895.\n\nIn 1895 Auguste and Louis Lumière were developing the Kinora simultaneously with the cinematograph. While cinema proved to be an enormous success, the Kinora became a popular motion picture viewer for home use.\n\nFilm, television and video are seen as the prevailing successors of the zoetrope, when regarded as technological steps in the development of motion pictures.\n\nGIF animation can arguably be seen as the closest contemporary successor of Zoetrope animation, since both usually show looped image sequences. However, the option of manipulating the speed of the animation is hardly ever present with GIFs.\n\nSince the late 20th century, zoetropes have seen occasional use for artwork, entertainment, marketing and other media use, notably as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes (see above).\n\nMaking a zoetrope has also become a relatively common arts and crafts assignment and a means to explain some of the technical and optical principles of film and motion viewing in educational programs.\n\nThe American company Optical Toys, in Vermont, publishes a paper zoetrope reproduction that was originally published as a newspaper supplement in 1896 in the Boston Herald.\n\nBlue Man Group uses a zoetrope at their shows in Las Vegas and the Sharp Aquos Theater in Universal Studios (in Orlando, Florida).\n\nThe 1999 film \"House on Haunted Hill\" uses a man-sized zoetrope chamber as a twisted horror theme.\n\nA zoetrope was used in the filming of the music video for \"My Last Serenade\" from \"Alive or Just Breathing\" (2002) by Killswitch Engage. It features a woman looking through the slits on a zoetrope while it moves; as she looks closer, the camera moves through the slits into the zoetrope, where the band is playing the song.\n\nIn 2007, an image of a zoetrope was unveiled as one of BBC Two's new idents: a futuristic city with flying cars seen through the shape of the number two.\n\nIn 2009 the E4 drama program \"Skins\" released silent preview clips of series four to coincide with their mash-up competition. One of the clips featured the character Emily Fitch looking into a zoetrope.\nIn 2011, Scott Blake created a \"9/11 Zoetrope\" allowing viewers to watch a continuous reenactment of United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.\n\nIn 2012 animation studio Sehsucht, Berlin created the opener to the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards. The CGI animation features a 3D zoetrope that shows a story of the American Dream. The animation followed the lives of Roxxy and Seth, who, through social media and popularity reach the height of their success playing at the EMA's atop the zoetrope carousel. It was directed by Mate Steinforth and produced by Christina Geller\n\nIn 2013, director Jeff Zwart created a two-minute film, \"Forza/Filmspeed\", promoting Forza Motorsport 5. The production placed high resolution still images from the game on panels around Barber Motorsports Park and filmed them from a camera attached to a McLaren MP4-12C sports car.\n\nIn the 2016 horror film \"The Conjuring 2\", there is the usage of a zoetrope in one of the scenes.\n\n\n"}
