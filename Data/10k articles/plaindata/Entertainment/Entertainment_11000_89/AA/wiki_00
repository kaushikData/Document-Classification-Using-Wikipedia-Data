It is the Philippines' largest entertainment and media conglomerate in terms of revenue, operating income, net income, assets, equity, market capitalization, and number of employees. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System and Chronicle Broadcasting Network. ABS was founded in 1946 by American electronics engineer James Lindenberg as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS), after Judge Antonio Quirino, brother of President Elpidio Quirino, purchased the company. The company that would later be merged with ABS was founded in 1956 as Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) by newspaper mogul Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez (then Vice President of the Philippines). The two companies were merged and incorporated as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on 1 February 1967, and renamed ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010 to reflect the company's diversification. The common shares of ABS-CBN were first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS.\n\nThe group owns and operates the ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Sports+Action national television networks as well as the Radyo Patrol and My Only Radio regional radio networks. The ABS-CBN television network, in particular, is the largest contributor to the group's revenue, generating about 50 to 60 percent of the group's total annual revenue mainly from selling airtime to advertisers. The remaining revenue is generated from consumer sales, mainly from ABS-CBN Global Ltd. which distributes international television channels such as The Filipino Channel and Myx TV and from pay TV and broadband internet provider Sky. Other companies under the ABS-CBN group are motion picture company Star Cinema, music recording label Star Music, publishing firm ABS-CBN Publishing, pay TV content provider and distributor Creative Programs, and talent agency Star Magic. Among the pay TV networks and channels under the ABS-CBN group are ABS-CBN HD, ABS-CBN News Channel, ABS-CBN Sports+Action HD, Cinema One, Jeepney TV, Metro Channel, Liga, and Myx. In recent years, ABS-CBN has ventured and diversified in other businesses such as cellular telephony provider ABS-CBN Mobile, video on demand platform I Want TV, digital terrestrial television service ABS-CBN TV Plus, family entertainment center Kidzania Manila, and home shopping network O Shopping. ABS-CBN is also the principal owner of ABS-CBN Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nThe nucleus of ABS-CBN Corporation began in 1946 with Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). BEC was established by James Lindenberg, one of the founding fathers of Philippine television, an American electronics engineer who went into radio equipment assembly and radio broadcasting. At that time, the largest media company was Manila Broadcasting, with DZRH as the leading radio station. In 1949, James Lindenberg shifted Bolinao to radio broadcasting with DZBC and masterminded the introduction of television to the country in 1953.\n\nIn 1951, Lindenberg partnered with Antonio Quirino, brother of then Philippine President Elpidio Quirino, in order to try their hand at television broadcasting. In 1952, BEC was renamed as Alto Broadcasting System or ABS (with Alto Sales Corporation as its corporate name). \"Alto\" was a contraction of Quirino’s and his wife’s first names, Tony and Aleli. Though they had little money and resources, ABS was able to put up its TV tower by July 1953 and import some 300 television sets. The initial test broadcasts began on September of the same year. The very first full-blown broadcast, however, was on 23 October 1953, of a party in Tony Quirino's humble abode. The television station was known as DZAQ-TV.\n\nIn turn, on 24 September, 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) was organized. The network was owned by Don Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and the then Philippine Vice President Fernando Lopez, and later on launched its very own TV station, DZXL-TV 9. The following year, Don Eugenio acquired ABS from Quirino and Lindenberg. However, it was only on 1 February 1967, that the corporate name was changed to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation to reflect the merger (before it was named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, the name was reverted to the precursor of the network, Bolinao Electronics Corporation or BEC, but the ABS-CBN brand was first used in 1961). In 1958 the network's new headquarters at Roxas Boulevard was inaugurated, and all radio and television operations were consolidated into its two buildings, the radio stations at the Chronicle Building at Aduana Street, Intramuros, Manila, and the TV operations at the brand new Roxas Boulevard building in Pasay City.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Don Eugenio's son, Geny Lopez saw the potential of TV and radio to reach and link Filipinos across the archipelago. By the mid-1960s, the ABS network was leading the radio industry, with stations like DZXL and DZAQ Radyo Patrol in the Manila area, which featured journalists like Ernie Baron, Bong Lapira, Orly Mercado, Joe Taruc, Mario Garcia, Jun Ricafrente, Bobby Guanzon, and Rey Langit, and various other stations nationwide. ABS also made breakthroughs in the TV industry by achieving the country's first color TV broadcast, first satellite feed (during remarkable events including the Man on the Moon, Ruby Tower collapse, interment of Robert Kennedy and the US Presidential Elections), and first use of videotape, among others. It featured top shows then, such as \"Your Evening with Pilita\" and \"Tawag ng Tanghalan\", the country's first comedy show \"Buhay Artista\", first Philippine game show, \"What's My Living\" and the first noontime show \"Student Canteen\", among others. It was also pioneering in marathon election coverage in 1967 when the TV & radio stations of the network aired election updates for 36 hours sharp - making it a national first.\nOn 15 June 1961, Eugenio Lopez, Jr. built the first provincial TV station in Cebu (based in Mandaue) airing 4 hours with the tallest tower (in that time) measuring 216 feet. Within weeks, another TV station in Dagupan opened its doors followed by the first broadcasts in Negros Island (through Bacolod) in 1963. Western Visayas had its first station in Iloilo City in 1964, the Socskargen region then followed up with the opening of its own regional station in 1965 and Baguio and Davao followed suit in 1967.\n\nTwo years later, the network's first test color broadcasts began with the help of the Radio Corporation of America. Color broadcasts started in November 1966, the first in the Philippines and Southeast Asia as the network was tagged as the \"First in Color Television\", with full-color broadcasting beginning in 1971 at all national television stations.\n\nOn 18 December 1968, ABS-CBN opened its new Broadcast Center on Bohol Avenue (renamed as Sgt. Esguerra Avenue in 1989), Quezon City, where it still stands today. At the time, it was the most advanced facility of its kind in Asia. The station again made breakthroughs by using the first live satellite transmissions from abroad, foremost of which was the first moon landing in 1969 and in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico the year before. The network enjoyed a big portion of the ratings and won various awards and recognitions from different organizations. The network pioneered the first all-national news simulcasts also in the same year as well.\n\nBy 1972, the ABS-CBN network owned and operated two television stations and 7 radio stations in Manila, 14 radio stations and three television stations in the provinces.\n\nThe station suffered a setback upon the declaration of martial law. In the midnight of 22 September 1972, a day after the declaration of Martial Law, ABS-CBN and its affiliate stations were seized. Geny Lopez, the president of the company, was imprisoned and held without trial for five years until he and his cellmate Sergio Osmeña III launched a daring jailbreak in 1977 and sought asylum in the United States together with his family. The network itself was taken over by Roberto Benedicto, a presidential crony, who used the Broadcasting Center at Bohol Avenue, then renamed as \"Broadcast Plaza\", as the home of MBS-4. Channel 2 would later be relaunched as the BBC-2, with a completely new logo, slogan, and a theme song from Jose Mari Chan entitled \"Big Beautiful Country\" and sung by various artists. BBC-2 later moved to new headquarters in Broadcast City (also in Diliman, Quezon City) in 1978. The network's radio stations were also affected with BBC and Radio Philippines Network operating several of the stations.\n\nAt the height of the People Power Revolution, military reformists, believing that television would be a powerful tool to aid the revolution, attacked and took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center. On 24 February 1986, former ABS-CBN talents put the station back on the air and televised the drama of the unfolding uprising, thereby contributing to the strength of the revolt. BBC-2, on the other hand, ceased operations after reformists shut down its transmitter on the following day as Channel 2 frequency was turned over to the Lopezes on July 16, 1986.\n\nOn 28 February 1986, after the Revolutions, Geny Lopez returned to the country after self-exile in the United States and started rebuilding from what was left of the station. Recovery was difficult and resources were low, hence, former ABS-CBN employees Freddie García, Ben Aniceto and Rolly Cruz was brought in to rework the station's programming. Thus, the channel began to rebroadcast to viewers once again starting September 14 of the same year. Aniceto, who worked as the Program Director for Radio and Television of the network and station manager of Channel 2 in the 1970s, was served as the first Vice President and General Manager of ABS-CBN upon the network's reopening from 1986 to 1987.\n\nOn 1 March 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched with the live musical special, \"The Star Network: Ang Pagbabalík Ng Bituin\" (The Return of the Star) which noted for the then-brand-new numerical white tri-ribbon channel 2 logo with a white rhomboidal star (from 1988 to 1993 the ribbons were tri-coloured in red, green and blue) as a centerpiece of the network's revival. By 1988, ABS-CBN had regained its foothold in Philippine TV ratings from dead last (#5) to being number 1 again nationally - as a result of the rebranding.\n\nWithin the year, ABS-CBN also beefed up its news programmes with \"TV Patrol\", anchored by a team of newsreaders composed of now-former Vice-President Noli de Castro, Mel Tiangco, Frankie Evangelista, and Angelique Lazo, with the late Ernie Baron telling the daily weather forecast. Other reputable news programmes followed, such as \"Magandang Gabi, Bayan\" and \"Hoy Gising!\". The entertainment programmes of ABS-CBN were also revamped with series that previously aired on RPN 9 and IBC 13: (\"Eat Bulaga!\", \"Okey Ka Fairy Ko!\", \"The Sharon Cuneta Show\", \"Coney Reyes on Camera\") while producing original content (\"The Maricel Soriano Drama Special\", \"Palibhasa Lalake\", \"Home Along Da Riles\"). Another feature of its return to the top of the ratings is the introduction of the live-action sentai and tokusatsu show formats from Japan (with \"Bioman\", \"Goggle V\" \"Gavan\" and \"Shaider\", the latter the first ever tokusatsu program to be aired in English and Filipino) to Philippine television full-time (after a brief appearance on RPN). Filipino-dubbed anime programmes, another network and Philippine television first, would only begin in the transition to the 1990s, and 1987's \"Hikari Sentai Maskman\", aired by the network, was first ever sentai program to dub in Filipino.\n\nWithin months after the relaunch in Manila, the revived network also restarted regional programs and broadcasting starting in Baguio, Cebu, Bacolod, and Davao (and later in Zamboanga and Cagayan de Oro). Within the 1990s, the network also helped open new stations in other parts of the country, while reopening stations used before.\n\nIn January 1989, ABS-CBN began shifting to satellite broadcast, enabling the entire country to watch the same programs simultaneously. This was also the very year when the network began international broadcasts to Guam and Saipan, Northern Marianas, also via satellite, yet another first for Philippine and Asian television. At the same time, the network began to increase the number of local TV programs being aired and produced.\n\nSlowly, the station inched its way to financial recovery, which it achieved by 1990, regularly garnering around 70% of the market. In 1992, ABS-CBN Talent Center (now Star Magic) was formed and in 1993, ABS-CBN launched Star Cinema as the company began to diversify. In 1995, Star Records (now Star Music) was launched. In that year, ABS-CBN also launched their own website ABS-CBN.com, the first Filipino television network in the World Wide Web and was created by its IT department Internet Media Group (IMG, which later became ABS-CBN Interactive until its merger in 2015).\n\nOn 30 March 1998, ABS-CBN Holdings Corporation was incorporated as Worldtech Holdings Corporation for the primary purpose of issuance of Philippine Depository Receipt (PDR) and the acquisition and holding of shares of ABS-CBN Corporation. Its Philippine depository receipt (PDR) is traded in the Philippine Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ABSP.\n\nGeny Lopez died of cancer on 29 June 1999, in the United States. This happened six months before the network celebrated the millennium by unveiling a new logo and inaugurating its Millennium Transmitter in the corporation grounds, resulting in a clearer signal for its television and radio stations in Mega Manila.\n\nIn 2002, Finance Asia ranked ABS-CBN as the 8th best-managed company in the Philippines in its \"Asia's Best Companies 2002\" survey. The survey covers the performance of the top companies in 10 countries in Asia. Finance Asia polled institutional investors and equity analysts for this survey.\n\nOn 27 May 2010, the conglomerate dropped the word \"Broadcasting\" from its corporate name.\n\nSince the 1990s, ABS-CBN has expanded into various successful media and entertainment ventures such as talent development and management (Star Magic), film and television production and distribution (Star Cinema), music and video recording, publishing, and distribution (Star Music), print publishing (ABS-CBN Publishing), new media (ABS-CBN Digital Media), pay TV (ABS-CBN Cable Channels), international television distribution (ABS-CBN Global), telecommunications (ABS-CBN Convergence, San Francisco International Gateway, and Sky Cable), sports programming (ABS-CBN Sports), post-production (RoadRunner; dissolved in 2013), home TV shopping (O Shopping), and theme park (Play Innovations).\n\nOn 24 September 1994, ABS-CBN signed a historic deal with PanAmSat to bring the first trans-Pacific Asian programming to some two million Filipino immigrants in United States. This deal would later gave birth to The Filipino Channel which is now available globally.\n\nThe company has also syndicated its programs for international audience through its ABS-CBN International Distribution division. Among the programs that gained popularity abroad are \"Pangako Sa 'Yo\", \"Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay\", \"Lobo\", \"Sana Maulit Muli\", \"Kahit Isang Saglit\", and \"Be Careful With My Heart.\"\n\nABS-CBN had a failed venture in online gaming industry in the Philippines through its now-defunct subsidiary ABS-CBN Multimedia, Inc. The subsidiary was the owner of Get Amped and Amped Casual Games, the Philippine operator of \"Tantra Online, War Rock, Cronous, Ragnarok Online\", and PopCap Games. Another failed venture was the 5 million dollar deal with the now defunct social network site Multiply.\n\nIn 2005, ABS-CBN International acquired the Richmond, California-based telecommunications port company San Francisco International Gateway from Loral Space & Communications. San Francisco International Gateway provides satellite communications services through its 2.5-acre facility consisting of 19 satellite dish antennas and 9 modular equipment buildings.\n\nIn 2007, ABS-CBN International launched Myx, the first and the only Asian-American youth music channel in the United States. It was later reformatted in 2011 to become a general entertainment channel targeted to the Asian-Americans.\n\nIn 2008, ABS-CBN International opened its state-of-the-art studio in Redwood City, California.\n\nIn 2003, during the 50th anniversary of Philippine television, ABS-CBN launched its present brand name, \"Kapamilya\" (literally means \"a member of the family\").\n\nIts international unit ABS-CBN Global Ltd. plans to undertake an initial public offering (IPO) the following year and might list on the Singapore Stock Exchange to help finance its expansion plans.\n\nThe network celebrated its golden anniversary in 2003. The network held its Kapamilya Homecoming, which gathered over 4,000 former employees and talents for a grand reunion at ABS-CBN’s compound in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City. The network also launched a promo called \"Treasure Hunt\", where the people were invited to bring their oldest television, radio sets, microphones, and posters. The network also celebrated its 16th-year reign in the TV ratings, with 13 of their shows included in the Top 15 daily programs in TV. ABS-CBN also launched several new shows such as \"Meteor Garden\". The company also did a nationwide caravan, showcasing the network's talents.\n\nOn 19 October 2003, the network held a month-long celebration of ABS-CBN and Philippine TV's 50th year. The station produced two commemorative documentaries about the station's contribution in news and entertainment. \"Sa Mata ng Balita\" encapsulated some of the most unforgettable, most remarkable, and most celebrated landmarks of the last 50 years as captured by television news. \"50 Taong Ligawan: The Pinoy TV History\", on the other hand, was the first extensive television documentary done about the history of Philippine television and the evolution of Philippine entertainment. For the celebration's finale, the broadcasting giant capped its 50th anniversary with a spectacular extravaganza dubbed as \"Kapamilya: ABS-CBN at 50\", held at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) in Pasay City. It was hailed as one of the biggest media events of the year. The Lopez-led network rolled out the red carpet to welcome its high-profile guests from the business, advertising and media sectors, politics, members of the diplomatic community, with many of the society’s luminaries and glitterati. Valued friends and supporters of the network throughout the five decades also attended the grand affair. The network's official 50 Years station ID won an Award for Excellence in the 2004 Golden Quill Festival.\n\nIn 2008, ABS-CBN celebrated the 55th year of Philippine television. A new station ID entitled \"Beyond Television\" was launched. The anniversary TV plug depicts the growth of ABS-CBN from a small television station that started in 1953 into a media conglomerate that has businesses beyond television. It is also on this year that The Wall Street Journal Asia ranked ABS-CBN as the 7th most admired company of the Philippines and 3rd in the Innovation Award category for its innovation in internet TV with the now-defunct TFC Now! service.\n\nOn 26 April 2009, ABS-CBN is the only media company to be cited as one of the country's top 15 listed companies in corporate governance, as shown by an annual survey of the Institute of Corporate Directors (ICD). It was the only media company to garner a score of 90 percent or higher in the 2008 Corporate Governance Scorecard, a survey of corporate governance practices among 172 publicly listed companies in the country.\n\nIn 2011, ABS-CBN announced the development of a state-of-the-art studio complex in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan for a projected cost of 6 to 7.5 billion pesos. A 15 hectare lot in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan was acquired earlier that year for 75 million pesos. In 2014, it was announced that the studio complex will consist of 10 sound stages and backlots. The company plan to build at least two sound stages a year for a cost of 600 million pesos or 300 million pesos for each sound stage.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, Charo Santos-Concio was appointed as the new chief executive officer of the company taking over Gabby Lopez. Lopez remains the chairman of the company.\n\nOn 28 May 2013, ABS-CBN Corporation, through its subsidiary ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc. (formerly known as Multi-Media Telephony, Inc.), signed a network sharing agreement with Globe Telecom for a new mobile telephony service in the country. The agreement includes the sharing of assets including switches, towers, servers, and frequencies. ABS-CBN is expected to spend between 2 and 3 billion pesos for the next two years to build up its telco business. The plan has been approved by the National Telecommunications Commission and now operates as ABS-CBNmobile.\n\nIn July 2013, ABS-CBN started the development of KidZania Manila family entertainment center in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.\n\nOn 30 May 2014, ABS-CBN and its current president and CEO Charo Santos-Concio received the Gold Stevie Awards for the categories Services Company of the Year - Philippines and Woman of the Year at the Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards held in Lotte Hotel, Seoul, South Korea. ABS-CBN also received the coveted Gold Stevie Awards for the category Company of the Year - Media & Entertainment at the 11th annual International Business Awards (IBA) which was held in Paris, France in October 10. As a result of the win, ABS-CBN also won the vote-based People’s Choice Stevie Awards for Favorite Companies in the Media and Entertainment Category, while their chairman Eugenio Lopez III received the lifetime achievement award from the KBP.\n\nOn 19 March 2015, Finance Asia ranked ABS-CBN as the third best mid-cap company in the Philippines. ABS-CBN is the only Filipino media company included on Asia's best companies 2015 list of Finance Asia. Also in this year, ABS-CBN was included on the 2015 Top Companies report of JobStreet.com which rank the country's top employers. ABS-CBN is ranked 7th on the list.\n\nOn 1 January 2016, Carlo L. Katigbak was appointed as the new president and chief executive officer of the company taking over Charo Santos-Concio who have succeeded her mandatory retirement age of 60. Concio will still be the network's chief content officer, president of the newly created ABS-CBN University, and executive adviser to the chairman of the company. One month later, the network also announced the appointment of Head for Free TV Maria Socorro Vidanes as the COO for broadcast of ABS-CBN effective 1 February 2016.\n\nIn 2016, ABS-CBN Corporation is the only media company included on the top ten 2016 Top Companies of JobStreet.com in the Philippines ranking at number ten. These companies are chosen by JobStreet.com as the \"most desired employers\" in the country.\n\nOn 19 April 2018, during the company's annual stockholders meeting, the ABS-CBN Board of Directors voted in favor and elected Eugenio \"Gabby\" Lopez III as the Chairman Emeritus and his cousin, Chief Technology Officer Martin \"Mark\" Lopez as his successor as Chairman of the network. Gabby Lopez will be the second executive to be elected as Chairman Emeritus, succeeded his late father, Eugenio \"Geny\" Lopez, Jr.\n\nThe ABS-CBN logo features three main elements, the vertical line rooted on a horizontal origin, the three extending circles, and the text ABS-CBN. The vertical line or bar represents a tower (broadcasting tower) as well as dignifying the company and representing its core business of broadcasting, with the circles symbolizing a transmitter tower's signals, and representing the red, green and blue or RGB colors which makes up a pixel shown on the television. The 3 divisions of the Philippines, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, are also denoted by the three circles, as well as its wide presence, “range for imagination”, and its “pioneering, embracing” spirit.\n\nOne unique thing about ABS-CBN's logo is that it has a horizontal version, usually used to save space as the main vertical logo usually takes up more space than the horizontal one. The design of the horizontal version of the logo contains the ABS-CBN text, split into two parts, \"ABS\" and \"CBN\", without the dash connecting them, and ABS-CBN's iconic symbol squeezed in between them.\n\nThe first logo to have a horizontal version going by this design was the logo launched in 1986, the year they relaunched their operations after 14 years of hibernation under martial law and Marcos' authoritarian rule. From 1986 up until 2014, the elements of the horizontal logo, text, and symbol were evenly sized. In the 2014 version of the horizontal logo, the symbol of ABS-CBN was squeezed in between was slightly larger than the ABS (Alto Broadcasting System) and CBN (Chronicle Broadcasting Network) names.\n\nSince 1969, the network has started using a channel logo beginning on DZAQ-TV with the early channel 2 logo for use as a promotion from 1969 to 1972 as \"The Family Channel\". The frequency was later awarded to BBC as DWWX-TV from 1973 to 1986, and had a different logo used. Channel 2 is currently used as the frequency of the flagship station of ABS-CBN in Metro Manila.\n\nABS-CBN introduced an innovation to the channel 2 logo from 1986 to 1992. At first, the channel 2 logo is introduced into ABS-CBN, after the dissolution of BBC in March. The features of the first channel 2 logo is a wing-shaped blue crest with a white curve at the top and a white line as a tail, the Broadway 2 logo was used from 1986 to 1987. It has a slogan name \"Watch Us Do It Again!\" as the station ID aired since the network's revival.\n\nAfter six months of carefully selected plans, the first tri-ribbon 2 logo laced with a rhomboidal star came to be on 1 March 1987. The tri-ribbon 2 logo's color is white carried the slogan \"The Star Network\" when it aired as a station ID to reclaim the dominance in TV ratings, using the Scanimate system that it took over from the private-owned BBC-2. By 1988, the ribbons in the tri-ribbon 2 logo were changed into red, green and blue stripes from the three white stripes it first used. Truly, the tri-ribbon 2 logo was accidentally coming from a shooting star in the form of the number 2 in the idents which came out. Similarly, most numerical channel logos within this slogan have a star and versions came into regional TV channels like 3 (DYCB-TV in Cebu and D-3-ZO-TV in Baguio), 4 (DYXL-TV in Bacolod and DXAS-TV in Davao) and other regional stations. The tri-ribbon 2 was also used on microphone flags until 2000, the celebration of the New Millennium.\n\nThe Sarimanok, a legendary bird in Philippine Folklore was first used in 1966 to identify color broadcasts (somewhat similar on how the NBC peacock has been utilized). In 1993, which happens to be the Chinese Year of the Rooster, ABS-CBN relaunched the Sarimanok with a new station ID featuring the legendary bird. The \"Sarimanok\" ID became utmostly associated with the channel that ABS-CBN opted it to become the station's mascot. ABS-CBN later named its new 24-hour news channel the Sarimanok News Network, the precursor of the ABS-CBN News Channel. It was revived again in 2004 to promote regional broadcasts nationwide.\n\nThe logo of pre-merger Alto Broadcasting System had a symbol composed of a transmitter with a circle denoting its signals, a precursor of sorts to ABS-CBN's current logos. The logo of pre-merger Chronicle Broadcasting Network, on the other hand, had three blocks and the CBN letters in them. In 1961, the ABS-CBN brand was introduced and its first logo had a big letter B, unifying the names ABS and CBN, in a box placed between their channel numbers 3 (ABS' DZAQ-TV) and 9 (CBN's DZXL-TV).\n\nA modified version of ABS' symbol was launched in 1963, composed of a triangle denoting a transmitter tower and four circles denoting its signals (in the same vein as the 1953 logo), enclosed in a rounded box and with the ABS-CBN text above, in a form that would evolve over the years. The logo soon after took on its current iteration—a vertical line, denoting a transmitter tower, with three concentric circles signifying Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, enclosed in a square frame, in 1967. At that time, it was rendered in black and white because color TV (despite the fact that it was ABS-CBN that introduced it the previous year) wasn't common yet and the logo style at that time separated ABS and CBN's names, putting ABS' name on top and CBN's on the bottom.\n\nThe network used a colored variation of the 1967 logo when color television introduced and they relaunched operations in 1986, after 14 years of forced closure under martial law. The logo had the three rings detached from the transmitter and colored the three rings in red, green, and blue, and substituted the square frame with an outlined black box. The RGB-colored logo has remained relatively unchanged since then, though two modifications in 1993 (the 40th anniversary of Philippine TV) and 1996 (ABS-CBN's 50th corporate anniversary) saw minor tweaks in the letters and the rings and box.\n\n1 January 2000 (the first day of the new millennium) saw a significantly revamped version of the logo. In this version, the outlined black box that enclosed the three rings and the vertical line (that maintained their 1996 design) was replaced by a grey square (a crystal plane when rendered in 3D) and the ABS and CBN names joined together to form ABS-CBN's name, now situated below the symbol. The ABS-CBN letters were also given a completely revamped look.\n\nThe present logo, launched in 2014, is a minimally altered version of the 2000 logo, greatly modifying the \"ABS-CBN\" text, dropping the once-standard serifs on the letters, giving the three RGB rings thicker width and perfected concentricity, and adopting a white square instead of a black or grey one. The rebranding aims to maintain the iconic structure of ABS-CBN's logo while at the same time giving it a new look suited for a period of popularity for social and digital media.\n\n\n"}

He used the social media website Twitter to send a link that contained a sexually suggestive picture of himself to a 21-year-old woman. After initially denying reports that he had posted the image, he admitted that he sent a link to the photo. He also sent additional sexually explicit photos and messages to women before and during his marriage. He denied ever having met or having had a physical relationship with any of the women. On June 16, 2011, Weiner announced his intention to resign from Congress effective June 23.\n\nWeiner returned to politics in April 2013 when he entered the New York City mayoral race. After additional pictures of Weiner were released, Weiner admitted sexting at least three women since his resignation from Congress. He remained in the race until the end, placing fifth in the Democratic primary.\n\nFollowing a report from the \"Daily Mail\" in September 2016, the FBI investigated Weiner for sexting with a 15-year-old girl. His laptop was seized and emails related to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were found on it, causing a controversy late in the presidential election. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty to one count of transferring obscene material to a minor. His wife, Huma Abedin, filed for divorce prior to Weiner's guilty plea. In September, he was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison. On November 6, 2017, Weiner began his sentence at Federal Medical Center, Devens, in Ayer, Massachusetts. His release date is scheduled for 2019.\n\nOn May 27, 2011, Weiner used his public Twitter account to send a link to a photo on yfrog. The picture of his erect penis concealed by boxer briefs was sent to a 21-year-old female college student from Seattle, Washington, who was following his posts on the social media website. Though the link was quickly removed from Weiner's Twitter account, screen shots of Weiner’s original message and of the photo were captured by a user identified as \"Dan Wolfe\" on Twitter and subsequently sent to blogger Andrew Breitbart who published them on his BigGovernment website the following day. CNN described it as a \"lewd photograph\" of a \"man bulge in ... underwear\".\n\nOn June 1, 2011, Weiner gave a series of interviews in which he denied sending the photo and suggested that someone, perhaps a political opponent, had hacked into his accounts and published the photo. Weiner also said he could not say \"with certitude\" that the photo was not of him. He suggested that the image might be doctored, saying, \"Maybe it did start being a photo of mine and now looks something different or maybe it is from another account.\" He did not ask the FBI or U.S. Capitol Police to investigate the incident but said he had retained a private security firm to look into this matter because he felt it was a prank, not a crime. Several bloggers accused Wolfe and Breitbart of planting the photo and message as part of a scheme to defame Weiner.\n\nEvidence later revealed that a group of self-described conservatives had been monitoring Weiner's communications with women for at least three months. Two false identities of underage girls had been created by unknown parties to solicit communication with Weiner and the women he was contacting. Bloggers reported a tweet made in April by a 17-year-old Delaware girl in which she exclaimed, \"Seriously talking to Representative Weiner from New York right now! Like is my life real?\" In early June, Fox News Channel, whose reporter \"happened to be there when the cops showed up\", reported that police went to the girl's house to question her and her parents. The police, who had been \"made aware of an alleged contact\" between Weiner and the girl, also reviewed content on her computer. Weiner confirmed having communicated with the girl, but denied sending any inappropriate messages. The family of the girl stated the contact was \"not salacious or in any manner inappropriate\". The police did not find anything wrong in Weiner's communications with the girl. The entire incident was later dubbed \"Weinergate.\"\n\nOn June 6, Breitbart posted a cropped, shirtless picture of Weiner that was obtained from a second woman on the Internet, and said that Weiner had sent more pictures of himself, including at least one that was sexually graphic. After this information had been made public, Weiner held a press conference in New York and apologized, saying, \"I have not been honest with myself, my family, my constituents, my friends and supporters, and the media\" and that, \"to be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it.\" After being prompted by reporters, he specifically apologized to Andrew Breitbart. He also said he had \"engaged in several inappropriate conversations conducted over Twitter, Facebook, email and occasionally on the phone\" and had exchanged \"messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years\". He added he had never met or had a physical relationship with any of them. He said he was \"deeply ashamed\" of his \"terrible judgment and actions\", which he called \"very dumb.\"\n\nWhen Weiner answered questions, he said that he had the continuing support of his wife Huma Abedin, who was a long-time aide to Hillary Clinton. He had married Abedin in July 2010 in a ceremony officiated by Bill Clinton, and he said that he did not intend to resign his congressional seat. Prior to his marriage, Weiner was known for his \"bachelor exploits with some of New York's most eligible women,\" detailed in a 2011 \"Moment\" profile of the Congressman. Following the revelations of his inappropriate communications, his reportedly emotional apology to former president Clinton was referred to in the press as highly ironic. Asked about an allegation that he had engaged in phone sex with a woman in Nevada, Weiner neither confirmed nor denied the statement, saying that though he did not want to impinge the privacy of any of the women, neither would he contradict any of their statements. At his press conference, Weiner did admit that he had exchanged the reported sexting messages with his accuser.\n\nDuring an appearance on Sirius XM radio on June 8, 2011, Breitbart showed hosts Opie and Anthony a photograph of what he claimed to be Weiner's nude genitalia. One of the cameras in the room caught the cell phone's display, and the hosts subsequently leaked the photo by publishing it on Twitter. Breitbart stated that the photo was published without his permission, and later told KFI radio, \"These people have admitted that they did this surreptitiously and illicitly and they lied in the process saying that they didn't even have a camera in the place.\" Weiner's spokesperson issued the following statement: \"As Representative Weiner said on Monday when he took responsibility for his actions, he has sent explicit photos.\"\n\nNews media also reported the identity of other Weiner's social media contacts, Lisa Weiss, a 40-year-old blackjack dealer in Las Vegas, and 28-year-old porn actress Ginger Lee who had exchanged sexually oriented messages with Weiner. On June 15, Ginger Lee held a press conference during which she said that when she requested advice from Weiner on how to respond to the media, he had advised her on June 2 that if they both stayed quiet the scandal would die down.\n\nOn the afternoon of June 6, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for an investigation by the House Ethics Committee to determine \"whether any official resources were used or any other violation of House rules occurred\". A number of Democratic and Republican congressmen called for Weiner's resignation. On June 7, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for him to resign, and challenged Pelosi to suggest the same. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R, VA) said he should resign, opining: \"The last thing we need is to be immersed in discussion about Congressman Weiner and his Twitter activities.\" House Democrats who called for him to resign on June 8 included Representatives Allyson Schwartz (PA), Mike Ross (AR), Mike Michaud (ME), Niki Tsongas (MA), Larry Kissell (NC) and Joe Donnelly (IN). \n\nOn June 11, Nancy Pelosi, DCCC Steve Israel, and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called for Weiner's resignation. Weiner requested and was granted a short leave of absence from the House to obtain professional treatment of an unspecified nature.\n\nTwo June 6 surveys of New York City adult residents provided conflicting results. A TV station NY1 and Marist College poll indicated that 51% believed Weiner should remain in Congress, 30% thought he should step down, and 18% were unsure. A WABC-TV/SurveyUSA automated survey found the city divided, with 46 percent who thought he should resign and 41 percent who thought he should stay in office. On June 9, a NY1-Marist Poll showed that 56% of registered voters in Weiner's Congressional District wanted him to stay in Congress, and 33% thought he should resign, with 12% uncertain. In the same poll, 73% said he acted unethically, but not illegally.\n\nOn June 13, White House spokesman Jay Carney said \"The president feels... this is a distraction, as Congressman Weiner has said himself, his behavior was inappropriate; dishonesty was inappropriate.\" President Barack Obama said in an interview later that day that if he were Weiner, he would resign.\n\nOn June 16, 2011, Weiner announced he would resign his seat in Congress. He made the announcement at a news conference in Brooklyn, at the same location where he announced his first campaign for New York City Council in 1992.\n\nOn June 20, Weiner formally submitted his letter of resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives, effective at midnight on June 21. His letter of resignation was read on the floor of the House of Representatives on June 23 and entered into the record.\n\nIn a special election held on September 13, 2011 to fill the vacant seat, the Republican candidate, businessman Bob Turner, defeated the Democratic candidate, State Assemblyman David Weprin.\n\nIn April 2013, the former congressman announced his return to politics as candidate for mayor of New York City. He soon became the front runner against Democratic primary-opponent City Council Speaker Christine Quinn.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, more pictures and sexting allegedly by Weiner were released by the website \"The Dirty\". They were allegedly sent under the alias \"Carlos Danger\" to a 22-year-old woman named with whom Weiner had contact in late 2012, as late as April 2013, more than a year after Weiner left Congress. The woman's identity had yet to be confirmed. At a news conference that same day, with his wife Huma by his side, Weiner responded, \"I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have.\" He also said he would not drop out of the mayoral election for the City of New York.\n\nOn July 24 Weiner's sexting partner's identity was confirmed as Sydney Leathers on CNN by a personal friend. Later \"The New York Times\" print edition called for Weiner to withdraw from the mayoral race in an editorial titled \"Mr. Weiner and the Elusive Truth\". In a joint NBC 4 New York/\"Wall Street Journal\"/Marist Institute for Public Opinion poll taken that day, Weiner's favorability rating had dropped over 20 points, and he had lost the lead in the primary race to councilor Quinn, now leading him 25 to 16 percent.\n\nOn July 25, the New York \"Daily News\" reported that, at a news conference in Brooklyn that day, Weiner admitted that he had sexted with three women in the months after his resignation from Congress, and that there had been six to ten women involved in total, not \"dozens and dozens\". Weiner’s campaign manager Danny Kedem quit the weekend after the news conference.\n\nFollowing the primary election on September 10, 2013, the press reported that Sydney Leathers, the young woman at the center of the second scandal, attempted to enter Weiner's campaign party that night, without an invitation. Weiner lost decisively in the election, finishing in fifth place with 4.9% of the vote.\n\nOn August 28, 2016, the \"New York Post\" reported that Weiner had engaged in sexting with another woman, including sending one picture in July 2015 while lying in bed with his toddler son sleeping next to him. \"The New York Times\" reported the next day that Weiner and his wife intended to separate. Weiner had served as a contributor to NY1, which put him on indefinite leave.\n\nOn September 21, 2016, the \"Daily Mail\" published an article claiming that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl. It's not known how the \"Daily Mail\" learned of this incident as in the \"Daily Mail\" article the girl's father says he did not contact the police and this article was used as reason for the FBI and NYPD to begin investigating Weiner. Devices owned by Weiner and Abedin were seized as part of the investigation into this incident. Emails pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on Weiner's laptop, prompting FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation late into the 2016 US presidential election. Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as one reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump.\n\nOn January 31, 2017, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that federal prosecutors were weighing whether to bring child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident. On May 19, 2017, the \"New York Times\" reported Weiner had surrendered to the FBI that morning, and under a plea bargain he intended to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. Abedin reportedly filed for divorce prior to his guilty plea. On September 25, 2017, Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York agreed to a plea agreement sentence totaling 21 months in federal prison, three years supervised release, and for Weiner to register as a sex offender. Weiner reported to Federal Medical Center, Devens on November 6.\n\nThe first scandal was used as the inspiration for part of the plot line of Season I-II of the Showtime series \"Homeland\", where a protagonist, a war hero (played by Damian Lewis), is invited to run for Congress (and subsequently gets elected) after the political career of \"Congressman Dick Johnson\" comes to a sudden end after his sexting pictures are publicized. A \"Washington Post\" article, noting that the Weiner story broke just in time for script purposes, quotes Alex Gansa, co-creator of \"Homeland\": \"We were looking for a way that our lead character could become a congressman in a very quick period of time. This presented itself on a platter.\"\n\nThe 2016 documentary \"Weiner\" covers his resignation from Congress and his 2013 run for Mayor of New York City.\n\n\n"}

It is not considered as part of the rules of these games, but an optional and informal side-bet between players. This practice is likely originated from Danish Tarot or Skat in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nThe requirements vary depending on whether the winner of the last trick is the declarer or a defender. In every case, though, the last trick must be won by 7.\n\nFor declarer, the requirements are generally that:\n\n\nFor a defender, the requirements are generally that:\n\n\nIf the contract is doubled, then two beers are earned. If the contract is redoubled, then four beers are earned.\n\n South plays in the inferior contract of three notrump (6 is excellent), against which the opponents cash the first four spade tricks. To maximize the chance of getting a beer, declarer must discard two top diamond honors and a small heart from dummy. If the diamonds do not break 4-0, it is straightforward to cash nine winners, ending with the beer card. If the diamonds don't break, there's a chance that a defender will be pseudosqueezed and choose to discard a diamond. For declarer to discard three diamond honors risks losing the contract unnecessarily, and so forfeits the beer, even if diamonds turn out to break normally.\n\nAlternately, if North-South only exclude diamond partials from beer card enforcement, then the declarer in six diamonds can easily beer assuming trumps break. Declarer wins the (say) heart lead in the South hand and cashes one high trump in the North hand. When they break, declarer cashes two more high trumps, exits a spade, uses the rounded-suit entries to ruff two spades in the North hand, and finally trump the losing heart with the beer card. When they do not break, the simplest line (ruff a heart in the South hand) forces declarer to use the beer card while drawing trumps.\n\nIn theory, South should have interpreted the final double as a Lightner double and removed to seven diamonds. However, given that his priorities placed the probable doubled beer ahead of trusting the opponents, he should still not redouble. Since the opponents were non-vulnerable, it just may have occurred to them to remove to seven hearts. While the sacrifice rates to go down two thousand, there is certainly no hope for even North to score the beer.\n\n\n"}

These stories were made famous and mostly written by the humorist storytelling team of Marshall Dodge (1935–1982) and Bob Bryan in the 1950s and the 1960s and in later years through retellings by Allen Wicken.\n\nThe stories communicate the quirkiness of rural New England and Maine culture, told in the traditional folksy New England storytelling vein with a dry wit akin to that of the Lake Wobegon stories that would begin appearing in 1974. \n\nThe title characters are fishermen by trade, operating a motor vessel named \"Bluebird\" (and later \"Bluebird II\"), based out of Kennebunkport. Many of the longer stories of Bert & I collections involve incidents during a day's work, with careful detail given to the intricacies of the trade (especially through sound effects vocalized by Dodge).\n\nOne story, \"Which Way to Millinocket?\", adapts the \"You can't get there from here\" trope of the 19th-century \"Arkansas Traveler\" tradition to a New England accent. The similarly titled \"Which Way to East Vassalboro?\" has a different, anti-urbanite theme.\n\nThe stories spread beyond New England during the 1970s and 1980s and introduced many parts of the country and world to the regionally distinct Maine (or \"Yankee\") accent.

{"id": "6493437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6493437", "title": "Flagging dance", "text": "Flagging dance\n\nThe art of flagging dance, often called flag spinning, flag dancing, or rag spinning, but more commonly referred to as flagging, is the undulation, spinning and waving of flags in a rhythmic fashion to music. Practitioners of this form of performance art and dance are usually referred to as \"flaggers\" and \"flag dancers\", though until the 1990s this mostly referred to those waving flags to aid transportation professions (flag semaphore).\n\nModern-day flagging in the United States developed from fan dancing, which was prominent in the leather subculture and later circuit parties of Fire Island and Manhattan in the 1970s.\n\nThe flaggers and fan dancers almost disappeared as AIDS took its toll on the community, but by 1988 a few masters of these arts ensured they passed their tradition onto new members of the community. Adam Wojtowicz (flags) and Jeffrey Reichlin (fans) were two such performance artists in the New York area first seen at The Saint at Large. Three performed for Heritage of Pride in 1990, four in 1991. In 1996 thirty fan dancers and flaggers from the Northeast where ready to take rotations on stage at the annual Pride Dance on the Pier. San Francisco, where this art form began, was still recovering from its loses. Those who had not died, placed their toys away out of significant grief. AmFAR held a benefit in September 1997 at the Trocadero returning the dance to its birthplace.\n\nThe origins of flagging started with simple tee-shirts on the dance floor or fabric with a quarter tied in one corner. Today they are made by adding curtain weights sewn onto portions of two sides of fabric make it possible for flaggers to spin their props, or toys, through the air in ways similar to fan dancing. Given their simpler design (and portability), flagging is easier for beginners to start with and one can purchase pre-made flags from a few artisans such as Don Baker. The first such opportunity was advertised in Circuit Noize magazine in 1997– simple gold lame flags of 3 feet by 5 feet that came with a matching bag. Flags can be of almost any fabric, but silk, organza and lamé are preponderant, with silk being the most favored. Silk flags are usually dyed in vibrant, ultraviolet fluorescent colors, creating an almost hypnotic spectacle when spun rhythmically to music.\n\nFlagger groups, known as tribes, formed in New York City, Boston, Columbus, Philadelphia, DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco and South Florida in the mid 1990s, and were often part of the backdrop of the circuit party events mostly attended by gay men. These were soon followed by the formation of troupes in Minneapolis, Seattle, and Houston in the United States, and in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Of these, two chose to commercialize this disco art form and operated as choreographed performance troupes: Axis Danz in New York the FlyBoys of Flag in Texas. Many tribes continue to perform as atmosphere in clubs and at benefits worldwide.\n\nThe origins of this art in Brazil date back to Belo Horizonte, a city of the state of Minas Gerais, 1998 - 1999. Due to the abundance of gay festivities in the country, the culture initially spread to Rio de Janeiro and later to São Paulo, Brasília and Florianópolis. Many users of social networks (Facebook, Orkut, among others) posted their photos with banners (flags) to promote and / or demonstrate the art.\nThere are some meetings in the park that are held to provide opportunities to practice, similar to those in the USA. Some of them even sponsored by the city (laws to encourage Culture, in Belo Horizonte). These are usually organized by art masters (flag masters) in some cities such as Belo Horizonte or São Paulo. Another city, Florianopolis, has seen an increase of flagging activities at festivals and parties since 2010. These events promote the exchange of experiences among the participants, ensuring the continued maintenance of Art and Culture with Flags on the national scene.\nOn July 9, 2011, the fourth Minas Gerais flaggers meeting took place in Belo Horizonte, where several members of the country participated. It is the second largest meeting of Flaggers in the world, second only to the community of the city of San Francisco, California. Currently, this art can be seen in electronic culture scenes such as Raves in various parts of the country. The flags are not necessarily manufactured by flag-makers originating in Brazil by the original flaggers, but flags still continue to enter the scene through outside sources.\n\nPerformances and conferences have begun forming in various cities, including New York, San Francisco and Dallas. Conferences and workshops happen in 2 or 3 full day events, and teach construction and techniques from beginner to advanced. A short list of leaders in the community often travel to many of these events, becoming known internationally as masters in Flag Dancing.\n\nThe Texas Flagger Weekend ran from 2003 - 2009. The event consisted of growing number of flaggers from around the world, peaking in 2008 with 80+ participants. The event had various tracks, from beginners to advanced. In later years, the Weekend expanded to include multiple tracks, a circuit party and a showcase of performances, SpinOut, of their own, inspired by the San Francisco events of the same name. The Texas Flagger Weekend was founded by Patric Nast and Phillip Bryan in Dallas in 2003.\n\nNew York hosted the \"World Symposium of Fanning and Flagging\" in 2005 and included movement classes, creation workshops, and performances, mostly held at The Center.\n\nFlagging In The Park (FITP), started in 1997, is a fundraising gathering of flaggers, flow artists, and their supporters, happening in the National AIDS Memorial Grove in Golden Gate Park. The event was started as a celebration of life and an honoring of those who had passed by founder Jeff Kennedy; then held by a few core members of the close-knit SF Tribe; in 2002 - 2003 the event was produced in Dolores Park by Bryan Hughes; in 2005 the event moved back to the National AIDS Memorial Grove being led by Xavier Caylor; from 2014 to the present the event is being held by a group of flaggers from the Bay Area and beyond. The basic event includes: a live DJ spinning music, a time for reflection, and hat being passed to raise money money for charity. Flaggers, Fan Dancers, Poi, and Hoop dancers are all invited to the event. One of the five events happens the last full weekend of July, on Saturday before the Up Your Alley Street Fair on Sunday, and is advertised as the (Flagger) SF Destination Weekend. The weekend offers a tie-dye opportunity (flag creation), FITP, and several opportunities to gather with and without flags; the other 4 dates vary - check www.flagginginthepark.org for more information. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "7942344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7942344", "title": "Graveyard slot", "text": "Graveyard slot\n\nA graveyard slot (or death slot) is a time period in which a television audience is very small compared to other times of the day, and therefore broadcast programming is considered far less important. Graveyard slots are usually in the early morning hours of each day, when most people are asleep. Because there is little likelihood of having a substantial viewing audience during this time period, providing useful television programming during this time is usually considered unimportant; some broadcast stations go off the air during these hours, and some audience measurement systems do not collect measurements for these periods. Some broadcasters may do engineering work at this time. Others use broadcast automation to pass-through network feeds unattended, with no one outside of broadcasting authority-mandated personnel and emergency anchors/reporters present at the local station overnight. A few stations use \"we're always on\" or a variant to position their 24-hour operation as a promotional selling point, though as this is now the rule rather than the exception it was in the past, it has now mainly become a selling point for a station's website instead.\n\nThe most well-known graveyard slot in most parts of the world is the overnight television slot, after late night television and before breakfast television/morning show (between 2:00a.m. and 6:00a.m.). During this time slot, most people who are at home are asleep, and most of those who are awake are either at work, away from the television, trying to fall asleep, or just returning home from a bar and too intoxicated to pay attention, leaving only insomniacs, intentionally nocturnal people, and irregular shift workers as potential audiences. Because of the small number of people in those categories, the overnight shift was historically ignored as a revenue opportunity, although increases in irregular shifts have made overnight programming more viable than it had been in the past. In the United States, for example, research has shown that the number of televisions in use at 4:30a.m. doubled from 1995 to 2010 (8% to 16%).\n\nSince the advent of home video recording, some programs in this slot may be transmitted mainly with home taping in mind. Among these are the BBC's Sign Zone and their former specialist service BBC Select, which were for specialist audiences. Some channels may carry adult-oriented content in the graveyard slot, although programming of a pornographic nature is restricted to subscription channels in most countries because government communications regulations forbid pornography on over-the-air channels at any time of the day.\n\nThe slot is used in the United States by some niche networks to transmit live sports such as cricket, Nippon Professional Baseball, Philippine Basketball Association matches, and Australian rules football from Australia, India, Japan, the Philippines, and other nations where the American overnight is the Asian afternoon and evening. Some limited prime-time or noontime general programming from those nations is also transmitted live to the United States, and for anime sites such as Crunchyroll which have arrangements with Japanese networks to premiere episodes day-date-and-time, it can be considered that site's official primetime slot.\n\nThe United States graveyard slot is often the premiere slot for content streaming on demand. 12:01a.m. in the Pacific Time Zone (or 3:01a.m. Eastern and 7:01 or 8:01a.m. UTC depending on daylight saving time), where the streaming provider Netflix is based, is when that provider often releases and premieres their series and films for the first time worldwide across all time zones, along with Amazon Prime. Hulu chooses to release their series at 12:01a.m. Eastern.\n\nSince the 1980s, graveyard slots, once populated by broadcasts of syndicated reruns and old movies, have increasingly been used for program-length infomercials or simulcasting of home shopping channels, which provide a media outlet with revenue and a source of programming without any programming expenses or the possible malfunctions which might come with going off-the-air; the graveyard slots can also be used as dumping grounds for government-mandated public affairs programming, or for station groups which are required by their parent companies to carry programming, to air those shows otherwise unpalatable in prime timeslots; for instance with Sinclair Broadcast Group, a public affairs program by political commentator Armstrong Williams (who has business interests with Sinclair), \"The Right Side\", is required to be aired by all Sinclair stations, but is often seen in graveyard slots on those stations instead of its intended weekend late morning slots as many Sinclair stations choose locally instead to present educational shows and paid programming at that time. The most often seen original programming in the overnight period in the past was daytime talk shows which had failed to find an audience in their original timeslots and are being burned off, though with cable networks airing the same talk shows, usually a same-day late repeat of a successful talk show or infotainment news program is now carried; this is prevalent in markets with sports teams where coach's shows and team highlight shows preempt primetime infotainment shows before primetime, allowing it to be seen in some form on a station without penalty to the syndicator.\n\nNo program that airs during an overnight graveyard slot may be counted toward the three minimum weekly hours of educational programming the U.S. government mandates stations carry each week.\n\nIn cases where a television station carries an irregularly scheduled sporting event that preempts the network prime time lineup, in many cases the station may air the preempted programming in a graveyard slot during the same broadcast day to fulfill their contractual obligations.\n\nThe Big Three television networks in the United States all offer regular programming in the overnight slot (ABC and CBS use overnight newscasts, with an emphasis on sports scores from West Coast games that typically conclude after 1a.m. ET and international financial markets with the ending of the Australasian and beginning of the European trading day, all of which takes place between 2 and 5a.m. ET, and NBC, which dropped its overnight news in the late 1990s, replays the fourth hour of \"Today\"). Each network also produces its early morning newscast at 4a.m. local time so that it may be tape-delayed to air before local news. Also, since the proliferation of digital video recorders, several cable and satellite outlets have begun airing original or rarely seen archival programming in these time slots to make them available to those recording them on DVRs (special restrictions prevent stations from using the overnight graveyard slot for E/I shows). An emerging trend in the United States is an increasingly early local newscast, which now begins as early as 4:00a.m. in some major markets, targeting those who work early shifts or are returning from late shifts; this early newscast would fit into the overnight daypart rather than breakfast television.\n\nThe graveyard slots' lack of importance sometimes benefits programs. Producers and program-makers can afford to take more risks, as there is less advertising revenue at stake. For example, an unusual or niche program may find a chance for an audience in a graveyard slot (a current day example is Adult Swim's \"FishCenter Live\", which features games projected onto the video image of an aquarium), or a formerly popular program that no longer merits an important time slot may be allowed to run in a graveyard slot instead of being removed from the schedule completely. However, abusing this practice may lead to channel drift if the demoted programs were presented as channel stars at some time.\n\nAnother thing to note is the prevalence of cheaply produced local advertisements which allow an advertiser to purchase time on the station for a low cost, advertisements for services of a sexual nature (such as premium-rate adult rate entertainment services and adult products from companies such as Adam & Eve), and public service announcements airing in this time slot due to the reduced importance of advertising revenue.\n\nUp until 2014, some cable networks would broadcast educational programing that educators can tape as part of Cable in the Classroom during these hours.\n\nJapanese over-the-air stations broadcast late night anime almost exclusively, starting in the Late night television slot at 11:00p.m., but bridging the graveyard slot and running until 4:00a.m.. Because advertising revenue is scant in these time slots, the broadcasts primarily promote DVD versions of their series, which may be longer, uncensored, and/or have added features like commentary tracks, side stories and epilogues.\n\nIn the UK, overnight is from 12:30a.m. to 6:00a.m..\nBBC One showed \"Sign Zone\" from 2000 to 2013 during this time before simulcasting with BBC World News (in a 3 way simulcast between BBC One, BBC News Channel and BBC World News for the second part). Nowadays, \"BBC World News\" comes on usually after midnight or 1a.m. depending on which films or programmes are broadcast usually followed by Weather for the week ahead BBC Two shows \"Sign Zone\" and repeats for the first part and then either closes down which is marked in schedules as \"This is BBC Two\" ITV shows \"Jackpot247\" (\"After Midnight\" on STV; \"Teleshopping\" on UTV) and then a repeats before showing ITV Nightscreen until 5:05 am on weekdays followed by \"The Jeremy Kyle Show\", and 6a.m. at the weekend. Channel 4 shows repeats and films during these hours apart from Wednesdays where sports including, Motor Racing, Triathlon and Beach Volleyball are shown. During the National Football League season for American football, the American NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" game, along with playoff games and the Super Bowl, are carried live, which is often also the case with other popular American sports airing in primetime in the UK on Sky Sports and BT Sport. Channel 5 shows \"Supercasino\" and some repeats. Most digital channels during this time either go off air or show simulcast with shopping channels and some stay on the air. BBC News Channel simulcasts with BBC World News during these hours.\n\nExamples of graveyard slots in the United States, outside of the traditional overnight slots, include:\n\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, overnight is from midnight to 06:00, and this slot generally consists of American sitcoms and dramas which ended up failing in their home market but need to air in some form to justify the network's investment, or archived content, along with teleshopping programs, lower-tier American syndicated newsmagazines, and American breakfast television programmes delayed to fill the remainder of the slot.\n\nIn Canada, federal regulations require television channels and radio stations to carry a certain percentage of Canadian content (or Cancon). It is common for most privately owned television channels to air the bulk of their Cancon in such graveyard slots (especially weekday mornings and Saturday nights), ensuring they can meet their required percentages of Canadian programming while leaving room for more popular foreign programming in other time periods. For over-the-air terrestrial television stations, the overnight hours are generally \"not\" subject to Canadian content requirements, allowing some opportunity for niche or experimental programming during those hours, although most commonly infomercials air instead. Canadian radio stations have similar practices regarding broadcasts of Canadian music, known pejoratively as the \"beaver hour\". For the most part in modern times however, Cancon requirements are filled easily by television stations throughout the week through local newscasts and magazine programming, along with licensed versions of American programs such as \"ET Canada\".\n\nLikewise, in the United States, some stations attempt to bury mandated E/I educational television programming in graveyard slots, though under current regulations by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Children's television series must air during times when children are awake (current standards state between 7:00a.m. and 10:00p.m.). Thus, these channels will \"bury\" E/I programs in the middle of a block of infomercials during daytime television hours, when most children are at school and are unlikely to ever see them.\n\n"}

The screenplay was written by Arnaud d'Usseau and Julian Zimet (credited as Julian Halevy). \n\nIn 1906, Saxton (Lee), a renowned British anthropologist, is returning to Europe by the Trans-Siberian Express from China to Moscow. With him is a crate containing the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature that he discovered in a cave in Manchuria. He hopes it is a missing link in human evolution. Doctor Wells (Peter Cushing), Saxton's friendly rival and Royal Geological Society colleague, is also on board but travelling separately. Before the train departs Shanghai, a thief is found dead on the platform. His eyes are completely white, without irises or pupils, and a bystander initially mistakes him for a blind man. A Catholic monk named Father Pujardov (Alberto de Mendoza), the spiritual advisor to the Polish Count Marion Petrovski (George Rigaud) and Countess Irina Petrovski (Silvia Tortosa), who are also waiting to board the train, proclaims the contents of the crate to be evil. Saxton furiously dismisses this as superstition. Saxton's eagerness to keep his scientific find secret arouses the suspicion of Wells, who bribes a porter to investigate the crate. The porter is killed by the defrosted humanoid (Juan Olaguivel) within. It then escapes the crate by picking the lock.\n\nThe humanoid finds more victims as it roams the moving train. Each is found with the same opaque, white eyes. Autopsies suggest that the brains of the victims are being drained of memories and knowledge. When the humanoid is gunned down by police Inspector Mirov (Julio Peña), the threat seems to have been eliminated. Saxton and Wells discover that external images are retained by a liquid found inside the corpses' eyeballs, which reveal a prehistoric Earth and a planetary view as seen from space. They deduce that the real threat is somehow a formless extraterrestrial that inhabited the body of the humanoid and now resides inside the inspector. Pujardov, sensing the greater presence within the inspector and believing it to be that of Satan, renounces his faith, pledging allegiance to the entity.\n\nNews of the murders is wired to the Russian authorities. An intimidating Cossack officer, Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas), boards with a handful of his men. Kazan believes the train is transporting rebels; he is only convinced of the alien's existence when Saxton switches off the lights and Mirov's eyes glow, revealing him to be the alien's host. It has absorbed the memories of Wells' assistant, a train engineer, and others aboard, and now seeks the Polish count's metallurgical knowledge in order to build a vessel to escape Earth. Kazan shoots and kills Mirov, and the alien transfers itself to the deranged Pujardov.\n\nThe passengers flee to the freight car while Pujardov murders Kazan, his men, and the count, draining all of their memories. Saxton rescues the countess and holds Pujardov at gunpoint. Saxton, having discovered that bright light prevents the alien from draining minds or transferring to another body, forces Pujardov into a brightly lit area. The alien Pujardov explains that it is a collective form of energy from another galaxy. Trapped on Earth in the distant past after being left behind in an accident, it survived for millions of years in the bodies of protozoa, fish, and other animals. It cannot live outside a living being longer than a few moments. The alien begs to be spared, tempting Saxton with its advanced knowledge of technology and cures for diseases. While Saxton is distracted by the offer, the alien resurrects the count's corpse and attacks him with it.\n\nSaxton and the countess flee, but the alien resurrects all of its victims as zombies. Battling their way through the train, Saxton and the countess eventually reach the caboose where the other survivors have taken refuge. Saxton and Wells work desperately to uncouple the caboose from the rest of the train. The Russian government sends a telegram to a dispatch station ahead, instructing them to destroy the train by sending it down a dead-end spur. Speculating that war has broken out, the station staff switch the track points.\n\nThe alien takes control of the train as it enters the spur. Saxton and Wells finally manage to separate the caboose. The alien tries to find the brakes but fails to slow down the train. It rams through the end of spur barrier and plunges down the deep cliff and is destroyed after it hits bottom. The caboose rolls precariously to the end of the track before stopping, inches away from the cliff. The survivors quickly leave, while Saxton, Wells, and the countess gaze over the ravine and witness an inferno engulfing the train and its unearthly inhabitant.\n\n\"Horror Express\" was filmed in Madrid between 1971 and 1972 and produced on a low budget of $300,000 with the luxury of having three familiar genre actors in the lead roles. The film was co-produced by American screenwriter/producer Bernard Gordon, who had collaborated with Martin on the 1972 film \"Pancho Villa\" (which featured Savalas in the title role). \n\nFilming started December 1971.\n\nRumors that the train sets were acquired from the production of \"Doctor Zhivago\" (or \"Nicholas and Alexandra\") were refuted by Gordon, who said in a 2000 interview that the model had been constructed for \"Pancho Villa\". Filmmakers used the mock-up from \"Pancho Villa\" as the interior for all train cars during production since no further room was available on stage. All scenes within each train car were shot consecutively, the set then modified and shot for the next car. The train's departure scene was filmed in Madrid's Delicias railway station. The locomotive which pulls the train in that scene is a RENFE 141F, but later in the film, the locomotive seems to be an unidentified RENFE locomotive whose wheel arrangement is unclear.\n\nSecuring Lee and Cushing was a coup for Gordon, since it lent an atmosphere reminiscent of Hammer Films, many of which starred both of the actors. When Cushing arrived in Madrid to begin work on the picture, however, he was still distraught over the recent death of his wife, and announced to Gordon that he could not do the film. With Gordon desperate over the idea of losing one of his important stars, Lee stepped in and put Cushing at ease simply by talking to his old friend about some of their previous work together. Cushing changed his mind and stayed on.\n\nLike all the Italian and Spanish films of the period, \"Horror Express\" was filmed mostly without sound, with effects and voices dubbed into the film later. Lee, Cushing and Savalas all provided their own voices for the English market.\n\nThe film generally received mixed reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 57% approval rating with an average rating of 6.6 out of 10, based on seven reviews.\n\nThis film was first titled \"Pánico en el Transiberiano\" and first released as an officially selected film of the 1972 Sitges Film Festival. Director Eugenio Martín won the Critic's Award Best Script for this film. According to Martín, his native country of Spain was where the film fared worst, both critically and in terms of box office revenue. The film was received more positively in other markets where the audience was more familiar with low-budget horror films, such as Great Britain, the United States, and Australia.\n\n\"Montgomery Advertiser\" film critic Jery Tillotson gave the film a positive review, writing, \"Good performances, brisk direction, and fast action moves this thriller a notch above the average shocker\".\n\nA special edition Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film was issued in 2011 by Severin Films.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1959255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959255", "title": "LGBT theatre in Singapore", "text": "LGBT theatre in Singapore\n\nIn the history of LGBT theatre in Singapore, it was only in the second half of the 1980s that gay writers started to explore the hitherto taboo area of homosexuality in their works. The licensing authority, however, was not quite ready so that in 1988, three plays with gay themes were banned from being performed. These were Eleanor Wong's \"Jackson on a Jaunt\", Chay Yew's \"As If He Hears\" and Russell Heng's \"Lest The Demons Get To Me\". The first two plays were subsequently staged in 1989/1990 after negotiations with the authority. The third was staged in 1992 after Singapore's culture policy was liberalised by its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong.\n\nThe following are some of the local theatre productions which have featured cross-dressing or LGBT themes:\n\n\"M Butterfly\" is an internationally acclaimed theatre piece by Chinese-American playwright David Hwang about a transvestite male opera star’s deceptive seduction of an unsuspecting French male diplomat in China. It was staged during the 1990 Singapore Arts Festival in the wake of the proscription of three gay-themed plays just two years earlier, probably to symbolise newly appointed Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's vision of a \"kinder and gentler Singapore\". It also marked the first instance of total nudity in Singapore theatre. The impact was heightened by the local media which, habitually sensitised to the political climate, highlighted members of the political élite seated in the front row taking in the spectacle with cultured nonchalance.\n\nThe matriarch in most of Gunung Sayang Association's Peranakan plays is played by a man, akin to theatre in Shakespearean times. Nyonya women were not encouraged to perform in front of an audience.\n\nThe most popular male cross-dressing matriarch to have performed in these plays was GT Lye, whose baju panjangs were made by Aljunied Brothers at Arab Street.\n\nKenny Chan is a comedic performer from Melaka who has also played the matriarch role and is known for what some consider rather crude stand-up comedy acts. Chan was most recently seen as Romeo in the TV12 series, \"The Ways of the Matriarch\".\n\nExamples of Peranakan plays which featured a male cross-dressing matriarch include:\n\n\n\n\"Invitation to Treat\" was a month-long trilogy of plays performed at the Jubilee Hall, Raffles Hotel in April 2003. They were penned by acclaimed playwright and academic lawyer Eleanor Wong and produced by W!LD RICE, a professional theatre company founded by well-regarded Artistic Director Ivan Heng.\n\nThe three plays of \"Invitation To Treat\" spanned 20 years in the life of their protagonist, Ellen Toh, following her journey towards self-discovery and self-actualisation. She was a smart, ambitious and hardworking lesbian lawyer who married her best friend in a 'marriage of convenience' that presented her with the best of both worlds– a socially respectable position, and a husband who accepted her sexual orientation.\n\nThe plays swept the audience along a unique and enjoyable journey, an Odyssey of insights which recounted the story of one member of an invisible minority who struggled with her sexuality and, over time, grew increasingly confident and self-aware, with more than a little help from her friends. Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.\n\n\"Mergers & Accusations\" and \"Wills & Secession\" ran as a double bill from 2 to 6 April 2003.\n\nThe play \"Private Parts\" was premiered at the 1992 Singapore Arts Festival, generating a buzz that lasted well past its two sell-out seasons, both during the festival and its immediate rerun, when it played to an estimated audience of 20,000.\n\nMany felt that \"Private Parts\" was popular playwright Michael Chiang’s best play to date; definitely, it was his most politicised. The man who defined Singapore comedy with runaway hits like \"Army Daze, Beauty World\" and \"Mixed Signals\", surprised many with this pointed yet poignant piece of writing.\n\nPushing the envelope the way no other local production had ever done, \"Private Parts\" was a play many agree was ahead of its time. One gets involved with a talk-show host who soon finds out the true meaning of reality TV. One gets a glimpse of the brutality of media competition: how far would one go for higher ratings? Plus, for a nation of gawkers weaned on the night-time beauties of Bugis Street back in the 60s, here was an up-close peek into that mysterious world of drag queens. What more could one want from theatre in the rigid, pre-RA days of Singapore?\n\nHype aside, \"Private Parts\" made news because it was able to engross even the most conservative of audiences with its bittersweet (and unexpectedly moving) story about 3 transsexuals trying to find their place in life. Way before Hollywood was fêted for daring to do the same by putting Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving in heels and makeup for \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (1994). Not to mention Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo donning even bigger bouffants and bosoms in \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything\" (1995).\n\nThe story: Briefly, a Star Search winner fronts a current-affairs talk show to improve ratings.

Written as a special dedication to Toy Factory's 15th anniversary and directed by award-winning director Goh Boon Teck, it recounted a period 5,000 years ago when five ill-fated beauties were impeached for their tramped existence. Spirits unveiled five untold stories of Sai Jing Hua from the Qing dynasty, an infamous prostitute, Bao Si from the Zhou dynasty, the concubine who never smiled, Lu Hou from the Han dynasty, the revengeful empress, Ya Zuan Ji from the Tang dynasty, a poetic priestess and Ke Shi Ming from the Ming dynasty, the Great Madam, all of whom were despised and condemned by Chinese historians.\n\nGoh collaborated with playwright Xu Sheng Liang (China) and music composer Saidah Rastam (Malaysia) to reinterpret Chinese opera and its heritage in a different ensemble. Together, they breathed contemporary life into traditional Chinese opera whilst retaining its beauty.\n\nIt was crafted as a musical, infusing 5 different forms of Chinese opera, namely Yue, Jing, Li Yuan, Huang Mei and Yu, with contemporary funk. No traditional opera musical instruments or props were employed in this unconventional fusion. Instead, there were 4 actors, 5 martial artistes, 7 musicians, 1 saxophonist and 5 genres of opera in this creative mix.\n\nSpirits advanced Chinese opera a step forward, creating a new theatre platform for the younger generation. Multimedia effects and high-tech neon swords replaced traditional props. An outrageous wardrobe dazzled and a fascinating mobile stage transported the audience to another world.\n\nThe constantly challenged notion of masculinity in Asia has unfortunately led to the near extinction of opera female impersonators.

It was an extension of Chua's belief that life should be led honestly and truthfully. In his quest to further meditate on love between people (in this case, among three boys in their 20s), Chua embarked on this project to push his collaborators to work in a space where they had nowhere to go, but to clean. Cleaning was an essential task that would bring these boys to the next phase of eternity.\n\nThe story was about love - love that seemed to be defined differently by different people, with different perspectives, resulting in different outcomes. Each boy had a love story to tell.\n\n\nThe following theatre companies have been active in staging plays which examine LGBT issues:\n\n"}

The programme's high episode count has resulted in \"Doctor Who\" holding the world record for the highest number of episodes of a science-fiction programme.</onlyinclude> In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between BBC Worldwide and SMG Pictures in China, the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" ceased production in 1989, then resumed in 2005. The original series (1963–1989), generally consists of multi-episode serials. The 2005 revival trades the earlier serial format for a run of self-contained episodes, interspersed with occasional multi-part stories and structured into loose story arcs.\n\nThe story numbers below are not official designations; they are meant as a rough guide to placement in the overall context of the programme. There is some dispute, for instance, about whether to count Season 23's \"The Trial of a Time Lord\" as one or as four serials, and whether the unfinished serial \"Shada\" should be included. The numbering scheme in this list reflects an internal practice of describing \"Planet of the Dead\" (2009) as the 200th story. Other sources, such as the Region 1 classic \"Doctor Who\" DVD releases, use different numbering schemes, which diverge after the 108th story, \"The Horns of Nimon\" (1979–1980).\n\nThe following table dictates the season or series in question for the programme as a whole; singular specials are not included in episode counts or viewer totals.\n\nIn 2005, the BBC relaunched \"Doctor Who\" after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer, and Christopher Eccleston taking the lead role of the Ninth Doctor.\n\nThe revival is a continuation of the original series. The new series is formatted to a widescreen display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965–1966 season each episode has an individual title, and most stories do not span more than one episode. The show also returned to its traditional Saturday evening slot.\n\nThe 2005 series constitutes a loose story arc, dealing with the consequences of the Time War and the mysterious Bad Wolf.\nThe Tenth Doctor was portrayed by David Tennant, who was cast before the first series aired.\n\nThe back-story for the spin-off series \"Torchwood\" is \"seeded\" in various episodes in the 2006 series. Each episode also has an accompanying online Tardisode.\n\nThis series introduces Martha Jones and deals with the Face of Boe's final message, the mysterious Mr. Saxon, and the Doctor dealing with the loss of Rose Tyler.\n\nThis series explores the coincidences binding the Doctor and Donna together.\n\nThe specials focus on the \"four knocks\" and the death of the Tenth Doctor.

MACW, also known as Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), was purchased by Turner Broadcasting System in 1988, and subsequently renamed WCW. In March 2001, certain assets of WCW were sold by AOL Time Warner to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). As such these assets, including the rights to the WCW World Television Championship, inactive since April 10, 2000, were now WWF property. Before it was known as the WCW World Television Championship (starting in 1991 and continuing until the title's deactivation), it was known as the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship (1974 to 1977), the NWA Television Championship (1977 to 1985), and the NWA World Television Championship (1985 to 1991).\n\nBeing a professional wrestling championship, it was won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. All title changes occurred at JCP or WCW-promoted events. The inaugural champion was Danny Miller, who defeated Ole Anderson on February 27, 1974, in the finals of a tournament. Booker T holds the record for most reigns, with six. Rick Steamboat's second reign ended due to vacancy for unknown reasons. The day on which the reign ended is also unknown, although it is known that the reign began on June 10, 1978, and came to a close sometime in 1980. As such, if the reign ended on January 1, 1980, or any later time during 1980, then Steamboat's second reign is the longest in the title's history, at over 570 days. Five different reigns are tied for the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at one day.\n\nJim Duggan was the last champion in his only reign. At the time, then-champion Scott Hall did not want to be champion, and after unsuccessfully trying to give the title to Kevin Nash, he abandoned the title by throwing the championship belt into a trashcan on the November 29, 1999, episode of one of WCW's television programs, \"Nitro\". Duggan later found the championship belt in a dumpster on the February 16, 2000, episode of another of WCW's television programs, \"WCW Saturday Night\" and named himself champion. The championship was later retired on the April 10, 2000, episode of \"Nitro\", after a storyline reboot by WCW authority figures Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo. Overall, there were 107 reigns shared among 55 wrestlers, with 11 vacancies.\n\n\n"}

The premiere of the first short film with the Mole was on Venice Film Festival in 1966. Since its inception, the cartoon won itself an enormous popularity in many Central European countries, as well as India, China, Kazakhstan, Croatia, Russia, Ukraine, Iraq and Japan.\n\nKrtek was first seen in 1956 in Prague, when Miler wanted to create a children's cartoon about how flax is processed. He wanted a strong Disney influence to the cartoon by choosing an animal for the leading role, and decided to pick a mole after stumbling over a molehill during a walk. The first film called \"Jak krtek ke kalhotkám přišel\" (\"How the mole got his trousers\") had premiere on Venice Film Festival in 1957, where it was awarded two Golden Lions. Production for further episodes started in 1963 and since then, around 50 episodes have been created.\n\nThe first episode of the cartoon was narrated, but Miler wanted the cartoon to be understood in every country of the world, so he decided to use his daughters as voice actors, reducing the speech to short non-figurative exclamations in order to express the mole's feelings and world perception. They also became the bottleneck of the creation process as they were the ones who got to see the whole film first, thus Miler was able to decide whether the message of the movie was able to get to children or not.\n\nOn May 16, 2011 a plush toy of Krtek was present on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour where it accompanied the U.S. astronaut Andrew Feustel, whose wife is of Czech ancestry, on the STS-134 mission.\n\nIn May 2012 Bloomberg announced that Apple Inc. is planning to help Krtek enter the $21 billion U.S. toy market for the first time. Exporting the six-decade-old “Little Mole” through new media is a first step toward establishing the most popular Czech animated icon in America to spur sales of books, movies and toys. Coloring books about the Mole have been very popular with young children.\n\nIn January 2015 the Czech Athletics Federation announced that Krtek would be the mascot for the 2015 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Prague, and would subsequently be used to promote the Federation's Athletics for Children programme.\n\nLittle Mole (aka Krtecek in Czech language), for certain, is a favourite Czech cartoon character. It was selected as a mascot for Our trip around the world project by travellers Pavel Zrzavy and Martina Libricka. Little Mole set out on his world trip together with his new friends on 8 February 2015. He was discovering the world for 527 days. During these days he traveled over 22 countries, visited hundreds of places and got to know many interesting cultures. Travellers decided to take Little Mole with them as a symbol reminding them home.They also wanted Little Mole to continue inspiring children and adults who like him.\n\nMusic plays an important role in the cartoons, since the characters almost never utter more than emotional sounds, the most common of which is \"Hello!\" (\"Ahoj\" in Czech). The original series' music uses acoustic and electric musical instruments, rather than synthesized ones.\n\nComposers:\n\n\n\n"}

They wash up on separate shores, a young man and woman living without memories and living separate lives. Aguiluz is adopted by a humble farmer and Alwina becomes the surrogate daughter of a wealthy family and is engaged to be married to Gabriel.\n\nBut a new period in the Mulawin saga unfolds as \"Keeper of the Jewel of Fire\", Sang'gre Pirena uses the \"gintong binhi\" to bring Ravenum back to life. Ravenum summons the dragon Buwarka and raises an army of Ravenas to wreak havoc on Avila, which barely survives the initial attack. With the power of Mulawin’s Tree of Life dwindling down and the Mulawin race in peril, the Diwatas and the Tres Aves (a legendary trio of heroes with special abilities) rush to aid the Mulawin. But ultimately, the fate of Avila and the Mulawin race now hinges on the valor of two of its two greatest champions, Aguiluz and Alwina.

They make a way out of the hideout and at the end, killing Ravenum and comes also the death of Aguiluz. They return to Avila after a victory and a deadly battle. Aguiluz is seen lying in a royal bed in the kingdom of Lireo in Encantadia with Queen Amihan of Lireo putting the gintong binhi to his mouth that can get his life back. Alwina is then seen putting Dakila's ugatpak in the Mulawin's Tree of Life.

Examples include: \"an embarrassed zebra\", \"a penguin with a rash\", \"a chocolate sundae with ketchup on top\", and \"a crossword done in red ink\". Portnoy describes these answers as \"adequate, but not clever\", because they lack the homophonic pun.\n\nIn \"The Language of Jokes\", Delia Chiaro notes that it is, technically, impossible to translate this joke into languages other than English, pointing out that, for example, in French, Italian, and German the words \"rouge\", \"rosso\", and \"rot\" have no meaning other than \"red\" and do not possess homophones.\n\nShe adds that it is possible to translate the intent of the joke, and to retain the invariant core of the colour red and the reference to a newspaper, by substituting a different riddle that relies upon metaphor, albeit that the homophonic play upon words is lost. She gives the following example in French, which relies upon the facts that \"L'Humanité\" is the newspaper of the French Communist Party, and that, as \"red\" has in English, \"rouge\" in French has political connotations of Communism:\n\nShe also gives a similar example in Italian, this time using the newspaper of the Italian Communist Party (L'Unità), noting that in Italian the order of black and white is the reverse of that in English, since \"nero e bianco\" is a marked form, and that for prosodic naturalness \"rosso\" must come first:\n\nFor German, she gives this example, which again, like Italian, requires the colour adjectives to be in a different order:\n\nOn 2009, Jason Jones asked the question to Bill Keller, the editor of The New York Times, and quickly answered back: \"Your balance sheet\".\nJimmy Kimmel at the 2012 White House Correspondent's Dinner did this joke and replied: \"Nothing anymore\", in an allusion to the death of print news.\n\n"}

The name originates from the feudal Japanese assassin. It is commonly played at meet-ups and conventions.\n\nThe rules of ninja are simple, and have only a few pivotal rules for play. In a game, players will stand in a circle, and place their hands together, the player leading the game will say \"Bow to your sensei\". There, the countdown begins, and each player must strike a pose. Players take turns attacking their opponents by swiping at their hands\n, and must freeze in place once their attack is finished. Defending players may dodge if they think they will be hit, and must also freeze once the attack is finished. If a player is hit, the hand that is hit is out but the other hand is still in. If a player misses, they must stop moving immediately. When both hands have been hit, the player is out and must stand back until there is one player left. The only player left is the winner. However, there have been variations to how children play the game, some exercise optional rules such as, the area that is hit, timed attacks or however the players want to change the game.\n\nA common \"Circle Ninja\" variant requires players to move in a clockwise motion rather than any direction they please.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Ninja\", players position themselves in a circle and take turns in a clockwise motion. This variant however, adds the objective of slapping either the hands or the feet. The players are also able to dodge multiple attacks before their turn. Typically, ultimate ninja has players completing more complex maneuvers such as cartwheels, slide kicks, jump kicks and so on.\n\nAnother variation specifies that players have only one life, that is, when one hand is hit, the player is considered out.\n\nSome games have a \"lightning round\" where two players attack each other and try to not stop until one is hit in the hand. The game is over when a player gets hit in the hand, stops the motion, or becomes confused during his or her turn. Many people play a rapid one-on-one variant where players must stand toe-to-toe throughout the game.\n\nIn \"Ninja Balance\", players can only use one hand and the other is placed behind the back and can not touch anything. The right hands are bound together and the players can not move one foot which is planted outer ankle bone to toe. The players score a hit by touching any part of the opponent with their finger of the bound hand or when they cause the other player to lose balance and move their planted foot. Three hits is a win. Players are disqualified for causing injury or using the dead hand for anything but balance.\n\nAnother variation includes the \"instant death\" rule. The most common version being when a player strikes another in the nose. Other locations such as the neck and forehead may also be used.\n"}

Therefore, both the DS Download and Play modes and direct connection modes are accessible from here.\n\nUp to 8 players can play and in any mode that the number of players permits. However, for technical reasons (such as alternative drawing methods being used in 8-player mode to keep the game from lagging), you can only play Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo TSU, and Puyo Puyo Fever modes in games with more than four players.\n\nIn this mode, you can use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to verse players across the internet. WiFi mode supports only 3 modes (Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Puyo Puyo Fever). You can play games of between two and four players, either with your friends using the Friend Code system or against random opponents. When playing random games, three-player mode and the original Puyo Puyo rules are not available, and you can earn (or lose!) points if playing a two-player game.\n\nPuyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary for the DS had several issues.\n\nIn the original release of Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary, a bug existed where data would could not be saved more than 255 times. A new version, nicknamed 1.1, was released to solve the problem on January 20, 2007. Information on how to find out the game version and instructions on how to get replacement can be found on Sega's website.\n\nIn both of these versions existed yet another bug, this one effecting WiFi. When a player disconnected, both lost points. A new version was released to solve this problem.\n\nWhile playing multiplayer games, the fever meter will occasionally freeze on 7 points without letting you into fever mode. It will subsequently let you in after your next move, but this may be deadly depending on the circumstances. This bug can also be seen in version 2.00 of the PC version of Puyo Pop Fever.\n\n\n"}

The brass duty legal stamps were kept at the office of the Stamp Commissioner and the stamped duty cards with the name of the card maker on them and the same number of labels were delivered to the card marker. These laws and regulations were to enforce the excise duty tax levied on every pack of playing cards. Card makers faced a monetary penalty for not following the laws under the Stamp Act. \n\nA playing card manufacturer without a license could neither obtain a legal stamp for the ace of spades nor a regulated label placed on the wrapper of the pack of playing cards. An illegal manufacturer of playing cards would have to forge the brass legal stamp placed on the ace of spades and create a counterfeit label for the wrapper. In England, forgery and uttering was a capital offence in 1805.\n\nRichard Harding was indicted under the stamp laws for two offences. The indictment charged Harding with having counterfeited the impression of brass duty stamps authorized by the Stamp commissioner for the purpose of denoting the duty on playing cards. It likewise charged Harding of vending and selling playing cards with these counterfeited impressions, knowing it to be so done.\n\nMore specifically, the first count was Harding feloniously did forge, counterfeit and resemble, on the ace of spades the impression of the mark used and denoted on the playing card, with intention to defraud the duty charged on playing cards.\n\nThe second count was Harding feloniously did vend and sell playing cards, with counterfeit impressions of the duty stamp on the ace of spades and Harding knowing the said marks to be counterfeited. And thirteen other counts for like offence, only charging them in a different manner.\nThe Attorney General, Spencer Perceval, opened the legal case against Harding and pursued the matter with great vigour.\n\nThe evidence supported that Harding was a licensed card maker and kept two licensed shops, in which he sold playing cards. The first shop was in Hereford Street, Oxford Road and the second shop in North Row, Grosvenor Square. Harding's print shop was behind the house of Mr. Skelton, a dealer in spirits and groceries, in Green Street, Grosvenor Square. This location was where Harding created the spurious ‘duty aces.’ \n\nMr. Hockley of the Stamp Office, the official printer of the legal ace of spades, provided evidence to the Court that he bought from Harding and his apprentice packs of playing cards, which contained a counterfeited ace of spades. \n\nHarding's apprentice gave testimony that he witnessed Harding manufacturing playing cards using forged brass duty legal stamps to place a duty stamp on the ace of spades and adhering counterfeit labels on the wrapper. Harding placed a substance on the labels to give them a gloss like the legal labels. \n\nOn Saturday, 21 September 1805, at the Old Bailey, London, Harding, was capitally indicted, before Mr. Justice Heath and a Jury, on two counts: \n\nJustice Heath told the Jury ‘there could be no doubt’ of Harding's guilt and they found Richard Harding guilty and he was sentenced to death at the age of 35.\n\nContemporary newspapers of the time had made unsuccessful attempts to secure a reprieve for Harding. On , Richard Harding's execution took place in the Old Bailey, by the hangman, William Brunskill.\n\nAn account of the Court case against Harding was reported in the ‘Imperial Weekly Gazette’ published at 45, Old Bailey. The Forgery, Abolition of Punishment of Death Act 1832 was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which abolished the death penalty for all offences of forgery, except for forging wills and certain powers of attorney. These exceptions were abolished under the Forgery Act 1837.\n\n"}

Kastari was the general secretary of Sarbufis.\n\nThe organization was founded in 1951, with the name \"Sarekat Buruh Film Indonesia\" (Film Workers Union of Indonesia, abbreviated \"Sarbufi\"). It was the first professional organization of the workers of the film industry. The union joined SOBSI immediately after its formation. The second Sarbufi congress, held in 1953, adopted the name Sarbufis. Amongst the members of Sarbufis were actors of \"ketoprak\", a form of Javanese traditional drama with political commentary. However, the main activity of the union remained in the film sector.\n\nIn 1955 Sarbufis initiated a campaign to ban American newsreel films. The union stated that the American newsreels propagated nuclear war. The Jakarta branch of Sarbufis claimed to have collected thousands of signatures supporting their demand, including that of prominent film maker Tan Sing Hwat (a prominent director, LEKRA member and an official of Sarbufis). Later, Sarbufis took part in founding the Action Committee for Boycott of Imperialist American Films. Moreover, the organization called for banning of British imports in 1963, in response to the expulsion of the Indonesian consulate from Sabah.\n\nSarbufis was crushed following the 1965 coup d'état.

In the 1970s, he wrote his experiences during World War II down in a book and director Paul Verhoeven made it into a feature film, starring actor Rutger Hauer.\n\nThe musical premiered on 30 October 2010, in a theatre that was purpose-built for the production: the TheaterHangaar on the former Valkenburg air base in Katwijk (in an old hangar). Queen Beatrix attended the premiere together with Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema's widow, Karin.\n\"Soldier of Orange\" is produced by Robin de Levita and NEW Productions, which is a collaboration between investment company Amerborgh Nederland and Volterra, parent company of Montecatini Talent Agency.\n\nStudent Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and his friends are carefree, until the Germans invade the Netherlands in the early days of May 1940. The war changes everything. They can no longer take friendship and love for granted. Everybody has to make choices. Fight for the country and for freedom? Focus on studying and deny what’s going on? Or join the enemy?\n\nThe book of Hazelhoff Roelfzema, with the title Cave of the Rattlesnake (Dutch: Het hol van de ratelslang), was published in 1970. It reappeared a year later under the title Soldier of Orange. Paul Verhoeven created a film version in 1977. Rutger Hauer played the character Erik Lanshoff, based on the resistance hero.\n\nSoldier of Orange – The Musical brings the true story to the theatre. After World War II starts, Erik decides to flee to Britain. He smuggles transmitting equipment to the Netherlands and, as a pilot, is involved in bombing Germany. He becomes adjutant for Queen Wilhelmina and receives the Military William Order ('Militaire Willems-Orde'), the highest royal honour in the Netherlands, for his contribution to the resistance movement.\n\nProducer Fred Boot obtained the rights to turn the story into a musical in 2005, after meeting Hazelhoff Roelfzema the year before.\n\nScriptwriter Edwin de Vries wrote the musical script. American duo Tom Harriman and Pamela Philips Oland was responsible for composition and lyrics. Dutch actor and composer Frans van Deursen translated the lyrics from English into Dutch.\nIn 2008, Boot asked theatre producer Robin de Levita to join him. Director Theu Boermans joined the team in 2009.\n\nThe show takes place in a former flight hangar, that is converted into a theatre. The location of the so-called TheaterHangaar is former military airport Valkenburg between Wassenaar, Katwijk en Leiden, a suitable, historical place. A foyer with a bar and restaurant is placed in front of the hangar.\n\nProducer Robin de Levita invented a new theatrical performance solution for Soldier of Orange – The Musical: a rotating auditorium in the center of a venue with 1100 seats. He named it SceneAround. The auditorium is placed on a turntable. The audience rotates from scenery to scenery, accompanied by 180 degree projections on panel screens around the auditorium. Both the auditorium and the screens are motorized and automated. The set is built around the auditorium. Almost every scenery has its own set. There is even a ‘sea’ and the runway of the airport is also part of the set.\n\nQueen Wilhelmina returned to the Netherlands with a Dakota. The Dakota C-47 was made available for the musical by a Dutch museum and was taken to Valkenburg in August 2010. Shortly after midnight, the plane got stuck in an overpass. It was too damaged to have it repaired on time for the premiere. The Dakota PH-ALR ‘Reiger’ from 1939 that’s being used in the production now, was delivered on 23 September 2010.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "570559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=570559", "title": "Star Search", "text": "Star Search\n\nStar Search is an American television show that was produced by T.P.E./Rysher Entertainment from 1983 to 1995, hosted by Ed McMahon, and created by Al Masini. A relaunch was produced by 2929 Productions from 2003 to 2004. On both versions of the show, contestants competed in several genres of entertainment. The show was originally filmed at the old Earl Carroll Theatre (now known as Nickelodeon on Sunset), at 6230 Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and later at the Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida.\n\n1983–1995 version\nWhile categories varied slightly from season to season, the ten basic categories during the 1983–1995 version were:\n\n\nEight categories were contested per show. Potential contestants auditioned to be on the show. In each category, two selected contestants would compete, a champion and a challenger. The challenger would usually perform first, while the champion performed second. In later seasons, the champion performed first.\n\nAll acts were judged by a panel of four judges, and each judge could award an act from one to four stars (later changed to five stars). Once both acts were complete, Ed would reveal the scores, and the best average won. If there was a tie, a studio audience vote broke the tie, in which case the results were revealed at the end of the show.\n\nAny performer must win at least several shows in a row, depending on the number of shows left in the season, to earn an entry into the next round of the competition; usually this was three or four wins in a row. In later seasons, three-match winners were automatically retired. In this case, two new performers would compete in that category the following week.\n\nIn most seasons, two semifinal shows took place, one in the fall, the other in the spring, prior to the championship show. Each semifinal used five judges. No scoring was used, and the judges' votes weren't revealed, but the acts that won their semifinals would then compete in the championship show.\n\nOn the championship show, winners of Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, Vocal Group, Comedy, and Dance, were awarded $100,000 but no record contract was guaranteed. Many Star Search winners from the early seasons secured recording contracts within a few weeks of the end of the competition—first season vocal group winner Sawyer Brown, first season male vocalist champion Sam Harris and second season male vocalist champion Durell Coleman were the first three, and were later followed by second season vocal group winner Limited Warranty, third season female vocalist champion Linda Eder, second season junior male vocalist champion Jimmy Salvemini, whose album was produced by Luther Vandross, fourth season male vocalist champion David Slater, and first season (1985) junior female vocalist runner-up Tiffany. Despite not winning her competition (she lost to Melissa Moultrie), Tiffany, performing on \"Star Search\" as 'Tiffany Renee,' was the first Star Search alumnus to land a #1 hit, with her cover of the Top 5 Tommy James and the Shondells hit \"I Think We're Alone Now\" —actually improving on the original single's chart performance. The winner of the Spokesmodel category was awarded $100,000 and a contract with a well-known modeling agency. The first Spokesmodel winner was Tracey Ross, who later became a leading actress on the soap opera Passions. Winners of Junior Vocalist, Junior Dance, Teen Vocalist, and Teen Dance win $10,000.\n\nIn early seasons, before the three match limit rule was adopted, the grand champions were determined by how long a champion held their title. While it is believed that Sam Harris holds the record for longest championship, at 14 weeks in Season 1, Harris was actually defeated by singer Beau Williams on Harris' 14th attempt. This record is actually held by Singer Durell Coleman (1985), who won the $100,000 on Season 2 with 15 wins and no defeats.\n\nIn the wake of \"American Idol\"s success, Arsenio Hall hosted a new version of \"Star Search\", which ran for two years: 2003 and 2004 on CBS, before ending up in reruns on cable channel GSN for one year from 2004 to 2005. This new version was judged by four panelists, including Ben Stein, Naomi Judd, Ahmet Zappa and a rotating celebrity panelist (which in at least one case was McMahon himself). Among the winners were singer Tiffany Evans, comedian John Roy and singer Mark Mejia.\n\nThe revival consisted of four series. For the first series, the categories were Adult and Junior Singer, Comedy, and Modeling. In series two and three, Modeling was replaced with Dance. In the final series, the Comedy category was scrapped altogether and only the singing and dancing categories remained.\n\nFor the first three series, two new competitors faced off. The three house judges, along with the one celebrity judge, gave each contestant a score on a scale from one to five stars, making a maximum studio score 20 stars. During each commercial break, the home audience went to www.cbs.com/star to rate the competitors who just performed. Each performer could earn up to another 20 stars from the home audience. In the climactic moment before the score from the home audience was revealed, Hall would often say, \"Hit me with the digits!\"\n\nWhen the scores were tallied, the higher scoring performer won. If the score was tied, then Hall would read off each performer's score rounded to the nearest hundredth (the at-home score was initially rounded down to the nearest star, unless there was a tie). That performer would then go on to the next round of competition. The only real exception to this format during the first three series was that three people competed in the semi-final rounds, not two. After the first two series, a special, \"Battle of the Best\" show took place, where the two Adult Singer, Junior Singer, and Comedian Grand Champions (Modeling was only the first season, and Dance had only been around for one season) were brought back to face off for an additional $100,000.\n\nFor the fourth and final series, three contestants in Adult Singer, Junior Singer, and Dance were brought back to initially compete (Comedy was dropped, jokingly because Naomi gave many comics only one star). The three brought back in each category were not necessarily the Grand Champions of their series. The show scrapped the celebrity judge and had three house judges for the entire series: Naomi Judd, MC Lyte, and Matti Leshem (who tried to berate contestants as Simon Cowell was doing at the time on \"American Idol\").\n\nAs in past series, two new contestants competed. With only three judges, a score of 15 stars was possible, and ties were broken by a majority vote between the three. This is where the former contestants came in. Initially, in each category, these three performers made up the \"Winner's Circle\". The winning challenger then had the chance to challenge one of the three performers in his or her respective winner's circle. The winner's circle performer then had to beat or tie the bar set by the challenger; ties were automatically given to the Winner's Circle performer. If they couldn't beat the score, they were out of the competition, and the challenger took his or her place in the Winner's Circle.\n\nHalfway through the series, the three performers in each Winner's Circle competed against each other in a special show. The winner in each category not only received a trip home, but a free pass to the final show. From then on, there were only two people who could be challenged in each Winner's Circle. In the final show, the three people in each Winner's Circle competed against each other for $100,000. This, along with the Free Pass show, were the only two shows which re-adopted the at-home voting concept.\n\n\nThis remake lasted two years before its cancellation in April 2004.\n\nAt the same time, a spin-off called \"Star Search – Das Duell der Stars von Morgen\" was produced and aired in Germany, but with less success than the more popular show \"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\", the German version of the \"Idol\" series.\n\n\n[[Category:1980s American television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American television series]]\n[[Category:CBS network shows]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Singing talent shows]]\n[[Category:Music competitions in the United States]]\n[[Category:Talent shows]]\n[[Category:Television series by Metromedia]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios]]\n[[Category:American reality television series]]\n[[Category:1983 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2003 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1995 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:2004 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Al Masini]]\n[[Category:Operation Prime Time]]"}

Julmahuvi collectively are Tommi Korpela, Jukka Rasila, Janne Reinikainen, Petteri Summanen and Jani Volanen.\n\nThe group first worked together on the sketch-show \"To(i)ni ja Heikki Haaman Show\" which ran from 1995 to -96 on MTV3. After this they produced the mockumentary about a fictional boyband named \"The Joyboys Story\" in 1997.\n\nThe group's most famous show was the sketch show \"Studio Julmahuvi\" which ran for 8 episodes on Yle in 1998. The show was a parody of YLE's own programming, squeezing an entire evening's worth of programming into a half-hour show which included everything from news and weather to a children's show and a German police drama, with commercials and TV-spots on the side. The show was created with an impressive budget of 67 000 € per episode which resulted in extremely high production-values (in comparison to low-budget sketch-shows like Pulttibois and Kummeli).\n\nAfterwards Julmahuvi made \"Jerico 2000\", a parody topic-show which also reused some of the smaller mockumentaries featured in Studio Julmahuvi. It aired on MTV3 in 1999. The last big production was the mini-series \"Mennen Tullen\" which featured several characters from Studio Julmahuvi's fictional cop-shows now in the present day. It aired on YLE between 2000 and 2001. Though produced in the fashion of a serious murder-mystery it was essentially a dark comedy with occasional absurd elements.\n\n\"The Joyboys Story\" won the Bronze Rose of Montreux in 1997 and \"Studio Julmahuvi\" was awarded with the Venla (Finland's equivalent to an Emmy) prize for the best comedy show in 1999.\n\nStudio Julmahuvi, The Joyboys Story, Jerico 2000 and Mennen tullen were all released as a box-set on DVD in 2005 with a bonus CD containing voice-clips and songs featured on \"Z-Salamapartio\", one of the fictional cop-shows set in the 1970s.\n\n"}
{"id": "188834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188834", "title": "TV Guide", "text": "TV Guide\n\nTV Guide is a bi-weekly American magazine that provides television program listings information as well as television-related news, celebrity interviews and gossip, film reviews, crossword puzzles, and, in some issues, horoscopes. The print magazine is owned by NTVB Media, while its digital properties are controlled by the CBS Interactive division of CBS Corporation; the \"TV Guide\" named and associated editorial content from the publication are licensed by CBS Interactive for use on the website and mobile app through an agreement with the magazine's parent subsidiary TVGM Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe prototype of what would become \"TV Guide\" magazine, was developed by Lee Wagner (1910–1993), who was the circulation director of MacFadden Publications in New York City in the 1930s – and later, by the time of the predecessor publication's creation, for Cowles Media Company – distributing magazines focusing on movie celebrities.\n\nIn 1948, he printed New York City area listings magazine \"The TeleVision Guide\", which was first released on local newsstands on June 14 of that year. Silent film star Gloria Swanson, who then starred of the short-lived variety series \"The Gloria Swanson Hour\", appeared on the cover of the first issue. Wagner later began publishing regional editions of \"The TeleVision Guide\" for New England and the Baltimore–Washington area. Five years later, he sold the editions to Walter Annenberg, who folded it into his publishing and broadcasting company Triangle Publications, but remained as a consultant for the magazine until 1963.\n\nThe national \"TV Guide\"s first issue was released on April 3, 1953, accumulating a total circulation of 1,560,000 copies that were sold in the ten U.S. cities where it was distributed. The inaugural cover featured a photograph of Lucille Ball's newborn son Desi Arnaz, Jr., with a downscaled inset photo of Ball placed in the top corner under the issue's headline: \"Lucy's $50,000,000 baby\". The magazine was published in digest size, which remained its printed format for 52 years. From its first issue until the July 2–8, 1954, issue, listings within each edition of \"TV Guide\" began on Friday and ended on Thursday; the July 9–16, 1954, issue began on a Friday and ended on the following Friday. Then, beginning with the July 17–23, 1954, issue, the listings in each week's issue changed to start on Saturday and end on Friday, which remained the listings format for all local editions until April 2004. The formation of \"TV Guide\" as a national publication resulted from Triangle Publications' purchase of numerous regional television listing publications such as \"TV Forecast\" (which was circulated in the Chicago area and, upon its first publication on May 9, 1948, was the first continuously published television listings magazine), \"TV Digest\" (which was distributed in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and was originally distributed under the title, the \"Local Televiser\", when it was first released on November 7, 1948), and the New York-based \"Television Guide\" (which had its title abbreviated to \"TV Guide\" on March 18, 1950). Each of the cities that had their own local TV listings magazine folded into \"TV Guide\" were among the initial cities where the magazine conducted its national launch.\n\nThe launch as a national magazine with local listings in April 1953 became an almost instant success; however, the circulation decreased over subsequent weeks, even as the magazine's distribution expanded to five additional cities (Pittsburgh, Rochester, Detroit, Cleveland and San Francisco) throughout the summer of 1953. By mid-August of that year, sales of the magazine had dropped 200,000 copies below that of the first issue. \"TV Guide\"s fortunes began to turn around with the September 4–10, 1953, issue – the magazine's first \"Fall Preview\" issue – when circulation hit 1,746,327 copies; circulation levels increased steadily over time, to the point where \"TV Guide\" eventually became the most read and circulated magazine in the United States by the 1960s. The initial cost of each issue was 15¢ per copy (equivalent to $ today; the price of each issue has gradually risen over the years, selling for $4.99 per copy as of ). In addition to subscriptions, \"TV Guide\" was sold at the checkout counters of grocery stores nationwide. Until the 1980s, the feature pieces included in each issue were promoted in a television commercial. Under Triangle, \"TV Guide\" continued to grow not only in circulation, but in recognition as the authority on television programming with articles – the majority of which typically appear in the color section – from both staff and contributing writers.\nOver the decades, the shape of the \"TV Guide\" logo has changed to reflect the modernization of the television screen, eventually adopting a widescreen appearance in September 2003, and then to its current flatscreen appearance in September 2016 (different versions of the logo – the only cosmetic difference being the utilization of different typefaces – are currently used respectively for the magazine and the separately owned, CBS-managed digital properties). At first, the logo had various colored backgrounds (usually black, white, blue or green) until the familiar red background became the standard in the 1960s with occasional changes used for special editions.\nThe magazine was first based in a small office in downtown Philadelphia, before moving to more spacious national headquarters in Radnor, Pennsylvania, in the late 1950s. The new facility, complete with a large lighted \"TV Guide\" logo at the building's entrance, based its management, editors, production personnel and subscription processors as well as a vast computer system holding data on every television show and movie available for listing in the popular weekly publication. Printing of the national color section of \"TV Guide\" – which incorporates television-related stories, and select feature columns such as program reviews – took place at Triangle's Gravure Division plant – which was known for performing some of the highest quality printing in the industry, with almost always perfect registration – located adjacent to the company's landmark Inquirer Building on North Broad Street in Philadelphia. The color section was then sent to regional printers to be wrapped around the local listing sections.\n\nIn addition to \"TV Guide\" and its flagship newspaper \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", Triangle Publications also owned the \"Philadelphia Daily News\"; ten radio and six television stations (WFIL AM-FM-TV in Philadelphia, WNHC AM-FM-TV in New Haven, Connecticut, KFRE AM-FM-TV in Fresno, California, WNBF AM-FM-TV in Binghamton, New York, WFBG AM-FM-TV in Altoona, Pennsylvania and WLYH-TV in Lancaster–Lebanon, Pennsylvania); \"The Daily Racing Form\"; \"The Morning Telegraph\"; \"Seventeen\"; and various cable television interests. It was under Triangle's ownership of WFIL-TV that Dick Clark and \"American Bandstand\" came to popularity. Triangle Publications sold its Philadelphia newspapers to Knight Newspapers in 1969, its radio and television stations during the early 1970s to Capital Cities Communications (the television stations that are now known as KFSN-TV and WPVI-TV were subsequently acquired by ABC through its 1986 merger with Capital Cities) and various other interests, retaining only \"TV Guide\", \"Seventeen\" and \"The Daily Racing Form\".\n\nFor the magazine's first 52 years of publication, listings information was displayed in a \"log\" format, a mainly text-based list of programs organized by both start time and channel, which was the sole method – eventually, primary once prime time grids were incorporated, and later secondary for the final two years of its inclusion of local listings – of displaying program information in \"TV Guide\" until the switch to national listings in 2005; this allowed for the display of full titles for each program as well as the inclusion of synopses for movies and most programs. Most listing entries in the log included program genres (and for national news programs, anchors) after the program's title, while its running time (which was mentioned only if a program lasted a minimum of one hour – later 35 minutes – in length) was listed in the synopses.\n\nOriginally, the majority of programs listed in the log each issue featured brief synopses, except for local and national newscasts, and programs airing on certain stations in various timeslots. As other broadcast television stations and cable channels were added, due to set space requirements for the local listings section, detailed synopses were gradually restricted to series and specials – usually those airing in evening timeslots – as well as movies airing on broadcast television, while shorter synopses were used for programs seen on broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market and select cable channels; and only the title along with supplementary information (such as genre and/or program length) for most other broadcast and cable programs. In addition, black-and-white ads for programs scheduled to air on broadcast stations – and later, cable channels – during prime time (with local airtimes, and for broadcast stations, information for network-affiliated stations featured in the edition which were scheduled to air the advertised show) were included within the listings.\n\nA regular feature of the listings section was \"Close-Up,\" which provided expanded reviews of select programs airing each day (various editions of \"Close-Up\" were eventually used for different types of programs, from premieres of new series to shows airing on cable). Over time, other regular and recurring features (most of them television-related) were included alongside the listings including \"Insider\" (a television news and interview section in the lead pages of the color section); \"Cheers and Jeers\" (a critique page about various aspects of television programming); \"Hits and Misses\" (featuring brief reviews of select programs in the coming week, rated on a score from 0 to 10); \"Guidelines\" (a half-page daily section featuring highlights of five or six programs of interest); horoscopes; recaps of the previous week's storylines on network daytime soap operas; a page reviewing new home video (and later, DVD) releases; dedicated pages that respectively listed select sporting events, children's programs and \"four-star\" movies being broadcast during that week; and crossword puzzles. Although its issues usually focus on different television-related stories week to week, \"TV Guide\" also incorporates recurring issues that appear a few times each year, most notably the \"Fall Preview\" (an issue featured since the magazine's inaugural year in 1953, which features reviews of new series premiering during the fall television season), \"Returning Favorites\" (first published in 1996, featuring previews of series renewed from the previous television season returning for the upcoming fall schedule), \"Winter Preview\" (first published in 1994 and later known as the \"(year) TV Preview\" from 2006 to 2009, featuring previews of midseason series) and \"The Best Children's Shows on TV\" (first published in 1989 and later renamed the \"Parents' Guide to Children's Television\" in 1990, and finally as the \"Parent's Guide to Kids' TV\" in 1993, featuring stories and reviews on family-oriented programs).\n\nIcons used for other means than identifying listed stations were first added to the magazine in 1962, denoting television specials and programs broadcast in color. \"TV Guide\" modified all icons incorporated into the local listings section in May 1969, changing the font for the bullets identifying local stations from Futura to the standard Helvetica and extending the TV-shaped bullets to denote color programs (replacing the bar/text icons that had been used for the previous seven years); as color programming became more ubiquitous, in August 1972, the magazine opted to instead included identifying programs originating in black and white (marked under the abbreviation \"BW\"). In September 1981, listings began to identify programs presented with closed or open captions or with on-screen sign language interpretation.\n\nThe advent of cable television would become hard on \"TV Guide\". Cable channels began to be listed in the magazine in 1980 or 1981, depending on the edition; the channels listed also differed with the corresponding edition. Regional and national superstations available on cable systems in the designated market of many editions were the only cable channels listed initially as well as, in certain markets, over-the-air subscription services transmitted over local independent stations (such as ONTV); local subscription television services were often listed as \"STV Programming\" or \"Subscription Television\" for the channel carrying the service, with the service listed separately or, in some editions, not at all. Cable-originated channels – such as HBO, CNN (both of which the magazine originally promoted mainly in full-page advertisements), the CBN Cable Network (now Freeform), the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS, since succeeded by A&E) and Nickelodeon – were added gradually between the winter of late 1981 and the first half of 1982, depending on the edition.\n\nTo save channel space, \"TV Guide\" incorporated a grid (a rowed display of listings for programs scheduled to air during the evening hours each night, primarily organized by channel) into the listings in September 1981, which was slotted at a random page within each day's afternoon listings. The grid originated as a single-page feature that provided a summary of programs airing during prime time (from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. or 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. depending on the start of prime time within a given time zone) on the stations mentioned in the corresponding edition; by 1985, it was expanded to a two-page section – which began to take up roughly three-quarters of the two adjoining pages on which it was placed – that included programs airing during the early access and late fringe periods (from 5:00 to 11:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. local time), with the beginning and end of the magazine-defined prime time daypart (between 7:30 and 11:00 p.m. or between 6:30 and 10:00 p.m. local time on Monday through Saturdays, and between 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. or between 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. local time on Sundays) delineated by a thicker border. Channels listed in the grid were organized by broadcast stations, basic cable channels, and premium channels.\n\nIn August 1982, the magazine expanded its coverage of cable programming with the introduction of two feature sections. The first, the \"CablePay Section,\" was a separate color insert that followed the Friday listings, which provided highlights of programs airing on the national basic and premium cable channels (this feature was discontinued in 1985, at which time, cable program highlights were folded into the \"Guidelines\" feature). The second feature, the \"Cable and Pay-TV Movie Guide\" (later renamed the \"Pay-TV Movie Guide\" in 1984 and \"Premium Channels Movie Guide\" in 1997), initially followed the \"CablePay\" insert before being moved to the pages immediately following the Friday listings in May 1985, resulting in the national section – which had been cordoned into two sections, both preceding and following the local section – being consolidated into the first half of the pages comprising each issue. The \"Movie Guide,\" which encompassed the final pages of each edition, provided summaries of films scheduled to air over the next one to two weeks on the cable channels included in both the log \"and\" grid listings (excluding those featured exclusively in the grids) as well as a first-page summary of the films scheduled to premiere that week (arranged by channel and sub-categorized by title). As the years went on, more cable channels were added into the listings of each edition. To help offset this, the May 11–17, 1985, issue introduced a smaller Helvetica font for the log, along with some other cosmetic changes; in particular, a show's length began to be listed after the show's title instead of at the end of its synopsis. That issue also saw advertising for local stations featured in the corresponding edition be restricted to certain special events, with most program promotions being restricted to those for national broadcast and cable networks.\n\nOn August 7, 1988, Triangle Publications was sold to the News America Corporation arm of News Corporation for $3 billion, one of the largest media acquisitions of the time and the most expensive publication transaction at the time. The November 3–9, 1990, issue saw the addition of VCR Plus+ codes in some of the magazine's regional editions, in order for users with devices incorporating the technology – which was developed by eventual \"TV Guide\" parent Gemstar International Group Ltd. – to input into their VCRs to automatically record television programs. (Two-digit PlusCodes corresponding to the channel airing the program that a user wished to record were listed after each channel in the channel directory page; six- to eight-digit codes for individual programs were listed in the log listings section following the title of each program.) The PlusCodes expanded to all local editions beginning with the September 14–20, 1991, issue. The September 12–18, 1992, issue saw the addition of bullet icons identifying colorized versions of older feature films.\n\nOn March 7, 1996, \"TV Guide\" launched the iGuide, originally developed by the News Corporation-MCI joint venture Delphi Internet Service Corp. as a web portal, which featured more comprehensive television listings data than those offered by the magazine (with information running two weeks in advance of the present date), as well as news content, \"TV Guide\" editorial content and a search feature called CineBooks, which allowed users to access detailed information on about 30,000 film titles. Later that year, content from the print publication was added to iGuide as well as content from News Corporation's other media properties. On January 13, 1997, shortly before MCI bowed out of the venture, iGuide was relaunched as the TV Guide Entertainment Network (TVGEN), which was renamed TV Guide Online in 2002. The refocused site covered television, music, movies and sports (with content concerning the latter sourced from Fox Sports), along with wire news and features from Reuters, \"Daily Variety\" and \"The New York Post\", free e-mail updates for registered users, and a chat room that was developed to accommodate 5,000 users simultaneously.\n\nAdditional changes to the listings took place with the September 14–20, 1996 edition of the print publication. Starting with that issue, program titles switched from being displayed in all-uppercase to being shown in a mixed case, Franklin Gothic typeface, film titles – which had previously been displayed within the film description – began appearing before a film's synopsis in an italicized format (replacing the generic \"MOVIE\" header that had been used to identify films since the magazine's inception), and children's programs that were compliant with the Children's Television Act of 1990 began to be designated by a circular \"E/I\" icon. In addition, infomercials (which had been designated under the boilerplate title \"COMMERCIAL PROGRAM[S]\" until 1994, and \"INFORMERCIAL[S]\" thereafter) ceased being listed in the magazine during time periods in which stations aired them. (Time-brokered programs continued to be listed in the magazine, but were primarily restricted to religious programming.) Replacing the text identifiers that had been included within the film synopses, theatrically released films also began to be identified by a black-and-white boxed \"M\" symbol, accompanied depending on the film by its star rating (a formula, on a scale of one [for \"poor\"] to four [for \"excellent\"], based on a consensus of reviews from leading film critics, the quality of the film's cast and director, and the film's box office revenue and award wins). Movie icons also were appropriated to identify direct-to-video (marked as \"M→V\") or made-for-TV (marked as \"M→T\") releases, which were not assigned star ratings. Beginning with the January 25–31, 1997, issue, the log listings began incorporating content ratings for programs assigned through the newly implemented TV Parental Guidelines system (the system's content ratings were subsequently added upon their introduction in October 1998).\nNews Corporation sold \"TV Guide\" to the United Video Satellite Group, parent company of Prevue Networks, on June 11, 1998, for $800 million and 60 million shares of stock worth an additional $1.2 billion (this followed an earlier merger attempt between the two companies in 1996 that eventually fell apart). Following the sale, reports suggested that \"TV Guide\" would remove program listings from the magazine, shifting them entirely to its new sister cable network Prevue Channel, which would be rebranded as a result of United Video's purchase of \"TV Guide\" magazine; News Corporation executives later stated that listings information would remain part of the magazine. That year, United Video acquired TVSM Inc. (publishers of competing listings guides \"Total TV\" and \"The Cable Guide\") in a $75 million all-cash acquisition; as a result, \"TV Guide\" merged with \"Total TV\", and began printing a version of the magazine in the latter magazine's full-size format (while retaining the original digest size version) effective with the July 11, 1998, issue.\n\nBecause most cable systems published their own listing magazine reflecting their channel lineup, and now had a separate guide channel or an electronic program guide that can be activated by remote and provide the same information in a more detailed manner – with additional competition coming in the late 1990s from websites that also specialize in providing detailed television program information (such as TVGuide.com, then jointly operated with \"TV Guide Magazine\", and Zap2It), a printed listing of programming in a separate magazine became less valuable. The sheer amount and diversity of cable television programming made it hard for \"TV Guide\" to provide listings of the extensive array of programming that came directly over the cable system. \"TV Guide\" also could not match the ability of the cable box to store personalized listings. Nevertheless, beginning with the September 12–18, 1998, issue, the magazine added several new channels to many of its editions, including those that had previously been mentioned only in a foreword on the channel lineup page as well as those that were available mainly on digital cable and satellite; although most of these newly added channels were placed within the prime time grids, only a few (such as Animal Planet and MSNBC) were also incorporated into the log listings.\n\nFeatures in the magazine were also revamped with the additions of \"The Robins Report\" (a review column by writer J. Max Robins), \"Family Page\" (featuring reviews of family-oriented programs) and picks of select classic films airing that week, as well as the removal of the \"Guidelines\" feature in the listings section in favor of the new highlight page \"Don't Miss\" (listing choice programs selected by the magazine's staff for the coming week) in the national color section. Listings for movies within the log also began identifying made-for-TV and direct-to-video films, as well as quality ratings on a scale of one to four stars (signifying movies that have received \"poor\" to \"excellent\" reviews).\n\nIn 1999, the magazine began hosting the \"TV Guide Awards\", an awards show (which was telecast on Fox) honoring television programs and actors, with the winners being chosen by \"TV Guide\" subscribers through a nominee ballot inserted in the magazine; the telecast was discontinued after the 2001 event. The July 17–23, 1999, edition saw the evening grids be scaled down to the designated prime time hours, 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. (or 7:00 to 10:00 p.m.) Monday through Saturdays and 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. (or 6:00 to 10:00 p.m.) on Sundays, to compliment the descriptive log listings for those time periods; this also allowed the grids to be contained to a single page in certain editions that provided listings for more than 20 cable channels.\n\nOn October 5, 1999, Gemstar International Group Ltd., the maker of the VCR Plus+ device and schedule system (whose channel and program codes for VCRs using the system for timed recordings were incorporated into the magazine's listings in 1988), and which incidentally was partially owned by News Corporation, purchased United Video Satellite Group; the two companies had previously been involved in a legal battle over the intellectual property rights for their respective interactive program guide systems, VCR Plus+ and TV Guide On Screen, that began in 1994. That month, \"TV Guide\" debuted a 16-page insert into editions in 22 markets with large Hispanic populations titled \"TV Guide en Español\", which provided programming information from national Spanish language networks (such as Univision and Telemundo) as well as special sections with reviews of the week's notable programs. The magazine discontinued the insert in March 2000 due to difficulties resulting from confusion by advertisers over its marketing as \"the first weekly Spanish-language magazine,\" despite its structure as an insert within the main \"TV Guide\" publication.\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of \"TV Guide\" as a national magazine, in 2002, the magazine published six special issues:\n\nBy 2003, the number of cable channels that were only listed in the grids expanded, with the addition of channels such as BBC America, Soapnet and the National Geographic Channel (some editions also featured a limited amount of broadcast stations – either in-market, out-of-market or both – exclusively in the grids); conversely, sister cable network TV Guide Channel (whose listings were added to the magazine after the Gemstar purchase) was relegated from the log listings to the grids in most editions. From its inception until 2003, \"TV Guide\" had offered listings for the entire week, 24 hours a day. Numerous changes to the local listings took place beginning with the June 21, 2003 issue – in just a few select markets, when the 5:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday listings were condensed down to four grids: these ran from 5:00 to 8:00 a.m., 8:00 to 11:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., and 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. If programming differed from one weekday to the next, the generic descriptor \"Various Programs\" was listed. The weekday grid maintained day-to-day listings for certain cable channels (primarily movie channels as well as a limited number of basic cable channels such as Lifetime, The History Channel and USA Network), which were organized separately from the other channels. These changes became permanent in all \"TV Guide\" editions beginning with the September 13, 2003, \"Fall Preview\" issue.\n\nOther changes were made to the magazine beginning with the June 21 issue in select markets and the 2003 \"Fall Preview\" issue elsewhere. A half-page daily prime time highlights section featuring the evening's notable shows, movies and sports events – similar to the former \"Guidelines\" feature – was re-added to the listings section; a full-page \"Weekday Highlights\" page was also added featuring guest and topical information for the week's daytime talk and morning shows as well as picks for movies airing during the day on broadcast and cable channels. In addition, while log listings continued in use for prime time listings, program synopses were added to the grids and log, as well as a \"NEW\" indicator for first-run episodes, replacing the \"(Repeat)\" indicator in the log's synopses. The \"Premium Channels Movie Guide\" was also restructured as \"The Big Movie Guide,\" with film listings being expanded to include those airing on all broadcast networks and cable channels featured in each edition (as well as some that were not listed in a particular local edition), as well as movies that were available on pay-per-view (page references to the films included in this section were also incorporated into the prime time grids and log listings). Beginning in January 2004, the midnight to 5:00 a.m. listings (as well as the Saturday and Sunday 5:00 to 8:00 a.m. listings) ceased to include any broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market, leaving only program information for stations within the home market and for cable channels.\n\nThe magazine's format was changed beginning with the April 11, 2004, issue to start the week's listings in each issue on Sunday (the day in which television listings magazines supplemented in newspapers traditionally began each week's listings information), rather than Saturday. In July 2004, the overnight listings were removed entirely, replaced by a grid that ran from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. that included only the broadcast stations in each edition's home market and a handful of cable channels. It also listed a small selection of late-night movies airing on certain channels. The time period of the listings in the daytime grids also shifted from starting at 5:00 a.m. and ending at 5:00 p.m. to running from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. By this point, the log listings were restricted to programs airing from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. In early 2005, more channels were added to the prime time and late-night grids.\n\nOn July 26, 2005, Gemstar-TV Guide announced that \"TV Guide\" would abandon its longtime digest size format and begin printing as a larger full-size national magazine that would offer more stories and fewer program listings. All 140 local editions were eliminated, being replaced by two editions covering the time zones within the contiguous United States: one for the Eastern and Central time zones, and one for the Pacific and Mountain time zones (which had existed separately from the local editions prior to the change, although their distribution was primarily limited to hotels). The change in format was attributed to the increase in the internet, cable television channels (like TV Guide Network), electronic program guides and digital video recorders as the sources of choice for viewers' program listings. The new version of \"TV Guide\" went on sale on October 17, 2005, and featured \"\" host Ty Pennington on the cover. The listings format, now consisting entirely of grids, also changed to start the listings in each week's issue on Monday rather than Sunday. As a result of the elimination of the local editions, broadcast stations were replaced by broadcast network schedules with the description \"Local Programming\" being used to denote time periods in which syndicated, locally produced or paid programs would air instead of network shows.\n\nIn September 2006, \"TV Guide\" launched a redesigned website, with expanded original editorial and user-generated content not included in the print magazine. On December 22, 2006, \"TV Guide\" introduced the magazine's first ever two-week edition. The edition, which featured Rachael Ray on the cover, was issued for the period from December 25, 2006 to January 7, 2007. In early 2008, the Monday through Friday daytime and daily late night grids were eliminated from the listings section, and the television highlights section was compressed into a six-page review of the week, rather than the previous two pages for each night. By 2007, \"TV Guide\"s circulation had decreased to less than three million copies from a peak of almost 20 million in 1970.\n\nWith the $2.8 billion acquisition of Gemstar-TV Guide by Macrovision on May 2, 2008, that company, which purchased the former mostly to take advantage of their lucrative and profitable VCR Plus and electronic program guide patents, stated it wanted to sell both the magazine and TV Guide Network, along with the company's horse racing channel TVG Network to other parties.\n\nOn May 18, 2005, \"TV Guide Talk\", a weekly podcast that was available to download for free, was launched. The podcast was headlined by \"TV Guide\" reporter/personality Michael Ausiello, and was co-hosted by his colleagues at the magazine, Matt Webb Mitovich, Angel Cohn, Daniel Manu and Maitland McDonagh. Each episode featured commentary from TV Guide staff on the week's entertainment news stories, television programs, and film releases, as well as occasional interviews with actors, producers, and executives. On April 4, 2008 (following Ausiello's move to \"Entertainment Weekly\"), it was announced that the podcast would be ending, and the final episode (Episode No. 139) was released on April 10, 2008.\n\nTV Guide Talk podcasts were released every Friday afternoon and averaged an hour in length. They featured the participants discussing and commenting on the past week in television and the entertainment industry in general. The beginning of each podcast was devoted to in-depth discussion on the week's biggest new story in the entertainment industry, whether it be a television program or something outside the scope of television show or movie (such as the Academy Awards or the Emmys). The middle part was devoted to discussion and commentary on individual shows. The podcast emphasized programs that tend to have a large online following even if that following is not necessarily reflected in the programs' Nielsen rating. Examples include \"American Idol\", \"Heroes\", \"Lost\", \"Survivor\", \"Gilmore Girls\", \"Veronica Mars\", and \"Project Runway\" (the latter three being examples a low-rated shows which nevertheless have sizable online followings). Each podcast also ended with a weekly review of that weekend's new theatrical releases.\n\nOn October 13, 2008, Macrovision sold the money-losing magazine (which was reportedly posting revenue losses of $20 million per year by that point) to Beverly Hills-based equity fund OpenGate Capital for $1, and a $9.5 million loan at 3% interest. As part of the sale, however, Macrovision retained ownership of the companion website – which was then sold to equity firm One Equity Partners for $300 million – which severed all editorial connections between the magazine and website, including the end of critic Matt Roush's presence on TVGuide.com. The editorial content of the magazine was launched on a new site, TVGuideMagazine.com, which did not feature \"TV Guide\"s listings in any form. TVGuideMagazine.com was later shut down on June 1, 2010; \"TV Guide\" magazine and TVGuide.com then entered into a deal to restore content from the magazine to the latter website, which Lionsgate Entertainment had bought along with the TV Guide Network in January 2009.\n\nIn January 2009, the magazine cut several networks from its grid listings – including MTV and DIY Network – citing \"space concerns\"; however, two cuts, those of The CW and TV Guide Network, were seen as suspicious and arbitrary, as the magazine carries several channels which have the same schedule night after night or have low viewership and could have easily been cut, while several Fox-owned networks continued to be listed due to agreements with the former News Corporation ownership. It is likely that TV Guide Network's removal from \"TV Guide\"s listings was related to the \"divorce\" of the website and network from the magazine. In early February 2009, The CW and MTV were brought back to the listings after the magazine received numerous emails protesting the move; as a consequence, listings for several low-rated networks were removed. The other channels previously incorporated into the listings before their removal were slowly re-added, until TV Guide Network's schedule returned to the listings pages in June 2010 with its logo prominent within the grids as part of the deal with Lionsgate's TV Guide division. Under OpenGate ownership, \"TV Guide\" slowly returned to profitability mainly through cost reductions instituted by its venture capital parent, making significant staffing reductions and switching to bi-weekly editions full-time, reducing the number of issues it published to 29 per year.\n\nIn March 2013, CBS Corporation acquired One Equity Partners' stake of their TV Guide assets. The CBS acquisition was finalized later that month for $100 million. On May 31, 2013, CBS bought Lionsgate's share of TV Guide Digital, which includes the website and mobile apps. On January 31, 2014, OpenGate Capital and CBS Interactive announced a deal to cross-promote \"TV Guide Magazine\" with TVGuide.com and CBS Interactive's other internet properties (including TV.com, Metacritic and CNET).\n\nOn June 26, 2014, OpenGate Capital announced that \"TV Guide\" would undergo a major redesign beginning with the August 11 issue; the magazine eliminated 14 pages of listings, with the listings pages that remained displaying programming information for only top-rated broadcast and cable networks. It also added \"enhanced editorial features,\" including recommendation sections focusing on traditional television and online programming – such as additional content from senior critic Matt Roush (an expanded \"Roush Review\" column and an additional column featuring ten picks for each week's programs as selected by Roush) and several new sections (\"Upfront,\" featuring trending television-related stories, infographics, question-and-answer coluumns and ratings charts; \"The Guide,\" containing expanded highlights for each day's television programming, including sports, daytime programming and content available for streaming online; a monthly television-related technology column; \"The TV Guide Interview,\" an occasional feature featuring celebrity interviews focusing on their career; and \"On Demand,\" a review column of movies premiering through streaming and on-demand services). In addition, the magazine's size was reduced from 7³/₈×10¼ inches to 7×10 inches in a cost-saving measure; it also began to be distributed in airport newsstands.\n\nOn October 8, 2015, OpenGate Capital sold the magazine and co-owned website TVInsider.com to Troy, Michigan-based publishing company NTVB Media for an undisclosed amount, marking \"TV Guide\"s third ownership transaction in eight years (OpenGate managing partner Andrew Nikou stated that the purchase price was for \"more than $1 and less than $3 billion,\" while estimates from other industry sources stated that the magazine sold for a price within the range of $12 million). TVGM Holdings chief executive officer David J. Fishman and chief financial officer Joe Clemente as well as the remainder of the magazine's 62-person staff will remain with the company; the magazine's corporate offices in New York City, Los Angeles and Newtown Square, Pennsylvania will also remain in operation – the former two of which also continue to base the magazine's editorial staff.\n\nThe acquisition made NTVB Media the largest owner of consumer television publications in the United States, with a combined reach of more than 20 million readers. NTVB already owned \"TV Weekly\" and \"Channel Guide\", both of which provide national editorial content and – through syndication agreements with 160+ newspapers throughout the country, in which they are distributed as supplementary publications incorporated within each paper's Sunday editions – listings customized for individual regions (the company began distributing its listings magazines in this manner in 2008, as newspapers began to cease publication of their proprietary television listings magazines due to cost-cutting measures spurred by declining circulation and revenue); it also publishes listings publications for pay television providers such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Dish Network. As such, it is undetermined whether NTVB will reach deals to distribute \"TV Guide\" to newspapers on a separate basis or extend the name to its existing television publications. Staff with \"TV Guide\" and NTVB's other titles will collaborate on feature content included in the respective magazines, while the company will fold advertising sales for the magazine with its existing television magazine titles.\n\nFrom the magazine's inception until the October 2005 conversion to national listings based on time zone, \"TV Guide\" maintained a local-national hybrid format with local editions tailored to a specific region or individual market. Each regional edition generally served either a single city or a designated region (comprising the largest market[s] served by the edition and one or more smaller, adjacent markets, or a single or multiple neighboring states or provinces). South Dakota, Delaware and the U.S. territories did not have their own editions during the local listings era. In the case of the two U.S. states, Rapid City and Sioux Falls, South Dakota (which had their corresponding television stations listed in the Northern Colorado and Nebraska statewide editions, respectively), were presumably both considered too small to have their own editions and were located too far away from one another to be included in one edition; Delaware is split between two markets – New Castle and Kent counties are part of the Philadelphia market (which comprised two editions, the regional Southeast Pennsylvania edition and a market-specific edition for the Philadelphia area), while Sussex County is part of the Salisbury, Maryland, market (which had its stations listed in the Washington-Baltimore edition until 1994, and the Baltimore edition thereafter). Some editions that once provided statewide listings were eventually split off into separate editions that only provided listings for a specific region; in addition, certain markets have been added or dropped from some editions.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, nearly 150 editions of the magazine were published; during that decade, \"TV Guide\" began to diversify its editions from those for individual cities and multiple media markets within a given state or multi-state region to include editions for certain cable providers in larger television markets – which were later branded as \"Ultimate Cable\" editions – as well as editions for satellite providers such as DirecTV and Dish Network (which were published in addition to the listings magazines that both providers produced themselves).\n\nEach channel in the listings section was designated by a bullet, which, like the magazine's logo, appeared in the shape of a television screen. Bullets used for broadcast stations contained a channel number, which had a different layout depending on the identified channel, and were often used in network promotional ads included to identify local affiliates carrying the advertised program. Filled black bullets with a white number overlaid on them designed local broadcast stations located in one of the primary market areas served by a specific edition; white bullets with a black screen outline indicated stations in outlying secondary markets covered by the corresponding edition. Out-of-market stations featured an alphanumeric identifier (with a letter next to the channel number) to disambiguate it from a local station, particularly in feature pages preceding the main listings (such as in the Northern Wisconsin edition, in which \"6M\" was used to disambiguate WLUC-TV in Marquette, Michigan, from WITI in Milwaukee, which only used a \"6\" as its identifier).\n\nThere were some exceptions to this formatting. For example, the Hawaii edition had the primary Honolulu-based stations listed first, followed by their satellite sister stations, while the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, edition had that market's primary stations listed first, followed by the out-of-market outlets; the latter being unique with having the other stations listed below WPGH (channel 53) when it listed a show during non-network hours, and during a network-scheduled lineup – in this case, NBC – the primary station and channel being listed first – WPXI (11), followed by WJAC-TV/Johnstown (6), WTOV-TV/Steubenville (9), WBOY-TV/Clarksburg, West Virginia (12) and WFMJ-TV/Youngstown, Ohio (21) – instead of by order of over-the-air channel number for all stations. If a certain edition featured more than one station that transmitted on the same channel but served different markets, the primary station in the edition was designated by a black bullet with a white number, while the other was indicated by a white bullet with a black number; some editions have also used a split (half for stations broadcasting on frequencies from channel 10 and up; three split with the channel number in the middle) or vertical channel bullet if it covered a large area. At times, several editions with out-of-market channels would have the bullets changed, like the Memphis Edition, where stations outside the primary area (especially the original channels in Jackson, Tennessee, Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Tupelo, Mississippi that became part of the lineup since the 1960 inception) that was listed in black bullet/white numbers was reconfigured to white bullet/black numbers after more stations were added in 1980.\n\nUpon the incorporation of those channels into the listings section in 1979–80, out-of-market superstations were first identified alphanumerically, indicating them by a combination of their over-the-air channel number and a letter representing their originating market city (WKBD-TV in Detroit, which effectively served as the Fox affiliate for most of Michigan until December 1994 via cable, was listed as \"50D\", for instance). By 1984, the three major national superstations at the time, TBS, WGN and WOR (which were respectively identified as \"17A\", \"9C\" and \"9N\"), were given conventional abbreviated letter designations used by other cable channels. Alphanumeric identifiers were also used in some regional editions to disambiguate broadcast stations with identical channel numbers – usually for an out-of-market station, with the numeric identifier used for either a local or out-of-market station – in genre-based listings pages (such as the sports guide), crossreferences in the pages preceding the local listings and within the listings section for stations serving as default network affiliates (via cable) in markets without a local major network outlets. (One notable exception was the New Mexico edition, which from 1984 until 2005, listed Los Angeles stations KTLA, KTTV and KCOP-TV, which were available via cable in some parts of the state at certain points during that period, under the codes \"TLA,\" \"COP\" and \"TTV\" rather than \"5L,\" \"11L\" and \"13L\".)\n\nThe outlined bullets that were originally used only for out-of-market television stations were also assigned to cable-originated channels when those began to be incorporated into the listings section in 1981, indicating those services by a three-letter abbreviation in a condensed typeface: for example, \"ESN\" represented ESPN, \"DSC\" represented The Discovery Channel and \"NIK\" represented Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite. (E! and FX later became exceptions, as those channels were identified by two-character abbreviations.) In certain cases, the abbreviation used (such as \"AMC\" for American Movie Classics, \"TNT\" for \"Turner Network Television\" and \"MTV\" for \"Music Television\") was that which the channel had already branded by (The Nashville Network [now the Paramount Network] is a noted exception, as it was originally assigned the abbreviation \"NSH,\" rather than its network-assigned initialism \"TNN\"). Following that group's launch in September 1998, in editions in which one or more smaller markets served by said edition had local affiliates of the primarily cable-only service, affiliates of The WB 100+ Station Group were also identified in the same manner as conventional cable channels (under the abbreviation \"WB\") for brevity. Some PBS state or regional member networks were listed similarly in certain editions (such as Mississippi ETV [now Mississippi Public Broadcasting], which was listed in the Memphis edition under the code \"E\"). Two pay cable networks, Cinemax and Showtime eventually rebranded in 1997 so that their respective \"TV Guide\" abbreviations – \"MAX\" and \"SHO\" – became the focal point of their logos. Some of the channels that were added to the prime time grids beginning with the September 12–18, 1998, issue were identified by four character abbreviations (such as \"BBCA\" for BBC America and \"HBOS\" for HBO Signature). In cable-specific editions, a bullet indicating a broadcast or cable channel's local cable assignment (except where a broadcast station's cable channel assignment is the same as its over-the-air channel or where smaller cable systems are listed) appeared alongside the specific station or network indicator.\n\nSome cable channels – mainly premium channels – had an asterisk displayed by them in that edition's channel directory, which meant that it was only listed in the evening grid (and later the \"Pay-TV Movie Guide\"). Cable channels like Cinemax and The Disney Channel initially had their programming listed exclusively within the prime time program grids in some editions of the magazine, but were later expanded to have their full daily schedules included in the log listings as well. In some larger markets where the local \"TV Guide\" edition maintained a regionalized format, pay-per-view services (such as Request TV and Viewer's Choice) were also included in the prime time grids. By the mid-1990s, most editions of \"TV Guide\" provided program listings for nearly all cable channels featured in each issue within both the grids and the log listings, although some editions continued to list at least one channel, such as The Movie Channel (the only premium service that was excluded from the log listings in many editions by that point – though its inclusion in the log, as with select other cable channels, varied by market – until the September 1998 additions of Starz, Encore, and HBO multiplex channels HBO Plus (now HBO2) and HBO3 (now HBO Signature) to the listings), exclusively in the grids. (Starz and Encore were listed in select markets where either network was available prior to being expanded to all local and regional editions with the 1998 \"Fall Preview\" issue.)\n\nIf the same program or episode was scheduled to air in the same timeslot on more than one channel, two or more bullets identifying each channel would precede the program title listed in a particular time entry. The usage of multiple bullets to denote stations airing the same program was a more common occurrence in instances where multiple broadcast stations aired the same network program or their respective local news programs at the same time, although this also applied to broadcast and/or cable channels carrying the same episode of a syndicated program; separate time entries would only be used in this situation if the program had differing running times between channels (the grouping of bullets based on a station's affiliated network was later applied to the prime time grids beginning in September 2003). Another example would involve the synopsis or topic of the program listed; if the same description from the program aired on different channels later on in the day or during that week when it had aired first on another station listed in the edition, readers will notice “See ch.(xx) at (day/time) for details” below the program.\n\nFor much of the log listings era, the listings section was preceded by a channel directory, which listed the broadcast stations – and later, cable channels – whose program information was provided in each edition. The listed channels were organized numerically for broadcast stations and alphabetically (by abbreviation) for cable channels. Until cable-originated channels were added to the magazine, the directory exclusively listed broadcast television stations serving the individual markets serviced by the corresponding edition. Each station was listed in a separate entry corresponding to their city of license, and in some cases, one or more stations serving a particular media market were broken out from competing stations serving the same market based on their primary city of service (for example, in the Oklahoma City/Oklahoma State and North Texas editions, ABC affiliate KSWO-TV in Lawton, Oklahoma – which was designated under a black bullet until the Oklahoma City and Tulsa editions were consolidated into a singular Oklahoma State edition in November 2003, when it began being identified by the outlined bullets assigned to its same-market competitors – was listed as serving \"Lawton/Wichita Falls,\" appearing in a separate entry from the three stations serving the primary city of that station's home market, Wichita Falls, Texas, NBC affiliate KFDX-TV, CBS affiliate KAUZ-TV and independent station-turned-Fox affiliate KJTL).\n\nThe directory originally appeared in the lower one-quarter of the listings section's first page; from the May 11–17, 1985, issue onward, it became a full-page insert that directly preceded the listings. Until the May 31–June 6, 1969, issue, the directory also included studio addresses for each of the listed stations. Beginning with the June 7–13, 1969, issue, a foreword was included in the directory to denote that all public television stations listed in the corresponding edition broadcast instructional programs for classroom use during the academic year.\n\nAdditional forewording was added below the listed channels in the lineup page beginning with the September 10–16, 1983, \"Fall Preview\" issue (in select markets; expanded nationwide with the May 11–17, 1985, issue) that provided descriptions of channels that were not included in each issue; this foreword was removed beginning with the September 12, 1998, issue, as the magazine began adding many of the channels mentioned in that paragraph. If any broadcast television stations listed in a particular edition operated satellite stations to cover adjacent areas not adequately covered by the main signal, a notation listing each repeater – identified only by channel number – was included directing readers living in those areas to view programs on those station in correspondence to their originating station (for example, readers of the Northern Wisconsin edition would be guided to the following, \"for programs on 3 Escanaba, Mich., see 5; on 28 Eau Claire, 31 La Crosse and 55 Ellison Bay, Wis., see 38; on 22 Sturgeon Bay, see 26.\")\n\nFrom the magazine's incorporation of cable-originated channels in its local editions in 1982 until 1984/85, nationally distributed basic cable channels (such as ESPN, Nickelodeon, Lifetime and CNN) were typically separated from out-of-market stations distributed to area cable providers in the channel lineup page, under the heading \"Satellite Program Services,\" while premium channels (like HBO and Showtime) were categorized as \"Pay-TV Services\"; all cable channels listed in each edition were listed in alphabetical order thereafter, with premium services only being categorized separately from other cable channels in the prime time grids. Notations were also included in some editions, starting with the September 14–20, 1985 \"Fall Preview\" issue, to outline programming offered on certain local stations not listed in that edition. In some editions, particularly the \"Ultimate Cable\" and satellite editions, the channel lineup was diagrammed in the form of a conversion chart that listed each channel's assigned placement on cable and satellite providers as well as their VCR Plus+ code number; the lineup pages in some of the local editions switched to these charts beginning in 2003, listing channel slots for major cable providers within the local edition's home market (or in more regionalized editions, the largest markets served by that edition). The channel lineup page was dropped in June 2004 in most local editions.\n\nIn June 1998, the \"TV Guide\" brand and magazine were acquired by United Video Satellite Group, the parent company of the Prevue Channel – a channel first launched in 1981 as the Electronic Program Guide network, that was carried by cable and some satellite television providers and was originally formatted to feature a scrolling program guide, short segments featuring previews of upcoming programs, and promos and short-form film trailers for programs airing on various channels. Its new owners promptly rebranded Prevue as the TV Guide Channel on February 1, 1999. With the rebranding, some of the hourly segments featured on the channel at that point were renamed after features in the magazine, including \"TV Guide Close-Up\", \"TV Guide Sportsview\" (which was formatted more similarly to the listings section's sports guide than the color column of that name) and \"TV Guide Insider\". After Gemstar's acquisition of \"TV Guide\", the channel began to shift towards airing full-length programs featuring celebrity gossip and movie-focused talk shows alongside the program listings; the channel was rebranded as the TV Guide Network in 2007.\n\nFollowing the respective sales of TV Guide's magazine and cable channel by Macrovision to OpenGate Capital and Lionsgate, the magazine and TV Guide Network became operationally separate, although the two properties still collaborated on content for TVGuide.com. After CBS Corporation bought stakes in TV Guide's properties in March 2013, TV Guide Network was rebranded under the abbreviated name TVGN that April to de-emphasize its ties to \"TV Guide\" magazine, as part of a transition into a general entertainment format while the channel gradually decommissioned its scrolling listings grid. The network was relaunched as Pop on January 14, 2015, with its programming focus shifting towards shows about pop culture and its fandom.\n\nTV Insider is a website promoted internally as an online \"guide to...TV\" published by \"TV Guide\"s parent holding company TVGM Holdings, LLC, which launched in January 2015. The website features reviews and interviews from critics and columnists (such as Matt Roush) who write for the print magazine.\n\nTV Weekly is a weekly magazine that offers television listings for viewers in the local markets, featuring the local channels and regional cable networks alongside the major network and cable outlets. The settings are similar to \"TV Guide's\" national listings.\n\nTV Guide Crosswords was a spin-off publication, first published in the late 1980s, based on the crossword puzzle feature in the penultimate page of each issue. The puzzles featured in \"TV Guide\" and the standalone magazine featured answers related to television programs, films, actors, entertainment history and other entertainment-related trivia. In addition to the regular magazine, \"TV Guide Crosswords\" also published special editions as well as books.\n\nTV Guide's Parents' Guide to Children's Entertainment was a quarterly spin-off publication, which was first released on newsstands on May 27, 1993. The magazine featured reviews on television shows, home videos, music, books and toys marketed to children ages 2 to 12, as well as behind-the-scenes features centering on children's television shows and films. To limit confusion among readers, the \"Parents' Guide\" issues were printed as a standard-size magazine instead of the digest scale then applied by the parent \"TV Guide\" magazine. The magazine ceased publication following the Spring 1996 issue, with some content covered by the spin-off magazine continuing to be featured in \"TV Guide\"s annual \"Parents' Guide to Kids TV\" issue.\n\nTV Guide Interactive is an interactive electronic program guide software system incorporated into digital set-top boxes provided by cable providers; the program listings grid rendered by the software is visually similar in its presentation to the grid used by the present-day Pop under its former TV Guide Network/TVGN identity on some providers.\n\nA separate IPG system, \"TV Guide On Screen\", was a brand name for Guide Plus+, a build of software featured in products such as televisions, DVD and digital video recorders, and other digital television devices providing on-screen program listings. First marketed in the mid-1990s, it was originally owned by Gemstar-TV Guide International before being acquired by the Rovi Corporation on December 7, 2007 in a $2.8 billion cash and stock deal. From November 2012 to April 2013, Rovi gradually discontinued broadcast transmission of the Guide Plus+ service.\n\n\nNational television listings magazines using the \"TV Guide\" name (verbatim or translated into the magazine's language of origin) are also published in other countries, but none of these are believed to be affiliated with the North American publication: \n\n\n"}

It is delivered through analogue and digital terrestrial, cable, IPTV, and the Internet. Satellite TV is not common, although many housing estates have dishes and re-distribute a limited number of free channels through coaxial cables. The dominant broadcaster is TVB.\n\nHong Kong's television history began with the launch of Rediffusion Television (RTV) on 29 May 1957 (later renamed as Asia Television (ATV)). RTV started off as a cable subscription service but became a free-to-air broadcaster in 1973, with Cantonese and English channels. In April 2016 the Executive Council decided not to renew ATV's broadcast licence and its channels closed. \n\nTelevision Broadcasts Limited (TVB) was the territory's first free-to-air commercial station (launching in 1967) and remains the predominant TV broadcaster today with multiple Cantonese channels and one English channel, on analogue and digital. \n\nA short-lived network, known as Commercial Television, opened in 1975 and operated for about three years until its bankruptcy (see 1970s in Hong Kong). \n\nGovernment owned Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) (a radio broadcaster from 1949) starting making TV programmes in 1976 - to be aired on TVB and ATV and later on Cable TV and Now TV. In 2016, RTHK took over the analogue frequency of ATV and now also has its own digital channels\n\nHKTVE, commonly known as ViuTV started broadcasting in 2016, on digital only, with a Cantonese channel and an English channel.\n\nIn May 2017, Fantastic Television started free-to-air broadcasting, on digital only, initially with a Cantonese channel.\n\nThere is also an Internet television and VOD channel called Hong Kong Television Network (HKTV, owned by City Telecom) which was launched in 2014 and can be viewed on smart TVs, set-top boxes, personal computers, smartphones and tablet computers.\n\n\n\nHong Kong's soap drama, comedy series and variety show productions reach mass audiences throughout the Cantonese-speaking, and even Mandarin-speaking, world. \n\nTelevision in Hong Kong is not subject to China's regulatory or 'content' control and is under the purview of the Communications Authority in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong was not required to follow China's DTT standard, but the Hong Kong government nevertheless opted to use DMB-T/H (now known as DTMB) as the digital terrestrial television broadcast standard in 2004 (hence rejecting the DVB-T standard originally proposed in 1998 and trialled in 2000). The official start of DTT broadcasting was at 7pm on 31 December 2007 as the first digital TV signal transmitter in Tsz Wan Shan went online.\n\nIn October 2007, both broadcasting companies agreed to use the MPEG2 video standard for broadcasting free-to-air channels (TVB Jade, ATV Home, TVB Pearl and ATV World); the H.264 video codec was implemented for all DTT-only channels.\n\nFor the audio codec, usual DTMB set-top boxes would support MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) for stereo audio tracks, and Dolby AC-3 for 5.1 surround sound audio tracks. The official specification defines standard-definition broadcasting as 576i at 50 fields per second and high-definition broadcasting in 720p at 50Hz or 1080i at 50Hz.\n\nAll major transmitters were completed by 2008, covering at least 75 percent of the Hong Kong population. The current coverage reaches 99% of the population. Digital switchover is expected to take place in 2020, postponed from the originally planned date in 2015.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2912851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2912851", "title": "The Beautiful Country", "text": "The Beautiful Country\n\nThe Beautiful Country is a 2004 Norwegian-American Vietnam-related drama film set in 1990. It is directed by Hans Petter Moland and starring Damien Nguyen, Nick Nolte, Bai Ling, Chau Thi Kim Xuan, Tim Roth, Anh Thu, Temuera Morrison and John Hussey. The screenplay was written by Sabina Murray, a writer who teaches at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's MFA Program for Poets & Writers.\n\nThe film tells the story of Binh, a Vietnamese boy who is often referred to as a \"bui doi\" (a derogatory term which has come to refer to a Vietnamese-born child fathered by an American soldier during the Vietnam War). After a life of prejudice and servitude, Binh decides to leave his tiny Vietnamese village and search for his mother in Saigon. Binh finds his mother, Mai, and discovers he has a younger brother, energetic and precocious Tam. Mai is employed by Mrs. Hoa, the cruel mistress of a great house. After getting a job at the house with his mother, Binh discovers that she is sexually harassed constantly by Mrs. Hoa's son.\n\nWhile dusting with his mother, Binh lifts a red glass statue of Buddha, a precious family heirloom, to allow his mother to dust. As Binh lifts the statue to see it glow in the sun, the mistress walks in and charges Binh, calling him a thief. As Binh tries to keep the Buddha safe in his arms, the mistress slips on a wet patch of the floor, falling to her death. Binh and his mother quickly escape the house back to their apartment. They frantically pack the belongings of Binh and Tam. His mother gives them American money, the address of Binh's American father, and passage on a boat.\n\nBinh and Tam both make it onto a boat bound for the United States, but a storm knocks them off course and instead takes them to Malaysia. Stuck in a refugee camp, Binh and Tam adapt to their new circumstances and meet Ling, a Chinese prostitute whose passage to America was also detoured to Malaysia. Binh and Ling seem to develop feelings for each other, kissing after Ling sings a ballad in Mandarin and dances for him.\n\nLing had been selling sexual favors for some time (though she dreams of a life as a singer) and had managed to buy herself, Binh, and Tam's way out of the refugee complex and onto a barge captained by the British Captain Oh. During the voyage Binh, Ling, and Tam suffer shortages of food and fresh water. A gambling game (two contenders shout off American brand names in succession) threatens the other passengers by unfairly winning their food, water, and money. Several people succumb to the conditions, as does little Tam. A heartbroken Binh and Ling give him a funeral at sea.\n\nThe immigrants finally reach the United States, but are quickly rushed into transport trucks, bound for Chinatown in New York City. Binh works at a Chinese restaurant as a delivery boy and Ling works in a Chinatown cabaret, though she still keeps prostitution as her main source of income. Ling eventually meets a wealthy businessman to support her. Binh's feelings for Ling go unanswered. Binh sends a letter explaining Tam's death to his mother, along with all the money he had saved thus far.\n\nBinh finds out (over a poker game with his friends) that Vietnamese children born to American fathers are allowed free airplane passage to the United States and granted citizenship. Angry because he didn't have to lose his brother, he promptly leaves his job and hitch hikes toward Houston, Texas, meeting amputee Vietnam War veterans and a Hispanic family along the way. Upon reaching the address Binh finds a woman, his father's ex-wife. His father had relocated after their divorce, working as a handyman at a ranch in Sweetwater, Texas. Binh is finally confronted with his father, blinded after opening a crate filled with explosives he thought was beer during the war. While Binh doesn't confess that he's his son, his father realizes it and the film ends with Binh and his father joking and laughing as he cuts his father's hair.\n\n\nThe Beautiful Country grossed $878,325 around the world from a budget of approximately $6 million.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \" The plight of Asian refugees is sensitively rendered, and the movie builds, with the help of Nolte, to a wrenchingly poignant conclusion\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3326435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3326435", "title": "The Hours (film)", "text": "The Hours (film)\n\nThe Hours is a 2002 British-American drama film directed by Stephen Daldry and starring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore. Supporting roles are played by Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, Stephen Dillane, Jeff Daniels, Miranda Richardson, Allison Janney, Toni Collette, Claire Danes, and Eileen Atkins. The screenplay by David Hare is based on Michael Cunningham's 1998 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title.\n\nThe plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel \"Mrs Dalloway\" by Virginia Woolf. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her AIDS-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife with a young boy and an unhappy marriage; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.\n\nThe film was released in Los Angeles and New York City on Christmas Day 2002, and was given a limited release in the United States and Canada two days later on December 27, 2002. It did not receive a wide release in North America until January 2003, and was then released in British cinemas on Valentine's Day that year. Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, with nine Academy Award nominations for \"The Hours\" including Best Picture, and a win for Nicole Kidman for Best Actress.\n\nWith the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 suicide by drowning of Virginia Woolf in the River Ouse, the action takes place within the span of a single day in three different decades and alternates between them throughout the film. In 1923, Virginia has begun writing the book \"Mrs Dalloway\" in her home in the town of Richmond outside London. In 1951, troubled Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown escapes from her conventional life by reading \"Mrs Dalloway\". In 2001, New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character, as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with AIDS who is to receive a major literary award. Richard tells Clarissa that he has stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tells him that she believes that he would have won the award regardless of his illness. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \"Mrs. Dalloway\" – her namesake – because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does.\n\nEach story in chronological order, not the order as presented in the movie:\n\n1923 -- Virginia, who has experienced several nervous breakdowns and suffers from bipolar disorder, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, Leonard, who has begun a publishing business, Hogarth Press, at home to stay close to her. Virginia both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister Vanessa and her children. Virginia passionately kisses her sister on the lips. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London, when Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.\n\n1951 -- Pregnant with her second child, Laura spends her days in her tract home with her young son, Richie. She married her husband, Dan, soon after World War II. On the surface they are living the American Dream, but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty laughs it off as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and \"Mrs. Dalloway\" from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday.\n\n2001 -- Clarissa appears equally worried about Richard's depression and the party she is planning for him. Clarissa, who is bisexual and has been living with Sally Lester for 10 years, had been in a relationship with Richard during their college days. She meets with Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare. Richard has taken a combination of Xanax and Ritalin and tells Clarissa that she is the most beautiful thing that he ever had in life, before he commits suicide in front of her. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura (the same character from the middle story), arrives at Clarissa's apartment. It is clear that Laura's abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She has led an independent, happier life as a librarian in Canada. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family (Dan and their daughter are also both dead) and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: \"It [her life] was death. I chose life.\" When Julia visits Laura in her bedroom, she treats her with kindness and sensitivity that Laura does not expect to receive.\n\nThe film ends with a voice-over in which Virginia thanks Leonard for loving her: \"Always the years between us. Always the years. Always the love. Always the hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"The Hours\" has an 80% \"fresh\" rating on the film review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes based on 192 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus says that \"the movie may be a downer, but it packs an emotional wallop. Some fine acting on display here.\" On Metacritic, the film holds an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 40 reviews. The four main cast members were praised, especially Nicole Kidman who won numerous awards for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf including the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nRichard Schickel of \"Time\" criticized the film's simplistic characterization, saying, \"Watching \"The Hours\", one finds oneself focusing excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman affects in order to look more like the novelist. And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer.\" He also criticized its overt politicization: \"But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score — tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.\"\n\nStephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"deeply moving\" and \"an amazingly faithful screen adaptation\" and added, \"Although suicide eventually tempts three of the film's characters, \"The Hours\" is not an unduly morbid film. Clear eyed and austerely balanced would be a more accurate description, along with magnificently written and acted. Mr. Glass's surging minimalist score, with its air of cosmic abstraction, serves as ideal connective tissue for a film that breaks down temporal barriers.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" observed, \"Director Stephen Daldry employs the wonderful things cinema can do in order to realize aspects of \"The Hours\" that Cunningham could only hint at or approximate on the page. The result is something rare, especially considering how fine the novel is, a film that's fuller and deeper than the book ... It's marvelous to watch the ways in which [David Hare] consistently dramatizes the original material without compromising its integrity or distorting its intent ... Cunningham's [novel] touched on notes of longing, middle-aged angst and the sense of being a small consciousness in the midst of a grand mystery. But Daldry and Hare's [film] sounds those notes and sends audiences out reverberating with them, exalted.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" awarded the film, which he thought \"sometimes stumbles on literary pretensions,\" three out of four stars. He praised the performances, commenting, \"Kidman's acting is superlative, full of passion and feeling ... Moore is wrenching in her scenes with Laura's son (Jack Rovello, an exceptional child actor). And Streep is a miracle worker, building a character in the space between words and worlds. These three unimprovable actresses make \"The Hours\" a thing of beauty.\"\n\nPhilip French of \"The Observer\" called it \"a moving, somewhat depressing film that demands and rewards attention.\" He thought \"the performances are remarkable\" but found the Philip Glass score to be \"relentless\" and \"over-amplified.\" Steve Persall of the \"St. Petersburg Times\" said it \"is the most finely crafted film of the past year that I never want to sit through again. The performances are flawless, the screenplay is intelligently crafted, and the overall mood is relentlessly bleak. It is a film to be admired, not embraced, and certainly not to be enjoyed for any reason other than its expertise.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" rated the film three out of five stars and commented, \"It is a daring act of extrapolation, and a real departure from most movie-making, which can handle only one universe at a time . . . The performances that Daldry elicits . . . are all strong: tightly managed, smoothly and dashingly juxtaposed under a plangent score . . . Part of the bracing experimental impact of the film was the absence of narrative connection between the three women. Supplying one in the final reel undermines its formal daring, but certainly packs an emotional punch. It makes for an elegant and poignant chamber music of the soul.\"\n\n\"The Hours\" opened in New York City and Los Angeles on Christmas Day 2002 and went into limited release in the United States and Canada two days later.
