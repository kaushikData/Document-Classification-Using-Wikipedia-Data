{"id": "32182335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32182335", "title": "Asiatic style", "text": "Asiatic style\n\nThe Asiatic style or Asianism (, Cicero, \"Brutus\" 325) refers to an Ancient Greek rhetorical tendency (though not an organized school) that arose in the third century BC, which, although of minimal relevance at the time, briefly became an important point of reference in later debates about Roman oratory.\n\nHegesias of Magnesia was Asianism's first main representative and was considered its founder. Hegesias \"developed and exaggerated stylistic effects harking back to the sophists and the Gorgianic style.\"\n\nUnlike the more austere, formal and traditional Attic style, Asiatic oratory was more bombastic, emotional, and coloured with wordplay.\n\nThe Asiatic style was distinguished by the use of a prose rhythm, especially the end of clauses (\"clausulae\"). This worked in much the same way as in Latin poetry, although poetic metres themselves were avoided. An effective rhythm could bring an audience to applaud the rhythm alone, however Cicero criticised Asiatic orators for their overly repetitive endings.\n\nThe first known use of the term is in Rome, by Cicero in the mid-first century BC. It came into general and pejorative use for a florid style contrasting with the formal, traditional rhetoric of Atticism, which it was said to have corrupted. The term reflects an association with writers in the Greek cities of Asia Minor. \"Asianism had a significant impact on Roman rhetoric, since many of the Greek teachers of rhetoric who came to Rome beginning with the 2d cent. B.C.E. were Asiatic Greeks.\" \"Mildly Asianic tendencies\" have been found in Gaius Gracchus' oratory, and \"more marked\" ones in Publius Sulpicius Rufus. However we have almost no remnants of oratory that can properly be called Asiatic.\n\nCicero (\"Orator ad Brutum\" 325) identifies two distinct modes of the Asiatic style: a more studied and symmetrical style (generally taken to mean \"full of Gorgianic figures\") employed by the historian Timaeus and the orators Menecles and Hierocles of Alabanda, and the rapid flow and ornate diction of Aeschines of Miletus and Aeschylus of Cnidus. Hegesias' \"jerky, short clauses\" may be placed in the first class, and Antiochus I of Commagene's Mount Nemrut inscription in the second. The conflation of the two styles under a single name has been taken to reflect the essentially polemical significance of the term: \"The key similarity is that they are both extreme and therefore bad; otherwise they could not be more different.\" According to Cicero, Quintus Hortensius combined these traditions and made them at home in Latin oratory.\n\nCicero himself, rejecting the extreme plainness and purism of the Atticists, was attacked by critics such as Licinius Macer Calvus for being on the side of the \"Asiani\"; in response he declared his position as the \"Roman Demosthenes\" (noting that the preeminent Attic orator would not have qualified as Attic by the strict standards of the \"oratores Attici\" of first-century Rome). In this sense, although Cicero identified with an Attic orator, he never went so far as to completely criticise Asiatic oratory, and professed a mixed or middle style (\"genus medium\"; Quintilian 12.10.18: \"genus Rhodium...velut medium...atque ex utroque mixtum\") between the low or plain Attic style and the high Asiatic style, called the Rhodian style by association with Molo of Rhodes and Apollonius the Effeminate (\"Rhodii\", Cicero, \"Brutus\" xiii 51).\n\nIn the Neronian period, the surviving portion of Petronius' \"Satyricon\" begins midway through a rant in which the unreliable narrator, Encolpius, denounces the corruption of Roman literary taste and the Asiatic style in particular: \"that flatulent, inflated magniloquence later imported from Asia to Athens has infected every aspiring writer like a pestilential breeze\" (trans. Branham and Kinney). Quintilian accepted Cicero's attitude towards Asianism and Atticism, and adapted the earlier debate's polemical language, in which objectionable style is called effeminate, in his own \"De causis corruptae eloquentiae\". \n\nIn his \"Institutio Oratoria\" (XII.10), Quintilian diagnoses the roots of the two styles in terms of ethnic dispositions: \"The Attici, refined and discriminating, tolerated nothing empty or gushing; but the Asiatic race somehow more swollen and boastful was inflated with a more vainglory of speaking\" (trans. Amy Richlin). Pliny the Younger continued to profess the mixed style. The debate remained topical for Tacitus (as seen in Pliny's correspondence with him on oratorical styles in Letter 1.20) and contributes to the atmosphere of his \"Dialogus de oratoribus\".\n\nUltimately, there seems to have been a general preponderance or victory of the Asiatic over the Attic style in the imperial period.\n\n"}

{"id": "250420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250420", "title": "Bielefeld Conspiracy", "text": "Bielefeld Conspiracy\n\nThe Bielefeld Conspiracy (German: \"Bielefeldverschwörung\" or \"Bielefeld-Verschwörung\", ) is a satire of conspiracy theories that originated in 1993 in the German Usenet, which claims that the city of Bielefeld, Germany, does not exist, but is an illusion propagated by various forces. Originally an internet phenomenon, the conspiracy has since been mentioned in the city's marketing, and referenced by Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nThe story goes that the city of Bielefeld (population of 336,352 ) in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia does not actually exist. Rather, its existence is merely propagated by an entity known only as \"SIE\" (\"they\" in German, always in block capitals), which has conspired with the authorities to create the illusion of the city's existence.\n\nThe theory poses three questions:\nA majority are expected to answer \"no\" to all three queries. Anybody claiming knowledge about Bielefeld is promptly disregarded as being in on the conspiracy or having been themselves deceived.\n\nThe origins of and reasons for this conspiracy are not a part of the original theory. Speculated originators jokingly include the CIA, Mossad, or aliens who use Bielefeld University as a disguise for their spaceship.\n\nThe conspiracy theory was first made public in a posting to the newsgroup codice_1 on May 16, 1993, by Achim Held, a computer science student at the University of Kiel. When a friend of Achim Held met someone from Bielefeld at a student party in 1993, he said \"\", a phrase comparable to \"I don't believe it\", signifying disbelief or surprise. However, its literal translation is \"That doesn't exist.\"; thus he (accidentally) implied that he refuses to believe that someone came from Bielefeld. From there, it spread throughout the German-speaking Internet community, and has lost little of its popularity, even after 25 years.\n\nIn a television interview conducted for the tenth anniversary of the newsgroup posting, Held stated that this myth definitely originated from his Usenet posting which was intended only as a joke. According to Held, the idea for the conspiracy theory formed in his mind at a student party while speaking to an avid reader of New Age magazines, and from a car journey past Bielefeld at a time when the exit from the \"Autobahn\" to it was closed.\n\nThere are a number of conflicting theories about the reasons behind the joke's gain in popularity, the most popular being a flame war between Usenet admins and the Bielefeld-based Z-Netz BBS about text encodings.\n\nHistorian Alan Lessoff notes that a reason for the amusement value of the theory is Bielefeld's lack of notable features, as being home to no major institutions or tourist attractions and not being on the course of a major river, \"Bielefeld defines nondescript\".\n\nThe Bielefeld Conspiracy remains one of the most popular internet jokes originating in Germany.\n\nIn November 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel referred to the Bielefeld Conspiracy in public when talking about a town hall meeting she had attended in Bielefeld, adding: \"… if it exists at all.\" and \"I had the impression that I was there.\"\n\nThe city council of Bielefeld tries hard to generate publicity for Bielefeld and build a nationally known public image of the city. However, even 19 years (or more) after the conspiracy started, the mayor's office still received phone calls and e-mails which claimed to doubt the existence of the city.\n\nIn 1999, five years after the myth started to spread, the city council released a press statement titled \"!\" (Bielefeld \"does\" exist!) on April Fools' Day. In allusion to the origin of the conspiracy the 800th anniversary of Bielefeld was held under the motto \"\" (That can not be real).\n\nIn 2009, film students at Bielefeld University started a project to develop a feature film based on the Bielefeld Conspiracy. The project was financed by the university and local sponsors. Most of the project's staff and actors were students or university employees; a few professionals, such as the actress Julia Kahl and the cameraman Alexander Böke, also joined the project. The screenplay was written by Thomas Walden. The film premiered in Bielefeld on 2 June 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "2461964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2461964", "title": "Casino Royale (novel)", "text": "Casino Royale (novel)\n\nCasino Royale is the first novel by the British author Ian Fleming. Published in 1953, it is the first \"James Bond\" book, and it paved the way for a further eleven novels and two short story collections by Fleming, followed by numerous continuation Bond novels by other authors.\n\nThe story concerns the British secret agent James Bond, gambling at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre, the treasurer of a French union and a member of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and René Mathis of the French Deuxième Bureau. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond also reflected many of Fleming's personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was assured by his friend, the novelist William Plomer, that the novel had promise.\n\nWithin the spy storyline, \"Casino Royale\" deals with themes of Britain's position in the world, particularly the relationship with the US in light of the defections to the Soviet Union of the British traitors Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. The book was given broadly positive reviews by critics at the time and sold out in less than a month after its UK release on 13 April 1953, although US sales upon release a year later were much slower.\n\nSince publication \"Casino Royale\" has appeared as a comic strip in a British national newspaper, \"The Daily Express\". It has been also adapted for the screen three times: a 1954 episode of the CBS television series \"Climax!\" with Barry Nelson as an American Bond, a 1967 film version with David Niven playing \"Sir James Bond\", and a 2006 film in the Eon Productions film series starring Daniel Craig as James Bond.\n\nM, the Head of the British Secret Service, assigns James Bond, 007, to play against and bankrupt Le Chiffre, the paymaster for a SMERSH-controlled trade union, in a high-stakes baccarat game at the Royale-les-Eaux casino in northern France. As part of Bond's cover as a rich Jamaican playboy, M also assigns as his companion Vesper Lynd, personal assistant to the Head of Section S (Soviet Union). The CIA and the French Deuxième Bureau also send agents as observers. The game soon turns into an intense confrontation between Le Chiffre and Bond; Le Chiffre wins the first round, cleaning Bond out of his funds. As Bond contemplates the prospect of reporting his failure to M, the CIA agent, Felix Leiter, gives him an envelope of money and a note: \"Marshall Aid. Thirty-two million francs. With the compliments of the USA.\" The game continues, despite the attempts of one of Le Chiffre's minders to kill Bond. Bond eventually wins, taking from Le Chiffre eighty million francs belonging to SMERSH.\n\nDesperate to recover the money, Le Chiffre kidnaps Lynd and tortures Bond, threatening to kill them both if he does not get the money back. During the torture, a SMERSH assassin enters and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for losing the money. The agent does not kill Bond, saying that he has no orders to do so, but cuts a Cyrillic 'Ш' (sh) to signify the SHpion (Russian for spy) into Bond's hand so that future SMERSH agents will be able to identify him as such.\n\nLynd visits Bond every day as he recuperates in hospital, and he gradually realises that he loves her; he even contemplates leaving the Secret Service to settle down with her. When he is released from hospital they spend time together at a quiet guest house and eventually become lovers. One day they see a mysterious man named Gettler tracking their movements, which greatly distresses Lynd. The following morning, Bond finds that she has committed suicide. She leaves behind a note explaining that she had been working as an unwilling double agent for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. SMERSH had kidnapped her lover, a Polish Royal Air Force pilot, who had revealed information about her under torture; SMERSH then used that information to blackmail her into helping them undermine Bond's mission, including her own faked kidnapping. She had tried to start a new life with Bond, but upon seeing Gettler—a SMERSH agent—she realised that she would never be free of her tormentors, and that staying with Bond would only put him in danger. Bond informs his service of Lynd's duplicity, coldly telling his contact, \"The bitch is dead now.\"\n\nIan Fleming, born in 1908, was a son of Valentine Fleming, a wealthy banker and MP who died in action on the Western Front in May 1917. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst and, briefly, the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through several jobs before he was recruited by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, to become his personal assistant. Fleming joined the organisation full-time in August 1939, with the codename \"17F\", and worked for them throughout the war. Early in 1939 he began an affair with Ann O'Neill ( Charteris), who was married to the 3rd Baron O'Neill.\n\nIn 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo-American intelligence summit in Jamaica and, despite the constant heavy rain during his visit, he decided to live on the island once the war was over. His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in Saint Mary Parish where, in 1945, Fleming had a house built, which he named Goldeneye. The name of the house and estate has many possible sources. Fleming mentioned both his wartime Operation Goldeneye and Carson McCullers' 1941 novel \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\", which described the use of British naval bases in the Caribbean by the US Navy.\n\nUpon Fleming's demobilisation in May 1945, he became the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, which at the time owned \"The Sunday Times\". In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take two months holiday every winter in Jamaica. In 1948 Charteris gave birth to Fleming's daughter, Mary, who was stillborn; Charteris and Fleming became engaged shortly in 1951.\n\nFleming had previously mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel, but it was not until early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write \"Casino Royale\" at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for \"Books and Bookmen\" magazine in which he said: \"I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\"\n\nBack in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he described as his \"dreadful oafish opus\"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at \"The Times\" on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, or at least to do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked \"I really am thoroughly ashamed of it ... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again, but I have got to take that chance.\" Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed.\n\nAlthough Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom have written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—put the events of \"Casino Royale\" in 1951; Griswold allows a possible second timeframe and considers the story could have taken place in either May to July 1951, or May to July 1952.\n\n\"Casino Royale\" was inspired by certain incidents that took place during Fleming's wartime career at the Naval Intelligence Division (NID), or by events of which he was aware. On a trip to Portugal, en route to the United States, Fleming and the NID Director, Admiral Godfrey, went to the Estoril Casino. Because of Portugal's neutral status, Estoril's population had been swelled by spies and agents from the warring regimes. Fleming claimed that while there he was cleaned out by a \"chief German agent\" at a table playing chemin de fer. Admiral Godfrey told a different story: that Fleming only played Portuguese businessmen, and afterwards fantasised about playing against German agents.\n\nThe failed attempt to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was inspired by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, \"\", in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.\n\nFleming also included four references in the novel to \"Red Indians\", including twice on the last page, which came from a unit of commandos, known as No. 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops. The unit was Fleming's idea, and he nicknamed the troops his \"Red Indians\", although they disliked the name.\n\nThe lead character of \"Casino Royale\" is James Bond, an agent of the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond, author of the ornithology guide, \"Birds of the West Indies\". Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife \"that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that \"When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\"\n\nFleming decided that Bond should resemble both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself, and in the novel Lynd remarks that \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" According to Andrew Lycett, Fleming's biographer, \"within the first few pages ... [Fleming] had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks\", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it \"The Vesper\", after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep champagne goblet, was for \"three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel.\"\n\nSpeaking of Bond's origins, Fleming said that \"he was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\", although the author gave many of his own traits to the character. Bond's tastes are often taken from Fleming's own, as is some of his behaviour: Fleming used the casino to introduce Bond in his first novel because \"skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen ... as attributes of a gentleman\". Lycett sees much of Bond's character as being \"wish fulfilment\" by Fleming.\n\nBond's superior, M, was largely based on Godfrey, Fleming's NID superior officer; Godfrey was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. One of the likely models for Le Chiffre was the influential English occultist, astrologer, mystic and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, on whose physical features Fleming based Le Chiffre's. Crowley's tastes, especially in sado-masochism, were also ascribed to Le Chiffre; as Fleming's biographer Henry Chancellor notes, \"when Le Chiffre goes to work on Bond's testicles with a carpet-beater and a carving knife, the sinister figure of Aleister Crowley is there lurking in the background.\"\n\nFleming later said of his work, \"while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature. He used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which the author Kingsley Amis called \"the Fleming effect\". Amis describes it as \"the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced.\" Within the text the novelist Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—identifies what he described as the \"Fleming Sweep\", the use of \"hooks\" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what the novelist Anthony Burgess calls \"a heightened journalistic style\" to produce \"a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery\".\n\nThe semiotician and essayist, Umberto Eco, in his 1979 examination of the Bond books, \"The Narrative Structure of Ian Fleming\", considered that Fleming \"has a rhythm, a polish, a certain sensuous feeling for words. That is not to say that Fleming is an artist; yet he writes with art.\" When examining the passage relating to the death of Le Chiffre, Eco wrote that \"there is a ... baroque feeling for the image, a total adaptation off the image without emotional comment, and a use of words that designate things with accuracy\", and he went on to conclude that \"Fleming is more literate than he gives one to understand.\"\n\n\"Casino Royale\" was written after, and was heavily influenced by, the Second World War; Britain was still an imperial power, and the Western and Eastern blocs were engaged in the Cold War. The journalist William Cook observes that with the decline in power of the British Empire, \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\" The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett agree, and consider that \"Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining.\"\n\nIn 1953 parts of central London, including Oxford Street and High Holborn still had uncleared bomb sites and, while sweets had ceased being rationed, coal and other food items were still regulated. According to \"The Times\" journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, Bond was \"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\".\n\n\"Casino Royale\" deals with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the real-world central role of the US in the defence of the West. The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship.\n\nAmis, in his exploration of Bond in \"The James Bond Dossier\", pointed out that Leiter is \"such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he\". The journalist and author Christopher Hitchens observed that \"the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans\". David Seed, in his examination of spy fiction, disagrees, and writes that while Bond beats Le Chiffre, his \"activities are constantly supported by American agencies, financing and know-how\".\n\nThe treachery of Le Chiffre, with the overtones of a fifth column, struck a chord with the largely British readership as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament at the time. Britain had also suffered from defections to the Soviet Union from two MI6 operatives who were part of the Cambridge Five spy ring that betrayed Western secrets to the Soviets. Thus Lycett observes that \"Casino Royale\" can be seen as Fleming's \"attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post-war world that could produce traitors like Burgess and Maclean\". The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that with the defections of the two spies so recent to the publication, it was \"perhaps the closest Fleming came to a [John] le Carré-style spy story\". Chancellor sees the moral ambiguity of the Cold War reflected in the novel.\n\nBenson considers the most obvious theme of the novel to be good versus evil. Parker agrees, and highlights a conversation between Bond and Matthis in the chapter titled \"The Nature of Evil\", in which Bond says: \"By ... [Le Chiffre's] evil existence ... he was creating a norm of badness by which, and by which alone, an opposite norm of goodness could exist.\" The subject was also dealt with by the academic Beth Butterfield, in an examination of Bond from an existentialist viewpoint. In light of Bond's conversation, Butterfield identifies a crisis of confidence in Bond's character, where he has \"moved beyond good and evil\" to the point where he does his job not because of principles, but to pursue personal battles. Eco comes to the same conclusion, stating that Bond \"abandon[s] the treacherous life of moral mediation and of psychological anger, with all the dangers they entail.\"\n\nBlack also identifies a mechanism Fleming uses in \"Casino Royale\"—and in subsequent \"Bond\" novels—which is to use the evil of his opponents both as a justification of his actions, and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths.\n\n\"Casino Royale\" was first released on 13 April 1953 in the UK as a hardback edition by publishers Jonathan Cape, with a cover devised by Fleming. Cape printed 4,728 copies of \"Casino Royale\", which sold out in less than a month; a second print run the same month also sold out, as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954. The sales figures were strong enough for Cape to offer Fleming a three-book deal. In April 1955 Pan Books issued a paperback version and sold 41,000 copies in the first year.\n\nIn the US three publishers turned the book down before Macmillan Publishing Co offered Fleming a deal. \"Casino Royale\" was published on 23 March 1954 in the US, but sales were poor, totalling only 4,000 copies across the entire US during the course of the year. When the novel was released as a US paperback in 1955, it was re-titled by publisher American Popular Library; Fleming's suggestions for a new title, \"The Double-O Agent\" and \"The Deadly Gamble\", were disregarded in favour of \"You Asked for It\", but this marketing ploy failed to raise the interest. The Popular Library version also changed Bond's name, calling him \"Jimmy Bond\".\n\nHugh I'Anson Fausset, writing in \"The Manchester Guardian\", thought that \"Casino Royale\" was \"a first-rate thriller ... with a breathtaking plot\". Although he considered the book to be \"schoolboy stuff\", he felt the novel was \"galvanised into life by the hard brilliance of the telling\". Alan Ross, writing in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" wrote that \"Casino Royale\" was \"an extremely engaging affair\", and that \"the especial charm ... is the high poetry with which he invests the green baize lagoons of the casino tables\". He concluded that the book was \"both exciting and extremely civilized\". Reviewing for \"The Listener\", Simon Raven believed that Fleming was a \"kind of supersonic John Buchan\", but he was somewhat dismissive of the plot, observing that it is \"a brilliant but improbable notion\" that includes \"a deal of champagne-drinking, bomb-throwing, relentless pitting of wits etc ... with a cretinous love-affair\". Raven also dismissed Bond as an \"infantile\" creation, but did allow that \"Fleming tells a good story with strength and distinction ... his creation of a scene, both visually and emotionally, is of a very high order indeed.\"\n\nJohn Betjeman, writing in \"The Daily Telegraph\", considered that \"Ian Fleming has discovered the secret of the narrative art ... which is to work up to a climax unrevealed at the end of each chapter. Thus the reader has to go on reading\". Publishers Jonathan Cape included many of the reviews on their advertisements for the book, which appeared in a number of national newspapers; the reviews included those from \"The Sunday Times\", which concluded that Fleming was \"the best new English thriller-writer since [Eric] Ambler\" and \"The Observer\", which advised their readers: \"don't miss this\".\n\nThe critic for \"Time\" magazine examined Raymond Chandler's \"The Long Goodbye\" alongside \"Casino Royale\"; he praised \"Casino Royale\", saying that \"Fleming keeps his incidents and characters spinning through their paces like juggling balls.\" The \"Time\" reviewer went on to say that \"As for Bond, he might be [Philip] Marlowe's younger brother except that he never takes coffee for a bracer, just one large Martini laced with vodka.\"\n\nWriting for \"The New York Times\", Anthony Boucher wrote that the book belongs \"pretty much to the private-eye school\" of fiction. He praised the first part, saying that Fleming \"manages to make baccarat clear even to one who's never played it and produced as exciting a gambling sequence as I've ever read. But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader through a set of tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You should certainly begin this book; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over.\"\n\nIn 1954 CBS paid Ian Fleming $1,000 to adapt \"Casino Royale\" into a one-hour television adventure as part of its \"Climax!\" series. The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as secret agent \"Card Sense\" James 'Jimmy' Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. A brief tutorial on baccarat is given at the beginning of the show by the presenter of the programme, William Lundigan, to enable viewers to understand a game which was not popular in America at the time. For this Americanised version of the story, Bond is an American agent, described as working for \"Combined Intelligence\", while the character Leiter from the original novel is British, renamed \"Clarence Leiter\". The agent for Station S., Mathis, does not appear as such; his surname is given to the leading lady, named Valérie Mathis instead of Vesper Lynd.\n\nIn March 1955 Ian Fleming sold the film rights of \"Casino Royale\" to the producer Gregory Ratoff for $6,000. After Ratoff's death, producer Charles K. Feldman represented Ratoff's widow and obtained the rights to make a film version. Feldman decided the best way to profit from the film rights was to make a satirical version, which was produced and released in 1967 by Columbia Pictures. The film, which cast David Niven as Bond, was made with five credited directors (plus one uncredited) and a cast that included Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Welles and Woody Allen. The 1967 version is described by the British Film Institute as \"an incoherent all-star comedy\".\n\n\"Casino Royale\" was the first James Bond novel to be adapted as a daily comic strip; it was published in \"The Daily Express\" and syndicated worldwide. The strip ran from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958, and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky. To aid \"The Daily Express\" in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. McLusky felt that Fleming's 007 looked too \"outdated\" and \"pre-war\" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look. A graphic novel adaptation of the book was released by Dynamite Entertainment in April 2018, written by Van Jensen and illustrated by Dennis Calero.\n\nFollowing the 1967 adaptation, the rights to the film remained with Columbia Films until 1989 when the studio, and the rights to their intellectual property portfolio was acquired by the Japanese company Sony. In 1999, following legal action between Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM/UA, Sony traded the rights to \"Casino Royale\" for MGM's partial-rights to \"Spider-Man\". This led to Eon Productions making the 2006 film \"Casino Royale\". The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond, supported by Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre; Judi Dench returned for her fifth Bond film as Bond's superior, M. \"Casino Royale\" is a reboot, showing Bond at the beginning of his career as a 00-agent and overall stays true to the original novel.\n\n\n"}

This sequel, directed by David Price (son of studio chief Frank Price), stars Terence Knox, Ryan Bollman, Ned Romero, and Paul Scherrer. The film was released in 1992 in Germany and in theatres by Dimension Films in January 1993. The video release was handled by Paramount Pictures. The film is the last film in the series to be released theatrically, as other sequels went on direct to video.\n\nThe plot involves the dark goings on in Hemingford, Nebraska, a town near Gatlin (the original film's setting). The people of Hemingford decide to adopt the surviving children from Gatlin, intending to help them start new lives. Unfortunately for the well-meaning locals, the children return to the cornfield where one of the cult members, Micah, is possessed by He Who Walks Behind the Rows, the demonic entity the cult worships.\n\nCaught in the middle are city reporter John Garrett and his son Danny, who are having a bitter falling out over John's failed relationship with Danny's mother. John is in town working on a story about the children to save his career, presently in a downward spiral. He runs into two of his former coworkers, Bobby Knite and fellow reporter Wayde McKenzie, who are on their way out of town before being killed in a nearby cornfield after taking a shortcut in their van by a mysterious, powerful storm which lasts only minutes and causes the surprisingly sharp cornstalks to wreak havoc. Back in town, John meets bed and breakfast owner Angela Casual and they soon become lovers. Danny, looking to distance himself from his father, befriends orphaned local girl, Lacey, who tells him a few disturbing details about Gatlin.\n\nMicah and the other children murder a local woman, Ruby Burke, by sabotaging the hydraulic jacks supporting her house while she is underneath it, causing it to descend and crush her. Micah then kills another person in the town, David Simpson, during church services with a knife and a wooden voodoo doll, which causes him to bleed to death. John begins to ask the town doctor questions about what is going on, but the doctor acts suspiciously and asks John to leave. The doctor is later stabbed to death in his office by the children. Micah and the children later kill Mrs. Burke's sister, Mrs. West, in the road making it appear that she had been struck by a car.\n\nJohn partners with Frank Red Bear, a professor at a nearby University, to try and make some sense of the recent chaos and death. They discover that certain residents of the town are selling spoiled corn from the previous year's harvest along with the new crop. The spoiled corn has a dark green acidic toxin growing on it which they believe is filling the town's air and contributing to a spate of delusions in the children, rendering them emotionless and violent. The town Sheriff discovers them spying on the site of his (and the dead town doctor's) misdeeds, ties them up, and tries to kill them with a corn harvester, but they escape.\n\nThe Sheriff and the rest of the Hemingford adults attend an emergency town hall meeting to discuss the situation, but the children lock them inside and set the building on fire killing all of them. The children then kidnap Angela and Lacey and bring them out into the cornfield where they are pressuring a confused Danny to join them in sacrificing Lacey. John and Frank arrive driving the harvester. One of the children shoots Frank with an arrow, wounding him. Danny and John free Lacey and Angela and attempt to escape but the cornfield seemingly never ends and they shortly return to where they started. Micah attempts to harness the power of He Who Walks Behind the Rows until Frank restarts the harvester, before finally dying. Micah's robe becomes caught in the machine, as he calls for help. Micah's face transforms, first into the demon that possessed him, then back to himself again. Danny runs in to help him but is too late. Micah is pulled in by the harvester and killed. The rest of the children scatter, and Danny, Angela, Lacey, and John leave the clearing.\n\nJohn and Danny later reconcile as they burn Frank's body and give him a funeral before they, Angela, and Lacey drive off together, presumably returning to the city.\n\nSome unspecified time later, it is revealed that Frank's spirit has become the protector of Hemingford.\n\n\nFilm production began at the end of spring 1991, and shooting began in July 1991 in Liberty, North Carolina. Most of the cast were locals, including the children. The scene involving an elderly woman flying through a store window after her wheelchair becomes controlled by Micah was filmed in downtown Ramseur, North Carolina. The scene where Micah and the children of the corn burn the town elders was filmed in a home at the corner of Asheboro St. and Luther Ave. in Liberty. The home was burned for the film and a vacant lot remains where the house once stood. The production crew used a local parsonage at the corner of Fayetteville and Raleigh Sts. in Liberty as its headquarters during shooting. Brian Yuzna's son Xeno appears as one of the children of the corn.\n\nIn the DVD commentary, director David Price said during the shoot there was a local Christian group who held a few (low-key) protests during filming, and he received a dead rodent on his door step as a warning. As a result, the production constructed their own church for a few scenes in the film. Despite this, no actual incidents occurred.\n\nAlso in the DVD commentary, Price said the ending involving Red Bear painting a stone was added at the last minute. Originally, it involved John Garrett making a phone call to his tabloid at a phone booth by the side of the road near the cornfield, only to have it swallowed into the earth by He Who Walks Behind The Rows, killing him. This was scrapped due to budget constraints.\n\nAccording to the original draft of the script, the film was going to be called \"Children of the Corn II: Deadly Harvest\".\n\n\"Children of the Corn II\" was released in the US on January 29, 1993. It made $2.7 million in its opening weekend and eventually grossed a total of $6,980,986 in the US.\n\nThe Canadian and European home video releases feature a slightly different musical score, and is missing the CGI sequence in the middle of the film. \n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 22% of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 2/10.\n\n"}
{"id": "17216986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17216986", "title": "Cyberformance", "text": "Cyberformance\n\nCyberformance refers to live theatrical performances in which remote participants are enabled to work together in real time through the medium of the internet, employing technologies such as chat applications or purpose-built, multiuser, real-time collaborative software (for example, UpStage, Visitors Studio, the Waterwheel Tap, MOOs, and other platforms). Cyberformance is also known as online performance, networked performance, telematic performance, and digital theatre; there is as yet no consensus on which term should be preferred, but cyberformance has the advantage of compactness. For example, it is commonly employed by users of the UpStage platform to designate a special type of Performance art activity taking place in a cyber-artistic environment.\n\nCyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet-connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers.\n\nThe term 'cyberformance' (a portmanteau word blending 'cyberspace' with 'performance') was coined by the net artist and curator Helen Varley Jamieson. She states that the invention of this term in 2000 \"came out of the need to find a word that avoided the polarisation of virtual and real, and the need for a new term (rather than 'online performance' or 'virtual theatre') for a new genre\". Jamieson traces the history of cyberformance back to the \"Satellite Arts Project\" of 1977, when interactive art pioneers Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz used live video mixing to create what they called \"a performance space with no geographic boundaries\".\n\nOnline performances or virtual theatre has taken place in a number of the virtual environments that have emerged since the 1980s, including the multi-user virtual environments known as MUDs and MOOs in the 1970s, internet chat spaces (e.g. Internet Relay Chat, or IRC) in the 1980s, the Palace graphical chatroom in the 1990s, and UpStage, Visitors Studio, Second Life, Waterwheel Tap and other platforms in the 2000s. Notable cyberformance groups and projects thus far include:\n\n\nCyberformance differs from digital performance, which refers to any kind of digitally mediated performance, including those with no significant networked element. In some cases cyberformance may be considered a subset of net art; however, many cyberformance artists use what is termed 'mixed reality' or 'mixed space' for their work, linking physical, virtual, and cyber spaces in manifold ingenious ways. The internet is often a subject and inspiration of the work as well as being the central enabling technology.\n\nCyberformers often work with the dual identities afforded by avatars, exploiting the gap between online persona and offline self. They can also take advantage of the ease of switching between avatars in a way unavailable to 'proximal' actors. However cyberformance has its own unique problems, including unstable technology and \"real life\" interruptions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4940990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4940990", "title": "DV8 Physical Theatre", "text": "DV8 Physical Theatre\n\nDV8 Physical Theatre (or Dance Visual 8) is a physically integrated dance company based at Artsadmin in London, United Kingdom. It was officially founded in 1986 by Lloyd Newson (1986-2015), Michelle Richecoeur (1986-1988) and Nigel Charnock (1986-1989, 1992). Lloyd Newson has led the company as choreographer and artistic director since its inception, apart from the production \"My Sex, Our Dance\" (1986), which was co-created and performed with Nigel Charnock.\n\nDV8's work is characterised by the desire to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and very pretentiously, often with a focus on socio-political issues. The work challenges the limitations of dance by using any means necessary to find the most appropriate way to say something, thereby incorporating elements of theatre, dance, film, and, increasingly, text. DV8 has toured work in the UK and to 28 countries worldwide, and received 55 national and international awards.\n\nLloyd Newson founded DV8 Physical Theatre in 1986 in response to his frustration with the lack of subject matter in contemporary dance. He felt audiences were being ‘conned about the depth’ of (much) contemporary dance, which he saw as generally superficial; obsessed with 'aesthetics over content'. The first work Newson produced with the new company was made in partnership with Nigel Charnock, and was titled \"My Sex, Our Dance\" (1986); it tackled the emergence of AIDS and investigated the idea of trust, both emotionally and physically, between two gay men. This was followed by \"Deep End\" (1987), in which dancer Liz Ranken joined Newson, Richecoeur and Charnock as a performer, and \"Elemen T(H)ree Sex\" (1987): works which focused on heterosexual relationships. All three works toured the UK, and \"My Sex, Our Dance\" and \"Deep End\" were also performed in New York as part of the Next Wave Festival (held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) in 1988.\n\nThe next work for the company was \"My Body, Your Body\" (1987), which explored the psychology of women who seek out relationships with abusive men. It was based on an audio recording of a close female friend of Newson’s and the book, Women Who Love Too Much by Robin Norwood. The production toured the UK in 1987 and featured Wendy Houstoun, who later played the lead role in \"If Only…\" (1990) and \"Strange Fish\" (1992).\n\nIn 1988, Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men was created for the stage and, two years later, adapted for film – the first of several made by the company. The production drew inspiration from the book, Killing for Company, about serial killer Dennis Nielsen. It garnered numerous awards for DV8, including the Time Out Dance Award and the Evening Standard Ballet Award, both in 1989. In 1990, film-director David Hinton, commissioned by the South Bank Show (ITV), collaborated with Newson to adapt the stage production for television.\n\nAfter Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men, Newson began to develop a more poetic style, involving increasingly complex sets. He stated at the time that he was ‘fatigued by the bruising physicality’ that marked DV8’s work from 1986-1989. The first of these works was \"If Only…\" (1990), which won the Golden Pegasus Award at the Melbourne International Festival (1990). \"Strange Fish\" (1992) followed, featuring Wendy Houstoun alongside Nigel Charnock and singer Melanie Pappenheim. Again, it was a critical success: the stage production won the London Dance & Performance Award (1992) and was adapted for a BBC film the same year, later winning the company’s first Prix Italia.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, DV8 continued to produce work that was critically well received and popular with audiences. The BBC film version of Enter Achilles (1995) won a Prix Italia and an International Emmy Award in 1997, while \"The Happiest Day of My Life\" (1999) won the Time Out Set Design of the Year.\n\nIn 2000, the Sydney Cultural Olympiad commissioned \"Can We Afford This\", later renamed \"The Cost of Living\". It went on to open London’s Dance Umbrella season, and toured to Hong Kong. In 2004, the work was adapted into an award winning film, directed by Newson, and reworked with extra scenes as a site-specific production, \"Living Costs\" (2003), commissioned by and for London’s Tate Modern contemporary art gallery.\n\nIn 2004-5, DV8 created \"Just for Show\", the first of a series of co-productions with the National Theatre (London). This was a significant new relationship in terms of the company’s cross-genre position between increasingly arbitrary categories of “dance” and “theatre”.\n\nThe next production, \"To Be Straight With You\" (2007), marked a move by Newson into verbatim theatre – setting minutely-detailed movement to the real (edited) words of real people. To create the script, 85 people of varying ethnicities and sexuality were interviewed by Newson and his researcher, Anshu Rastogi, about their experiences and views concerning religion, culture and homosexuality.\n\n\"Can We Talk About This?\" (2011–12), a second verbatim production, dealt with freedom of speech, censorship and Islam. It drew on existing interviews as well as those conducted by Newson himself, and involved people associated with the burning of author Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses and associates of film-maker Theo van Gogh, who was murdered by Dutch Islamist, Mohammed Bouyeri. \"Can We Talk About This?\" won a Helpmann Award (Australia, 2012), and was named Tanz Magazine’s Production of the Year (Germany, 2012).\n\nDV8’s most recent work, \"JOHN\" (2014) follows the life-story of a man, the eponymous title character, played by Hannes Langolf. It traces his criminality, drug use, personal relationships, efforts at rehabilitation and desire to lead an ordinary life. Again co-produced with the National Theatre, it was broadcast to cinemas worldwide through the NT Live programme.\n\nOn the 12th January 2016, the company announced that artistic director Lloyd Newson was taking time out to reflect about the future. Due to this the company confirmed that the production of new work was to be paused indefinitely. \n\nDV8’s work is characterised by a desire to take risks, to question people’s attitudes and beliefs, to dissolve barriers that separate art forms, and ultimately to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously. The company frequently addresses pertinent social topics, such as freedom of speech, human rights, multiculturalism, tolerance/intolerance, gender roles, sexual identity and social class, as well as personal issues.\nDV8’s work seeks to use the most appropriate means available to serve its mission. Thus, its productions have incorporated elements of dance, naturalistic movement, video, circus skills and more recently, verbatim text.\n\nDV8 Physical Theatre receives funding through Arts Council England’s National Portfolio programme, as well as occasional project support from the British Council. It has toured work extensively in the UK and Europe, and further afield to Australia, the USA, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. Many of its long-term co-production partners are theatres and festivals from across the world. It is an Artsadmin associate company, and also a member of the ITC, Dance UK and IETM. Newson has often stated that the company is motivated by artistic inspiration and creative need, rather than financial, organisational and touring demands.\n\nIt has thus far produced 18 works for the stage, the majority of which have toured internationally, and four award-winning films adapted from stage performances.\n\n\nFilm adaptations of DV8's theatrical productions, except Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men, were produced by DV8 Films Ltd.\n\n\n"}

This album is a follow-up to his 2017 album, \"Drogas Light\".\n\nLupe Fiasco announced the album on September 13, 2018, revealing its release date, cover art and track listing via Twitter.\n\nThe album is the second part of a planned trilogy of albums, with \"Drogas Light\" as its predecessor followed by \"Skulls\", and was slated for a 2016 release with the two albums.\n\nIn a 2018 Billboard interview, Fiasco revealed the main idea of the project:\nIt’s about a group of slaves on a slave ship on their way to Africa to the West Indies and they are thrown off the boat. But they didn’t die. They stayed alive and they lived under the sea. And they dedicated their lives to sinking slave ships -- so they became this super, underwater force against slavery. It’s like a super-deep story that I am building on different fronts. But that’s the main idea and the source material for the album.\n\nIn a 2018 Complex interview, Fiasco said:\nDrogas Wave is based on a story about a group of slaves that jumped off a slave ship transporting them from Africa. The slaves did not drown, and instead somehow managed to live under the sea. They spent the rest of their underwater existence sinking slave ships. ‘\"Drogas\"’ is the Spanish word for drugs. I made it an acronym which stands for ‘\"Don’t Ruin Us God Said\"’.\n\nBecause of reported leaks, the album release date was released a week early on September 21, 2018 instead of the initial release date, September 28, 2018.\n\nOn March 15, 2013, Fiasco released a song called \"Jonylah Forever\" on his SoundCloud page in honor of the 6-month-old infant Jonylah Watkins, who was shot five times while her father was changing her diaper in a minivan and imagines what the infant's life could have been had she survived the March 11 shooting.\n\nOn October 24, 2014, Fiasco released a song called \"Haile Selassie\" featuring longtime contributor Nikki Jean in which he stands up for equality and justice. The title track is inspired by the late Ethopian emperor of the same name.\n\nOn December 20, 2015, Fiasco teased a song called \"Mural Jr.\" as a sequel to his song \"Mural\" from Tetsuo and Youth. The song was originally intended to be included on the previous album, Drogas Light.\n\nTrack 9 \"Alan Forever\" centers around the Death of Alan Kurdi in September 2015 during the European migrant crisis. The song tells of an alternate reality where Alan Kurdi does not drown but instead becomes an Olympic swimmer and later saves a similar boy from drowning. The song is thematically linked to Track 15 \"Jonylah Forever\" which also explored an alternative reality of a young child who was killed.\n\n\"Drogas Wave\" received generally favorable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 73, based on 5 reviews.\n\n\"Drogas Wave\" debuted at number 60 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, with first-week sales of 4,951 copies in the United States.\n\nTracklist adapted from iTunes, Qobuz and the album digital booklet.\n\nNotes\n"}

The term was first suggested by Polish publicist Jerzy Giedroyc in his letter to Ukrainian literature researcher Yuriy Lavrinenko, who later used it as a title for the collection of the best literary works of that generation.\n\nThe downfall of the Russian Empire after the First World War, the resulting abolition of imperial censorship, the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state, and the relative leniency of the Soviet regime in the 1920s all led to an astonishing renaissance of literary and cultural activity in Ukraine. Scores of new writers and poets appeared and formed dozens of literary groups that changed the face of Ukrainian literature. These processes were supported by politics of nativization (in Ukraine it was called ), New Economic Policy (state capitalism) and elimination of illiteracy.\n\nWriters mostly were consolidated into literary organizations with different styles or positions. The period between 1925 and 1928 was characterized by \"literature discussion\" on the initiative of Mykola Khvylovy. An object of the discussion was ways of development for new Ukrainian Soviet literature and role of writer in society. Khvylovy and his associates were supporting an orientation towards Western European culture instead of Russian, they were rejecting \"red graphomania\" (though they weren't rejecting Communism as political ideology).\n\nThe main literary organizations of that time were:\n\nIn late 1920s Stalin abolished the New Economic Policy and returned to forced collectivization. In this context changes in cultural politics occurred as well. An early example was the Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process in 1930, a show trial of 474 people (mostly scientists), 15 of whom were executed and 248 sent to prison.\n\nThe campaign was concentrated in the years from 1934 to 1940, reaching a peak during the Great Purge of 1937-1938. Overall, 223 writers were subjected to harassment, arrest and in a number of cases imprisonment and execution. Almost three hundred representatives of the Ukrainian renaissance of the 1920s were shot between 27 October and 4 November at Sandarmokh, a massive killing field in Karelia (northwest Russia).\n\nSome important representatives of this generation survived. They remained in the Soviet Union (Oleksandr Dovzhenko, Pavlo Tychyna, Maksym Rylsky, Borys Antonenko-Davydovych, Ostap Vyshnya, and Mykola Bazhan), or emigrated (Ulas Samchuk, George Shevelov, and Ivan Bahrianyi).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1851712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851712", "title": "Film adaptation", "text": "Film adaptation\n\nA film adaptation is the transfer of a work or story, in whole or in part, to a feature film. Although often considered a type of derivative work, recent academic developments by scholars such as Robert Stam conceptualize film adaptation as a dialogic process.\n\nA common form of film adaptation is the use of a novel as the basis of a feature film. Other works adapted into films include non-fiction (including journalism), autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays, historical sources, and other films. From the earliest days of cinema, in nineteenth-century Europe, adaptation from such diverse resources has been a ubiquitous practice of filmmaking.\n\nIn 1924, Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of Frank Norris's novel \"McTeague\" with his moving picture \"Greed\", and the resulting film was 9½ hours long. It was cut, at studio insistence, to four hours, then without Stroheim's input, cut again to around two hours. The end result was a film that was largely incoherent. Since that time, few directors have attempted to put everything in a novel into a film. Therefore, elision is all but essential.\n\nIn some cases, film adaptations also interpolate scenes or invent characters. This is especially true when a novel is part of a literary saga. Incidents or quotations from later or earlier novels will be inserted into a single film. Additionally, and far more controversially, filmmakers will invent new characters or create stories that were not present in the source material at all. Given the anticipated audience for a film, the screenwriter, director, or movie studio may wish to increase character time or to invent new characters. For example, William J. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"Ironweed\" included a short appearance by a prostitute named Helen. Because the film studio anticipated a female audience for the film and had Meryl Streep for the role, Helen became a significant part of the film. However, characters are also sometimes invented to provide the narrative voice.\n\nThere have been several notable cases of massive inventive adaptation, including the Roland Joffe adaptation of \"The Scarlet Letter\" with explicit sex between Hester Prynn and the minister and Native American obscene puns into a major character and the film's villain. The Charlie Kaufman and \"Donald Kaufman\" penned \"Adaptation\", credited as an adaptation of the novel \"The Orchid Thief\", was an intentional satire and commentary on the process of film adaptation itself. All of those are cases of Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. The creators of the \"Gulliver's Travels\" miniseries interpolated a sanity trial to reflect the ongoing scholarly debate over whether or not Gulliver himself is sane at the conclusion of Book IV. In those cases, adaptation is a form of criticism and recreation as well as translation.\n\nChange is essential and practically unavoidable, mandated both by the constraints of time and medium, but how much is always a balance. Some film theorists have argued that a director should be entirely unconcerned with the source, as a novel is a novel and a film is a film, and the two works of art must be seen as separate entities. Since a transcription of a novel into film is impossible, even holding up a goal of \"accuracy\" is absurd. Others argue that what a film adaptation does is change to fit (literally, adapt), and the film must be accurate to the effect (aesthetics), the theme, or the message of a novel and that the filmmaker must introduce changes, if necessary, to fit the demands of time and to maximize faithfulness along one of those axes.\n\nIn most cases adaptation, the films are required to create identities (for example, a characters' costume or set decor) since they are not specified in the original material. Then, the influence of film-makers may go unrecognised because there is no comparison in the original material even though the new visual identities will affect narrative interpretation. Peter Jackson's adaptations of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"The Hobbit\" by author JRR Tolkien represent an unusual case since many visual and stylistic details were specified by Tolkien. For the \"Harry Potter\" film series, author JK Rowling was closely consulted by the filmmakers, and she provided production designer Stuart Craig with a map of Hogwarts' grounds and also prevented director Alfonso Cuarón from adding a graveyard scene because the graveyard would appear elsewhere in a later novel.\n\nAn often overlooked aspect of film adaptation is the inclusion of sound and music. In a literary text, a specific sound effect can often be implied or specified by an event, but in the process of adaptation, filmmakers must determine specific the sound characteristics that subliminally affects narrative interpretation. In some cases of adaptation, music may have been specified in the original material (usually diegetic music). In Stephenie Meyer's 2005 \"Twilight\" novel, the characters Edward Cullen and Bella Swan both listen to Debussy's \"Clair de lune\" and Edward composes the piece \"Bella's Lullaby\" for Bella. While \"Clair de lune\" was a pre-existing piece of music, \"Bella's Lullaby\" was not and required original music to be composed for the 2008 movie adaptation.\n\nIn the 2016 sci-fi film \"\" adapted from the story by Kurt Vonnegut, the film-makers decided to abandon Vonnegut's choice of music. They stated that they felt that it worked in his prose only because it was not actually heard. Filmmakers' test screenings found that Vonnegut's style of music confused audiences and detracted from narrative comprehension. The film's composer, Leon Coward, stated, \"You can try to be as true to Vonnegut's material as possible, but at the end of the day also you’re working with the material that you as a team have generated, not just Vonnegut's, and that’s what you've got to make work.\"\n\nStage plays are frequent sources for film adaptations. \n\nMany of William Shakespeare's plays, including \"Hamlet\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"Othello\", have been adapted into films. The first sound adaptation of any Shakespeare play was the 1929 production of \"The Taming of the Shrew\", starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. It was later adapted as both a musical play called \"Kiss Me, Kate\", which opened on Broadway in 1948, and as the 1953 Hollywood musical of the same name. \"The Taming of the Shrew\" was again retold in 1999 as a teen comedy set in a high school in \"10 Things I Hate about You\", and also in 2003 as an urban romantic comedy, \"Deliver Us from Eva\". The 1961 musical film \"West Side Story\" was adapted from \"Romeo and Juliet\", with its first incarnation as a Broadway musical play that opened in 1957. The animated film \"The Lion King\" (1994) was inspired by \"Hamlet\" as well as various traditional African myths, and 2001's \" O\" was based on \"Othello\".\n\nFilm adaptations of Shakespeare's works in languages other than English are numerous, including Akira Kurosawa's films \"Throne of Blood\" (1957, an epic film version of \"Macbeth\"), \" The Bad Sleep Well\" (1960, inspired by \"Hamlet\") and \"Ran\" (1985, based on \"King Lear\"); and Vishal Bhardwaj's \"Shakespearean trilogy\" consisting of \" Haider\" (2014, a retelling of \"Hamlet\"), \"Omkara\" (2006, based on \"Othello\") and \"Maqbool\" (2003, based on \"Macbeth\"). \n\nAnother way in which Shakespearean texts have been incorporated in films is to feature characters who are either actors performing those texts or characters who are somehow influenced or effected by seeing one of Shakespeare's plays, within a larger non-Shakespearean story. Generally, Shakespeare's basic themes or certain elements of the plot will parallel the main plot of the film or become part of a character's development in some way. Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way. Éric Rohmer's 1992 film \"Conte d'hiver\" (\"A Tale of Winter\") is one example. Rohmer uses one scene from Shakepeare's \"A Winter's Tale\" as a major plot device within a story that is not based on the play at all.\n\nIn Britain, where stage plays tend to be more popular as a form of entertainment than currently in the United States, many films began as a stage productions. Some British films and British/American collaborations that were based on successful British plays include \"Gaslight\" (1940), \"Blithe Spirit\" (1945), \"Rope\" (1948), \"Look Back in Anger\" (1959), \"Oh, What a Lovely War!\" (1969), \"Sleuth\" (1972), \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975), \"Shirley Valentine\" (1989), \"The Madness of King George\" (1994), \"The History Boys\" (2006), \" Quartet\" (2012), and \"The Lady in the Van\" (2015).\n\nSimilarly, hit Broadway plays are often adapted into films, whether from musicals or dramas. Some examples of American film adaptations based on successful Broadway plays are \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" (1944), \"Born Yesterday\" (1950), \"Harvey\" (1950), \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"The Odd Couple\" (1968), \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970), \"Agnes of God\" (1985), \"Children of a Lesser God\" (1986), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), \"Real Women Have Curves\" (2002), \"Rabbit Hole\" (2010), and \"Fences\" (2016).\n\nOn one hand, theatrical adaptation does not involve as many interpolations or elisions as novel adaptation, but on the other, the demands of scenery and possibilities of motion frequently entail changes from one medium to the other. Film critics will often mention if an adapted play has a static camera or emulates a proscenium arch. Laurence Olivier consciously imitated the arch with his \"Henry V\" (1944), having the camera begin to move and to use color stock after the prologue, indicating the passage from physical to imaginative space. Sometimes, the adaptive process can continue after one translation. Mel Brooks' \"The Producers\" began as a film in 1967, was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2001, and then adapted again in 2005 as a musical film.\n\nFeature films are occasionally created from television series or television segments. In some cases, the film will offer a longer storyline than the usual television program's format and/or expanded production values. In the adaptation of \"The X-Files\" to film, for example, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Additionally, adaptations of television shows will offer the viewer the opportunity to see the television show's characters without broadcast restrictions. These additions (nudity, profanity, explicit drug use, and explicit violence) are only rarely a featured adaptive addition (film versions of \"procedurals\" such as \"Miami Vice\" are most inclined to such additions as featured adaptations) – \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" is a notable example of a film being more explicit than its parent TV series.\n\nAt the same time, some theatrically released films are adaptations of television miniseries events. When national film boards and state-controlled television networks co-exist, filmmakers can sometimes create very long films for television that they may adapt solely for time for theatrical release. Both Ingmar Bergman (notably with \"Fanny and Alexander\" but with other films as well) and Lars von Trier have created long television films that they then recut for international distribution.\n\nEven segments of television series have been adapted into feature films. The American television variety show \"Saturday Night Live\" has been the origin of a number of films, beginning with \"The Blues Brothers,\" which began as a one-off performance by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Mr. Bean was adapted into \"Bean\" and the sequel, \"Mr. Bean's Holiday\".\n\nRadio narratives have also provided the basis of film adaptation. \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" for example, began as a radio series for the BBC and then became a novel that was adapted to film. In the heyday of radio, radio segments, like television segments today, translated to film on several occasions, usually as shorts. Dialog-heavy stories and fantastic stories from radio also adapted to film (e.g. \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" and \"The Life of Riley\").\n\nComic book characters, particularly superheroes, have long been adapted into film, beginning in the 1940s with Saturday movie serials aimed at children. \"Superman\" (1978) and \"Batman\" (1989) are two later successful movie adaptations of famous comic book characters. In the early 2000s, blockbusters such as \"X-Men\" (2000) and \"Spider-Man\" (2002) have led to dozens of superhero films. The success of these films has also led to other comic books not necessarily about superheroes being adapted for the big screen, such as \"Ghost World\" (2001), \"From Hell\" (2001), \"American Splendor\" (2003), \"Sin City\" (2005), \"300\" (2007), \"Wanted\" (2008), and \"Whiteout\" (2009).\n\nThe adaptation process for comics is different from that of novels. Many successful comic book series last for several decades and have featured several variations of the characters in that time. Films based on such series usually try to capture the back story and “spirit” of the character instead of adapting a particular storyline. Occasionally, aspects of the characters and their origins are simplified or modernized.\n\nSelf-contained graphic novels, and miniseries many of which do not feature superheroes, can be adapted more directly, such as in the case of \"Road to Perdition\" (2002) or \"V for Vendetta\" (2006). In particular, Robert Rodriguez did not use a screenplay for \"Sin City\" but utilized actual panels from writer/artist Frank Miller's series as storyboards to create what Rodriguez regards as a \"translation\" rather than an adaptation.\n\nFurthermore, some films based on long-running franchises use particular story lines from the franchise as a basis for a plot. The second X-Men film was loosely based on the graphic novel \"\" and the on the storyline \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\". \"Spider-Man 2\" was based on the storyline \"Spider-Man No More!\" Likewise, \"Batman Begins\" owes many of its elements to Miller's \"\" and the film's sequel, \"The Dark Knight\", uses subplots from \"\".\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe starting in 2008 is a shared universe with films combining characters from different works by Marvel Comics. The DC Extended Universe starting in 2013 uses the same model for DC Comics.\n\n \nVideo games have also been adapted into films, beginning in the early 1980s. Films closely related to the computer and video game industries were also done in this time, such as \"Tron\" and \"Cloak & Dagger\", but only after the release of several films based on well-known brands has this genre become recognized in its own right.\n\nSimilar to comic book-based films in the past (especially from 1980s), films based on video games tend to carry a reputation of lackluster quality and receive negative reaction from both film critics and fans of the source material. A number of films have been successful at the box office, such as \"Mortal Kombat\", \"\", \"Silent Hill\", \"Resident Evil\", and \"\"), but critical reception of the films is either mixed to poor.\n\nSome, such as \"Super Mario Bros.\", were particularly negatively received and are considered among the worst films ever made. \"Super Mario Bros.\" was criticized for being too dark, violent and unfaithful (in plot) to the popular video game series. Many anime Original Video Animations (OVAs) based on popular games have been released such as \"\", \"Halo Legends\", \"\", and numerous films based on the video game series \"Pokémon\".\n\nAmong the most well-known video game filmmakers is Uwe Boll, a German writer, director, and producer whose works include \"House of the Dead\", \"Alone in the Dark\", \"BloodRayne\", \"\", \"Postal\", and \"Far Cry\", all of which were almost universally panned by critics.\n\nAnother likely reason for the failure of video game adaptations is that structural conversion from video game to film format can be challenging for filmmakers. Nintendo video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto said in a 2007 interview:\nIn an interview with \"Fortune\" in August 2015, Miyamoto said, \"Because games and movies seem like similar mediums, people’s natural expectation is we want to take our games and turn them into movies. … I’ve always felt video games, being an interactive medium, and movies, being a passive medium, mean the two are quite different.\"\n\nWhile documentary films have often been made from journalism and reportage, so too have some dramatic films, including: \"All the President's Men\" (1976, adapted from the 1974 book); \"Miracle,\" (2004, from an account published shortly after the 1980 \"miracle on ice\"); and \"Pushing Tin\" (1999, from a 1996 \"New York Times\" article by Darcy Frey). \"An Inconvenient Truth\" is Al Gore's film adaptation of his own Keynote multimedia presentation. The 2011 independent comedy film, \"Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins\" was based on \"Kermode and Mayo's Film Review\" of \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\".\n\nFilms adapted from songs include \"Coward of the County\", \"Ode to Billy Joe\", \"Convoy\", and \"Pretty Baby\" (each from a song of the same name).\n\nFilms based on toys include the Transformers franchise and the G.I. Joe films; there is a longer history of animated television series being created simultaneous to toy lines as a marketing tool. Hasbro's plans to for films based on their board games began with 2012's \"Battleship\". While amusement park rides have often been based on action movies, conversely the 1967 Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland was adapted into \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" in 2003.\n\nRemakes and film sequels are technically adaptations of the original film. Less direct derivations include \"The Magnificent Seven\" from \"The Seven Samurai\", \"Star Wars\" from \"The Hidden Fortress\", and \"Twelve Monkeys\" from \"La Jetée\".\n\nMany films have been made from mythology and religious texts. Both Greek mythology and the Bible have been adapted frequently. Homer's works have been adapted multiple times in several nations. In these cases, the audience already knows the story well, and so the adaptation will de-emphasize elements of suspense and concentrate instead on detail and phrasing.\n\nMany major film award programs present an award for adapted screenplays, separate from the award for original screenplays. \n\nIn the case of a film which was adapted from an unpublished work, however, different awards have different rules around which category the screenplay qualifies for. In 1983, the Canadian Genie Awards rescinded the Best Adapted Screenplay award they had presented to the film \"Melanie\" when they learned that the original work had been unpublished; and in 2017, the film \"Moonlight\", which was adapted from an unpublished theatrical play, was classified and nominated as an adapted screenplay by some awards but as an original screenplay by others.\n\nWhen a film's screenplay is original, it can also be the source of derivative works such as novels and plays. For example, movie studios will commission novelizations of their popular titles or sell the rights to their titles to publishing houses. These novelized films will frequently be written on assignment and sometimes written by authors who have only an early script as their source. Consequently, novelizations are quite often changed from the films as they appear in theatres.\n\nNovelization can build up characters and incidents for commercial reasons (e.g. to market a card or computer game, to promote the publisher's \"saga\" of novels, or to create continuity between films in a series)\n\nThere have been instances of novelists who have worked from their own screenplays to create novels at nearly the same time as a film. Both Arthur C. Clarke, with \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", and Graham Greene, with \"The Third Man\", have worked from their own film ideas to a novel form (although the novel version of \"The Third Man\" was written more to aid in the development of the screenplay than for the purposes of being released as a novel). Both John Sayles and Ingmar Bergman write their film ideas as novels before they begin producing them as films, although neither director has allowed these prose treatments to be published.\n\nFinally, films have inspired and been adapted into plays. John Waters's films have been successfully mounted as plays; both \"Hairspray\" and \"Cry-Baby\" have been adapted, and other films have spurred subsequent theatrical adaptations. \"Spamalot\" is a Broadway play based on Monty Python films. In a rare case of a film being adapted from a stage musical adaptation of a film, in 2005, the film adaptation of the stage musical based on Mel Brooks' classic comedy film \"The Producers\" was released.\n\n\n"}

The \"Van Eps Recording Banjo\" was a well-known model until 1930. He was the father of jazz guitarist George Van Eps.\n\nVan Eps was born in Somerville, New Jersey, and moved with his family to Plainfield in 1892. He learned to play the banjo and studied the phonograph cylinder recordings of Vess Ossman. In 1897 Van Eps was hired by Thomas Edison's National Phonograph Company in West Orange to work in studio engagements. Van Eps's cylinder recordings, often remakes of Ossman's tunes, sold well for Edison. Early ragtime banjo recordings by Van Eps included \"A Bunch of Rags\" (1900) and \"A Ragtime Episode\" (1902). He also recorded for a number of other companies, including Columbia (from 1904) and Victor (from 1910).\n\nThe Van Eps Trio recorded steadily from 1912 to 1922. He also led other groups, such as the Van Eps Quartet, the Van Eps Specialty Four, and the Van Eps Banjo Orchestra. In 1914, the latter group was one of the first to record for the American branch of the French Pathé Frères Company. In 1921, Orlando Kellum, inventor of the Photokinema sound-on-disc sound film system, filmed the Van Eps Trio in \"The Famous Van Eps Trio in a Bit of Jazz\".\n\nWith Henry Burr, he formed a company that manufactured and sold the Van Eps Recording Banjo, modeled on the one he used in recordings and concerts. The banjo remained on the market until about 1930, when widespread use of electric recording removed the need for the loud volume produced by the Van Eps model.\n\nBy the 1930s the banjo had fallen out of favor in popular music, and Van Eps switched to guitar, playing as a studio musician with Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Red Norvo. He was associated with the British banjo composer Frank Lawes and recorded some pieces with him. In the 1950s he attempted a comeback with a number of banjo recordings before his death in Burbank, California, at the age of 81.\n\nVan Eps also worked in vaudeville and influenced pre-bluegrass musicians like Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers. \n\n"}

{"id": "1016799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1016799", "title": "Hrotsvitha", "text": "Hrotsvitha\n\nHrotsvitha of Gandersheim (; c. 935 – after 973) was a 10th-century German secular canoness, dramatist and poetess who lived at Gandersheim Abbey (in modern-day Bad Gandersheim, Lower Saxony), established by the Ottonian dynasty. \n\nShe wrote in Latin, and is considered by some to be the first person since antiquity to compose drama in the Latin West. She is one of the very few women who wrote about her life during early middle ages, a history of women in that era from a woman's perspective. She has been called \"the most remarkable woman of her time\". \n\nHrotsvitha's name appears variously in the forms Hrosvite, Hroswitha, Hroswithe, Rhotswitha, Roswit and is modernized as Roswitha but the proper pronunciation is Hrotsuit. The name is Old Saxon for \"strong honour\", which she re-interpreted to mean \"a clarion voice\".\n\nHrotsvitha's family lineage, at what time she entered the nunnery, and what reasons led her to take the veil are unknown. There is no direct evidence concerning the dates of her birth, consecration, and death. Hrotsvitha’s biography largely depends on her own accounts or results of inferential reasoning. For instance, in her historical poem, “Carmen de Primordiis Coenobii Gandersheimensis”, she tells us that she entered the world a long while after the death of Saxon duke Otto the Illustrious (the father of King Henry the Fowler), which occurred in 912.\n\nFrom the overall disposition of her works, scholars are sure she lived at Gandersheim, and they infer that she was born into the Saxon nobility. Due to the depth of her point of view in her writings, it is widely believed that she took the veil later in life. Some scholars also infer that she may have personal experience with the love and renunciation that permeates her work.\n\nShe studied under Rikkardis and Gerberga, a daughter of Duke Henry I of Bavaria and niece of Emperor Otto the Great (912–973), who became Abbess of Gandersheim in 956. Hrotsvitha was noted for her great learning and was introduced to Roman writers by Gerberga. Hrotsvitha's work shows familiarity not only with the Church fathers, but also with classical poets, including Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Plautus and Terence (on whom her own verse was modeled). Several of her plays draw on the so-called apocryphal gospels. Her works form part of the Ottonian Renaissance.\n\nUnder Gerberga's leadership, the Ottonian house monastery of Gandersheim rivalled with the abbeys of Quedlinburg and Memleben for the favour of the emperor. Otto penned a history that became one of Hrotsvitha's poetical subjects, in her \"Carmen de Gestis Oddonis Imperatoris\" (\"Deeds of Emperor Otto\"), which encompasses the period up to his coronation in 962. Hrotsvitha believed that Otto's affinity for Italy arose from romances set there similar to the story of Jaufre Rudel, when pilgrims returned commending the troubled fate of Queen Adelaide.\n\nScholars have questioned the authenticity of Hrotsvitha's works. Extensive studies attempting to detect the presence or lack of discrepancies or patterns among them can provide evidence of their authenticity. Thus, analysis of Hrotsvitha's works are important to the discussion of what influence Hrotsvitha, especially as a woman, and her writing may have actually had on society at that time.\n\nHrosvitha divided her work into three books:\n\nA. Liber Primus\n\nB. Liber Secundus\n\nC. Liber Tertius\n\nHrothsvitha's works fell under the categories of legends, comedies, and plays. Cardinal Gasquet said her works have \"a claim to an eminent place in medieval literature, and do honor to her sex, to the age in which she lived, and to the vocation which she followed.\"\n\nThe \"Book of Legends\" is a collection of eight legends, all of which are written in Leonine hexameter—with the exception of Gongolph, which was written in rhymed distichs. Hrotsvitha penned a number of legends in verse, including those of Gongolfus and Theophilus, and it is evident that there is a theme of religion throughout and within this book. The fifth and sixth legends, \"Theophilus\" and \"Basilius\", are both based on Latin translations of the vitae of Greek saints. The legends speak about the Faustian tradition in the West, in which sinners sell their souls to Satan.\n\nThe story of Theophilus was one of the most popular written in any language. It describes how the young and ambitious archdeacon Theophilus, raised by his uncle in sixth century Antioch, is overcome by disappointment about his lack of promotion in the church. He consults a Jewish sorcerer and is taken to a meeting of devils. Theophilus renounces God in a written document and joins hands with Satan. He gains a position of high influence, and is happy with his power until he begins to repent the sin he has committed. Theophilus requests help from the Virgin Mary in order to reverse his contract with the Devil, and ultimately good trumps evil, and the contract is terminated. Hrotsvitha supplements the story with her description of Theophilus in \"The Seven Arts\":- \"De sophiae rivis septeno fonte manantis.\"\n\nA common theme throughout this legend, which is also applicable to some of the other legends, is the presence of the Devil and the constant battle between good and evil. Theophilus's choice to side with the Devil, but then turn against him is a primary example of this in the text - good always win. The Devil is a common presence in many of Hrosvitha's works, and she characterizes him according to the conventions of her time. Even when the Devil himself is not present, she often incorporates his sinful characteristics into another character in the work.\n\nAnother example from the \"Book of Legends\" is the legend of Basilius. Basilius, a fourth-century bishop of Caesarea, exuded the traits of goodness and the power of Christ on earth by defeating Satan in a physical and verbal struggle for the soul of a servant who had fallen in love with his master’s daughter. Satan causes the couple to “burn in mad desire” in order to turn Christians away from Christ. This man renounces Christ in return for marriage to the daughter. This legend sums up all of the religious themes present in the previous examples mentioned. It includes a battle between good and evil or Christ and Satan, in which she illustrates the powers of Satan to be similar to if not equal to those of Christ in causing a person to do evil, whereas Christ would have them doing good.\n\nIn her seventh and eighth poems, \"Dionysius\" and \"St. Agnes\", Hrotsvitha recounts the martyrdoms of early Christians. These are only a few examples from the \"Book of Legends\"; in the other poems she expresses similar themes of martyrdom, religion and spirituality.\n\nThe best known and original of the works of Hrotsvitha is her imitation of \"Terence\". It was written in prose as six comedies. She writes in her preface that her writing will appeal to many who are attracted by the charm of style.\n\nThe comedies of Hrotsvitha took the place of \"Terence\" in the studies of Gandersheim. Her themes remained love stories. Among them include \"Gallicanus\", \"Dulcitius\", \"Callimachus\", \"Abraham\", \"Paphnutius\", and \"Sapientia\". The reader will note Dulcitius being stricken with illusion, embracing the pots and kettles in the kitchen. In the meantime three lovely maidens, Agape, Chionia, and Hirena, are rescued from his villainy. Dulcitius is the only one of Hrotsvitha's comedies that could really fit the modern sense of the word.\n\nIn general, Hrosvitha's plays were works of hagiography. Her plays contrast the chastity and perseverance of Christian women with Latin women who are portrayed as weak and emotional. Her \"Passio Sancti Pelagii\" is derived, she says, from an eyewitness to the martyrdom of Pelagius of Cordova.\n\nThe \"Book of Drama\" presents a Roman Catholic alternative to Terence. These are the six plays, that are not so much drama as \"dialogues\", and are a medieval example of closet drama.\n\nOne of the biggest debates over Hrosvitha's plays is over whether they were ever performed while she was alive. However, they are known to have been performed many times since her death, the earliest confirmation of which was in Paris in 1888.\n\nOne of Hrotsvitha's most well known plays was \"Gallicanus.\" It was also the first drama she wrote and, like another of her dramas, \"Calimachus,\" focuses on the theme of conversion. The central woman in the story is the Emperor Constantine's daughter, Constance. Constance is a consecrated Virgin, while Gallicanus is the Commander-in-Chief of Constantine's army. When Gallicanus tells Constantine that he wants to marry his daughter, Constantine goes to Constance and tells her of Gallicanus' wishes. But Constance is strong in her convictions of chastity, and Constantine supports his daughter's wishes.\n\nConstance has a plan for her father to avoid her having to marry Gallicanus, which he happily goes along with. The conversion part comes in when they plan to have Gallicanus convert to Christianity. Constance's Grand Almoners, John and Paul, see to it that Gallicanus wants to convert when he thinks he might lose a battle, and after his victory Gallicanus has himself baptized and takes a vow of celibacy. Likewise, he informs Constantine that he can no longer marry his daughter, like Constance had planned. Constance is portrayed as an intelligent girl who has dedication and a vow of chastity, a common theme in Hrotsvitha's plays. Her faith is emphasized, as is her perseverance.\n\nGallicanus is comparable to one of Hrosvitha's eight legends, \"Agnes.\" Both highlight the preservation of the main female's virginity and her faithfulness to God, even though the marriage she is being offered is an honorable one. Both also deal with conversion in a very similar way, with the man seeking to marry her eventually converting himself and becoming a follower of Christ. In all of Hrovitha's works that include the preserving of one's virginity, there seems to be a pattern of it being only a female virtue.\n\nThe third book comprised two historical writings in Latin hexameters: the \"Gesta Ottonis\" (a history of the Ottonian houses 919–65) and the \"Primordia coenobii Gandeshemensis\" (a history of her order from 846–919).\nThe most important manuscript of her works, containing all the texts other than \"Primordia\", is the Codex Bayerische Staatsbibliothek (Bavarian State Library) Clm 14485, a manuscript written by several, different hands in Gandersehim toward the end of the 10th or start of the 11th centuries. It was discovered by the humanist Conrad Celtis in 1493/94 in the Cloister of St. Emmeram in Regensburg and formed the first edition (illustrated by Albrecht Dürer).\n\nAs the earliest known woman writer in the German lands, Hrotsvitha was strongly aware that her gender made her less likely to be taken seriously in her contemporary society, and she used a number of strategies to counter this. Generally, she accepts the view of her time that women are less suited to writing than men - it would be several centuries before female writers would seriously attempt to argue otherwise - but argues that she is a divinely inspired exception. God has given her a \"perspicax ingenium\" - a perceptive intellect, and her (cheekily misleading) etymologizing of her own name is used to back this up. She said she “put womanly weakness aside and summoned manly strength to her prudent heart.” She did not want to be discredited by people because she was a woman, and she said she had the strength of a man within her heart. In the prologue to \"The Book Of Legends, \"Hrotsvitha says that “Scorn he should not render at the writer’s weaker gender/ Who these small lines had sung with a woman’s untutored tongue/ But rather should he praise the Lord’s celestial grace”. However, despite her role as a “clarion voice,” Hrotsvit still felt compelled to submit her works “to the examination of learned clerks” for approval, invoking a \"testimony of three... to constitute truth.\".\n\nSince Hrotsvitha's writings were rediscovered and published by the Renaissance humanist Conrad Celtes (1459–1508), her historical picture, as well as her image as a woman depended on contemporary interpretation. Celtes portrayed her as an icon of humanist values and educational ideals, emphasizing her alleged knowledge of the Ancient Greek language and comprehensive quadrivium education by largely ignoring her religiousness.\n\nTexts and translations\n\n\nSince 1973 Bad Gandersheim has annually awarded the Roswitha Prize, named for Hrosvitha, to female writers; since 1974 the Roswitha Ring has been awarded at the close of each summer season of the Gandersheimer Domfestspiele to the outstanding actress.\n\nThe artwork \"The Dinner Party\" features a place setting for Hrosvitha.\n\nIn 2006, American feminist drama group Guerrilla Girls On Tour issued the \"First Annual Hrosvitha Challenge\" on their website, announcing that they would bestow the First Annual Hrosvitha Award on whichever professional theater decides \"to scrap their plans of producing yet another production of a Greek tragedy and instead produce a play by Hrosvitha, the first female playwright\".\n\nThe Hroswitha Club is an association of women book collectors founded in New York City in 1944. Members included co-founder Sarah Gildersleeve Fife and Frances Hooper. The club published \"Hroswitha of Gandersheim: Her life, times, and works\" in 1965.\n\nHrotsvitha is frequently referred to in John Kennedy Toole's comic novel \"A Confederacy of Dunces\", in which she is called Hroswitha.\n\nAsteroid 615 Roswitha is named in her honour.\n\nA play on Hrotsvita, on her playwriting career and touches of the secular in her plays, was penned by Amit Maitra of Howrah, a suburb of Kolkata, and is now being performed in Kolkata by a theatre group.\n\n\n\n \n"}

The show followed a group of Americans, who leave the United States for Japan where they competed in a Japanese style game show. The winner takes home US $250,000. The series won both the Best Reality prize and the overall prize at the 2009 Rose d'Or ceremony.\n\nOn October 9, 2008, it was renewed for a second season. On March 5, 2010, it was announced that ABC had not renewed the show for a third season.\n\nIn Season One, the contestants are informed that they are to take part in a reality-style competition, but not informed of the nature of the show. They are flown to Tokyo, Japan, and taken to the Toho Studios, where it is revealed that they are to compete on a Japanese game show called . For Season Two, \"Majide\" host Rome Kanda surprised each of the contestants in their hometowns informing them they were going to Japan. They are broken up into teams and competed in games against each other. The winning team was given a reward activity while the losing team was given a punishment activity after their team game. In the second season, the first game played saw the winning team have an advantage into the second game, where rewards and punishments were handed out afterward. In the final episode, the first two games reverted to the rules of Season One. Two members of the losing team are chosen to compete in an additional game known as the elimination game head-to-head where the loser of that game is eliminated. (In general, the losing team chooses its two players as a team, although in the event that they fail to come to a decision, their opponents make the selection for them.) If the losing team has only two players remaining, then both have to compete in the elimination game. In the final part, the teams are broken up and the four remaining players face three elimination challenges in Season One, and final three facing two elimination games in Season Two; in all cases, the losing contestant was eliminated from the show and carried offstage and sent back to the United States by the \"sayonara mob\" (脱落者决定), dressed in black suits.\n\nThe series followed not only the \"Majide\" competition, but also the contestants' activities backstage and outside the game show in reality style. The contestants lived in a house together in the suburb of Kasai, with a Mama-san (Kozue Saito), who generally expects the contestants to live in line with Japanese culture and customs. In season 2, they live in the Majide Guest House with Mama-san.\n\nThe host of season one was Japanese-American Tony Sano, who commented, \"It's going to be like nothing American audiences have seen on network television.\" Episodes are narrated by Robert Cait.\n\nThe show was produced by A. Smith & Co. Productions (the producers of Gordon Ramsay's \"Hell's Kitchen\" and \"Kitchen Nightmares\" in the USA) with Arthur Smith, Kent Weed of A. Smith and Co. and Tim Cresenti of Small World International Format Television as executive producers and Weed directing, and is distributed by Disney/ABC's Greengrass Productions division. The format was created by Danish producers Karsten Bartholin and David Sidebotham for Babyfoot ApS, and was originally titled \"Big in Japan\".\n\n\"Majide\" (which is Japanese slang for \"Seriously?!\"), the show-within-the-show, was not an actual Japanese game show, but was intended to resemble a stereotypical Japanese game show. The American producers watched hours of Japanese game shows, took the most common elements and created all of the games, with help from producers in Japan, who also produced the game segments at Toho Studios. In contrast to many American game shows, which are usually based on either trivia (such as \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\"), mental skill (\"Wheel of Fortune\") celebrity interaction (\"Match Game\" or \"The $100,000 Pyramid\") or even dumb luck (\"Let's Make a Deal\"), Japanese game shows tend to be more physically oriented, such as \"Takeshi's Castle\". The Nickelodeon game show \"Double Dare\" was a hybrid of both the American and Japanese styles, while the reality show format also used a strategy base for who to eliminate, and who to keep such as \"Big Brother\" and \"Survivor\".\n\n\"Majide\" is hosted by Rome Kanda and judged by Masahiro Hurugori, known on the show as Judge Bobu (Bob). Kanda has translated \"Majide\" (マジで) as \"You've got to be crazy!\"\n\nThe first episode premiered on ABC on June 24, 2008. Tony Sano was host for this season. There were ten contestants in the first episode, with only one team game per episode. The season ran for seven episodes (unlike the second season) and the last episode screened on August 6, 2008.\n\nThe second season premiered on June 17, 2009. Tony Sano did not return to host. In addition, the number of contestants increased from ten to twelve, and there are two team games per episode instead of one. The team that wins the first team game is given an advantage in the second, while the rest of the format remains the same. It ran for eight episodes and finished on August 5, 2009.\nBesides the USA, fifteen other countries bought the format. The American version of this show is airing in Australia on 7Two, Denmark on TV3, Hungary on Animax, New Zealand's TV2, Poland's AXN, Singapore's Channel 5, the Philippines' Studio 23, Sweden's TV6, Slovenia's TV3 Slovenia and Portugal's SIC Radical. The Greek version of the show (under the original name \"Big In Japan\") airs on Alpha TV. In Malaysia it airs on 8tv and in South Africa on Animax. In Indonesia the show is titled \"Keep Ganbatte!!\" and is on NET. TV. FremantleMedia is the license holder of the show.\n\nA Greek version was produced by Alpha TV and began airing on February 1, 2009 with the title \"Big in Japan\". The host was Kalomoira, a Greek singer, with Yoshi Amao. 15 contestants took part.\n\nIn 2009, Sweden began airing its own version of the show called Hjälp! Jag är med i en japansk TV-show (Help! I'm in a Japanese television show) with Swedish celebrities competing against each other. The show was produced and aired by TV4. The Swedish version was also recorded in the Toho Studios but did not include Tony Sano, Masahiro Hurugori or Rome Kanda. Instead it was narrated (and sometimes hosted) by Carolina Gynning. The show-within-the-show was not \"Majide\" but \"Do Konjo\", and was hosted by Yoshi Amao with Mr. Fu as the judge.\n\n\nThe winner of the final episode of \"Hjälp! Jag är med i en japansk TV-show\" was Kjell Eriksson, against runner-up Klasse Möllberg.\n\nA Norwegian version of the Swedish format was aired by the TV3 network.\n\nIn late November 2009, Portuguese TV station TVI aired its own version of the series called Portugal de Olhos em Bico. It ran only for two episodes. Instead of traveling to Japan, the contestants played the game in a TV studio in Portugal. They were divided into three teams of two members each, each of whom were relatives or friends. The teams were different in each episode, with the team with the most points winning at the end of each episode.\n\n"}

It was first performed in 1981 in the Lenkom Theatre, Moscow, directed by Mark Zakharov. Main roles in the premiere performed by Soviet stars Nikolai Karachentsov and .\n\nThe opera is named after the two ships \"Juno\" and \"Avos\" that constituted the expedition headed by Russian explorer Nikolai Rezanov. The plot is based on the love story of Nikolai Rezanov and Concepción Argüello, a 15-year-old daughter of José Darío Argüello, the colonial governor of Spanish California.\n\nThe performance was first recorded for television in 1983, the second television version was created in 2002.\n\nThe opera's first premiere abroad took place at Espace Cardin theater in Paris in 1983.\n\nIn April, 2017, the opera was performed by local actors in Donbass Opera, Donetsk \n\nThe libretto of \"Juno and Avos\" is based on Andrey Voznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" written in 1970. The poem is based on actual events of 1806 surrounding the love story of Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, and Maria Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish governor of Alta California José Darío Argüello. Voznesensky was inspired by Rezanov's diary, George Alexander Lensen books about the Rezanov expeditions, the Bret Harte ballad \"Conception de Arguello\" and Piotr Tikhmenev's \"A History of the Russian-American Company\".\nIn 1806 Nikolai Rezanov arrived in California, then a part of New Spain, to get provisioning for Russian settlements in Alaska. Maria fell in love with Rezanov and they got engaged. To marry Maria, a Catholic, Rezanov had to obtain the Emperor's permission. He also had to sail back to Alaska. On his way back to Saint Petersburg he fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807 at the age of 43. A year later, Alexander Andreyevich Baranov told Maria the news, but she would not believe it until 1842 when Sir George Simpson gave her a detailed account of Rezanov's death. She took a vow of silence and lived in a monastery in Monterey, California until her death in 1857.\n\nIn the fall of 2000 the sheriff of Benicia, California, where Maria is buried, brought a handful of earth and a rose from her grave to Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk. The cross on the grave is engraved with \"I will never forget you\" on one side and \"I will never see you again\" on the other, referencing a line from a popular track of the opera performed by a male and a female singer.\n\nVoznesensky never claimed historical accuracy in his account, stating that characters in his poem are images echoing the fates of real people.\n\nAfter his wife's death, Court Chamberlain Rezanov decides to commit himself entirely to the service of Russia. His attempts to arrange trade with North America are not well received at government, but finally he is ordered to organize the expedition he desires. Before his departure, Rezanov tells a story that has been bothering him since his youth. Once he saw the icon of Our Lady of Kazan and since then he feels he is in love with Mary. Mary visits Rezanov in one of his dreams and tells him not to be afraid of his feelings, promising to pray for him.\n\nTwo ships, Juno and Avos, under Russian Navy Ensign are leaving for California. In then-Spanish California, the governor is preparing for the wedding of his daughter Conchita and Sir Fernando. Rezanov greets the Californians on behalf of Russia and the governor invites him, as the ambassador of Czar Alexander, to the 16th birthday ball for his daughter. Nikolai asks Conchita for a dance, which turns into a fateful event in the lives of the two and Fernando. Fernando is jealous, and guests cynically make bets on whether Rezanov will \"pluck the California flower\". Both men, Fernando and Rezanov, understand that neither one will give up without a fight. At night Conchita prays to Mary, and Nikolai comes to her room. The two fall in love and secretly become engaged.\n\nBut good fortune is no longer on Rezanov's side. Fernando calls for a duel. The Russian-American company business is in decline. The scandal prompts the Russians to leave San Francisco. On his way back to Saint Petersburg, Rezanov falls ill and dies in Krasnoyarsk. Conchita dies in a Dominican monastery.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "211933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211933", "title": "Lucifer (DC Comics)", "text": "Lucifer (DC Comics)\n\nLucifer Samael Morningstar is a fictional character appearing primarily as a supporting character in the comic book series \"The Sandman\" and as the title character of a spin-off, both published under the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics.\n\nThough various depictions of Lucifer—the Biblical fallen angel and Devil of Christianity—have been presented by DC Comics in their run, this interpretation by Neil Gaiman debuted in \"The Sandman\" in 1989.\n\nLater, the character acquired an ongoing \"Lucifer\" spin-off series written by Mike Carey, depicting his adventures on Earth, Heaven, and in the various other realms of his family's creations and in uncreated voids after abandoning Hell in the \"Sandman\" series. Lucifer also appears as a supporting character in issues of \"The Demon\", \"The Spectre\", and other DC Universe comics. Two angels, several demons, a human, and briefly Superman have taken his place as ruler of Hell.\n\nIn 2010, IGN's named Lucifer as the 68th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. Lucifer appears as the titular character in a television series, portrayed by Tom Ellis.\n\nIn the earlier related series \"The Sandman\", written by Neil Gaiman, Lucifer abandoned his lordship over Hell. While Lucifer had previously appeared in various stereotypical guises in earlier DC books, Gaiman's version was premised on English poet and prose writer John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". At Gaiman's request of the artist, Lucifer looks like David Bowie at the time. In the \"Sandman\" series, Lucifer had ruled as Lord of Hell for 10 billion years after rebelling three seconds after Creation. Over that time, he had manipulated the various demons of Hell against each other, provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented, and led the war against Heaven.\n\nHowever, at some point during his rule, he had become bored with his existence. He became tired of the various stereotypes and prejudices that mortals held of the devil, such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls, which was largely untrue, and that he forced mortals to commit evil acts. He had become tired of his reign over Hell and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled. In the \"Sandman\" story \"\", Lucifer expels all the demons and damned souls from Hell before closing Hell's gates and handing over the key to Hell to Dream of the Endless, the title character of the \"Sandman\" series. Eventually, control of Hell was handed over to two angels, Duma (the angel of silence) and Remiel (\"set over those who rise\"), while Lucifer simply retired to Earth, initially to Perth, Western Australia and later to Los Angeles, California.\n\nBy the end of the series, however, it is revealed that Hell was not a punishment, but a gift: being the furthest possible place from the throne of light, Lucifer could be separated from God as far as possible. Lucifer never created the physical features of Hell—Hell created itself around him.\n\nLucifer was the main character in an eponymous series that ran for 75 issues and the \"Lucifer: Nirvana\" one-shot, from June 2000 to August 2006, the entire run of which was written by Mike Carey (this series was preceded by Carey's work in 1999, \"The Sandman Presents: Lucifer\" miniseries). To Carey, the essence of the character was:\nIn the series, Lucifer runs a piano bar (an element introduced in the \"Sandman\" story \"\") called \"Lux\" in Los Angeles, with the assistance of his mistress, Mazikeen who is a Lilim, one of the race descended from Lilith. Lucifer is portrayed as a sophisticated and charming man, in accordance with the stereotypical gentleman-devil.\n\nThe theme of the \"Lucifer\" series revolves around the free will problem. Carey's Lucifer is a figure representing will and individual willpower, who challenges the \"tyranny of predestination\". While in Heaven's eyes this is blasphemy, Lucifer points out that the rebellion (and indeed all sin) and damnation as consequence were pre-planned by his Creator, God. Lucifer rejects God's rule and moral philosophy as tyrannical and unjust. The violent, aggressive, totalitarian, vengeful and dictatorial aspects of Heaven's rule are represented mostly by the Angel, Amenadiel, who has a particular hatred of Lucifer and leads attacks of various kinds against him. The attacks include verbal criticism, marshaling the host of Heaven, as well as challenging him to individual combat—almost all of it without the slightest care for the countless innocent, unwilling and unwitting victims that he is more than willing to sacrifice for his own pride. For his part, Lucifer disdains Amenadiel, treating the latter's emotional outbursts with contempt, and repeatedly defeats Amenadiel's assaults with well-orchestrated, hidden plans. Ironically, however, it is often difficult to discern when Lucifer acts as a slave to predestination and when he effectively acts according to his own free will.\n\nElaborate codes of conduct and schemes of entrapment based on these codes are vital elements of the DC/Vertigo magical universe. Lucifer appears as a master of these arts. In an encounter during the first \"Sandman\" story arc (around issue #5) a weakened Dream outsmarts Lucifer. Lucifer first swears revenge on Dream, but later comes to accept Dream's critique of his role and project as Lord of Hell. This inspires Lucifer's abdication, a vital element of the \"Sandman\" saga, and the point of departure for the \"Lucifer\" series.\n\nFor Lucifer, his word is his bond. As David Easterman, a character who sees himself as a victim of Lucifer, puts it:\n\nDespite his theological title as the \"Lord of Lies\", the refusal to lie is central to the moral position of the character -he sees himself as a neutral or amoral facilitator of forces within individuals, and Lucifer actively and effectively combats what he regards as corrupting moral codes. While he avoids lying, his morality seldom extends to compassion and Lucifer regards the sacrifice of millions of souls as unimportant collateral damage; there are few, if any, beings he respects and even fewer for whom he cares.\n\nAs the series opened in 2000, Lucifer's \"restful\" retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past. After various catalytic events, he endeavored to create a universe in competition with (and presumably against the wishes of) his father, Yahweh. This puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray - including his brother, the archangel Michael Demiurgos, and his niece, Elaine Belloc.\n\nThe series paralleled \"The Sandman\" in several ways, with epic fantasy stories being told in arcs separated by one-shot episodes depicting a smaller, more personal tale. Unlike \"The Sandman\", the series has had a consistent art team in Peter Gross and Ryan Kelly, with most of the odd issues illustrated by Dean Ormston. The title's 50th issue was penciled by P. Craig Russell, a homage to \"The Sandman\" #50. Structurally, the series mostly follows its own path. Numerous gods appear, with greater focus on Judeo-Christian religion (as viewed by Milton in \"Paradise Lost\"), Japanese mythology and Norse mythology than in \"Sandman\". As for the Endless themselves, Dream, Death, Delirium and Destiny appear, but their appearances are small and rare. Destiny, perhaps, plays the biggest role in so far as he represents predestination, which Lucifer of course finds \"offensive as a concept\", stating that Lucifer knows Destiny is \"really just a SIDE effect of [Lucifer's] FATHER, or rather, his deterministic APPROACH to the act of creation.\"\n\nCover artists included Duncan Fegredo, Christopher Moeller, and Mike Kaluta. The letters are inconsistent, with the first half of the series carrying particularly established fonts of Gaudium, Michael, and God, only to drop almost all of them, save Lucifer's, towards the end with numerous changes in the letterers.\n\nThe series ended in June 2006 with issue #75 and has thus far been collected in eleven books, with a stand-alone story (\"Lucifer: Nirvana\") published as a smaller graphic novel. The series' parent title, \"The Sandman\", also ran for 75 issues.\n\nWhen Lucifer ventures outside Creation, he sees something resembling the comics pages themselves. In the end of the \"Lucifer\" story arc, God and the devil are no longer part of the universe, and a former human (Elaine Belloc) is instead presiding over it. New concepts for Heaven and Hell are created, inspired and influenced by other human or superhuman characters in the story. The new situation is described on several occasions by the fallen cherubs Gaudium and Spera. In essence, it is \"growing up\", i.e., the need to find one's own truth and values without being directed by parents, elders, teachers, authority figures, etc.\n\nLucifer himself, his whole identity having been forged by that same motive, scoffs at his Father's final offer: to merge their beings (described by God as a potlatch) so that they can finally understand one another's perspective. As this would be the final expression of God's will (even when delivered from \"outside the plan\", as he puts it), Lucifer finds the ultimate expression of his own defiant will by refusing the bargain and travelling beyond his Father's influence into the undefined void.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Lucifer is much more influenced by traditional Christian theology. He is depicted as a malevolent, sadistic, and cunning fallen angel who is the ruler of Hell and seeks to possess human souls. He is held with great respect and fear by the denizens of Hell, who serve and obey him like a king. Lucifer himself, however, is mostly bored with his existence when the group known as the Demon Knights are captured by him during the early Middle Ages, and passes the time by finding small amusements, such as watching the struggles and falls of Etrigan the Demon.\n\nLucifer made a more physical appearance in \"I...Vampire\" #19 after being tipped by John Constantine in destroying Cain. Lucifer immediately sentences Cain and drags him to Hell, though a being claiming to be him has appeared in the Modern Age of DC Comics to the superhero Deadman.\n\nNote: The versions of Lucifer, Michael, Gabriel, Cain and Abel in mainstream New 52 are not of the same continuity as the versions in the previous or later Lucifer comics and are currently noncanonical to the Vertigo Sandman-Lucifer-Hellblazer continuity, in which Lucifer is not ruling Hell and Cain has not been destroyed or banished to Hell. In fact, Cain (restored to his original / New Earth version) appeared in DC's \"Dark Nights Metal\" #2 as a member of the Immortal Men, with his brother Abel. Cain, Abel, Gabriel and Lucifer (the Pre-\"Flashpoint\" versions) currently appear in the Sandman Universe Comics from Vertigo. Cain, Abel, Daniel Hall (Dream), and Lucien also appeared in DCs' Dark Nights Metal in these forms, re-establishing their pre-New 52 incarnations in both DC and Vertigo.\n\nContinuing from where Lucifer left off before New 52 (the New 52 version not being canon to this continuity). As this series begins, God is dead and Gabriel has accused Lucifer of His murder. Lucifer had motive and opportunity, but claims he can prove his innocence. If Gabriel finds the killer and takes the culprit into custody, his sins will be forgotten, and he will be welcomed back into the Silver City. Despite the fact that Lucifer has just opened a nightclub on Earth and is hiding a mysterious wound, the two brothers set off to solve their Father’s murder. Note: This version is not considered canon to the Lucifer comics starting in late 2018. Those will continue from where the Mike Carey continuity ended. and \n\nLucifer is continuously described as a celestial being of incalculable power due to his dominion over the very substance and knowledge of the formation of Creation. He has been cited as one of the most powerful characters in the DC Multiverse. He is one of a few characters to be capable of fully comprehending the Primal Monitor/Monitor-Mind the Overvoid, better known as the canvas paper of the DC franchise, which views the entirety of the franchise as meaningless fiction. Through this understanding, Lucifer can shape the matter and foundation of the creation into anything he can imagine, including matter, energy and more abstract concepts such as time. He once shaped big bang energies released by death of his brother Michael into a new universe. However, he does have certain limitations as he is still a creation of God; chiefly, he cannot create something out of nothing, unlike his Creator or brother. In some ways, this makes him the most disadvantaged, though not the weakest, of the higher angelic host. He needs existing matter (and where that is unavailable, the Demiurgic power of the Archangel Michael or that of God Himself) to provide the foundation for him to shape. In certain dimensions for reasons unknown, he is powerless and his mobility is limited without his wings. He is also not unbeatable as Basanos was able to kill him with probability manipulation. He may choose to temporarily abandon his powers, including his immortality. In the story titled \"Lilith\", it is logically implied that God could destroy him at His own whim, which makes Lucifer sometimes wonder why He has not dealt with him already. He is so dangerous and unpredictable that even Death does not apply to him.\n\nHe is never without the formidable resources of his brilliant intellect and his unbending will or inner strength, which allowed him to defy and confront his Father as well as many other formidable opponents without fear or doubt. Although Lucifer's overt exercise of power is limited in the books, if he is provoked to violence, his preference seems to be to use fire and light as a weapon. His original role was as \"God's lamplighter\", in which he used his will to condense clouds of hydrogen into star-masses and set them alight. As terrifying as they are brief, battles with Lucifer usually begin and end with him drawing down the flames of a super-heated main sequence star and incinerating to ash anything in the immediate area. However, the true reasons why he favors light and fire are partially explained in the story \"Lilith\" (from \"The Wolf Beneath the Tree\").\n\nBeyond his demigodly powers as an archangel, Lucifer possesses the common powers appropriate to an archangel of his position; superhuman strength, superhuman durability, flight, acidic blood (or, rather, he bleeds willpower, as depicted in when he reaches Yggdrasil in \"The Wolf Beneath the Tree\"), a devastating sonic cry, telepathy and the power to speak to and understand animals. As an archangel, his powers are significantly superior to other angels.\n\nIn the New 52 reboot, Lucifer is shown to be significantly less powerful, often using Hell's armies to do his bidding and is susceptible to magic, shown when Excalibur was used to cut off his hand. He has no power over animal souls. He can open and close magical portals to Earth from Hell and back again. He can use this power to either summon or banish demons, as he does with Etrigan. He is clairvoyant, possessing a heightened perception or knowledge of time, even to the extent of being able to know the future.\n\n\nLucifer appears in \"Constantine\", portrayed by Peter Stormare. This film's adaptation of Lucifer wears a pure white suit and has tattoos visible at the sleeves and neckline, implying a full body design, while constantly dripping a black oil from his feet that leaves footprints. John Constantine summons him by slitting his wrists, suicide being a sin, in order to convince Lucifer to stop the Archangel Gabriel and Lucifer's own son Mammon from bringing humanity to its knees with the Spear of Destiny. Lucifer appears, stopping time in the process. Lucifer admonishes Constantine's amateurish suicide attempt by noting how the exorcist can no longer move his fingers properly from cutting too deep. Constantine asserts that Mammon is trying to usurp Lucifer's revenge against God for Mammon's own glory, which finally brings Lucifer's attention to the angel Gabriel. Lucifer reestablishes time, quickly grabbing the woman Mammon possessed, Angela Dodson, and confronting Gabriel. Though Gabriel tries to smite Lucifer with God's power, the demon remains unaffected as God has abandoned Gabriel, allowing Lucifer to both banish Mammon back to Hell and destroy Gabriel's wings. After this, Lucifer returns to Constantine, who had offered his own soul in exchange for Isabel's (Angela's sister who had committed suicide) so that she could be released to Heaven. Seeing it as fair, Lucifer grabs Constantine, but God declares it a selfless sacrifice. Constantine, dying from the slit wrists and suffering from lung cancer, is slowly drawn into a heavenly column of golden light. Furious at his revenge being denied yet again, Lucifer resurrects Constantine by reaching into his chest and pulling the cancer out, thereby giving Constantine the chance to prove his soul belongs in Hell after all.\n\nDC and Fox developed a TV series based on the \"Sandman\" character Lucifer. In February 2015, Fox ordered the pilot. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", the series focuses on Lucifer, \"who is bored and unhappy as the Lord of Hell and resigns his throne and abandons his kingdom for the beauty of Los Angeles, where he gets his kicks helping the LAPD punish criminals.\" \"Californication\" creator Tom Kapinos penned the script, and served as executive producer for the pilot; Len Wiseman directed. Jerry Bruckheimer and Jonathan Littman also served as executive producers. Jerry Bruckheimer Television's KristAnne Reed was on board as a co-executive producer. It was announced that Tom Ellis would portray the main character in the series. In March 2015, Lauren German was cast as the female lead on the series, described as an LAPD homicide detective who is \"repulsed and fascinated\" by Lucifer as they work together to solve a murder. Fox officially picked up the series on May 8 and premiered the series on Monday January 25, 2016. Fox later cancelled the series after 3 seasons on May 11, 2018. However, following the successful campaign \"#SaveLucifer\" which was initiated by fans, the series was picked up by the streaming network Netflix for Season 4, which will consist of ten episodes.\n\n\"Lucifer\", including the \"Sandman Presents\" mini-series and the \"Lucifer: Nirvana\" one-shot, has been collected together into eleven trade paperbacks:\n\n"}

{"id": "19641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19641", "title": "Mass media", "text": "Mass media\n\nThe mass media is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication. The technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets.\n\nBroadcast media transmit information electronically, via such media as film, radio, recorded music, or television. Digital media comprises both Internet and mobile mass communication. Internet media comprise such services as email, social media sites, websites, and Internet-based radio and television. Many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web, by such means as linking to or running TV ads online, or distributing QR Codes in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website. In this way, they can utilise the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords, as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently. Outdoor media transmit information via such media as AR advertising; billboards; blimps; flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes); placards or kiosks placed inside and outside buses, commercial buildings, shops, sports stadiums, subway cars, or trains; signs; or skywriting. Print media transmit information via physical objects, such as books, comics, magazines, newspapers, or pamphlets. Event organizing and public speaking can also be considered forms of mass media.\n\nThe organizations that control these technologies, such as movie studios, publishing companies, and radio and television stations, are also known as the mass media.\n\nIn the late 20th century, mass media could be classified into eight mass media industries: books, the Internet, magazines, movies, newspapers, radio, recordings, and television. The explosion of digital communication technology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries made prominent the question: what forms of media should be classified as \"mass media\"? For example, it is controversial whether to include cell phones, computer games (such as MMORPGs), and video games in the definition. In the 2000s, a classification called the \"seven mass media\" became popular. In order of introduction, they are:\n\n\nEach mass medium has its own content types, creative artists, technicians, and business models. For example, the Internet includes blogs, podcasts, web sites, and various other technologies built atop the general distribution network. The sixth and seventh media, Internet and mobile phones, are often referred to collectively as digital media; and the fourth and fifth, radio and TV, as broadcast media. Some argue that video games have developed into a distinct mass form of media.\n\nWhile a telephone is a two-way communication device, mass media communicates to a large group. In addition, the telephone has transformed into a cell phone which is equipped with Internet access. A question arises whether this makes cell phones a mass medium or simply a device used to access a mass medium (the Internet). There is currently a system by which marketers and advertisers are able to tap into satellites, and broadcast commercials and advertisements directly to cell phones, unsolicited by the phone's user. This transmission of mass advertising to millions of people is another form of mass communication.\n\nVideo games may also be evolving into a mass medium. Video games (for example massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), such as \"RuneScape\") provide a common gaming experience to millions of users across the globe and convey the same messages and ideologies to all their users. Users sometimes share the experience with one another by playing online. Excluding the Internet however, it is questionable whether players of video games are sharing a common experience when they play the game individually. It is possible to discuss in great detail the events of a video game with a friend one has never played with, because the experience is identical to each. The question, then, is whether this is a form of mass communication.\n\nFive characteristics of mass communication have been identified by sociologist John Thompson of Cambridge University:\n\nThe term \"mass media\" is sometimes erroneously used as a synonym for \"mainstream media\". Mainstream media are distinguished from alternative media by their content and point of view. Alternative media are also \"mass media\" outlets in the sense that they use technology capable of reaching many people, even if the audience is often smaller than the mainstream.\n\nIn common usage, the term \"mass\" denotes not that a given number of individuals receives the products, but rather that the products are available in principle to a plurality of recipients.\n\nMass media are distinguished from local media by the notion that whilst mass media aims to reach a very large market, such as the entire population of a country, local media broadcasts to a much smaller population and area, and generally focuses on regional news rather than global events. A third type of media, speciality media, provide for specific demographics, such as specialty channels on TV (sports channels, porn channels, etc.). These definitions are not set in stone, and it is possible for a media outlet to be promoted in status from a local media outlet to a global media outlet. Some local media, which take an interest in state or provincial news, can rise to prominence because of their investigative journalism, and to the local region's preference of updates in national politics rather than regional news. \"The Guardian\", formerly known as the \"Manchester Guardian\", is an example of one such media outlet; once a regional daily newspaper, \"The Guardian\" is currently a nationally respected paper.\n\nThe sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule. With all technological endeavours a number of technical terms and slang have developed. Please see the list of broadcasting terms for a glossary of terms used.\n\nRadio and television programs are distributed over frequency bands that in the United States are highly regulated. Such regulation includes determination of the width of the bands, range, licensing, types of receivers and transmitters used, and acceptable content.\n\nCable television programs are often broadcast simultaneously with radio and television programs, but have a more limited audience. By coding signals and requiring a cable converter box at individual recipients' locations, cable also enables subscription-based channels and pay-per-view services.\n\nA broadcasting organisation may broadcast several programs simultaneously, through several channels (frequencies), for example BBC One and Two. On the other hand, two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day, such as the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim. Digital radio and digital television may also transmit multiplexed programming, with several channels compressed into one ensemble.\n\nWhen broadcasting is done via the Internet the term webcasting is often used. In 2004, a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce podcasting. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium. Adam Curry and his associates, the \"Podshow\", are principal proponents of podcasting.\n\nThe term 'film' encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the field in general. The name comes from the photographic film (also called filmstock), historically the primary medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms for film exist, such as \"motion pictures\" (or just \"pictures\" and \"picture\"), \"the silver screen\", \"photoplays\", \"the cinema\", \"picture shows\", \"flicks\", and most common, \"movies\".\n\nFilms are produced by recording people and objects with cameras, or by creating them using animation techniques or special effects. Films comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown in rapid succession, an illusion of motion is created. Flickering between frames is not seen because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion: a psychological effect identified as beta movement.\n\nFilm is considered by many to be an important art form; films entertain, educate, enlighten, and inspire audiences. Any film can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of dubbing or subtitles that translate the film message. Films are also artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.\n\nA video game is a computer-controlled game in which a video display, such as a monitor or television, is the primary feedback device. The term \"computer game\" also includes games which display only text (and which can, therefore, theoretically be played on a teletypewriter) or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their primary feedback device, but there are very few new games in these categories. There always must also be some sort of input device, usually in the form of button/joystick combinations (on arcade games), a keyboard and mouse/trackball combination (computer games), a controller (console games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input, e.g., the player's motion. Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe.\n\nIn common usage, an \"arcade game\" refers to a game designed to be played in an establishment in which patrons pay to play on a per-use basis. A \"computer game\" or \"PC game\" refers to a game that is played on a personal computer. A \"Console game\" refers to one that is played on a device specifically designed for the use of such, while interfacing with a standard television set. A \"video game\" (or \"videogame\") has evolved into a catchall phrase that encompasses the aforementioned along with any game made for any other device, including, but not limited to, advanced calculators, mobile phones, PDAs, etc.\n\nSound recording and reproduction is the electrical or mechanical re-creation or amplification of sound, often as music. This involves the use of audio equipment such as microphones, recording devices, and loudspeakers. From early beginnings with the invention of the phonograph using purely mechanical techniques, the field has advanced with the invention of electrical recording, the mass production of the 78 record, the magnetic wire recorder followed by the tape recorder, the vinyl LP record. The invention of the compact cassette in the 1960s, followed by Sony's Walkman, gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings, and the invention of digital recording and the compact disc in 1983 brought massive improvements in ruggedness and quality. The most recent developments have been in digital audio players.\n\nAn album is a collection of related audio recordings, released together to the public, usually commercially.\n\nThe term record album originated from the fact that 78 RPM Phonograph disc records were kept together in a book resembling a photo album. The first collection of records to be called an \"album\" was Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker Suite\", release in April 1909 as a four-disc set by Odeon records. It retailed for 16 shillings – about £15 in modern currency.\n\nA music video (also promo) is a short film or video that accompanies a complete piece of music, most commonly a song. Modern music videos were primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. Although the origins of music videos go back much further, they came into their own in the 1980s, when Music Television's format was based on them. In the 1980s, the term \"rock video\" was often used to describe this form of entertainment, although the term has fallen into disuse.\n\nMusic videos can accommodate all styles of filmmaking, including animation, live action films, documentaries, and non-narrative, abstract film.\n\nThe Internet (also known simply as \"the Net\" or less precisely as \"the Web\") is a more interactive medium of mass media, and can be briefly described as \"a network of networks\". Specifically, it is the worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet switching using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and governmental networks, which together carry various information and services, such as email, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web.\n\nContrary to some common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous: the Internet is the system of interconnected \"computer networks\", linked by copper wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless connections etc.; the Web is the contents, or the interconnected \"documents\", linked by hyperlinks and URLs. The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, file sharing and others described below.\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Anyone with a web site has the potential to address a global audience, although serving to high levels of web traffic is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable. Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. \"content\") has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages (in many cases, self-published). The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes. This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralized communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society.\n\n\"Cross-media\" means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels. A similar idea is expressed in the news industry as \"convergence\". Many authors understand cross-media publishing to be the ability to publish in both print and on the web without manual conversion effort. An increasing number of wireless devices with mutually incompatible data and screen formats make it even more difficult to achieve the objective \"create once, publish many\".\n\nThe Internet is quickly becoming the center of mass media. Everything is becoming accessible via the internet. Rather than picking up a newspaper, or watching the 10 o'clock news, people can log onto the internet to get the news they want, when they want it. For example, many workers listen to the radio through the Internet while sitting at their desk.\n\nEven the education system relies on the Internet. Teachers can contact the entire class by sending one e-mail. They may have web pages on which students can get another copy of the class outline or assignments. Some classes have class blogs in which students are required to post weekly, with students graded on their contributions.\n\nBlogging, too, has become a pervasive form of media. A blog is a website, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or interactive media such as images or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order, with most recent posts shown on top. Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images and other graphics, and links to other blogs, web pages, and related media. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting) are part of a wider network of social media. Microblogging is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts.\n\nRSS is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like Wired, news-oriented community sites like Slashdot, and personal blogs. It is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines, and podcasts. An RSS document (which is called a \"feed\" or \"web feed\" or \"channel\") contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner that can be piped into special programs or filtered displays.\n\nA podcast is a series of digital-media files which are distributed over the Internet using syndication feeds for playback on portable media players and computers. The term podcast, like broadcast, can refer either to the series of content itself or to the method by which it is syndicated; the latter is also called podcasting. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster.\n\nMobile phones were introduced in Japan in 1979 but became a mass media only in 1998 when the first downloadable ringing tones were introduced in Finland. Soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones, tablets and other portable devices, and today the total value of media consumed on mobile vastly exceeds that of internet content, and was worth over 31 billion dollars in 2007 (source Informa). The mobile media content includes over 8 billion dollars worth of mobile music (ringing tones, ringback tones, truetones, MP3 files, karaoke, music videos, music streaming services etc.); over 5 billion dollars worth of mobile gaming; and various news, entertainment and advertising services. In Japan mobile phone books are so popular that five of the ten best-selling printed books were originally released as mobile phone books.\n\nSimilar to the internet, mobile is also an interactive media, but has far wider reach, with 3.3 billion mobile phone users at the end of 2007 to 1.3 billion internet users (source ITU). Like email on the internet, the top application on mobile is also a personal messaging service, but SMS text messaging is used by over 2.4 billion people. Practically all internet services and applications exist or have similar cousins on mobile, from search to multiplayer games to virtual worlds to blogs. Mobile has several unique benefits which many mobile media pundits claim make mobile a more powerful media than either TV or the internet, starting with mobile being permanently carried and always connected. Mobile has the best audience accuracy and is the only mass media with a built-in payment channel available to every user without any credit cards or PayPal accounts or even an age limit. Mobile is often called the 7th Mass Medium and either the fourth screen (if counting cinema, TV and PC screens) or the third screen (counting only TV and PC).\n\nA magazine is a periodical publication containing a variety of articles, generally financed by advertising or purchase by readers.\n\nMagazines are typically published weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly or quarterly, with a date on the cover that is in advance of the date it is actually published. They are often printed in color on coated paper, and are bound with a soft cover.\n\nMagazines fall into two broad categories: consumer magazines and business magazines. In practice, magazines are a subset of , distinct from those periodicals produced by scientific, artistic, academic or special interest publishers which are subscription-only, more expensive, narrowly limited in circulation, and often have little or no advertising.\n\nMagazines can be classified as:\n\nA newspaper is a publication containing news and information and advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called newsprint. It may be general or special interest, most often published daily or weekly. The most important function of newspapers is to inform the public of significant events. Local newspapers inform local communities and include advertisements from local businesses and services, while national newspapers tend to focus on a theme, which can be exampled with \"The Wall Street Journal\" as they offer news on finance and business related-topics. The first printed newspaper was published in 1605, and the form has thrived even in the face of competition from technologies such as radio and television. Recent developments on the Internet are posing major threats to its business model, however. Paid circulation is declining in most countries, and advertising revenue, which makes up the bulk of a newspaper's income, is shifting from print to online; some commentators, nevertheless, point out that historically new media such as radio and television did not entirely supplant existing.\n\nThe internet has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. According to the World Trends Report, between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. Most notably, between 2012 and 2016, India’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.\n\nOutdoor media is a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards placed inside and outside commercial buildings/objects like shops/buses, flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes), blimps, skywriting, AR Advertising. Many commercial advertisers use this form of mass media when advertising in sports stadiums. Tobacco and alcohol manufacturers used billboards and other outdoor media extensively. However, in 1998, the Master Settlement Agreement between the US and the tobacco industries prohibited the billboard advertising of cigarettes. In a 1994 Chicago-based study, Diana Hackbarth and her colleagues revealed how tobacco- and alcohol-based billboards were concentrated in poor neighbourhoods. In other urban centers, alcohol and tobacco billboards were much more concentrated in African-American neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.\n\nMass media encompasses much more than just news, although it is sometimes misunderstood in this way. It can be used for various purposes:\n\nJournalism is the discipline of collecting, analyzing, verifying and presenting information regarding current events, trends, issues and people. Those who practice journalism are known as journalists.\n\nNews-oriented journalism is sometimes described as the \"first rough draft of history\" (attributed to Phil Graham), because journalists often record important events, producing news articles on short deadlines. While under pressure to be first with their stories, news media organizations usually edit and proofread their reports prior to publication, adhering to each organization's standards of accuracy, quality and style. Many news organizations claim proud traditions of holding government officials and institutions accountable to the public, while media critics have raised questions about holding the press itself accountable to the standards of professional journalism.\n\nPublic relations is the art and science of managing communication between an organization and its key publics to build, manage and sustain its positive image. Examples include:\n\nPublishing is the industry concerned with the production of literature or information – the activity of making information available for public view. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers.\n\nTraditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as books and newspapers. With the advent of digital information systems and the Internet, the scope of publishing has expanded to include websites, blogs, and the like.\n\nAs a business, publishing includes the development, marketing, production, and distribution of newspapers, magazines, books, literary works, musical works, software, other works dealing with information.\n\nPublication is also important as a legal concept; (1) as the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to marry or enter bankruptcy, and; (2) as the essential precondition of being able to claim defamation; that is, the alleged libel must have been published.\n\nA software publisher is a publishing company in the software industry between the developer and the distributor. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be combined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of shareware).\n\nSoftware publishers often license software from developers with specific limitations, such as a time limit or geographical region. The terms of licensing vary enormously, and are typically secret.\n\nDevelopers may use publishers to reach larger or foreign markets, or to avoid focussing on marketing. Or publishers may use developers to create software to meet a market need that the publisher has identified.\n\nA YouTuber is anyone who has made their fame from creating and promoting videos on the public video-sharing site, YouTube. Many YouTube celebrities have made a profession from their site through sponsorships, advertisements, product placement, and network support.\n\nThe history of mass media can be traced back to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures. This was the first time when a form of media was \"broadcast\" to a wider audience. The first dated printed book known is the \"Diamond Sutra\", printed in China in 868 AD, although it is clear that books were printed earlier. Movable clay type was invented in 1041 in China. However, due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in China, and the relatively high cost of paper there, the earliest printed mass-medium was probably European popular prints from about 1400. Although these were produced in huge numbers, very few early examples survive, and even most known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived. The term \"mass media\" was coined with the creation of print media, which is notable for being the first example of mass media, as we use the term today. This form of media started in Europe in the Middle Ages.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation. He printed the first book, a Latin Bible, on a printing press with movable type in 1453. The invention of the printing press gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication, by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible. The invention also transformed the way the world received printed materials, although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass-medium for at least a century after that. Newspapers developed from about 1612, with the first example in English in 1620; but they took until the 19th century to reach a mass-audience directly. The first high-circulation newspapers arose in London in the early 1800s, such as The Times, and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses, and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas. The increase in circulation, however, led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership, making newspapers a more one-way medium.\n\nThe phrase \"the media\" began to be used in the 1920s. The notion of \"mass media\" was generally restricted to print media up until the post-Second World War, when radio, television and video were introduced. The audio-visual facilities became very popular, because they provided both information and entertainment, because the colour and sound engaged the viewers/listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch TV or listen to the radio than to actively read. In recent times, the Internet become the latest and most popular mass medium. Information has become readily available through websites, and easily accessible through search engines. One can do many activities at the same time, such as playing games, listening to music, and social networking, irrespective of location. Whilst other forms of mass media are restricted in the type of information they can offer, the internet comprises a large percentage of the sum of human knowledge through such things as Google Books. Modern day mass media includes the internet, mobile phones, blogs, podcasts and RSS feeds.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the growth of mass media was driven by technology, including that which allowed much duplication of material. Physical duplication technologies such as printing, record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. Radio and television allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could make money. An example of Riel and Neil's theory. proportional to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, unit costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were to be made in mass media. In a democratic society, the media can serve the electorate about issues regarding government and corporate entities (see Media influence). Some consider the concentration of media ownership to be a threat to democracy.\n\nBetween 1985 and 2018 about 76,720 deals have been announced in the Media industry. This sums up to an overall value of around 5,634 bil USD. There have been three major waves of M&A in the Mass Media Sector (2000, 2007 and 2015), while the most active year in terms of numbers was 2007 with around 3,808 deals. The U.S. is the most prominent country in Media M&A with 41 of the top 50 deals having an acquiror from the United States.\n\nThe largest deal in history was the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online Inc for 164,746.86 mil USD.\n\nLimited-effects theory, originally tested in the 1940s and 1950s, considers that because people usually choose what media to interact with based on what they already believe, media exerts a negligible influence. Class-dominant theory argues that the media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite, which controls it. Culturalist theory, which was developed in the 1980s and 1990s, combines the other two theories and claims that people interact with media to create their own meanings out of the images and messages they receive. This theory states that audience members play an active, rather than passive role in relation to mass media.\nIn an article entitled \"Mass Media Influence on Society\", rayuso argues that the media \"in the US\" is dominated by five major companies (Time Warner, VIACOM, Vivendi Universal, Walt Disney and News Corp) which own 95% of all mass media including theme parks, movie studios, television and radio broadcast networks and programing, video news, sports entertainment, telecommunications, wireless phones, video games software, electronic media and music companies. Whilst historically, there was more diversity in companies, they have recently merged to form an elite which have the power to shape the opinion and beliefs of people. People buy after seeing thousands of advertisements by various companies in TV, newspapers or magazines, which are able to affect their purchasing decisions. The definition of what is acceptable by society is dictated by the media. This power can be used for good, for example encouraging children to play sport. However, it can also be used for bad, for example children being influenced by cigars smoked by film stars, their exposure to sex images, their exposure to images of violence and their exposure to junk food ads. The documentary \"Super Size Me\" describes how companies like McDonald's have been sued in the past, the plaintiffs claiming that it was the fault of their liminal and subliminal advertising that \"forced\" them to purchase the product. The Barbie and Ken dolls of the 1950s are sometimes cited as the main cause for the obsession in modern-day society for women to be skinny and men to be buff. After the attacks of 9/11, the media gave extensive coverage of the event and exposed Osama Bin Laden's guilt for the attack, information they were told by the authorities. This shaped the public opinion to support the war on terrorism, and later, the war on Iraq. A main concern is that due to this immense power of the mass media (being able to drive the public opinion), media receiving inaccurate information could cause the public opinion to support the wrong cause.\n\nIn his book The Commercialization of American Culture, Matthew P. McAllister says that \"a well-developed media system, informing and teaching its citizens, helps democracy move toward its ideal state.\"\n\nIn 1997, J. R. Finnegan Jr. and K. Viswanath identified 3 main effects or functions of mass media:\n\nSince the 1950s, when cinema, radio and TV began to be the primary or the only source of information for a larger and larger percentage of the population, these media began to be considered as central instruments of mass control. Up to the point that it emerged the idea that when a country has reached a high level of industrialization, the country itself \"belongs to the person who controls communications.\"\n\nMass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues, both through the information that is dispensed through them, and through the interpretations they place upon this information. They also play a large role in shaping modern culture, by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs, values, and traditions (an entire way of life), as reality. That is, by portraying a certain interpretation of reality, they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation. Mass media also play a crucial role in the spread of civil unrest activities such as anti-government demonstrations, riots, and general strikes. That is, the use of radio and television receivers has made the unrest influence among cities not only by the geographic location of cities, but also by proximity within the mass media distribution networks.\n\nMass media sources, through theories like framing and agenda-setting, can affect the scope of a story as particular facts and information are highlighted (Media influence). This can directly correlate with how individuals may perceive certain groups of people, as the only media coverage a person receives can be very limited and may not reflect the whole story or situation; stories are often covered to reflect a particular perspective to target a specific demographic.\n\nAccording to Stephen Balkaran, an Instructor of Political Science and African American Studies at Central Connecticut State University, mass media has played a large role in the way white Americans perceive African-Americans. The media focus on African-American in the contexts of crime, drug use, gang violence, and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a distorted and harmful public perception of African-Americans. African-Americans have been subjected to oppression and discrimination for the past few hundred years. According to Stephen Balkaran in his article \"Mass Media and Racism\": \"The media has played a key role in perpetuating the effects of this historical oppression and in contributing to African-Americans' continuing status as second-class citizens\". This has resulted in an uncertainty among white Americans as to what the genuine nature of African-Americans really is. Despite the resulting racial divide, the fact that these people are undeniably American has \"raised doubts about the white man's value system\". This means that there is a somewhat \"troubling suspicion\" among some Americans that their white America is tainted by the black influence. Mass media as well as propaganda tend to reinforce or introduce stereotypes to the general public.\n\nLack of local or specific topical focus is a common criticism of mass media. A mass news media outlet is often forced to cover national and international news due to it having to cater for and be relevant for a wide demographic. As such, it has to skip over many interesting or important local stories because they simply do not interest the large majority of their viewers. An example given by the website WiseGeek is that \"the residents of a community might view their fight against development as critical, but the story would only attract the attention of the mass media if the fight became controversial or if precedents of some form were set\".\n\nThe term \"mass\" suggests that the recipients of media products constitute a vast sea of passive, undifferentiated individuals. This is an image associated with some earlier critiques of \"mass culture\" and mass society which generally assumed that the development of mass communication has had a largely negative impact on modern social life, creating a kind of bland and homogeneous culture which entertains individuals without challenging them. However, interactive digital media have also been seen to challenge the read-only paradigm of earlier broadcast media.\n\nWhilst some refer to the mass media as \"opiate of the masses\", others argue that is a vital aspect of human societies. By understanding mass media, one is then able to analyse and find a deeper understanding of one's population and culture. This valuable and powerful ability is one reason why the field of media studies is popular. As WiseGeek says, \"watching, reading, and interacting with a nation's mass media can provide clues into how people think, especially if a diverse assortment of mass media sources are perused\".\n\nSince the 1950s, in the countries that have reached a high level of industrialization, the mass media of cinema, radio and TV have a key role in political power.\n\nContemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of concentration of media ownership, with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms.\n\nCriticism\n\nWhen the study of mass media began the media was compiled of only mass media which is a very different media system than the social media empire of the 21st-century experiences. With this in mind, there are critiques that mass media no longer exists, or at least that it doesn't exist in the same form as it once did. This original form of mass media put filters on what the general public would be exposed to in regards to \"news\" something that is harder to do in a society of social media.\n\nTheorist Lance Bennett explains that excluding a few major events in recent history, it is uncommon for a group big enough to be labeled a mass, to be watching the same news via the same medium of mass production. Bennett's critique of 21st Century mass media argues that today it is more common for a group of people to be receiving different news stories, from completely different sources, and thus, mass media has been re-invented. As discussed above, filters would have been applied to original mass medias when the journalists decided what would or wouldn't be printed.\n\nSocial Media is a large contributor to the change from mass media to a new paradigm because through social media what is mass communication and what is interpersonal communication is confused. Interpersonal/niche communication is an exchange of information and information in a specific genre. In this form of communication, smaller groups of people are consuming news/information/opinions. In contrast, mass media in its original form is not restricted by genre and it is being consumed by the masses.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the editor of the anthology of hip hop, poetry and art, \"Poets for Palestine\" (2008), the author of two collections of poetry, \"Poetic Injustice: Writings on Resistance and Palestine\" (2011) and \"Before the Next Bomb Drops: Rising Up From Brooklyn to Palestine\" (2015). His political commentary has been featured by news outlets throughout the world, including the \"New York Times\", \"Salon\", Al Jazeera English, and BBC Radio. He has appeared in the Palestine Festival of Literature as well as Poetry International. He is a Lannan Residency Fellow and is on the advisory committee for the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.\n\nKanazi is the son of Palestinian refugees who fled Palestine before the state of Israel was established in 1948.\n\nInspired by underground hip hop, Def Poetry Jam on Broadway, and the work of artists like Suheir Hammad and Carlos Andres Gomez, Kanazi began writing spoken word. \nKanazi writes and performs political poetry addressing topics such as human rights, Palestine, Iraq, and islamophobia. Approaching his work from a humanist perspective, Kanazi says, \"This isn’t about me being a Palestinian or me being an Arab. It’s about a system of oppression and what’s being done to a people. So whether you’re talking about police brutality or the US-Mexico border or Afghanistan or the war in Iraq or the plight of Palestinians, what they’re going through and the injustice that’s being perpetrated against them is what matters. And that’s what we’re working against – systems of oppression [...].\"\n\nKanazi is the editor of \"Poets for Palestine\" (Al Jisser Group, August 2008), a collection of hip hop, poetry and art featuring Palestinian poets such as Suheir Hammad, Nathalie Handal, Fady Joudah, Annemarie Jacir, Mahmoud Darwish, Naomi Shihab and Kanazi himself, as well as African American poets Patricia Smith and Amiri Baraka. In 2011, Kanazi came out with his first collection, \"Poetic Injustice: Writings on Resistance and Palestine\", a volume of poetry including a CD; he has also been a writer in residence and an advisory board member for the Palestine Writing Workshop, teaching spoken word poetry to youngsters in Palestine. He has appeared on Al Jazeera English and BBC Radio and has toured North America, the UK, and the Middle East, with appearances at the Palestine Festival of Literature and at Poetry International. Kanazi is also on the organizing committee of the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel. His website is PoeticInjustice.net.\n\n The Pulitzer Prize winner Chris Hedges has commented positively about Kanazi's poetry, saying, \"There is more truth, and perhaps finally more news, in Remi Kanazi's poems than the pages of your daily newspaper.\" His poetry was similarly praised by the South African former minister Ronnie Kasrils, who considered it \"a shining example of tomorrow's Palestine.\" Novelist and Booker Prize winner John Berger has described Kanazi as \"a voice which refuses to be silenced\".\n\nIn 2016, when Kanazi was on a tour of campuses promoting his latest book \"Before the Next Bomb Drops: Rising Up From Brooklyn to Palestine\", Israel on Campus Coalition (ICC) ran a covert campaign against him. ICC had professional setting up Facebook groups, pretending to be students. Both before Kanazi's meeting at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and San Jose State University such groups appeared.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a staple of Doug Henning's stage and television shows.\n\nA large transparent bowl is placed on a pedestal along with three small piles of colored sand. The bowl is filled with water, often with the magician drinking some or providing it to an audience member to demonstrate it is simply normal water. Stirring the water with their hand, the water turns murky or black. The colored sands are then poured into the bowl and stirred by hand. With a flourish, the magician reaches into the bowl to pull out each color of sand, separate and unmixed. With a last stir, the water turns clear again, with a few stray grains of sand left in it.\n\nThe trick uses simple chemistry for all of its effects.\n\nThe change of color from clear to opaque and back can be accomplished using any number of simple chemical reactions. Almost any acid/base invisible ink formula will work, with common examples being iodine which goes clear with sodium metabisulfite, or a mixture of tannic acid and ferric ammonium sulfate which turns clear with oxalic acid. In both cases, the chemicals are introduced during the pour, often using multiple containers with only the first being pure water, or using any number of simple gadgets like a false thumb to store them during setup.\n\nThe sand is treated with a hydrophobic compound to produce what is commonly known as magic sand or Moon Sand. When poured into water, it naturally clings to other grains, forming piles or lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The sand can be poured rapidly in a spray and will still re-form, adding to the illusion of it mixing into the water. The hand-stirring performed after pouring will leave these piles intact. The magician can then reach into the bowl and feel out the piles, grasping some of the sand and tossing it into the air. Water has been excluded from the piles, leaving the sand completely dry and free-flowing.\n"}
{"id": "50132583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50132583", "title": "Scriptnotes", "text": "Scriptnotes\n\nScriptnotes is a weekly podcast that began airing on August 30, 2011. It is billed as \"a podcast about screenwriting, and things that are interesting to screenwriters.\" The podcast is hosted by screenwriters John August and Craig Mazin, with new episodes released every Tuesday.\n\nThe podcast has featured appearances from many notable people in the world of film and TV, including Rian Johnson, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (the showrunners of \"Game of Thrones\"), Aline Brosh McKenna, Dana Fox, Rachel Bloom, Jennifer Lee, Riki Lindhome, Natasha Leggero, Alec Berg, Kelly Marcel, Rawson Marshall Thurber, Richard Kelly, Chris Nee, Malcolm Spellman, David Wain, and Jason Bateman.\n\n\"Scriptnotes\" episodes are available for free up to 20 weeks after their initial airing. Back episode archives and bonus episodes are available to premium subscribers at scriptnotes.net. Transcripts of all back episodes are available for free, and are usually posted within one week of the episode's initial airing.\n\nAugust, who had been writing his popular eponymous screenwriting blog since 2003, developed an interest in podcasting and its potential to extend the work he had been doing to help the screenwriting community. He approached Mazin via email in June 2011 with the idea of producing a screenwriting podcast together. Despite being largely unfamiliar with the medium, Mazin agreed out of a desire to talk about screenwriting without writing about it, as he had been doing for a number of years on his blog, The Artful Writer. The inaugural episode of the podcast was released 30 August 2011.\n\nAspiring screenwriters are encouraged to send in three pages of their screenplay - almost always the first three - to be critiqued. The scripts vary widely in tone, style and genre. Links to the screenplays are provided in the show notes so listeners can read them and then listen to the critique. Typically three are tackled in one show. Those that have had their screenplays subjected to August and Mazin's critical eyes have typically thanked them from the feedback, which has ranged from congratulatory to despairing. The three-page challenge is a particularly useful segment for screenwriters as it provides sharp insights into unproduced screenplays; lessons easily applied to a writer's own project. The segment was first announced with a call for submissions in episode 45 and the first critiques debuted the next week in episode 46.\n\nOne Cool Thing is a weekly segment that occurs at the end of each episode. August, Mazin and their guests will each give a plug to something or someone they deem cool. The cool things vary greatly. The segment dates back to May 2012, when August officially started it at the end of episode 35. Since then he has been a faithful participant. Mazin's participation was suspect for a time, most notably during a six-week stretch that began in August 2012, but since then he has overcome his umbrage-tinted glasses and regularly found something in the world worth praising every week.\n\nIn this newer segment of the show, August and Mazin pull a few current stories from the news and discuss if and how those stories could be adapted into feature films. The discussion often includes brainstorming possible genres and approaches a perspective writer could take with the story, discussing how to collapse or expand the details of the story to fit a feature film, and determining which of the week's stories, if any, have any serious potential as a future film. The segment debuted in episode 201, when the stories included scandals in FIFA, the Large Hadron Collider, and sexual assault on college campuses.\n\nA number of episodes have been dedicated to deep dive analyses of individual films. The first such episode, in January 2013, featured \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Subsequent episodes have looked at \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Frozen\", \"Groundhog Day\", \"Ghost\", \"Unforgiven\" and \"The Addams Family\".\n\nThe podcast has a number of recurring themes, particularly in how the hosts interact with one another.\n\nAt the beginning of every podcast, August uses a 'straight' introduction, while Mazin uses a silly or mechanical voice.\n\nMazin tells anecdotes about himself that emphasize how he is lazy, unprepared, and frequently late. In contrast, August appears productive, organized, and punctual.\n\nIn line with their personas of Mazin being the lazy one and August being the organized one, plus knowledgeable about technology, Mazin mocks August by calling him a robot. This includes accusations that August has no emotions and no heart.\n\nMazin is the more emotionally expressive of the two podcasts hosts. When Mazin delivers impassioned speeches, August will typically agree with Mazin on content and then transition into the next item on the agenda. Because of August's focus on pacing and transitions during the show, Mazin has christened August \"Segue Man.\"\n\nFor five years up to episode 259, Stuart Friedel was August's assistant, and the producer and original editor of the podcast. With the exception of episode 259, Friedel's voice was never heard on the podcast. The hosts would frequently talk about him, and the work that he did for the show, including reading and selecting scripts for the Three Page Challenge.\n\nDavid Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the showrunners of HBO's fantasy drama \"Game of Thrones\", appeared on a live version of the podcast in February 2016. They spoke about the poor reception to the show's original pilot episode, and how it was largely reshot following a screening of the episode to Mazin and other screenwriters.\n\nOn episode 129, August and Mazin welcomed Final Draft CEO and co-founder Marc Madnick and then-product manager Joe Jarvis. Their visit was in response to negative comments made about the software on previous episodes of Scriptnotes, and came out of Madnick's desire to discuss what he perceived as misconceptions about both the software and the company.\n\nInstead, Madnick offered a revealing look into—as described by the Accidental Tech Podcast—the company's shortcomings, management's apparent feeling that they should make \"[their] problems your problems,\" and the \"severe technical debt\" Final Draft has ignored for far too long, resulting in out of date, difficult to update, and unnecessarily expensive software.\n\nIn response to the episode's controversy, filmmaker and software developer Kent Tessman pointed out that a possible reason many of Madnick's excuses were met with pushback is that, simply, \"there might be technical people listening\".\n\nAs part of Scriptnotes's 2014 Summer Superhero Spectacular live show, August and Mazin played a game with guests Andrea Berloff, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely and David S. Goyer. Each was randomly assigned a superhero and asked how they would adapt the character for TV or film.\n\nTalking about She-Hulk, Goyer said:\n\nI have a theory about She-Hulk. Which was created by a man, right? And at the time in particular I think 95% of comic book readers were men and certainly almost all of the comic book writers were men. So the Hulk was this classic male power fantasy. It’s like, most of the people reading comic books were these people like me who were just these little kids getting the shit kicked out of them every day... And so then they created She-Huk, right? Who was still smart... I think She-Hulk is the chick that you could fuck if you were Hulk, you know what I’m saying? ... She-Hulk was the extension of the male power fantasy. So it’s like if I’m going to be this geek who becomes the Hulk then let’s create a giant green porn star that only the Hulk could fuck.\n\nThe day after the episode's release, Alan Kistler of The Mary Sue wrote about these comments as well as Goyer's take on Martian Manhunter. His summation:\n\nSo to recap. She-Hulk is just a sex power fantasy rather than a character with agency who from the beginning went down a different path than her cousin, The Hulk. Martian Manhunter being the last survivor of a race which died out on Mars over a thousand years ago is goofy, but putting him Area 51 and using the same plot as many alien visitor movies is not. And God forbid superheroes embrace some goofiness and absurdity.\n\nThis prompted Michael Cavana from The Washington Post's Comic Riffs to reach out to She-Hulk co-creator Stan Lee for a response.\n\nWhen Lee, as writer, co-created She-Hulk with artist John Buscema (the character debuted in February of 1980, in Savage She-Hulk #1), he was absolutely focused on his gamma-green superheroine having brains. Lee tells The Post’s Comic Riffs this evening, in response to Goyer’s words: “I know I was looking for a new female superhero, and the idea of an intelligent Hulk-type grabbed me.”\n\nDuring his freshman year at Princeton University, Mazin was roommates with future junior U.S. Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz. Mazin has been open about his dislike for Cruz, and on episode 113 said:\n\nAnd, you know, I want to be clear, because Ted Cruz is a nightmare of a human being. I have plenty of problems with his politics, but truthfully his personality is so awful that ninety-nine percent of why I hate him is just his personality. If he agreed with me on every issue, I would hate him only one percent less.\n\nMazin's comment has since been picked up by The Daily Show, The Huffington Post, Texas Monthly, The Telegraph, The Sun Times, and more.\n\nMazin does not hold back on his disdain for Carson Reeves and his Scriptshadow blog, which reviews both professional and amateur scripts, including one of August's rewrites of a possible tentpole movie for 20th Century Fox. Per August, though the review was positive, the studio went 'ballistic' and it was taken down. Mazin broached the topic again on episode 186 (March 3, 2015), citing Reeves' negative review of the \"Birdman\" screenplay as an example of why Reeves' opinions are misplaced, unnecessary and unwelcome, considering \"Birdman\" went on to win six Oscars at the 2015 ceremony, including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.\n\nMazin broached the topic a third time on episode 291 (March 07/2017) after Reeves called out 2017 Oscar winners \"Moonlight\" (Best Adapted Screenplay), and \"Manchester By The Sea\" (Best Original Screenplay) as terrible screenplays that any of the 10,000 WGA members could have scripted. Mazin's issue was that Reeves should have written them himself if that's the case, then went on to call Reeves an 'idiot' suffering 'delusions of grandeur' since Reeves had expressed his views on a public blog and not in a private conversation.\n\nLive events for the podcast have been sponsored by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Austin Film Festival, and the Writers Guild Foundation.

{"id": "8608590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8608590", "title": "Skins (UK TV series)", "text": "Skins (UK TV series)\n\nSkins is a British teen drama television series that follows the lives of a group of teenagers in Bristol, South West England, through the two years of sixth form. Its controversial story-lines have explored issues like dysfunctional families, mental illness (such as depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder), adolescent sexuality, gender, substance abuse, death and bullying. Each episode generally focuses on a particular character and the struggles they face in their life. The episodes are named after the featured character. The show was created by father-and-son television writers Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain for Company Pictures, and premiered on E4 on 25 January 2007. \"Skins\" went on to be a critical success as well as a ratings winner.\n\nOver its initial six-year run, \"Skins\" proved to be atypical of ongoing drama series in that it replaced its primary cast every two years. Plans for a film spin-off were first discussed in 2009, but ultimately did not come to fruition. Instead, a specially-commissioned seventh and final series of the show was broadcast in 2013, featuring some of the cast from its 2007–2010 run. The show's name comes from the cigarette rolling papers known as \"skins\".\n\nOther ventures to expand the brand have included a short-lived North American remake, which aired on MTV in 2011, but was cancelled after one season after advertisers abandoned the series in response to low ratings and the significant controversy which arose over its depiction of teen sexuality.\n\nCo-creator Bryan Elsley recalls his first conversation with his son Jamie Brittain, soon to be co-creator, that led to the creation of the popular and edgy show. Jamie Brittain critiqued many of his father's other ideas for a TV series. He started with the idea that being a teenager co-existed with poor behavior, casual sex, and experimenting with drugs and alcohol. Most shows with teenagers pretended that these things didn't happen especially involving consequences, which this show also lays bare. Bryan Elsley has been defending his controversial show for years. His philosophy explored how teenagers believe adults act in corrupted ways, which explains why all the adults in the show appear to be crooked, in poor relationships, swearing, and overall poor parents. Skins explores the world of teenagers in a way that many other shows don't.\n\nTony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) is an attractive, intelligent and popular boy. His manipulative ways often go unnoticed by many, and are a catalyst for the majority of the events in the series. Sid Jenkins (Mike Bailey) is Tony's best friend and has an entirely opposite personality. He lacks confidence, is socially uneasy and struggles with school work. Tony's girlfriend is Michelle Richardson (April Pearson), a girl who can never stay angry at his mischievous behaviour for long. Outwardly, Michelle appears shallow, vain and conceited, but she works hard, has a strong interest in French and Spanish, and is very emotionally mature. She is friends with Cassie Ainsworth (Hannah Murray), an eccentric girl who suffers from an eating disorder. Cassie attempts to hide her own struggles with mental health while her flamboyant parents ignore her in favour of their new baby.\n\nChris Miles (Joe Dempsie) is the party animal of the group. He has a difficult home life; he lost his brother to a hereditary subarachnoid haemorrhage at a young age, and is living alone due to his ambivalent father and absent mother. He has a crush on his psychology teacher Angie (Siwan Morris). Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson) is a sensible girl with a talent for playing the clarinet. Her runaway mother has left Jal with her famous musician father and aspiring rapper brothers. She is best friends with Michelle. Maxxie Oliver (Mitch Hewer) is openly gay and has a passion for dance. He is portrayed as attractive, seductive and talented, and is well accepted by most of his friends and family. His best friend Anwar Kharral (Dev Patel) has a slightly off-the-wall personality and is known for his silly antics and sense of humour. While he takes a pick-and-choose approach to Islam, and has no qualms about indulging in premarital sex and usage of alcohol and drugs in spite of his religion's policies against them, he has some difficulty fully accepting Maxxie's sexuality. Appearing only in the second series, Lucy, better known as \"Sketch\" (Aimee-Ffion Edwards), is a quiet and scheming Welsh girl who is polite yet unnerving. Living two buildings over and having a clear view of his room, she develops an obsession for Maxxie and becomes his stalker. Without her father, she is a young carer for her mother Sheila, who suffers from multiple sclerosis.\n\nAs well as the regular cast, there are several important recurring characters. Effy Stonem (Kaya Scodelario) is Tony's younger sister, and shares many of her brother's qualities. She is mysterious and manipulative, and selectively mute during the first series; she regularly breaks the fourth wall. Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat) is an upper class school girl with sociopathic tendencies, and one of Tony's many sexual conquests. \"Posh\" Kenneth (Daniel Kaluuya) goes to the same college as the main cast and often spends time with the boys. Madison \"Mad\" Twatter (Stephen Walters) features as Sid's emergency drug dealer, Doug (Giles Thomas) is a senior teacher at Roundview College, and British comedian and co-writer Josie Long appears as the college's careers counsellor.\n\nThe central cast's parents are often played by well-known British actors credited in a guest starring role. Harry Enfield and Morwenna Banks act as Tony and Effy's parents, Jim and Anthea Stonem. Peter Capaldi and Josie Lawrence act as Sid's parents, Mark and Liz Jenkins. Arabella Weir acts as Michelle's mother, Anna Richardson, and Danny Dyer as her stepfather, Malcolm. Neil Morrissey and Naomi Allisstone act as Cassie's parents, Marcus and Margeritte Ainsworth. Mark Monero acts as Jal's father, Ronny Fazer, and (Josette Simon) as her estranged mother, Elaine. Inder Manocha and Nina Wadia act as Anwar's parents, Istiak and Bibi Kharral. Bill Bailey and Fiona Allen act as Maxxie's parents, Walter and Jackie Oliver. Mark Heap acts as Chris' estranged father, Graham Miles, and Sarah Lancashire as his stepmother, Mary Jane.\n\nEffy Stonem (Kaya Scodelario), Tony's younger sister, becomes the principal character in the second generation. Effy is pretty, popular, but also quiet and distant, attempting to keep her own troubles hidden. Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell) is her friend, having appeared for the first time in a second series episode. She is innocent to the sexual and narcotic world in which Effy indulges, but is ready and willing to explore it. Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) is an immigrant from DR Congo, with a morally upright outlook and good-hearted nature, and his storyline sees him becoming romantically involved with Pandora.\n\nJames Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie McClair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) have been best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, he is also boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of the events in the series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more sensible and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, but he knows Cook and Freddie will always take care of him. He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.\n\nKatie (Megan Prescott) and Emily Fitch (Kathryn Prescott) are very different identical twin sisters. Katie thinks of herself as something of a WAG and wants to usurp Effy's place as queen bee of the group. Katie's homophobic attitudes cause problems between them, as Emily comes to terms with her homosexuality. The quieter of the two, Emily is used to being in her sister's shadow, and is sulky but perceptive. She tends to not stand out in a crowd due to her insecurities, but later grows out within the show. She is in love with Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless), a fiery, politically charged and passionate young woman with idealistic views and an abundance of ambition. Emily also develops a good friendship with JJ, becoming close confidantes to one another.\n\nOther characters include Klariza Clayton as Karen McClair, Freddie's older sister, who is desperate to become famous, Mackenzie Crook as Johnny White, a psychotic Bristol gangster, with comedians Jordan Long and Justin Edwards as his inept henchmen, and Ardal O'Hanlon as the gang's careless college tutor, Kieran MacFoeinaiugh (pronounced Mac-Phew). Chris Addison appears as Roundview College's new headmaster, David Blood, Will Young as a school counsellor, Pauline Quirke as the detective investigating Sophia's suicide, and Georgia Henshaw as Lara, JJ's new girlfriend.\n\nAs with the first generation, the central cast's parents are played by established British comedic actors. Harry Enfield and Morwenna Banks return as Effy's parents, Jim and Anthea Stonem, with Banks' real life partner David Baddiel appearing as Jim's colleague whom Anthea has an affair with. Sally Phillips acts as Pandora's mother, Angela Moon. Simon Day acts as Freddie's father, Leo McClair. Olivia Colman acts as Naomi's mother, Gina Campbell. Juliet Cowan and Douglas Hodge act as JJ's parents, Celia and Edward Jones. Ronni Ancona and John Bishop act as Katie and Emily's parents, Jenna and Rob Fitch. Matt King and Tanya Franks act as Cook's estranged parents, Cook Sr., and Ruth Byatt. Maureen Lipman also stars as Pandora's auntie, Elizabeth, and Dudley Sutton as Freddie's grandfather, Norman.\n\nFranky Fitzgerald (Dakota Blue Richards) is seen as an outsider, having arrived to her first year at Roundview three weeks late upon moving to Bristol from Oxford. She is intelligent and creative, but is seen by others as strange, and is ostracised largely due to her androgynous dress sense. Alo Creevey (Will Merrick), something of an optimist, loves his dog and his van foremost. He is best friends with Rich Hardbeck (Alex Arnold), a boy from a very middle-class home who immerses himself in heavy metal subculture. He uses musical elitism as a means to cover up his own shyness when, among other things, interacting with girls.\n\nMini McGuinness (Freya Mavor), Liv Malone (Laya Lewis), and Grace Blood (Jessica Sula) have been best friends since childhood. By the time Franky arrives, image-conscious Mini has already established herself as Roundview's new \"queen bee\". She obscures her own insecurities (such as her body image, and her virginity), and is cruel to Franky and others. Of her two friends, Liv is the more devoted to Mini, and is more worldly and sexually voracious. By contrast, Grace—sweet, kind, and positive in her outlook—begins to disassociate herself from Mini after seeing Franky's example, and in the first episode establishes a friendship with outsiders Franky, Alo and Rich. Mini's boyfriend is Nick Levan (Sean Teale). His popularity makes him something of a status symbol for Mini, but his feelings for her are shallow and uncomplicated. His brother Matty (Sebastian de Souza) has strained relationships with his family, engages in criminal behaviour, and lives rough following an altercation with their father. In series six, the group befriend Alex Henley (Sam Jackson), who is gay and in particular forms a close friendship with Liv.\n\nGiles Thomas returns as Doug, Roundview's deputy headmaster as does comedian Chris Addison for a second and third year as headmaster David Blood. Josie Long returns in series six, once again as guidance counselor Josie. Gordon Kennedy plays English teacher Alan Precopp, and Alistair McGowan plays Coach Pooter, Nick's South African rugby coach.\n\nEpisode one, \"Tony\", is an ensemble piece that introduces the characters and the format. We meet the effortlessly attractive, popular and intelligent Tony as he arranges for his friends to attend a party held by upper-class girl Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat). The second episode, \"Cassie\", focuses on Cassie's final visit to an eating disorder clinic under the supervision of Abigail's mother Dr Stock. In her day-to-day life, she hallucinates messages instructing her to eat which seem to come from Sid, for whom she develops feelings. Jal's episode follows her attempt to win BBC Young Musician of the Year, and her strained relationship with her famous musician father. When drug dealer 'Mad Twatter' smashes her clarinet as payback for Sid not giving him money for drugs he bought, Jal's father sees to it he will not bother the gang again. In \"Chris\", Chris' mother abandons him, leaving £1,000 in cash. He blows the money on a party, and is eventually helped into temporary student accommodation by his psychology teacher, Angie (Siwan Morris). Episode five, \"Sid\", shows Sid's struggle with his parents' break-up while Tony organises a scheme to set him up with Michelle. A heartbroken and fragile Cassie attempts suicide by drug overdose.\n\n\"Maxxie and Anwar\" focuses on the conflict between Anwar's Muslim faith and Maxxie's homosexuality. On a school trip to Russia, Tony tells Maxxie that he wants to 'try something new', and Michelle ultimately witnesses Tony cheating on her with Maxxie. In \"Michelle\", Michelle faces up to Tony's manipulative and cheating ways. She begins to date Josh Stock (Abigail's brother, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes) until Tony breaks them up by sending naked photos of Abigail from Josh's phone. In \"Effy\", Josh seeks revenge on Tony and his younger sister Effy, by drugging her and effectively taking her for ransom. In the finale episode, \"Everyone\", it is Anwar's birthday. Anwar and Maxxie are reconciled when Anwar's father welcomes Maxxie to the birthday party, accepting his homosexuality. Chris' relationship with Angie ends violently when her fiancé returns. Tony confesses to Michelle that he loves her and wants to change his manipulative ways (whilst on the phone), only to be hit by a bus, as Effy watches on from Sid's dad Mark's car. The characters begin to sing \"Wild World\" by Cat Stevens as Tony lies unconscious and Sid searches for Cassie.\n\nThe second series premiered on E4 on 11 March 2008, however the first episode was available in four parts to MySpace users prior to airing. \"Maxxie and Tony\" starts the series, showcasing Tony's impairments following his accident and Maxxie's involvement to his recovery. The episode also reveals more about Maxxie's life; we learn of his ambitions to be a dancer, his surname, his difficulties with homophobic bullies, and encounter his parents (played by Bill Bailey and Fiona Allen). The second episode introduces a new character in Maxxie's stalker, young carer Lucy, also known as 'Sketch'. Sketch disrupts the school play organised by drama lecturer Bruce (Shane Richie) to steal a kiss from Maxxie. To spite Maxxie, Sketch begins a sexual relationship with Anwar. Episode three focuses on Sid's life, coping with Cassie's departure to Scotland, and he suspects her of cheating. Sid's Scottish relatives visit. Sid's father, Mark, stands up to his own father's abuse and ultimately reconciles his relationship with Sid; allowing for the unforeseen, peaceful death of Mark. Sid reconnects with brain-damaged Tony when he is able to open up to him about his father's death. In \"Michelle\", the group go on a camping trip to a beach. Maxxie discovers Sketch having sex with Anwar, and Sid sleeps with Michelle, starting a relationship; he comes home to find Cassie waiting for him. In \"Chris\", Chris agrees to start a job and Jal learns to start being more open to new things, and the two end up in a relationship. Chris cheats on her with Angie after Cassie tells Chris that Jal left him, but they move back in together, and Jal discovers she is pregnant.\n\n'Tony', directed by recurring actor Harry Enfield, sees Tony Stonem attend a university open day not long after taking an ecstasy tablet that awakens elements of his old personality. In a visual metaphor for Jungian psychology, a mysterious girl who is a projection of Tony's subconscious helps him conquer his mental impairments. His old self again, he confronts Michelle and Sid and tells them their relationship is 'wrong'. With the Stonem parents unable to run the house, Effy takes over in episode seven. She starts a new private school and befriends weird girl Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell), and resolves to solve her brother's and his friends' relationship problems. Cassie is hurting and turning to promiscuity, but through Effy's machinations, she and Sid get back together, as do Tony and Michelle. Actor Daniel Kaluuya wrote \"Jal\", which sees her struggle with her pregnancy, while Chris is rushed to hospital with a Subarachnoid Haemorrhage. Meanwhile, Maxxie introduces his new boyfriend, James (Sean Verey). In \"Cassie\", Jal tells Chris she is having an abortion. Cassie feels without her eating disorder and other problems, she is disempowered; she is traumatised when Chris dies in her arms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage and flees to New York City. In the series finale, the gang get their A Level results, collectively mourn Chris and eventually part ways, with Sid following Cassie to New York (it is left ambiguous whether he finds her), Anwar moving with Maxxie and James to London, and Sketch left behind. The series ends with Effy in Tony's bed, revelling in the artwork of emotions she has created as she claims her top place in their social world, and also as series' lead in the upcoming series.\n\nWe are introduced to the new cast on their first day at Roundview College in the series premiere, \"Everyone\". JJ Jones, James Cook and Freddie McClair are best friends to begin with; twins Katie and Emily Fitch know Naomi Campbell from school but are distant with her because Katie is homophobic and suspects her of being a lesbian. The gang meet Effy, and sidekick Pandora; Katie wants to become Effy's best friend, and both Cook and Freddie are instantly smitten. Cook passes the test set by Effy and begins a casual sexual relationship with her. Episode two focuses on Cook who invites the whole group over, but their friendships are not very strong yet; chaos ensues, and Cook angers local gangster Johnny White (Mackenzie Crook). Thomas Tomone is only introduced in the third episode. He is an immigrant from the Congo, and develops a crush on Pandora. He endears himself to the group when he is able to get Johnny White off their backs by besting him in a pepper-eating competition. However, despairing at his decadent life in Bristol, Mrs. Tomone brings Thomas back to the Congo. In \"Pandora\", Pandora's innocent slumber party becomes an MDMA-fuelled rave after Katie spikes the brownies. Emily and Naomi kiss; Naomi denies being gay, but urges Emily to admit that she is, who also denies it. Pandora allows Cook to take her virginity, but regrets it when later Thomas returns from the Congo.\n\nFreddie's episode shows his difficult relationship with his widower father (Simon Day) and his sister Karen (Klariza Clayton), who has ambitions to be a celebrity. His father converts Freddie's shed—his personal sanctuary—into a dance studio for Karen. He witnesses Effy's parents' break-up, discovers that Cook slept with his sister, gets punched in the face by his father, and when he goes to tell Effy how he feels about her discovers she is with Cook. In \"Naomi\", Naomi runs against Cook for student president on the basis that if he wins she will have to sleep with him; when he wins, however, he does not force her to take it further than kissing. She and Emily begin a sexual relationship, but Naomi is unwilling to accept the reality of its romantic nature. In \"JJ\", Freddie and Cook's feud over Effy negatively affects JJ. At Emily's encouragement, he manages to confront them both about it, and later loses his virginity when Emily decides to have pity sex with him. Thomas discovers that Pandora has been cheating on him, and while high on JJ's medication, Cook reveals to Freddie that Effy loves Freddie and not him. In Effy's episode, she has nothing: her Queen Bee status has been usurped by Katie, sex with Cook means nothing, and her home life is a wreck. She finally feels something when she has sex with Freddie, but after being tormented by Katie, an intoxicated Effy hits her with a rock. Katie is recovering in \"Katie and Emily\" but her relationship with her sister is falling apart. However, at the college ball, Emily is able to assert herself and Naomi confesses she loves Emily back. Thomas and Pandora also reunite. The finale episode sees Cook and Effy hiding out with Cook's father (Matt King). JJ tracks them down however, and forces Effy to confess it is Freddie that she loves, but Cook is adamant he loves her too. Freddie closes the series, asking 'What do we do now?'.\n\nSeries four begins with the suicide of a girl named Sophia (Amberley Gridley) while she is high on MDMA at a club Thomas works at. A police inspector (Pauline Quirke) questions the entire gang, and Thomas is expelled by the new headmaster (Chris Addison) for his unseemly connection to the incident. Thomas gives into temptation and sleeps with another girl, resulting in the break-up of him and Pandora. In \"Emily\", Emily's mother (Ronni Ancona) warns her to take her relationship more slowly and cautiously. Emily discovers Naomi had slept with Sophia and is the one who sold her the MDMA, leaving their relationship fraught. In \"Cook\", Cook is in trouble for an assault and, to be a better influence on his younger brother, accepts a prison sentence for dealing the drugs that led to Sophia's death, covering for Naomi. When Katie loses her job and discovers she has premature menopause, she cannot confide in her mother at first because of the stress of their bankruptcy and homelessness; the Fitches are forced to move into Naomi's house.\n\nFreddie worries over Effy's psychological state in his centric episode, as she is developing a psychotic depression that resembles what his mother had before she committed suicide. He is able to save Effy after an attempt on her life; she is hospitalised and he is left desolate.This situation took a large toll on Effy's and Freddie's relationship. JJ's episode sees him fall in love with a single mother called Lara (Georgia Henshaw), through whom he finds a new-found confidence and begins to doubt whether he really needed to be so highly medicated his whole life. In the penultimate episode, Effy's psychiatric counsellor Dr John Foster (Hugo Speer) uses unorthodox hypnotic methods to cure Effy's depression, making her forget and want to abandon her old friends. After an incident at the spot of Tony's accident where she nearly commits suicide again, her psychosis comes back and Freddie insists Dr Foster cease treating Effy. Later, Foster lures Freddie to discuss Effy, and brutally murders Freddie with a baseball bat. In the finale episode, everyone deals with Freddie's absence, thinking that he has left of his own volition. Naomi and Emily finally repair their damaged relationship, scorched by cheating, and Naomi confesses she loved Emily since they first met; Thomas and Pandora are thrown back together by chance when they both get into Harvard College; a mostly-recovered Effy holds Freddie's birthday party in his shed, knowing that he loved her and pining for his return. Cook, who is on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, uncovers Dr Foster's killing and after confronting him, furiously lunges at Foster. The series ends here in freeze-frame leaving both Cook's and John Foster's fates unknown.\n\nThe series begins by introducing unconventional newcomer Franky, to whom secretly insecure popular girl Mini takes a dislike; Mini ingratiates Franky into her group only to disown her. Frank is on the verge of breakdown, her adoptive father's air revolver in hand, when mysterious stranger Matty convinces her of her self-worth. Mini's sweet friend Grace establishes new friendships with Franky and the school's other outsiders, metalhead Rich and farmhand Alo. In episode two, \"Rich\", Grace finds herself drawn to Rich. She attempts to help him win over an elusive girl, and eventually he gets past his shyness to realise his attraction to her too. After Mini's fashion show in \"Mini\", the two agree to begin dating. Mini, however, feels pressured to have sex with boyfriend Nick, who does not know she is a virgin. Mini's cruelty to Grace and her new friends backfires when her fashion show goes completely awry. When she realises that her best friend Liv has slept with Nick, she forces herself to have sex with him, which is disappointing. She is devastated to see the parallel between her and her promiscuous mother (Clare Grogan) as they encounter one another on their walks of shame. The affair between Nick and Liv continues, though they both suspect Mini knows when she unifies the two groups of friends under Liv's roof for a party, in \"Liv\". Because she cannot handle the stress of her family life or Mini's scheme, Liv leaves the house. In town, she meets drifter Matty, and the pair embark on a drug-fuelled bender. Back at her house, she discovers that Matty is in fact Nick's brother, and Liv's affair with Nick comes out in the open. The brothers reconcile, however, and Matty comes home again.\n\nIn \"Nick\", Matty is re-enlisted at Roundview, but his relationship with Liv causes a new love triangle to form—between him, Liv and Franky. Having lost both Mini and Liv, and now living in Matty's shadow, Nick has a nervous breakdown and smashes up his house with a golf club. Through Matty, however, Nick comes to see his father Leon (Dorian Lough) and his parenting in a more negative light and the two brothers take a stand. In his episode, Alo's parents take him out of sixth form to work on the farm, and after he causes an explosion they sell all of his belongings. In protest, he throws a massive party and when he confronts his parents, his father suffers a heart attack. Rather than burden his friend Rich, who has just proudly had sex for the first time with Grace, he goes home and attempts to repair things with his parents. In \"Grace\", Grace introduces Rich to her parents; Rich is shocked to discover that her father is headmaster David Blood (Addison). Blood schemes to have Grace's grades slip on her drama assessment, a staging of \"Twelfth Night\", so that he can justify removing her from Roundview. Grace sees her dilemma, as peacemaker, through \"Hamlet\"s \"sea of troubles\" soliloquy; she uses \"Twelfth Night\" to bring the love triangle between Matty, Liv and Franky to a head, and ultimately receives an A. After Blood still forces Grace to change schools, Rich is inspired by \"Romeo and Juliet\" and proposes to her. In the series finale, the two attempt to marry in secret with the gang as witnesses, though Alo's van breaks down. Mini begins to recognise her attraction to Franky, and becomes very protective of her. After an attempt at sex with Matty, Franky has a panic attack, charges through a forest, and accidentally falls over a ledge. After being rescued by Mini, Matty and Liv, Franky reveals more to her friends about her insecurities. Though Blood intervenes and Grace and Rich do not marry, they are happily allowed to continue dating and the gang, solidified as friends, party together at a local fête.\n\nSeries 6 starts with the gang on holiday in Morocco; Franky has lost her virginity to Matty but is already becoming bored, and is tempted by wealthy drug dealer Luke (played by Joe Cole). Mini also decides to take Alo's virginity and swears him to secrecy. Matty pursues Luke and Franky which quickly escalates into a car chase; his truck overturns, putting Grace in a critical condition, and he runs away to avoid being arrested for the possession of the marijuana and ketamine Luke placed inside his vehicle. Back in Bristol, Franky struggles to cope with her guilt and Rich is prevented by her father from seeing Grace in hospital, where she lies in a coma, in \"Rich\". When Mr Blood takes Grace for treatment in Switzerland, Rich squats in the Bloods' home for some time, convinced that Grace is still alive, but after a party at the house a mournful David Blood informs him that Grace has subsequently died. In \"Alex\", new kid Alex, who is a little strange, arrives while the gang are at odds still mourning Grace; Liv in particular develops feelings for him, only for him to disclose to her that he is in fact gay. Nevertheless, they form a close in bond, particularly as Mini remains distant from Liv. In her episode, Franky, overwhelmed with guilt, escapes to 'bad boy' Luke for companionship and excitement. Her actions are negatively viewed, and she quickly becomes alienated. She turns against authoritative figures at school and at home, pushing her to get more involved in her violent and destructive relationship with Luke. During a full-blown fight at a bar, Nick saves Franky and quietly confesses he loves her. After Luke gets rough with her, Franky escapes to a park near home where her father meets her; he is there to fend Luke away when he returns in an attempt to win Franky back. Subsequently, in \"Mini\", Mini continues to distance herself from her friends after Grace's death, while continuing her 'no-strings-attached' relationship with Alo, but is hit further by the revelation that she is pregnant with Alo's baby. To get away from it, she clings to her deadbeat dad, Gregory, who she is convinced has changed. Though he abandons her, with the support of Franky she is able to accept her pregnancy.\n\nIn \"Nick\", Nick struggles to find money to pay for Russian gangsters to smuggle Matty back into England, all the while struggling with his feelings for Franky. After emotionally pouring his heart out to her during an argument in a nightclub toilet, he subsequently blows the deal. But, to his happiness, Franky finally reciprocates his feelings, and they form a relationship. In \"Alo\", Alo is finally forced to grow up when, in his effort to put his failed relationship with Mini behind him, he has sex with a girl named Poppy Champion (Holly Earl) who he did not initially know to be underage. Poppy reports him to the police when he breaks up with her. Although charges are eventually dropped, he and Mini are forced further apart than ever before. \"Liv\" focuses on Liv's isolation. Since meeting Alex, she has been 'dealing' with Grace's death by going out, partying, drinking, and staying at Alex's house instead of her own home. Alex leaves Bristol one weekend, and Liv finds that—aside from her sister Maude—she has truly drifted from her friends, and Mini in particular. Moreover, she begins to have intense pains and feels a large lump on her side, which she worries might be ovarian cancer. Ultimately however, the lump turns out to be a grief-induced hallucination; responding to this, Liv takes a step towards dealing with Grace's death by placing flowers next to her tombstone alongside Rich, Doug, and Maude. While Mini's mum tries to convince her to give her child for adoption once it is born, and Franky is conflicted after Matty returns to Bristol, in \"Franky & Mini\", the girls decide to leave everything behind and abscond. Soon, however, Mini wishes to return home, despite Franky's insistence. Alo learns of Mini's pregnancy and to her surprise—in the end—vows to take care of her no matter what. In the finale, Franky attempts to track down her mother, but instead finds her biological sister who declares their mother has died. At Alex's house party to celebrate leaving Bristol behind, she tells both Matty and Nick she loves them but cannot be with them. In the conclusion, Mini goes into labour, while Franky's sister takes her to see her mother—who is not dead after all. Nick and Matty bond once again, and the latter turns himself in to the police. In the final scene, playing in parallel, Alex leaves Bristol for Thailand; Alo and Liv are beside Mini as she gives birth; Franky lays eyes on her mother; and Rich, outside the room where Mini is giving birth, looks at the camera and says 'bye'.\n\nThe seventh series, titled \"Skins Redux\", aired on 1 July 2013. It saw the return of former \"Skins\" stars Hannah Murray as Cassie, Jack O'Connell as Cook and Kaya Scodelario as Effy in three individual stories. Lily Loveless as Naomi and Kathryn Prescott as Emily also starred in guest roles. The three stories have their own titles: \"Skins Fire\" (Effy), \"Skins Pure\" (Cassie) and \"Skins Rise\" (Cook). The six-part series began filming on 22 October 2012 and concluded at the end of January 2013.\n\nSkins Fire depicts Effy as a 21-year-old hedge fund receptionist. She lives with Naomi, who is drifting through life with vague ambitions of being a stand-up comedian. Effy is much more serious and driven than in the past, and impresses her bosses enough to win a shot at being a stock trader. In her attempts to succeed in her career, she becomes embroiled in an insider trading scandal, as well as romantically involved with her boss (Kayvan Novak). To spare her lovelorn friend Dom (Craig Roberts) from jail time for his part in the crime, she makes a full confession to the Financial Services Authority of hers and Jake's activities. Meanwhile, Naomi reveals she is struggling with cancer, and pleas with Effy to not tell Emily, who is in New York on an internship. Dom and Effy support Naomi until it is clear her condition is terminal; Emily returns to London, hurt and betrayed, and comforts Naomi while Effy is prosecuted.\n\nSkins Pure catches up with Cassie at 23, living a solitary existence in London and waitressing after breaking up with an ex-boyfriend in America. The new Cassie no longer does drugs, and has recovered from her eating disorder. After discovering someone has been secretly taking artistic photos of her and uploading them to the Internet, she tracks down her stalker, and discovering it to be the cook at her café, Jakob (Olly Alexander). After realising Jakob's attention gives her confidence, she allows him to continue photographing her on her terms, in an explicitly non-sexual friendship. While trying to support her depressed father and little brother after the death of her mother, her friendship with Jakob slowly comes apart as his jealousy grows irrational, particularly when Cassie models for a professional shoot. Ultimately, Cassie chooses to leave behind her friendship with Jakob and another man who had been pursuing her romantically (Daniel Ben Zenou) to focus on raising her little brother while her father recuperates in Italy.\n\nSkins Rise follows Cook (now somewhere in his early 20s) who is on the run and living alone in Manchester. In an introductory voiceover, Cook explains his thoughts and alludes towards a murder he may have committed; it is implied but not outright stated that he is avoiding capture after killing John Foster a few years back. He is now a drug dealer and has a semi-serious relationship with a woman named Emma (Esther Smith), but becomes mesmerised by Charlie (Hannah Britland), the girlfriend of local drug lord Louis (Liam Boyle) after he is asked to watch over her for a few days. After Louis brutally kills a man named Jason (Lucien Laviscount) for having an affair with Charlie, Cook flees Manchester, taking Emma with him. En route, Charlie calls Cook and begs him to take her with them. The three end up at Emma's family's old country home, in a remote part of the country. Not long after though, Louis arrives, explaining that he tracked their car. After Charlie refuses to go with him, the three leave the house and find Emma's parents' car abandoned, indicating they have been killed. The trio are stranded in the woods, where Louis catches up with and murders Emma. Seeing this, Cook decides he is done running, confronting Louis and beating him to a pulp. He declares, \"I'm Cook. You thought you could kill me? I'm fucking Cook.\" He helps Charlie escape and alerting the police, while a voiceover indicates he is pondering the significance of life and death.\n\nAlthough \"Skins\" aired in the United States on BBC America (only series 1–3 aired and the rights cleared only for those series for purchase of DVDs or online viewing in the US), albeit in a heavily censored form (strong language bleeped out and some more graphic scenes of violence and sex cut out), MTV announced that they would be adapting the show into an American version set in Baltimore, Maryland. With Bryan Elsley as executive producer, the series began filming in February 2010 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The first episode of the US series is almost a shot-for-shot copy of the first episode of the UK series, but it deviates from the original plot in following episodes such that there are significant differences between the US and UK versions. Characters are also similar, and some names have been changed; Sid has been renamed Stanley, Cassie renamed Cadie and Jal renamed Daisy. In addition, Tony's younger sister Effy, who becomes a main character in Generation Two of UK Skins, was renamed Eura. However, the biggest change comes in the form of Tea, a lesbian cheerleader who replaces the UK gay character Maxxie who was a professional dancer.\n\nThe show's cancellation was announced by MTV on 10 June 2011. The Parents Television Council, an advocacy group, criticised the show, calling it one of the worst shows a child could watch. Reasons cited for its cancellation included loss of advertising sponsors and a shrinking audience, with fewer people tuning in for each subsequent episode. Pre-adult teens (\"minors\" under US law), who are MTV's core demographic audience, were at the centre of the argument for those who disapproved of the program, even with MTV's self-imposed restrictive broadcaster-like standards and practices.\n\nThe popular Thai series was influenced by this TV show.\n\nThe show's writing team has an average age of 21, and includes several \"teenage consultants\". Elsley said, \"It's all about the writing. [...] We're about letting our audience feel they are not alone. [...] We're always having people miss [writing] meetings because they've got A-levels or even GCSEs\".\n\nIn January 2011, Brittain announced a writing competition open to the public to help with the developing and writing of Series 6. According to Brittain, the winner will receive \"a four-month placement in the \"Skins\" writers' room, where you'd be invited to attend at least 10 of our top secret meetings, working with [Brittain] and the other \"Skins\" writers,\" as well as monetary compensation. The winners of the 2011 competition were Sophie Boyce (18) and Joe Hampson (21). The winner of the 2008 competition, Dan Lovett, went on to become an official member of the \"Skins\" writing team.\n\nThe show is filmed almost entirely in Bristol; scenes at Roundview College were shot at Henbury School for series four, having formerly been set at the John Cabot Academy and SGS WISE Campus. and multiple scenes are located around College Green. Special locations for individual episodes have included the Gower Peninsula, Sharpness Docks, the University of Exeter and New York City. The series was shot entirely in High Definition, using Sony HDW-750P cameras for the first two series, and Sony HDW-F900R thereafter, both supplied by Panavision. It was edited by BBC Studios and Post Production in Bristol, using Autodesk Lustre and Autodesk Smoke.\n\n\"The trip to Russia\" episode was actually shot in Lithuania, near the capital Vilnius. This episode was shot in co-operation with Lithuanian Film Studios and professional Lithuanian actors.\n\nIt was announced in April 2008 that all of the original cast (except Kaya Scodelario and Lisa Backwell) would be replaced for series 3. Elsley said: \"There are risks associated with dumping a cast, but we just did it. There was some disquiet at the channel, but then they told us just to go with it.\" Speaking at Broadcast's television drama conference, he also confirmed the show would stick to its pattern of introducing college-age characters, moving them on in the next series, then letting them go. \"The first year is about getting to know the kids, and the second gives us the advantage of being able to explore their psyches a little more,\" said Elsley. Brittain said that the new cast would be quite different from the original characters, although people may still spot some similarities. Open auditions for the second generation of cast members were held in Bristol, which attracted 1,500 16- to 18-year-olds, followed by a further two days of auditions in London.\n\nA variety of videos have been released on the \"Skins\" website, including character profiles, and \"Unseen Skins\" mini-episodes that interweave with every aired episode. In addition to character profiles on the official E4 website, accounts for the lead \"Skins\" characters are maintained on popular social networking website MySpace. Each series is launched on MySpace, with previews of the first episodes a few days before they are aired on television. There is also an official \"Skins\" Internet bot for Windows Live Messenger, which allows users to receive automated messages throughout the airing of each episode with music credits, trivia, and behind-the-scenes gossip.\n\nThe first series received positive reviews, although some critics complained that the series depicts teenagers unrealistically and stereotypically. Others criticised the excessive promotion of the show (specifically in the UK) and having relatively mediocre writing in comparison to other similarly themed shows. Actor Nicholas Hoult defended the extreme storylines, saying they would not reflect \"everyone's teenage life\", adding \"it is maybe heightened for entertainment but all of it is believable.\"\n\nMarieke Hardy expressed admiration for the show, and particularly enjoyed the fact that the show was \"beautiful and sad and poignant and perfectly hurtful\", while also managing to give impression of being drama that is \"edgy, funny and rude\". However, she did state that she was unsure whether the show was meant for teenagers or not. Stewart Lee has remarked during an interview on the BBC4 programme \"Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe\" that he feels lucky for having been a teenager watching TV for teenagers in the 1970s and not the 2000s as \"there was something really comforting for nerds and weirdos about programmes like \"Children of the Stones\" and \"The Changes\".\" He said that watching \"Skins\" as a teenager today would make him feel lonelier than he already would have been. However, Brooker himself gave the programme a positive review in his \"Guardian\" column \"Screen Burn\", and specifically stated that \"the series had wrong-footed me\", comparing his initial expectation of \"Skins\" as a shallow show to after he had finished watching the series.\n\nIn his book \"Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale\", Russell T Davies and his co-author, Benjamin Cook, discuss \"Skins\" at length, with Davies praising the show's innovation in a genre that was fast becoming tired and out of date. They are critical of some elements of the first series, such as the believability of Tony's character, or episode 6 which is described as \"Carry On Russia\", but give high praise to the second series as a whole, highlighting the death of Sid's dad as a superb moment, and calling the finale \"perfect\". Davies, creator of the award-winning \"Queer as Folk\", also praised the handling of the show's homosexuality-related storylines, saying that he knew a boy very like Maxxie in the 1980s. \"The Age\" called it a \"refreshing, entertaining and worthy series\" and wrote it was \"compulsory viewing for parents of teenagers as much as for teens.\" Similarly, the \"Naomily\" storyline of Series 3 and 4 proved popular with lesbian viewers; a poll conducted by American lesbian's' media website AfterEllen.com ranked Naomi and Emily as the top two fictional lesbian and bisexual characters.\n\nThe pilot episode of \"Skins\" averaged 1.5 million viewers. The ratings for the second series which launched peaked at 884,000 viewers, which gave it 5.9% audience share and taking 60% of the 16–24 demographic, however this was still more than 500,000 viewers down on its series one premiere. The series finale attracted an audience of 740,000 on E4, equating to a 4.65% share of the audience. The start of the third series drew in 877,000 viewers, proving popular with its key audience demographic of younger people—56.2% of viewers were aged between 16 and 34. Series 4 premiered with 1.5 million viewers across E4 and E4+1, the highest rated episode since series 1.\n\nThe programme has given rise to the term 'Skins party', referring to a debauched night of heavy drinking and recreational drug use. During the 2007 Easter holidays, a girl in County Durham threw a house party; it was advertised on her Myspace profile as \"Skins Unofficial Party,\" referring to the party in the first series' trailer, with the subtitle \"Let's trash the average family-sized house disco party.\" Two hundred people turned up, breaking into the house and causing over £20,000 of seemingly deliberate damage. She claimed that her account was hacked and someone else placed the ad. Similar incidents have taken place in the Republic of Ireland, with major household damage and theft of personal property being reported in Firhouse, Bray and Drogheda. Although these attacks have not been conclusively linked to the show, news outlets have reported that they are called Skins parties. Club nights marketed as 'Skins Secret Parties' have also taken shape in Leicester and Brighton. Following this, a series of parties were run by Company Pictures in spring 2008.\n\nIn May 2009, E4 confirmed that Film4 and Company Pictures were in \"preliminary talks\" about a movie spin-off. In March 2010, Jack Thorne revealed to \"The Guardian\" that the \"Skins\" motion picture was in pre-production.\n\nOn 31 May 2011, after many whisperings about whether the movie would go ahead or not, Kaya Scodelario announced on Twitter \"I genuinely don't know anything about that, have no idea if it's even happening.\" Scodelario continued by saying, \"I would still love to do the \"Skins\" movie\" and that she would enjoy working with the cast again.\n\nIn September 2009, Company Pictures announced that the \"Skins\" brand has been licensed to Crystal Entertainment. The plan is to help creator Bryan Elsley expand the brand into areas such as film, fashion and music. They described \"Skins\" as \"the most authentic teen brand on TV\".\n\nIn January 2010, Hodder & Stoughton published \"Skins: The Novel\", a short novel by Ali Cronin that describes events taking place between series 3 and 4. In March 2011, they published \"Skins: v. 2: Summer Holiday\", a short novel by Jess Britain which centres around the series 5 cast.\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n"}

{"id": "2991389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2991389", "title": "Sky Cable", "text": "Sky Cable\n\nSky Cable (stylized as SKY cable) is a cable television service of Sky Cable Corporation. Its franchise area covers Metro Manila, and its suburb or neighboring areas and it is also in provincial areas that both digital and few analog services, and it has 700,000 subscribers controlling 45% of the cable TV market.\n\nSince it started community antenna television system operation in the Philippines on January 26, 1992, SkyCable provides cable Internet, VoIP services and digital cable TV service.\n\n\nIn order to be competitive in the cable TV industry, SkyCable adopts an alternative pricing model for its subscribers. It allows its subscribers to select their own packages or channels, comparable to a pay per channel service most generally used in the United States. SkyCable also introduces the package-pricing model typically used by other cable television providers in which channels are classified into packages.\n\nThe SkyCable postpaid bundles are categorized into 10 clusters named as Select, Bronze 299, Bronze 399, Bronze 499, Silver HD, Gold HD, Postpaid HD (299, 549, 999, 1999) and a separate payment scheme for its Premium/Pay-Per-View.\n\n\nSkyCable also offered prepaid packages to its cable TV service, the Silver Prepaid and Select Plus Prepaid. It was a prepaid cable TV service based on a non-recurring subscription scheme and allows non-postpaid customers to subscribe to selected channels and pay only for the desire duration of viewing and the service requires a digital addressable set-top box. The prepaid plans came in an array of card denomination to choose from that is suitable to its non-postpaid subscribers. Silver Prepaid and Select Plus Prepaid packages came in similar denomination: 3, 15 and 30 days. But as of around 2011 or 2012, it currently no longer offered for new subscribers and status of remaining subscribers remained uncertain. But recently, as of around 2015, the Prepaid service were relaunched and introduced Prepaid 99 and Prepaid 250, and each prepaid package/s valid within 30 days. It was offered initially available for Greater Manila Area and provinces nearby (Cavite and Laguna). It was later expanded its service for regional system areas, first it was expanded for new subscribers in Cebu and Davao, then the rest of Visayan cities (Bacolod, Iloilo and Dumaguete) and lastly expanded in General Santos. In 4th Quarter In 2016 The Prepaid Plan Has Been Phase Out But However it still available for Loading Amounts.\n\n\n\nSkyCable coverage area for analog cable TV is available in selected areas in Metropolitan Manila and its suburb while its digital services covers key cities in the Philippines. It offers basic to premium cable TV services.\n\nIn an ongoing exertion to battle cable piracy and averting illegitimate connections, SkyCable through SkyCable Digital adopts digital video broadcasting for cable or DVB-C. It is a standard for transmitting digital television signal over cable. SkyCable uses digital video compression or distribution through its digital addressable box or the Digibox, a digital set-top box that uses the DVB-C broadcast standard to give its subscribers access to its digital infrastructure.\n\nThe Digibox provides an enhanced viewing experience with features such as crystal clear picture quality; allowing its users to customize its viewing preferences by organizing its channels and useful programming information by its real-time onscreen electronic program guide with highlights and synopsis of every program shown; and an in-house mail function for its technical and corporate announcements. One key feature of the Digibox is the parental control lock that can pre-select channels and set an automatic parental rating level that locks programs or channels. It also has built-in games, the classic Tetris and GoBang.\n\n\nSkyCable Digital’s Digibox conveys programming with encryption to alleviate signal piracy. It utilizes ISO/IEC 7816 smart cards, which transmit digital signals to the receiver to decrypt the programming for viewing. To fully consummate the Digibox, it uses Irdeto Access B.V. smart cards, which are ISO/IEC 7816 compliant. It is given to all subscribers with standard and high definition set-top boxes. The smart card stores the subscriber’s information and the plan to which they subscribe.\n\nOn September 19, 2008, SkyCable initiated the pay-per-view broadcast of the 2008 Ryder Cup golf tournament in high-definition (HD). It is transmitted in 1080i resolution and paves the way for the Philippines to convey the first HD signal. In July 2009, Skycable also commenced a locally produced HD program through, Balls HD, the collegiate basketball tournament—University Athletic Association of the Philippines and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. At present, SkyCable offers over 20 HD channels accessible through separate payment. Lineup consists of RTM HD, ABS-CBN HD, ABS-CBN Sports + Action HD, ANC HD, Discovery Asia, Discovery HD, History HD, National Geographic HD, HBO HD, NBA Premium TV HD, Fox Movies HD, Fox Crime HD, FOX Life HD, Comedy Central HD, Fox Sports 3 HD, HBO Hits HD, Fox HD, MTV Live HD, Fox Family Movies HD, FOX Life HD, ASN HD, Cartoon Network HD, Outdoor Channel HD, Fashion TV HD, Freeview Channel HD, AXN HD, Disney Channel HD, Fox Sports HD, and the Fox Sports 2 HD.\n\nOn December 8, 2010, SkyCable announced that it would launch a new service similar to U. S.-based TiVo for its high and standard definition services within the first quarter of 2011. Initially, the service will be called PVR or personal video recording, which has a 500GB internal hard drive enough to record 135 hours of cable programs in high definition or 217 hours for its standard definition service. Distinct from regular digital video recorders, the PVR uses the built-in electronic program guide that enables its subscribers which programs to be recorded. The new service will also feature Timeshift, a new way of recording programs to be viewed to at a time more opportune to its subscribers, and that would also allow recording of favorite programs on a time delay basis. Timeshift will also allow its subscribers or has the ability to pause live broadcast and in slow motion. On March 21, 2011, SkyCable launches its first personal video recording in the Philippines, the iRecord. It is an enhanced version of its digibox. It allows subscribers to record cable programs up to 145 hours in standard definition or 86 hours in high definition platform. It comes with a 320GB disk space.\n\nIn June 1996, SkyCable in partnership with SolidBank Corporation through Solidcard Products Corp. launches the first cable TV branded credit card in the Philippines, the SkyCard MasterCard. A fully integrated credit card exclusive to its qualified subscribers. At the height of partnership, First Metro Investment Corp., a financing house of Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company is in talks with SolidBank Corp. for possible merger and acquisition. On June 1, 2000, First Metro Investment Corp. fully acquired the financial and non-real estate resources of SolidBank. And on September 22, 2000, First Metro Investment Corp. completed its acquisition of SolidBank Corp. and its subsidiaries AB Card and Solidcard Products corporations and launches its own brand, the Metrobank Value MasterCard. At the time of the merger, SkyCable through Sky Vision Corporation turned its financial facilities and transferred its SkyCard MasterCard accounts to Citibank N. A. and rebranded it to SkyCard-Citibank MasterCard. Months after it was launched, the SkyCard-Citibank MasterCard failed to reach its target market and eventually ended the partnership.\n\nIn February 2003, GMA Network, Inc., operator of a close competitor to ABS-CBN filed a complaint against SkyCable for allegedly moving GMA Network from channel 12 without approval of the National Telecommunication Commission. Local authorities decided on April 25, 2003 that SkyCable violated the provisions of Memorandum Circular 4-08-88 and ordered to carry the free-to-air television signal on its system except when theoretically impracticable. It also ordered SkyCable to faithfully and strictly conforms with the requirements and to conclude from randomly changing channel assignments without notice and approval from local authorities. As a result, SkyCable filed a motion for reconsideration addressing the rule invalidate the means as it conflicts with a state law on intellectual property but local authorities denied the motion and directed SkyCable to comply with its previous decision. Consequently, the latter filed another appeal through an appellate court but still rejected their request and ordered them to conform to local authorities resolution.\n\nOn January 1, 2008, Solar Entertainment pulled its 6 cable channels from SkyCable; namely Basketball TV, Solar Sports, ETC, 2nd Avenue, Jack TV and Crime/Suspense. The channels were replaced by 6 new channels owned by fellow subsidiary Creative Programs, Inc.; AXN Beyond, Balls, Fox Crime, KidsCo, Maxxx and Velvet. While vice president Juno Chuidian stated in a report to GMA News TV that the new channels were added because they would offer less \"redundant\" programming and feature more series that had never been aired in the country before, reports surfaced that the channels were pulled due to a dispute; ABS-CBN believed that Solar's lower fees for advertising on its channels were causing ABS-CBN to lose revenue.\n\nSolar Entertainment however, retaliated by expanding its partnership with the terrestrial broadcaster Radio Philippines Network; adding programming from its C/S cable channel to its primetime lineup, and using the channel as part of its successful bid against ABS-CBN for the next PBA broadcast contract.\n\nThe Solar Entertainment owned channels returned to SkyCable in 2010.\n\nAccording to a blind article in a business column, Solar Entertainment pulled out again all of its channels in SkyCable beginning April 10, 2017 allegedly due to SkyCable's unpaid carriage fees for two of Solar's sports channels carrying NBA games: NBA Premium TV and Basketball TV. On October 16, 2018, all the Solar channels were restored.\n\nDue to programming costs, STAR TV pulled its plug over SkyCable while a negotiation was still in the offing. In May 1999, STAR TV decided to unilaterally cease its entire channel signal and demanded that SkyCable carry STAR Movies, STAR World, STAR Sports, ESPN, Viva Cinema, Channel V, STAR Movies Mandarin (now STAR Chinese Movies & STAR Legend Movies) and the National Geographic Channel (formerly NBC Asia) and asked the cable company to pay twice the amount from its original contract. As a result, SkyCable dropped STAR TV channels and its affiliates and launches Lifestyle Network. After three years of absence, SkyCable and its sister company, Home Cable relaunched the STAR TV lineup.\n\nOn August 1, 1999, SkyCable axes AXN from its programming lineup due to low and poor content, and too much violence on its programming. In addition to various complains from its subscribers, no new programming lineup was offered by AXN. Consequently, SkyCable replaced AXN with a business channel, Bloomberg Television. In May 2000, AXN resumed its broadcast in SkyCable and offered AXN to its programming lineup as one of its exclusive channels.\n\nOn March 14, 2011 local television network, TV5 through its parent company, ABC Development Corporation (now TV5 Network, Inc.) filed a complaint to the local National Telecommunications Commission against SkyCable. The latter accused SkyCable of unfair practice for refusing to carry its news channel, AksyonTV. Under NTC Memorandum Circular 4-08-88, all cable and satellite companies in the Philippines must carry all free-to-air local channels on its lineup. On April 1, 2011, SkyCable announced the inclusion of AksyonTV to its lineup effective May 4 on channel 61 which was being occupied by a religious channel, EWTN. However, on April 28, 2011, SkyCable said it would start airing the channel on April 30, four days earlier from its original pronouncement and it will only be available through its digital platform.\n\n"}

The liner notes make the point that although series musical arranger Leon Klatzkin is conventionally credited with composing the theme, that credit is in some doubt. The use of the \"Superman\" theme in the show became ingrained in viewers' minds because the same section of music was played nearly every time the scene cut to Superman flying.\n\nJones' music for this series was released in its entirety on its own CD as part of the 8-disc collection \"Superman: The Music (1978-1988)\", issued by Film Score Monthly in 2008.\n\nThe most widely available and well-known \"Superman\" music is from the four Christopher Reeve films (1978–1987) and the remainder of this article focuses on these, plus the 2006 film, starring Brandon Routh.\n\nWilliams' \"Superman Theme\", which is first heard during the opening credits to the film \"Superman\", has been reused (with varying arrangements) as the opening music for every \"Superman\" film except for \"Superman III\", in which Ken Thorne employed a lighthearted, somewhat comical cue to represent 'the streets of Metropolis.' It is also referenced in Jerry Goldsmith's score to the 1984 film \"Supergirl\" during a scene in which the title character sees a poster of Superman.\n\nDirector Zack Snyder's 2013 reboot of the series, \"Man of Steel,\" is scored by Hans Zimmer, and is the first \"Superman\" film not to use any of Williams' themes.\n\nA leitmotif is a melody associated with a particular character or story element in any mode of drama in which music is employed, such as a musical play, opera, ballet, or film.\n\n\nComposer/arranger Ken Thorne was mandated to reuse the first film's themes for \"Superman II\". He based the music for the Kryptonian villains on the Williams material associated with Krypton and the Fortress of Solitude. He also added a descending three-note motif for the villains and a briefly heard ominous melody associated with General Zod.\n\nKen Thorne was given a freer hand in the scoring of \"Superman III\" in accordance with the series' change in direction and more comedic tone. His new thematic material consisted of related themes for Gus Gorman and a general theme for computers, plus an ominous \"Supercomputer\" theme heard in the latter part of the score. Thorne also supplied a love theme for Lana Lang and Clark Kent, based on a melody written for the film by Giorgio Moroder. Lois Lane's theme is not present in the score because she only appears in the film briefly.\n\nJohn Williams composed three new themes for \"\", attaching to three new characters.\nAlexander Courage adapted Williams' themes for the film, integrating the three new ones with all of the existing themes from \"Superman\". He also supplied two new themes of his own: a \"missile\" motif for when nuclear arms are shown or discussed, and a \"Russian\" motif, a minor mode march used when Soviets and their weapons appear.\nCourage completed a 100-minute score for a version of \"\" that ran over two hours. It had been long rumored that a version of the film previewed in Orange County, California, in late June 1987 ran 134 minutes. Screenwriter Mark Rosenthal recalls a version of that length on his DVD commentary for the film, but existing documentation suggests that the film was actually 10 minutes shorter than that when previewed. In any event, as a result of negative audience response to the preview, the picture was cut down to a length of 89 minutes for U.S. release. At the urging of visual effects supervisor Harrison Ellenshaw, two action scenes were reinstated for the international version, which ran 92 minutes and was later shown on U.S. television. As a result of this cutting of running time, much of the music was not heard and \"Jeremy's Theme\" in particular was virtually undetectable in the final version. No music from the film was released for over twenty years until Film Score Monthly issued an 8-CD box set called \"Superman: The Music (1978-1988)\" which presents the complete score to \"\".\n\nThree new themes were composed for Bryan Singer's 2006 film, a \"Bad Hat Harry\" production, which loosely followed the continuity of the first two Reeve films: a personal theme for Superman, a motif for Lois and her son, and a darker theme for Lex Luthor. Singer's favorite composer, John Ottman, also incorporated several themes from the first film, such as Williams's \"Superman March,\" Lois Lane's love theme (\"Can You Read My Mind\"), the \"Smallville\" theme, and the \"Krypton\" theme. A reprise of \"The Fortress of Solitude\" from the original 1978 soundtrack is heard at the end of the airplane rescue sequence as Superman is re-introduced to the public after Lois Lane sees him for the first time.\n\nThis refers to music which originates within the narrative of a film, i.e. the characters in the story are aware of the music.\n\n\"Superman\":\nA selection of existing songs were featured in \"Superman\", not included on any version of the soundtrack albums, but readily available elsewhere:\n\nSource music written for the film: A Hawaiian-themed cue called \"Luthor's Luau,\" heard in the background in Lex Luthor's secret hideaway the day after Superman's debut around the city was composed by John Williams, who also wrote additional pieces of source music that were not used in the film. In some cases these were replaced by the existing songs listed above. However, some of Williams' versions were used in the extended television broadcast versions of the film in place of these.\n\n\"Superman II\":\n\n\"Superman III\":\n\n\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\":\n\nThese are regularly performed in symphony and pops concerts, including those by composer John Williams, and have also been featured in re-recordings for various CD compilations.\n\nThe score for \"Superman,\" composed and conducted by John Williams, was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, with John Georgiadis as concertmaster. Recording took place on July 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, September 9, 10, 11, October 6 (Irvine Arditti, concertmaster), 15, 24, 31 (Richard Studt, concertmaster), and November 4, 1978, at the Anvil Studios in Denham, Bucks, England. Source music was recorded on July 17. The recording engineer was Eric Tomlinson, assisted by Alan Snelling. Orchestrations were by Herbert Spencer, Arthur Morton, Angela Morley and John Williams. The music editor was Bob Hathaway, assisted by Ken Ross.\n\nThe score was composed, conducted and orchestrated by Ken Thorne (from original material composed by John Williams) Because of budget restrictions, the score was recorded by an orchestra of contract players rather than the London Symphony Orchestra. Recording took place on March 25, 26, 27, 29, April 17, 18, 25, and May 2, 1980, at CTS Studios (The Music Centre) in Wembley, Middlesex, England. The recording engineer was John Richards, assisted by Tim Pennington and James Abramson, and the music editor was Bob Hathaway.\n\nThe score was composed, conducted and orchestrated by Ken Thorne (with original Superman themes by John Williams). Recording took place on February 14, 15, 16, March 7, 8, 9 and 18, 1983 at CTS Studios (The Music Centre) in Wembley, Middlesex, England. The recording engineer was John Richards. The music editor was Bob Hathaway.\n\nThe score was adapted and conducted by Alexander Courage (from music by John Williams). Recording took place from May 11–18, 1987 at the Bavaria Studios in Munich, Germany, performed by Symphony-Orchestra Graunke. Recording engineer was Peter Kramper. Additional recording took place May 23-June 2, 1987, at CTS Studios (The Music Centre) in Wembley, Middlesex, England, performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. Recording engineer was Dick Lewzey, assisted by Steve Price and Jonathan Ruttley. Orchestrations were by Frank Barber and Harry Roberts, and the music editor was Bob Hathaway. Jack Fishman was musical advisor. Songs by Paul Fishman were recorded in September 1986 in Hampstead, London, England.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Time: 79:21\n\nThis album was released on CD in 1987 and is still in print, but it is missing the tracks \"Growing Up\" and \"Lex Luthor's Lair\". The Japanese issue, which was released in 1990, presents the full program, but is out of print and rare.\n\nThis release is a re-recording of the score by John Debney and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra including the first release of additional music from the film in any form. As detailed in the liner notes, the project was hampered when it was discovered that the existing scores and parts for the \"Superman: The Movie\" score had been lost. When extensive efforts to locate them failed, a team of orchestrators reconstructed the music from John Williams' 8-12 stave composer sketches—thus there are subtle differences which may be noted in a number of the cues when compared to their original counterparts.\n\nThe tempi of the cues in this re-recording are generally rather slower than in the original recording—possibly because the recording was made in the highly resonant acoustic of Glasgow City Hall.\n\n\n\nThis release combines the master for the original album with what were believed at the time to be the only surviving elements to reconstruct the full length of the original Williams recording. This release went out of print in 2005, but may still be available online through many internet music services.\n\nTotal Time: 75:18\n\nTotal Time: 73:38\n\nThis release restores the complete score from newly discovered high quality original masters and includes previously unreleased material.

Side A presented 19 minutes of Ken Thorne's score, while Side B contained music composed and produced by pop mogul Giorgio Moroder. These included three sung versions (with lyrics by Keith Forsey) of songs heard as source music in the film, plus Moroder's love theme for Clark Kent and Lana Lang (used by Thorne as the basis for his own theme), and ending with a completely synthesized version of the \"Superman II\" main title march.\n\nThis album and the original album for \"Superman II\" were combined for an out-of-print Japanese CD release.\n\nThis release restores the complete score, which is presented on disc 4 of the 8 disc set, with additional music presented on disc 8.\n\nTotal Time: 64:18\n\nTotal Time: 8:57\n\nTotal Time: 18:00\n\nReleased by \"Varèse Sarabande\" in 2000.\n\nAlthough an album release for \"\" was produced in 1987, it was aborted when the film was shortened shortly before release. As with \"Superman III\", it was to contain several songs (by Paul Fishman of Re-Flex) and a small sampling of the score by Alexander Courage (adapting John Williams' themes). In 2008, the 8-CD box set \"Superman: The Music (1978-1988)\" premiered the entire score for \"\" as composed for the long version of the film.

He specialises in the study of Jewish communities around the world, particularly in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Some of these communities have been recognised only since the late 20th century as having ancient Jewish origins.\n\nParfitt is Emeritus Professor of Modern Jewish Studies in the University of London at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), where he was the founding director of the Centre for Jewish Studies. He is now Senior Associate Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. He is Corresponding Senior Fellow of the Académie Royale des Sciences d’Outre-Mer, Koninklijke Academie voor Overzeese Wetenschappen, Belgium and is on the Board as chair of the Academic Advisory Committee of the Paris-based Projet Aladin and is on the Committee of Experts of the New York based Global Hope Coalition. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in the United Kingdom. He was appointed Distinguished Professor at Florida International University in 2012 and Distinguished University Professor in 2018. He is Alumni Fellow at the Hutchins Center, Harvard College. In 2011 he gave the Nathan Huggins Lectures at Harvard College which were published by Harvard University Press. \n\nParfitt has published over 100 articles and written, edited or translated 30 books.\n\nHe was born Vernon Tudor Parfitt in Porth, Wales, in 1944, as the son of Vernon (a headmaster) and Margaret (Sears) Parfitt. He was educated at Loughborough Grammar School.\n\nIn 1964 Parfitt spent a gap year with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) in Jerusalem, where he worked with handicapped people, some of whom were Holocaust survivors. Upon his return to Britain, he studied Hebrew and Arabic at the University of Oxford. In 1968 he was awarded the Goodenday Fellowship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He completed a D.Phil at Oxford with David Patterson and Albert Hourani, on the history of the Jews in Palestine and their relations with their Muslim neighbours. He expanded it for publication by the Royal Historical Society.\n\nIn 1972 Parfitt was appointed lecturer in Hebrew language, literature and history at the University of Toronto, Canada. In 1974 he was appointed Parkes Fellow at the Parkes Institute for the Study of Jewish/non-Jewish Relations at the University of Southampton in England. Shortly afterward, he took up a lectureship in Modern Hebrew at SOAS. His first body of work interrogated the received wisdom about the nature of the revival of the Hebrew language.[6]\n\nHis main academic interests have been: the Sephardi/Mizrahi communities of the Muslim world, Jewish-Muslim relations, Hebrew and Hebrew Literature, Judaising movements, Jewish genetic identity and the discourses surrounding it, attitudes towards Jews and Zionism in South Asia, and Jews in Asia and Africa.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Parfitt undertook covert lecture tours to Jewish Refusenik groups in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. In 1985 he spent several months visiting the various Jewish communities of Asia - including Thailand, Singapore and Japan. There he interested the Emperor's brother, Prince Mikasa, in the Jewish communities of the East. In 1987 he was asked by the Jewish community of Singapore to write an official history of the island's Jews. That same year he visited Syria to write about the situation of its Jewish community for the Minority Rights Group. He was arrested by the Syrian secret police, the \"Mukhabarat,\" during his trip. He describes these events in his first travel book: \"The Thirteenth Gate.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, Parfitt conducted fieldwork in Yemen, researching its ancient Jewish community, and wrote a book on the subject. In \"The Road to Redemption,\" he said that the Yemenite Jews had emigrated to Israel as a result of extreme prejudice, persecution, legal disabilities and because of the rapidly changing economy of the Indian Ocean region. He also researched and presented a BBC documentary called \"The Last Exile\" on this subject. In 2002 he published his \"Lost Tribes of Israel: the History of a Myth.\" One of his themes is that the creation of Israelite and Judaic identities throughout the world, from the Americas to Papua New Guinea, was an innate feature of western colonialism in general, and British Israelism in particular whereby Israelite identities were constructed in the colonies as a means of comprehending a wide range of religious and cultural manifestations. In some cases the colonial effort was supported by the idea that indigenous cultures were descended from the Biblical House of Israel. In his recent work on the origins of race, he consults with British, German and French Enlightenment scholars.\n\nIn 1984 Parfitt was commissioned by the London-based Minority Rights Group to write a report on the Ethiopian Jews who had fled Ethiopia. They had migrated to escape persecution and famine, but were dying in large numbers in the refugee camps along the border between the Sudan and Ethiopia. His visits to the camps coincided with Israel's Operation Moses, which rescued thousands of Ethiopian Jews and took them to Israel. Parfitt's book on the operation was translated into many languages. He later was selected as the Vice-President of the Society for the Study of Ethiopian Jewry (SOSTEJE).\n\nSubsequently, he turned his attention to another black and apparently Jewish group: the Lemba tribe of southern Africa. They claimed descent from some ancient Jewish population. He published \"Journey to the Vanished City\" (1992) about his six-month journey throughout Africa, in which he traced the origins of the tribe to the eastern end of the Hadhramaut in Yemen. There he discovered the ancient city of Sena and origins of the tribe in some migrating Jewish traders. TV programs about the discoveries, and major newspaper coverage, brought Parfitt international attention. He was nicknamed the British 'Indiana Jones,' after a film character.\n\nSeeking more data, in 1996 and later years Parfitt organised Y-DNA studies of Lemba males. These found a high proportion of paternal Semitic ancestry, DNA that is common to both Arabs and Jews from the Middle East. The work confirmed that the male line had descended from a few ancestors from southern Arabia. In recognition of this work, he was made corresponding fellow of the \"Académie Royale des Sciences d’Outre-Mer.\"\n\nThe Lemba have a tradition of having brought a drum, or \"ngoma\", from the Middle East centuries ago. Parfitt noted that their description of the \"ngoma\" was similar to that of the Biblical Ark of the Covenant. He observed that rabbinic sources maintain that there were two Arks of the Covenant: one the ceremonial Ark, covered with gold, which was eventually placed in the Holy of Holies in the Temple; the other the Ark of War, which had been carved from wood by Moses and was a relatively simple affair. Parfitt proposed that the Ark of War may have been taken by Jews across the Jordan River and, citing Islamic sources, suggests that they carried it as they migrated south, while under rule by Arab tribes. The Lemba claim to have brought their ark/ngoma from Arabia at some point in the past. In 2007, Parfitt discovered an object he claimed was a copy of the \"ngoma\".\n\nParfitt wrote \"The Lost Ark of the Covenant: Solving the 2,500 Year Old Mystery of the Fabled Biblical Ark \" (2008), documenting his findings. Associated documentaries were aired on Channel Four and the History Channel. The BBC reported that the discovery of the ngoma \"instilled pride among many of the Lemba\". In 2010 Parfitt was invited to address a symposium in Harare on the subject; attendees included the cabinet and vice-president John Nkomo. The ngoma has been exhibited at the Zimbabwe Museum of Human Sciences. The authentic ngoma was briefly on display but was soon replaced by a replica.\n\nParfitt subsequently turned his interest to Jewish communities in India and the Pacific. His DNA work on the Bene Israel, the origins of whom were obscure, showed that they were descended from males from the Middle East, consistent with their oral histories of origin. These successes led other Judaising groups, including the Gogodala tribe of Papua New Guinea, to seek help in determining their own origins. Parfitt's pioneering work has contributed to the expanding study of the spread of Judaism and Judaising movements throughout the African continent.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11029356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11029356", "title": "Valentine Phantom", "text": "Valentine Phantom\n\nThe Valentine Phantom, often referred to as the Valentine Bandit in media reports, refers to an unidentified individual or group who each Valentine's Day secretly decorate the downtown area of a city in the United States with a series of red hearts printed on sheets of letter-sized paper.\n\nThe reports began in Portland, Maine in 1985, and the perpetrators remain unknown. Speculation about the individual or group which decorates before dawn each February 14 is popular in conversation, and local media, and over the past ten years has emerged as an example of vernacular culture.\n\nThe earliest known occurrence of this phenomenon was 1976 in Portland, Maine. Every year since, red hearts have appeared throughout the city on Valentine's Day morning.\nBeginning in the early 2000s, red hearts drawn on white sheets of paper have been attached to the doors of businesses along the Pearl Street business district in Boulder, Colorado each Valentine's Day, according to reports in the \"Daily Camera\" newspaper. In Boulder, the mysterious Valentine's messenger has been dubbed the \"kissing bandit.\" \n\nIn 2002, the city of Montpelier, Vermont became a part of the yearly tradition, with the added twist of each heart including a poem signed \"The Valentine Phantom\".\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2010, pink hearts appeared up and down St. Johnsbury, Vermont's Railroad & Main Street, even finding their way to the local police and fire department buildings.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2012, this phenomenon spread to Bangor, Maine when Bangorians woke up to a flurry of red and white hearts throughout downtown Bangor and the tradition continues into 2013 with the addition of cute messages and candy.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2017, the bandit allowed a \"Bangor Daily News\" reporter to accompany them on their travels, in return for anonymity. The bandit, after tagging a Planned Parenthood office in Portland, stated that they are normally apolitical but felt \"we could be a bit more progressive this year\". A Planned Parenthood spokesperson stated that a liaison for the bandit contacted them the prior week to request permission to post a heart banner.\n\nMontpelier's incarnation of the phenomenon began in 2002 near the corner of Main Street and State Street. The windows of shops were covered in 8.5\" x 11\" color copies of red hearts. They appeared before dawn, and for the most part were welcome and not seen as a nuisance. In subsequent years the center remained the intersection of Main and State streets, but grew outward to include Langdon Street, Elm Street, and lower State Street near the State House and the Pavilion. This raised speculation that the Valentine Phantom might be a team. \n\nIn 2006, for the first time, the \"bandit\" applied banners with large red hearts around the base of the columns on the portico of the Vermont State House. They were photographed, reproduced on web blogs and on the website of the Friends of the Vermont State House. These same banners were again displayed on the statehouse in 2007. On Valentine's Day 2008, they appeared on the chimney stack of Montpelier High School and on the tower of College Hall at the Vermont College of Fine Arts. In 2009, they were hung over the entrance of the Kellogg-Hubbard Library and from the landslide cliff on Elm Street. In 2010, two heart banners were hung from the Langdon Street Bridge.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2007, the phenomenon became larger, and coincided with a dumping of heavy snow. The \"Times Argus\" reported, \"Despite the snow, however, the Valentine bandit visited the Statehouse and other buildings in Montpelier on Wednesday to put up large red paper hearts. Other state buildings, stores and restaurants were also visited during the night, with business windows throughout downtown Montpelier covered in the red paper hearts – a mystery that has become a Valentine’s Day tradition in the state’s capital city.\" For the first time, sculptural hearts painted red were planted on the public lawn in front of the State House. A blizzard brought a fresh coat of snow setting off the bright red heart sculptures. The Vermont State House Sergeant at Arms, Francis Brooks, allowed the valentine banners and sculptures to remain through the day.\n\nDuring the winter of 2008, the slate roof on the steeple of the Methodist church on Main Street in Montpelier was replaced by Southgate Steeple Jacks. The new slate roof features several red hearts around the base of the steeple. Jay Southgate designed the new roof for the church and was quoted in the Montpelier Bridge saying that the use of the hearts was inspired by Montpelier's Valentine Phantom. Coincidentally, February 14, 2008 was the first sunny, calm day in several weeks, allowing the Southgate crew to resume their work on the roof — that's the day they began to place the red slate of the hearts on the steeple.\n\nOn September 1, 2009, rainbow hearts mimicking the Valentine Bandit appeared around Montpelier to celebrate the legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont. \n\nOn the morning of February 14, 2015, the residents of Montpelier awoke to find that the tradition had been broken; no hearts appeared throughout the city. In response, a group of students from the local high school hung hearts that afternoon, and the Valentine Phantom has struck again each year since.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56248237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56248237", "title": "Wheels of Aurelia", "text": "Wheels of Aurelia\n\nWheels of Aurelia is a visual novel and adventure video game that was developed and published by Santa Ragione, and was released worldwide on 20 September 2016 for Linux, Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, and later released on 4 October 2016 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and a mobile version on 19 October 2017 for iOS. The game was also released on 2 November 2017 for the Nintendo Switch. Its story is set in Italy in 1978 and tells the story of the player-character, a woman named Lella who drives along the Italian motorway \"Via Aurelia\" alongside one or many companions.\n\nFrom a bird's-eye view, the player controls Lella's vehicle and dialogue choices; the game's narrative has a branching dialogue system. On her way across \"Via Aurelia\", she meets hitchhikers who can alter the story's outcomes. While the game is fairly short, it offers 16 different endings. The game was inspired by the \"1986\" arcade game \"Out Run\" and the cult film \"Il Sorpasso\". \"Wheels of Aurelia\" received mixed reviews from critics; while its atmosphere and aesthetics were praised, reviewers thought the gameplay was fitted into the narrative poorly.\n\nThe player controls Lella, a feminist woman driving a sports car who stops in a nightclub to \"find someone to take her away\", looking for a date to help her leave the country. She finds Olga, who later accompanies her for the journey to France, leaving behind the highly political and dangerous Italy. Lella and Olga want to leave the country for different reasons; Lella is attempting to re-convene with her former kidnapper and Olga is attempting to flee to France to abort her unborn child. The players' actions and their interactions with non-player characters in the form of hitchhikers, one of many different endings may be incurred.\n\nWhen the characters reach new locations, a cutscene with the characters placed over a postcard of the area will play. The player can visit Rome, Civitavecchia, Bracciano, Piombino, Siena and Viareggio during the trip, but may visit a limited range of locations per playthrough. The player may change Lella's travel companions, dump hitchikers, and change the vehicle Lella is driving at these locations, purely on the players' choice of dialogue. \"Wheels of Aurelia\" explores many topics, including single parents, fascism and the Mafia. Experiences of the game can range from a car race against a stranger to robbing a bank.\n\n\"Wheels of Aurelia\" follows a female couple in a 1978 road trip across Italy. Unusually for a traditionally story-based visual novel, the player is expected to drive the sports car in game. As the journey progresses, the player-character meets hitchhikers and, through interactions with them, can alter the game's endings. The game features 16 different endings. From start to finish, game playthroughs last around 15 minutes.\n\nThe game sees the player-character called Lella and a partner called Olga, who both want to leave Italy for initially unknown reasons. The two drive an Italian sports car, and attempt to drive the motorway \"Via Aurelia\", where they learn more about themselves, Italy, and bystanders and villages along the way, The game features \"Wheelspedia\", where information discussed in dialogue is added and the player can read about the information being discussed. New cars and vehicles can be unlocked through different endings and circumstances can be changed through dialogue options. Despite having multiple endings and a branching story, the game only offers three dialogue options at a time.\n\nThe game was designed and coded by Santa Ragione's Pietro Righi Riva and Nicolò Tedeschi, with help from Double Fine Productions Anna Kipnis. Kipnis was responsible for the game's dialogue design, a role she worked on with Double Fine Productions. According to the game's creators, \"Wheels of Aurelia\" was developed with a \"unique\" system in place, with each line of dialogue tied treated as a separate topic, setting certain interactions to affect later events. \"Wheels of Aurelia\" was first released as a beta included in a release on Humble Bundle called \"Humble Weekly Bundle: Fantastic Arcade\". This version of the game would be referred to as the \"Fantastic Arcade Beta Edition\".\n\nThe game was inspired by the 1986 arcade game \"Out Run\" and 1962 cult film \"Il Sorpasso\", featuring Commedia all'italiana which the developers attempted to attach to the release. During an interview with designer, producer, and programmer Pietro Riva, noted that \"Wheels\" \"is the natural evolution\" of the \"driving game\" mentality set out in the \"Out Run\" series. Riva also noted that \"Il Sorpasso\" was the \"movie that single-handedly inspired [\"Wheels of Aurelia\"] — the main reference\" Riva also mentions that other driving games were inspiration for the game including 1993's \"World Rally Championship\", and 1994's \"Great 1000 Mile Rally\" as inspiration for the visual aspect of the game. Riva had spent some time discussing with co-developer Nicolò Sala regarding making a game set in Italy before working on the project. Along with this, Riva wanted to research how the country was in the generation before his, \"because it always felt like we were living – as kids – in the aftermath of something important.\"\n\n\"Wheels\"s artwork came from a variety of artists. The environment Italian artist Flaminia Grimaldi, who contributed over 200 assets for the game's Italien landscape, whereas the game's characters were created by New Yorker Patrick Leger; who worked closely with the game's writers to create the characters. Italian game designer couple \"We Are Müesli\" helped to create \"Wheels\"s dialogue; and provided the voice artist recordings for all of the game's characters.\n\nThe game was created using the Unity game engine, with pre-production starting in January 2014. The production was delayed until June 2015 for Santa Ragione to work on \"FOTONICA\", an action first person runner, whilst still working on the imagery, movies, and music for \"Wheels\". Shortly after, \"Wheels\" was placed on Steam Greenlight. The game was eventually greenlit and was released for Linux, Macintosh and Microsoft Windows on 20 September 2016. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 4 October 2016, and the Xbox One version was released on 18 November 2016. The first mobile version of the game was released for iOS on 19 October 2016, and after the release of the Nintendo Switch, the game was released exclusively via the Nintendo eShop the following year on 2 November 2017.\n\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, the Windows version of \"Wheels of Aurelia\" received \"mixed or average reviews\", while the Switch version received \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Italy's \"Eurogamer\" reviewed the PlayStation version, calling the game's soundtrack \"captivating\", and that the game was an \"interesting product\" but stated the game was only suitable for a \"niche audience\". \"IGN Italy\" reviewed the PlayStation version, calling it \"a truly unique game that deserves to be played\".\nCritics praised the game's presentation and graphical interface. \"Kotaku\" was very positive about the game's graphics, saying, \"Playing this game is like playing an Italian neorealist film.\" They praised the game's graphical representation of this type of film, despite it being a modern game \"it still captures the naturalness and honesty of the films of that genre.\" \"Kotaku\" also praised the game's atmosphere, \"\"Wheels of Aurelia\" captures a moment in time when conventions of Italian life were being challenged, and it’s worth getting a little insight into these struggles.\" Rosa Piermarco of \"IGN Italy\" also commented on the games' graphical representation, citing \"mention of merit to the nice low poly graphics and two-dimensional portraits of the characters inspired by the seventies comics, such as those of \"Lanciostory\" and \"Skorpio\"\"\n\n\"Game Informer\" cited the games' \"aesthetically flawless\" graphics and the \"accurate historical reconstruction\"; however, it was less appreciative of the games' driving mechanics and lack of real interaction with the story. Review magazine \"Game Informer\" were also positive about the game, being particularly positive about the game's immersion, with the game being at its \"best when it’s immersing you in the culture it came from\".\nHowever, some reviews questioned the game's substance. \"Edge\" reviewing the Windows version, said it is a \"shame the journey itself can't match the poignancy of the final destination\". When reviewing the Nintendo Switch release, \"Switch Player\" called it \"too short to be engaging\" and a \"disappointing attempt at bringing the Visual Novel genre to the Switch\". \"Switch Player\" also commented on the game's value for money, saying \"Maybe if the game was longer I might’ve had more time to warm into the story and I may have been able to enjoy \"Wheels of Aurelia\" a little more.\" \"Nintendo Life\" also found the game lacking, saying, \"As a visual novel, \"Wheels of Aurelia\" is a lacklustre experience. As a driving game, it’s even worse.\"\n\n"}
