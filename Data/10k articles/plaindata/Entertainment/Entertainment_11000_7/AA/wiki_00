Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the canonical narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.\n\nAlternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's DVD release. These alternative endings are a special type of deleted scene. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.\n\nSome films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.\n\nThe following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:\n\nIn TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.\n\nMany video games also have alternative endings.

The story follows Amy, a nine-year-old girl whom Hartman has compared to \"Anne of Green Gables and Harriet the Spy\" in terms of personality. The series has had two spinoffs, a prose novel entitled Seraphina and the webcomic \"Return of the Mad Bun\". Hartman has stated that she chose to incorporate the dragons shape changing into humans because she found dragons harder to illustrate. Hartman chose to self-publish after facing rejection from traditional publishers, eventually publishing issues 7-12 of the series in a collected volume with funds received from a Xeric Grant.\n\nReception for the series has been positive, with Publishers Weekly favorably comparing it to the writing of Laura Ingalls Wilder.

It is part of the \"Armored Core\" series. The storyline follows the original \"Armored Core\". The game was not released in Europe.\n\nA Raven operating out of Isaac City receives an unusual request. Not only is the request both vague and cryptic, stating simply: \"Infiltrate the underground urban complex, Amber Crown,\", but it also bypasses normal channels of communication and is sent directly to the Raven in question, without anyone else seeing the message. No sender name or corporate affiliation is mentioned, but the monetary reward promised is massive. Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge. With interest piqued, the Raven climbs into the AC and heads toward Amber Crown.\n\n\n\n\"Project Phantasma\" continued from where \"Armored Core\" left off. Players could either start a new game or convert their previous save data from \"Armored Core\". Converting data allowed a player to carry over a number of parts that would otherwise be unavailable to a player who starts a new game like the powerful \"Moonlight\" laser blade. \"Project Phantasma\" was the first AC game to introduce the concept of an Arena; the player was given the opportunity to face off against over 50 opponents of varying difficulty. The Arena was an optional feature, but if a player competed in the Arena they could earn extra credits and unlock new parts for their AC.\n\nOne notable aspect regarding the parts (particularly weapons) in the original Armored Core and its two PS1 expansions is that they are by far the most powerful in the series. For example, the original KARASAWA fired faster than most AST Rifles and Pulse Rifles in later games. The FINGER had 3000 ammo, and the Large Missile came in two styles, one that flew like a regular missile (discontinued after Master of Arena), and the traditional slow (though roughly twice as fast as later versions such as those in Last Raven) version. The slow version had ten missiles as opposed to the current four, and was the longest range missile of the first generation. \n"}

Skills include comedy, puppetry, acrobatics, equestrianism, bear training, tight rope walking, and juggling.\n\nBerousek's dynasty dates back to 1756 when the family appeared in Vilémov. The first performer from the family was Josef Berousek.\n\nThe Cirkus Berousek was founded around 1920 in Bohemia by fourth generation Hynek Ignac Berousek, then taken over by his son Antonin Berousek and renamed Circus Central, and then nationalized in 1951.\n\nAlan Šulc (born 1990 in Prague, Czech Republic) is a world record–holding juggler. He is best known for his bounce juggling and using Irish dancing steps in his juggling performance.\nHe started juggling at the age of five and gave his first live performance at eight years old.\n\nŠulc holds the following awards:\n\nŠulc holds the following world records in solo force bounce jugging:\n\nBohumil Berousek, known professionally as Bobby Berosini is a Czech-born American entertainer best known for his long-running show involving live orangutans.\n\nBerosini emigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1964, and eventually made his way to Las Vegas. He was a fixture at the Stardust Resort & Casino starting in the mid-1970s, and his act was featured in \"Going Ape!\", a 1981 comedy film starring Tony Danza and Danny DeVito. Earlier, in 1978, one of his orangutans, Manis, appeared as Clyde in \"Every Which Way but Loose\" with Clint Eastwood.\n\nIn 1989 a Stardust dancer secretly videotaped Berosini grabbing, slapping, punching and shaking his orangutans before going on stage with them. The dancer, Ottavio Gesmundo, sent the tapes to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and the resulting outcry forced the Stardust to cancel Berosini's act for a few days. He returned to star in the \"Lido de Paris\" at the Stardust until it closed in 1991 and then starred in the resort's \"Enter the Night\" for several years. Although he later moved his act to Branson, Missouri, he has only made sporadic appearances in Las Vegas since then. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service later canceled Berosini's wildlife permit.\n\nBerosini sued Gesmundo, PETA and another animal rights group, the Performing Animal Welfare Society, for defamation and invasion of privacy. In 1990, a jury found in favor of Berosini and awarded him $3.1 million in damages. However, the Nevada Supreme Court threw out the judgment in 1994, saying that the tape was an accurate portrayal of Berosini's behavior and fell within the realm of \"protected opinion.\" It also ruled that Berosini had no expectation of privacy in the crowded backstage area.\n\nThis judgment was affirmed on a rehearing of the case a year later, and in 1996, a Nevada District Court judge ordered Berosini to pay a total of $417,000 in attorneys' fees to PETA and PaWS.\n\nPETA subsequently alleged that Berosini had moved more than $2 million out of the country to avoid paying court costs. Berosini and his wife, Joan, claimed that the money was for a land investment in Central and South America. In February 2000, a federal magistrate ordered Berosini to return the money, finding that Berosini was deliberately hiding his assets. Berosini and PETA agreed to a settlement in which Berosini paid $340,000 in court costs and interest. However, two years later, Berosini was ordered to pay three law firms $250,000 for the time they spent trying to find the $2 million. Berosini contested this judgment four times on appeal and lost each time, and PETA claims that it is considering further legal action against Berosini for filing a frivolous appeal.\n\nBerosini told \"Harper's Magazine\" in 1993 that he and his wife received numerous death threats against themselves and their orangutans in the middle of the night. He also said he had to shop at a different supermarket every day for several months due to threats that the orangutans' food would be poisoned.\n\nMario Berousek (born 14 October 1974 in Prague, Czech Republic) is the fastest club juggler in the world and a world record holding juggler.

It was released worldwide on November 10, 2009 for Microsoft Windows, the PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. A version for OS X was developed by Aspyr and released on May 20, 2014. The Xbox 360 version was made backward compatible for the Xbox One in 2018. It is the sixth installment of the \"Call of Duty\" series and the direct sequel to \"\", continuing the same storyline. It was released in conjunction with two other \"Call of Duty\" games: \"\" for the Nintendo DS, and \"\", a port of \"Call of Duty 4\" adapted by Treyarch for the Wii console.\n\nThe game's campaign follows the Task Force 141, a special forces unit fronted by Captain Soap MacTavish, as they hunt Vladimir Makarov, leader of the Russian Ultranationalist party, and the United States Army Rangers, who are defending the country from a Russian invasion. The game's main playable characters are Sergeant Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson, of the 141, and Private James Ramirez, of the Army Rangers, with Captain MacTavish becoming playable later in the campaign. An expansive multiplayer mode is featured in the game, with several new features and modes that were not seen in its predecessor.\n\nDevelopment for the game began in 2008, when it was still known as \"Call of Duty 6\". It uses the IW 4.0 engine, an improved version of \"Call of Duty 4\"s IW 3.0. Infinity Ward was inspired by real-life conflicts when developing the campaign mode. They initially tested the multiplayer mode by playing an in-house beta version of the game. \"Modern Warfare 2\" was officially announced on February 11, 2009. Teasing of the game began in March, with short trailers being released for the game and, eventually, a full reveal trailer. The multiplayer mode was revealed shortly after. Two downloadable content packs were released for it post-release, each containing four new multiplayer maps.\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2\" has been critically acclaimed by various gaming websites as one of the greatest first-person shooters of all time. Within 24 hours of release, the game sold approximately 4.7 million copies in North America and the United Kingdom. As of early 2018, the game has sold over 25 million copies and still has an active multiplayer base with third party servers being hosted in Melbourne, Australia. In addition to its release, a comic book series based on one of the game's characters was also produced, entitled \"\". Despite the game's success, it was subject to , with one surrounding a playable level that had the player carry out a terror attack on an airport. A sequel, \"\", was released in 2011 and finishes the \"Modern Warfare\" storyline.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" revolves around fast-paced gunfights against enemy combatants. The player controls a soldier, and can perform several actions, including jump, sprint, crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights. When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter their heads-up display (HUD), denoting that they have taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, their health will recover. The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's current ammunition count. The game features traditional guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns at the beginning of each level, but may switch them out with another gun they find. Some guns have attachments, such as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors. The player can also use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat. In some levels, the player will be given special equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser designator.\n\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" has three different game modes: Campaign, Spec Ops, and Multiplayer. Campaign is a single-player mode where the player completes eighteen levels connected by an overarching plot. Each level features a series of objectives to fulfill, and the player will often switch characters between levels. If the player dies during a level, they will respawn at the most recent checkpoint. Levels can be played on one of four difficulties, and each level can be replayed after it has been completed. Spec Ops mode features twenty-three additional levels that can be played individually or cooperatively with a partner. These levels provide specific challenges, such as defusing three bombs within a short period of time. If one player is shot down while playing cooperatively, they will begin crawling, and can shoot enemies with a handgun. If they are not revived by the other player, then they will die and fail the level. There are five tiers of Spec Ops levels, with each tier harder than the previous. Only the first tier is available from the beginning, as later tiers can be unlocked with enough stars. The player earns stars by completing the levels on one of three difficulties, with the number of stars earned corresponding to the difficulty chosen.\n\nMultiplayer mode allows players to compete against each other in team-based and deathmatch-based game types on various maps. Each game type has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete. If the player kills three or more players in a row without dying, they achieve a \"killstreak\", which gives the player a tactical advantage during a match. These include a Predator missile, a sentry gun, and a \"tactical nuke\". Alternatively, if the player dies several times without a kill, they will be rewarded with a \"deathstreak\" bonus, which evens the match for the player. A match ends when either a team or player has reached a predefined number of points, or the allotted time expires in which case the team or player with the most points wins. The player's performance in the Multiplayer is tracked with experience points, which can be earned by killing opposing players, completing objectives, or by completing a match. As the player gains experience, they advance in level, unlocking new weapons. The player will also unlock perks, which modify gameplay elements such as unlimited sprint and increased bullet damage.\n\nDuring the single-player campaign, the player controls five different characters from a first-person perspective. The player primarily controls Sergeant Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson, a British member of an international Special Forces unit named Task Force 141. In addition to Roach, the player will also assume control of Private First Class Joseph Allen (Troy Baker) and Private James Ramirez of the United States Army Rangers. The now Captain John \"Soap\" MacTavish (Kevin McKidd) serves as a senior member of Task Force 141, acting as Roach's superior officer and becomes the playable character in the final three missions of the game. Lastly, the player briefly assumes the role of an astronaut stationed on the International Space Station during the height of the war between the United States and Russia.\n\nThe game's non-playable characters (NPCs) feature prominently in the story: For Task Force 141, Lieutenant Simon \"Ghost\" Riley (Craig Fairbrass), who conceals his face with a skull print balaclava serves as Soap's second in command. For the United States Army Rangers, Sergeant Foley (Keith David), along with his subordinate, Corporal Dunn (Barry Pepper), is initially Joseph Allen's squad leader, and becomes James Ramirez's squad leader later in the story. Lieutenant General Shepherd (Lance Henriksen) is the commander of the United States Army Rangers and Task Force 141. Other supporting characters returning from Call of Duty 4 include Captain John Price (Billy Murray), MacTavish's former commanding officer in the British Special Air Service who was imprisoned in Russia, and Russian informant \"Nikolai\" (Sven Holmberg).\n\nDespite the efforts of the U.S. Marine Corps and British Special Air Service in the previous game, the ultranationalists seize control of the Russian Federation, making Imran Zakhaev a martyr and straining diplomatic relations with the United States. Shortly after this, an ultranationalist named Vladimir Makarov, Zakhaev's right-hand man, begins a campaign of revenge against the West, by committing acts of terrorism on European and International soil over the course of five years.\n\nIn 2016, Private First Class Joseph Allen participates in a military operation alongside United States Army Rangers stationed in Afghanistan, by assisting them in taking back a city from insurgents. Impressed by Allen's capabilities, General Shepherd recruits him into Task Force 141. While Allen prepares for an upcoming assignment, Captain John \"Soap\" MacTavish and Sergeant Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson infiltrate a Russian airbase in the Tian Shan mountains to retrieve an Attack Characterization System (ACS) module from a downed American satellite.\n\nAllen is soon sent on an undercover mission for the CIA, joining Vladimir Makarov in a mass shooting at an airport in Moscow, Russia. Afterwards, Makarov kills Allen, aware of his true identity, and leaves his body behind to spark a war between Russia and the United States. Outraged by an apparent American-sponsored terrorist attack, Russia retaliates by launching a surprise invasion on the East Coast of the United States. With no evidence of Makarov's involvement in the airport massacre, Task Force 141 is sent to Rio de Janeiro to capture his arms dealer, Alexandro Rojas. They succeed and learn that Makarov's nemesis is being held in a Russian gulag. They assault the gulag and rescue the prisoner: Captain Price, Soap's previous commanding officer in the SAS.\n\nPrice agrees to help Task Force 141 but insists on ending the United States' war with Russia. After raiding a Russian port, Price launches a ballistic missile towards Washington, D.C. and detonates it in the upper atmosphere. The resulting EMP blast disables all electronic devices across the eastern seaboard, giving the Americans a much-needed advantage. Soldiers fighting in D.C. narrowly avoid a bombing run of Russian-occupied strategic structures by the United States Air Force, lighting green flares atop the White House to show that the city remains in American hands.\n\nMeanwhile, Task Force 141 narrows Makarov's hiding place to two locations; an aircraft boneyard in Afghanistan, and Makarov's safehouse on the Georgian-Russian border. Roach and Simon \"Ghost\" Riley successfully raid the safehouse, but are then betrayed and murdered by Shepherd. It soon becomes evident that Shepherd is the catalyst of the Russian-U.S. war, intent on cementing his status as a national hero and prolonging military action as revenge for the men he lost to the nuclear device five years earlier, during the .\n\nPrice and Soap learn of Shepherd's betrayal and escape a battle between his and Makarov's forces at the boneyard. After learning of Shepherd's mountain base in Afghanistan from Makarov, Price and Soap raid the base to take revenge on Shepherd in a suicide mission. The duo pursue Shepherd's boat, and Price manages to shoot down his helicopter extraction as he and Soap tumble over a waterfall. A dazed Soap stumbles towards the crash site and attempts to kill Shepherd, but is stabbed in the chest. While Price arrives and engages Shepherd in a fist fight, Soap pulls the knife out of his chest and throws it at Shepherd, killing him. Nikolai arrives and helps Price evacuate Soap for medical attention.\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2\" was originally announced as \"Call of Duty 6\". The game was first announced under the title \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" by Activision on December 3, 2008. Activision subsequently retracted its announcement, stating that any information about an upcoming \"Call of Duty\" game was \"speculative.\" Infinity Ward then asserted that it had not officially confirmed its latest project at that time. On February 11, 2009, Activision officially announced \"Modern Warfare 2\" and set a tentative release date for \"Holiday 2009.\" The game was tested in an internal beta by the development team. While both \"Call of Duty 4\" and \"\" had been preceded by public multiplayer betas, no such beta was released for \"Modern Warfare 2\" because it was determined that, according to Community Manager Robert Bowling, no public beta was needed unless the internal beta did not provide adequate feedback.\n\nInfinity Ward announced on October 2009 that the PC version of \"Modern Warfare 2\" would not support the use of user-run dedicated servers or in-game console commands. This announcement was received poorly by some members of the PC community, eventually instigating a response from Infinity Ward in an attempt to put the community at ease. During brainstorming sessions, an idea came forth on what if the ending of Modern Warfare was a loss, leading to the sequel. In an interview with Jesse Stern, he talked to producers of Infinity Ward with ideas such as \"outbreaks, viruses, chemical warfare, and even outlandish things such as aliens and the living dead.\" Stern mentioned having the game based on real-life conflicts before they halted further planning at first due to events in the 2008 South Ossetia war and in the Mumbai terrorist attacks.\n\nThe game utilizes the in-house IW 4.0 game engine, which is claimed to be a generation beyond the capabilities of the engine used in \"Call of Duty 4\". Although proprietary, the game is based on an unspecified id Tech engine, and can accommodate larger worlds, enhanced graphic detail, and more efficient rendering. Infinity Ward has addressed the issue of enemies that continually respawn at different points of a level. The developer demonstrated that the game engine uses a \"dynamic AI\", which has replaced the infinite respawn system and allows enemies to act more independently. These \"smarter\" enemies are designed to actively seek out and drive the player forward through a level, and can break away from set behaviors such as following a designated route in order to attack. The player cannot depend on enemies to be found in the same locations as a previous play-through because enemies will behave differently each time a level is played.\n\nOn August 20, 2009, Robert Bowling revealed through Twitter that Kevin McKidd, Craig Fairbrass, Barry Pepper, Keith David, and Glenn Morshower were confirmed voice actors for the game. It was later confirmed that McKidd would voice the protagonist, \"Soap\" MacTavish. Fairbrass, who voiced Gaz in \"Call of Duty 4\", provided voice work for \"Ghost\". Billy Murray reprised his role as Captain Price from \"Call of Duty 4\". Rapper 50 Cent provided voice work for the Special Ops and multiplayer modes, portraying \"one of the squad [member] voices.\" The main theme of \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" was provided by Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer, while the rest of the score was composed by Lorne Balfe. The soundtrack was released on June 1, 2010. The iTunes page for the soundtrack incorrectly lists Zimmer as the soundtrack's only composer.\n\nOn March 25, 2009, a teaser trailer for the game was revealed at the Game Developer Choice Awards ceremony in San Francisco. The teaser was posted on Infinity Ward's website, and released on the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Network a short time later. A second teaser was released on May 10, 2009 and showed gameplay features such as snowmobile driving and underwater actions. The teaser announced that the game would be \"revealed\" on TNT during the NBA Eastern Conference Finals on May 24, 2009. The \"reveal\" was the first full-length trailer, which debuted extended sequences of actual in-game scenes and combat; the trailer was subsequently made available on the \"Modern Warfare 2\" official website, which was kept updated for the occasion. A fourth trailer was released on July 27, 2009, and showed the first footage of the game's multiplayer mode. On October 4, 2009, a second full-length cinematic trailer was released and revealed that part of the game would take place in a war-torn Washington, D.C.\n\nOn July 21, 2009, Infinity Ward's Robert Bowling revealed through Twitter that a \"Modern Warfare 2\" controller was in the works. Peripherals manufacturer Mad Catz was contracted by Activision to create a line of \"Modern Warfare 2\" controllers and accessories for all platforms that the game would be available on. Activision stated, in its quarterly earnings report, that pre-orders for the game had broken a company record; more copies of \"Modern Warfare 2\" had been pre-ordered than any other game that the company had published before. In September 2009, Monster Energy teamed up with Activision to bring special redeemable codes on the Monster Energy website, where people may submit codes included in Monster Energy packs to redeem items such as Xbox 360 Premium Themes and a \"Modern Warfare 2\" Map Pack code.\n\nThe original teaser trailer confirmed that the game's title of \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" was officially shortened to just \"Modern Warfare 2\". After photographs of the official retail boxes were posted by Robert Bowling, Activision confirmed that the standard-edition \"Modern Warfare 2\" packaging would feature the \"Call of Duty\" brand logo in order to reflect the game's association with the \"Call of Duty\" franchise. It is speculated that the decision was influenced by findings that brand awareness for the game was significantly lower without the \"Call of Duty\" logo. However, the developers still prefer to simply call the game \"Modern Warfare 2\" as they consider it a new IP. The menus in the game also refer to the title as simply \"Modern Warfare 2\".\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2\" was released in four different retail versions across the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms: Standard, Hardened, Veteran, and Prestige. The standard version consists of the game and an instructional manual, and is the only version available for the Microsoft Windows platform. The Hardened Edition consists of the game and manual (which are packaged in a steel book case), an art book, and a token that allows one to download \"Call of Duty Classic\", a hi-definition version of the original \"Call of Duty\" game, from Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation Store (\"Classic\" was released individually on December 2, 2009). The Prestige Edition contains all of the elements of the Hardened Edition, but also includes a set of fully functioning night vision goggles, imprinted with the \"Modern Warfare 2\" logo, and a stand modeled after the head of the character \"Soap\" MacTavish. The goggles are powered by five AA batteries and can see up to 50 feet in absolute darkness.\n\nOn September 15, 2009, Activision and Microsoft jointly announced a special, limited \"Modern Warfare 2\" version of the Xbox 360 with a 250GB hard disk. The unit is highlighted by special game product branding and includes two wireless controllers and a headset. This is the first Xbox 360 to come with a 250GB hard drive. On September 18, UK and rep of Ireland retailer GAME announced a Veteran Edition of \"Modern Warfare 2\" would be exclusive to rep of Ireland and UK. It will come with a 12\" (30.5 cm) tall statue of \"Soap\" MacTavish with interchangeable arms and weapons; has the same contents as the Hardened Edition. In September 2009, a Veteran Statue Bundle of \"Modern Warfare 2\" was posted on the EB Games website and is available for all platforms.\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2\" was ported to OS X by Aspyr years after the game's original release. This version was released on May 20, 2014, alongside the OS X port for \"\". The Xbox 360 version of \"Modern Warfare 2\" was made backward compatible with the Xbox One on August 28, 2018.\n\nActivision announced that two downloadable map packs would be released for \"Modern Warfare 2\". At E3 2009, Microsoft stated that these map packs would first be made available for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live before they would be released for other platforms. Robert Bowling stated that the community response to the game and the first ten downloadable map packs would be used in designing other potential map packs.\n\nThe first map pack, titled the \"Stimulus Package,\" was released first for Xbox Live on March 30, 2010 and for PlayStation Network and PC on May 4, 2010 in North America. The pack contains five maps: reincarnations of the \"Crash\" and \"Overgrown\" maps from \"Call of Duty 4\", and three new maps: \"Bailout\", a multi-level apartment complex; \"Storm\", an industrial park littered with heavy machinery; and \"Salvage\", an abandoned car junkyard in the middle of the snow. Within 24 hours of its release, it was downloaded over one million times. Within the first week it had been downloaded 2.5 million times, breaking Xbox Live DLC records. In addition to integrating the maps into all existing game types, the Stimulus Package adds two new game modes, randomizing the built-in game types in either normal or hardcore mode.\n\nActivision released the second downloadable map pack, titled the \"Resurgence Package\", exclusively for Xbox Live on June 3, 2010 in North America. This release was followed by the PlayStation Network and PC versions on July 6 in North America and on July 7 worldwide. The package includes five new multiplayer maps: reincarnations of the \"Strike\" and \"Vacant\" maps from \"Call of Duty 4\", and three new maps: \"Carnival\", a desolated amusement park; \"Trailer Park\", a mobile home park; and \"Fuel\", an oil refinery. Both of the map packs were made available for purchase on OS X on May 20, 2014, when the OS X port of the game was released.\n\nA six-part comic book mini-series related to the game has also been produced. Announced by Robert Bowling on August 17, 2009, \"\" is focused on the backstory of the character Ghost, who appears in the video game as a member of Task Force 141. The series is published by WildStorm. The first issue of the series debuted on November 11, 2009.\n\nA fan-made prequel to \"Modern Warfare 2\", entitled \"\", premiered at . The video was produced by We Can Pretend, visual effects by The Junction, and was endorsed by Activision. The first film, Find Makarov, was a non-canon fan made film. Activision contacted We Can Pretend about the video and helped produce a second canon short film, Find Makarov: Operation Kingfish. The prequel tells the story of how Task Force 141 first tried to capture Vladimir Makarov, who was known then as Kingfish. It also tells how Soap got his facial scars, and how Price was captured and incarcerated in a gulag.\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2\" received universal critical acclaim, especially its console versions. Reviewers praised the in-depth story mode, mini missions, and multiplayer.\n\n1UP.com stated \"Mixing real-world locations with bombastic set-pieces \"MW2\" continues the guided, thrill-ride experiences of its predecessor, and adds even more depth to its multiplayer offerings. It might not have fixed all the problems from the first game, but there's just so much quality content packed into this game that it will almost certainly be one of the most-played games in your library for a long time to come\". \"Game Informer\" noted \"Modern Warfare 2 is a masterpiece of careful iteration, with an unmatched presentation and a well of content that will take months to run dry\". IGN commented \"For those planning to check out everything Modern Warfare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign– you're looking at a no-brainer purchase\". GameTrailers stated \"The air of unpredictability and the care that was paid to each separate element puts it in lofty company. The multiplayer hasn't received an overhaul, but considering most shooters are still playing catch-up with Call of Duty 4, the tweaks and twists make it the best multiplayer shooting experience in the industry. Few games manage to meet such high expectations\". \"Computer and Video Games\" called the game \"Loud, epic and incredibly polished, [and] this year's biggest must-have shooter\".\n\nCriticisms of the game are directed towards a variety of aspects, but focus on the short length of the single player campaign. IGN's Mark Bozon remarks that the single-player of \"\"Modern Warfare 2\" is surprisingly short, and doesn't live up to the standard set by previous \"Call of Duty\" games.\" In addition, many reviewers have complained about the lack of innovation to the formula of the series.\n\n\"Famitsu\" named \"Modern Warfare 2\" as the number one game on the top 10 video games sold in 2009, beating games such as \"\", \"\", \"Halo 3\" and \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". It also gave the game a score of 39/40, being one of the few Western games released in Japan to have the same score as \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n\nAccording to preliminary sales figures from Activision, \"Modern Warfare 2\" sold approximately 4.7 million units in the United States and the UK combined in the first 24 hours of its release. The total revenue from first day sales in the U.S. and the UK was $310 million, making \"Modern Warfare 2\" the biggest entertainment launch in history at the time, surpassing in revenue its predecessor, \"\", as well as items from other media types. After five days of sales, the game had earned revenue figures of $550 million worldwide. As of January 18, 2010, it has taken over $1 billion in sales. Activision also claims that \"Modern Warfare 2\" had 8 million players online within the first five days, constituting the largest 'army' of players in the world. On March 8, 2010, Robert Bowling announced that the game had amassed 25 million unique players. In June 2010, Activision's CFO Thomas Tippl revealed that the game had sold 20 million copies. In August 2011, Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg revealed that the game had sold 22 million copies. A month later in September 2011, \"Modern Warfare 3\" producer Mark Rubin, said that the game's sales are between 28 and 29 million. In November 2013, IGN put the game's sales at 22.7 million.\n\nAccording to the NPD Group, \"Modern Warfare 2\" sold approximately 4.2 million units for the Xbox 360 and 1.87 million units for the PlayStation 3 in the U.S. during the month of November 2009. In Japan, \"Modern Warfare 2\" sold 64,000 copies for the PlayStation 3 and 42,000 copies for the Xbox 360 in its first week of sales. The game later sold 117,000 copies on the PlayStation 3 and 61,000 on the Xbox 360. Anita Frazier of the NPD Group reported in March 2010 that the game had sold slightly under 10 million copies in the U.S. alone. The game is the second best-selling game of all time in both the UK and the U.S.\n\nAfter it became backward compatible with the Xbox One, the NPD Group reported that \"Modern Warfare 2\" was the eighth-best selling video game in the United States during August 2018. It had sold more copies in that month than the then-most recent entry in the series, \"\", which came out in November 2017. During the previous month, before becoming backward compatible, \"Modern Warfare 2\" was at only number 321 on the best sellers list.\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2\" received awards from various gaming sites and publications, it gained high praise from some video game magazines. At the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, \"Modern Warfare 2\" received the Best Shooter and Best Multiplayer awards. Both GameSpy and GameTrailers gave the game the \"Best Overall Game of 2009\" award and received from \"GameTrailers\" overall six awards. GameSpot and Metacritic, both gave it the \"Best Xbox 360 Game\" award, the Pakistani game reviewing site, PakGamers, has awarded \"Modern Warfare 2\" with 'Best Xbox 360 Game of 2009'. and from GameTrailers received the game the \"Best Multiplayer\" award including the \"Best First-Person Shooter\" award.\n\nVarious portions of the campaign have caused some , including the of a massacre carried out in a Russian airport, on the mission \"No Russian\", the fourth mission in the game.\n\nAnders Behring Breivik claims in his manifesto that he used this video game to perpetrate the 2011 Norway attacks. Coop Norway, a chain of retail stores in Norway, removed the game from its shelves as a result of this attack.\n\nA YouTube user claimed that two paintings in the multiplayer map Favela offended Muslims. Activision removed the controversial paintings and apologized for its offense to Muslims. The amended Favela map was added back into the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game, however was permanently taken out of the PC version.\n\nAfter the successful hack on the PlayStation 3 in January 2011, some \"Modern Warfare 2\" players on the PlayStation 3 have had their stats hacked or completely deleted. Infinity Ward replied that their advice was to play in private games, waiting for Sony to fix the problems on the platform side, saying that they could not patch the security problem themselves. \n"}
{"id": "946852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=946852", "title": "Cassino (card game)", "text": "Cassino (card game)\n\nCassino, also known as Casino, is an Italian fishing card game for two, three, four (possibly in two partnerships), or even theoretically five players. It is the only one to have penetrated the English-speaking world. First recorded in 1797, it seems to have been heavily elaborated in 19th-century American practice. It is mostly played by two with a standard deck of playing cards, the object of the game being to score 21 points by fishing up cards displayed on the table. It is very similar to and probably descended from the Italian game Scopa.\n\nThe dealer deals four cards to each player and four cards face up in the center. Traditionally, the deal is in twos: two cards at a time to each player. The remainder of the deck is temporarily put aside. After everyone has played their four cards, another hand of four cards is dealt to each player from the remaining cards (two at a time), but no more cards are dealt to the table after the first deal. After these cards have been played there is another deal, and this continues until all 52 cards have been dealt. The dealer announces \"cards\" when dealing the last cards. After the last cards have been played, and the hand scored, the deal passes to the left for the next round.\n\nBeginning with the player to the dealer's left, each player plays one card at a time, performing one (or more) of the following actions:\n\n\nPlayers may perform two of the above actions only when pairing and combining simultaneously; \"e.g.\" a player may take a 3, a 4 and a 7 with his own seven.\n\nPlayers with builds on the table are limited in the actions they are permitted to make. This is described in more detail below.\n\nFace cards do not have a denomination in Cassino and are not available for building. The face-cards may only be paired one at a time; if there are two queens on the table, only one queen can be paired up. This removes the possibility of a so-called \"orphan\" face card remaining and preventing further sweeps.\n\nAn ace has a numerical value of 1.\n\nCards are usually left on the table after each player's final hand is exhausted. These cards are given to the last player to take in cards through pairing or combining. It is common for the dealer, if dealt a face-card in the final hand, to hold this until the final play, as they are certain to pair with it.\n\nUnder the first type of building, a player may lay one card on top of another if their total equals the total of a card in their hand, and announce that the two cards are built to the total. For example, a player may build a 2 onto a 7 and announce \"building nine,\" provided they have a 9 in their hand. The two cards cannot be split up for pairing or combining and are treated as a single nine.\n\nBuilds of this type may be taken in by any player by pairing. The building player's adversaries may also take in a build by combination, increasing the capturing number; that is, an eight build may be combined with an ace if an adversary holds a nine. Any player may also continue to build on a build, for example, a seven build could be built to nine by a player with a 2 and a 9. The player who originally builds may also re-build, but only if they hold all appropriate cards: they would have to hold both a 7 and a 9 to make the required building steps.\n\nUnder the second type of building, called \"multiple building,\" \"natural building\", or \"double building,\" a player may lay one card on top of another if their values are the same, and announce that the two cards are built together. That is, a player can place a 7 on top of another 7, or on top of a 5 and a 2 which have been built to 7, and announce \"building sevens,\" provided that he has a 7 in his hand. The built cards are gathered only with another 7. As with the first build type, a player must hold the card necessary to gather his build for the natural build to be permissible. Importantly, the capturing number of a multiple build can never be changed.\n\nAn optional rule is that, when building in this manner, players may combine other cards on the table, and build in the first manner. For example, suppose the cards on the table are 2 K 6 5 8, and the player holds a 3 and an 8. They may play their 3 onto the 5 to \"build eight\" and in the same move \"build eights\" by gathering the 5-3, the 8, and the 6-2 together onto one pile, taking in all five cards on their next play.\n\nBuilding exists as a means of protecting cards from being captured by adversaries. The first form of building is a weaker form of protection, and primarily protects cards against combination by mid-to-high range cards. Natural building is a much stronger protection, and prevents adversaries from taking cards unless they hold a card of specific face value, one of which the builder already knows resides in their own hand.\n\nThe value of building decreases significantly as the number of players in the game increases. In a two-player game, one requires only one adversary to be bereft of the necessary cards; in a four-player game, one requires three adversaries to be lacking the necessary cards to steal a build. As such, building effectively in a two-player game can be very advantageous, but in a four-player game is very difficult.\n\nAt least three rule variants exist dictating the actions which may be taken by a player who has a build on the table:\nWhile Hoyle recommends variant 1, all variants are very common in different regions. The regional variant of this rule in particular should always be checked before play.\n\nWhich variant is used changes the tactics, particularly in a two-player game. Under variant 1, the builder has a profound advantage; if they know that their adversary lacks the cards necessary to steal their build, they can often take several cards trailed by their adversary before taking in their build at the end of the round. Variant 2 allows the adversary to trail a card they wish to subsequently capture without the risk of it being taken, reducing the builder's advantage.\n\nThe round is over when the stock has been exhausted, and the last deal played. Players count their tricks and score points as follows:\n\n\nIf \"most cards\" or \"most spades\" are held by two or more players, no points are awarded in that category.\n\nThus there are 11 points to be won in each round if there are no sweeps scored and there is not a tie for number of cards. Typically, when at least one player has reached a score of 21 or more at the end of a round, the winner is the player to score the highest after tallying points.\n\nIn one two-player variation, a player can call for a game to be concluded once they are convinced they hold sufficient cards to bring their score to 21; if they do have 21 points, they win regardless of their adversary's score; if they do not have 21 points, their adversary wins.\n\nIf one player has won the entire 11 points, some rules state that this player will be awarded an extra point for 12 total points in the round. Other rules state that this is a \"skunk\" if it occurs in the first round, and therefore that player wins. In other variations, taking all traditional 11 points in a single round is an automatic win, no matter when it occurs.\n\nA sweep is declared by a player who manages to capture all face-up cards from the table. In some localities, each sweep is worth an additional point. The opponent has no move except to trail, and a follow-on sweep may result. Points for sweeps are awarded after the base 11 points, in the event that two players reach 21 in the same round. In another variation, trailing the five of spades sweeps the table, the sweep giving one point.\n\nThere is a variation in which sweeps are scored as they occur; if the sweeper had 20 points (or more, due to a tie score), the sweep would end the round instantly. A scoring variation in which each point card is scored as it is captured also exists.\n\nIn a variation devised in Michigan, a player who defaults on his duty after building gives up 2 points at the time of the violation. This is sometimes an acceptable cost to trap cards from the other player in builds the player cannot take. Sweeps also score 2 points. In a series of \"rounds to 5,\" any three instant scores (sweeps or defaults) against the same player ends the round.\n\nThese sudden-death variations make short-term tactics more important in certain situations than the longer-term goal of achieving the high score for the round.\n\nIn some regions, all four face-cards of the same rank may be gathered simultaneously. This allows natural building with face-cards, while still removing the possibility of an \"orphan\" card. However, this provides no particular advantage if all four face cards are shared between one player and the table, as is necessary to build in such a manner.\n\nAny pairs dealt to the table at the start of the round may be automatically granted to the first player to move, regardless of whether or not that player has a card to capture them. These cards cannot be built upon, but multiple pairs may constitute an automatic sweep if the table is cleared this way. This rule variation is intended to counteract the advantage of later players' ability to poach or modify builds started by the first player, by awarding extra points at the start.\n\nFive-player Cassino can be played by removing the deuces of hearts, diamonds and clubs, and by giving an extra card to each player on the last deal.\n\nIn Royal Cassino, face cards are given number values upon which building may occur: jacks count as 11, queens as 12, kings as 13. For example, a player could combine a jack and a two with a king, since 11+2=13, and all applicable building laws remain. An Ace is 1 or 14, the player's choice. If trailed, it is not yet determined. If not, it is fixed. There are no 'Face Cards'. Sweeps do not count. The total points is always 11. You may play to 6 or 21. Ties are possible if no one has the majority of spades, broken by another hand played for 6.\n\nIn Buckeye Cassino, all rules of Royal Cassino are inherited. In addition, the ten of diamonds ('Big Ten') holds two values: ten and eleven, poking fun at college basketball's Big Ten Conference, which then consisted of 11 teams.\n\nIn the Trailing-royals Cassino variant, orphaned face cards are not considered a problem. Face cards may be naturally built or paired in any way, so a player may gather three of the same face card simultaneously. The remaining face card will be an orphan, because there is no card left with which to capture it. Such cards remain on the table until the end of the round, and are taken by whoever performed the final capture, as are all other cards left on the table. This method of play does not pair well with the preceding variant that rewards sweeps, because having orphaned cards on the table prevents sweeps.\n\nPluck Cassino is an interesting and popular modern variation that follows all the rules of classic Cassino, with an optional additional play option called \"pluck\". Each player has one opportunity each time cards are dealt to \"pluck\" a card from the table and add it to their pile of \"won\" cards. Players still need to play a card on their turn, plucking is an additional move that they can make either before or after playing their card. The player may pluck at any time during play of that deal, with the following restrictions:\n\nThe gameplay of Portuguese Cassino is the same as the Italian version, except for the following differences:\n\n\nIf both players/teams finish the round with 26 cards each, the player/team with the most spades is awarded the points for most cards.\n\nCalifornia Cassino is a variation for two, three, four or six players, played with a standard deck of cards. The object is to score the most points through acquiring certain cards or by acquiring a certain number of cards.\n\nThe dealer deals four cards to each player, one at a time, and, in the first deal, four cards face up to the table. This is the only point at which cards are placed on the table by the dealer. Beginning with the player to the dealer's left, each player plays one card at a time, performing one of the following actions:\n\n\nFace cards don't have a denomination and are not available for combining or building, though multiple face cards can be paired simultaneously. For example, if a player has a queen in their hand and two queens lie on the table, that player can acquire all three queens.\n\nWhile other forms of cassino use \"sweeps,\" a point for clearing the table, California Cassino prohibits points based on sweeps. Cards are usually left on the table after each player's final hand is exhausted. These cards are given to the last player to take in cards through pairing or combining.\n\nThe round is over when the deck has been exhausted and the last deal played. Players count their cards and score points as follows:\n\n\nThere are 11 points to be won in each round. If \"most cards\" or \"most spades\" are held by two or more players, no points are awarded in those respective categories. The number of rounds played is determined by the number of players present. Each player must deal twice in a complete match, so if there are 3 players, then there are 6 rounds of play. At the end of the 6 rounds - the player with the highest score is the winner.\n\nDiamond Cassino is a variant of Cassino which is similar to standard Cassino, but it is not played with the picture cards. It is, therefore, played with a forty-card pack. Players are dealt three cards each, and four cards are dealt to the table; these are the cards which the players aim to capture. In this game, players get points if they capture all aces, and extra points if they capture the seven of diamonds. Diamond Cassino has been described as an Italo-American version of Scopone.\n\nIn this game, each player is dealt three cards, and five are dealt to the table. Players may trail or take cards from the table, if they have cards which match the cards on the table, or if they have two cards which add up to a card on the table and equal the table card's value. In this game, Jacks are worth eleven points, Queens are worth twelve points and Kings are worth thirteen points. Game ends when a player finally clears all the cards from the table. (SOURCE: The Penguin Book of Card Games).\n\nTablanette is said to be of Russian provenance. In this game, each player has six cards, and a player with a jack may use it to clear the whole table. At the end of a round, players score points for holding the most cards, and extra points if they are holding picture\ncards.\n\nIn Spade Cassino, players are awarded two points for gathering the jack of spades, and one point for each additional spade, in addition to the one point awarded to the player with the most spades. This lifts the number of points awarded in one round to 25. A game of Spade Cassino is usually played to 61.\n\nIn Draw Cassino, players draw a replacement card each time they make a play, so that they always have four cards in hand (until the end), rather than being dealt cards in discrete rounds of four.\n\n"}

{"id": "274362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274362", "title": "Core War", "text": "Core War\n\nCore War is a 1984 programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called \"warriors\") compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called \"Redcode\".\n\nAt the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction in turn. The goal of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate (which happens if they execute an invalid instruction), leaving the victorious program in sole possession of the machine.\n\nThe earliest published version of Redcode defined only eight instructions. The ICWS-86 standard increased the number to 10 while the ICWS-88 standard increased it to 11. The currently used ICWS-94 standard has 16 instructions. However, Redcode supports a number of different addressing modes and (from ICWS-94) instruction modifiers which increase the actual number of operations possible to 7168. The Redcode standard leaves the underlying instruction representation undefined and provides no means for programs to access it. Arithmetic operations may be done on the two address fields contained in each instruction, but the only operations supported on the instruction codes themselves are copying and comparing for equality.\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of versions of Redcode exist. The earliest version described by A. K. Dewdney differs in many respects from the later standards established by the International Core War Society, and could be considered a different, albeit related, language. The form of Redcode most commonly used today is based on a draft standard submitted to the ICWS in 1994 that was never formally accepted, as the ICWS had become effectively defunct around that time. Development of Redcode, however, has continued in an informal manner, chiefly via online forums such as the codice_2 newsgroup.\n\nWarriors are commonly divided into a number of broad categories, although actual warriors may often combine the behavior of two or more of these. Three of the common strategies (\"replicator\", \"scanner\" and \"bomber\") are also known as paper, scissors and stone, since their performance against each other approximates that of their namesakes in the well-known playground game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an understanding of \"Core War\" strategies, a programmer can create a warrior to achieve certain goals. Revolutionary ideas come once in a while; most of the time, however, programmers base their programs on already published warriors. Using optimizers such as OptiMax or core-step optimizer tools, a more effective warrior can be created.\n\nWarriors can also be generated by genetic algorithms or genetic programming. Programs that integrate this evolutionary technique are known as \"evolvers\". Several evolvers were introduced by the \"Core War\" community and tend to focus on generating warriors for smaller core settings. The latest evolver with significant success was \"µGP\" which produced some of the most successful nano and tiny warriors. Nevertheless, evolutionary strategy still needs to prove its effectiveness on larger core settings.\n\n\"Core War\" was inspired by a self-replicating program called Creeper and a subsequent program called Reaper that destroyed copies of Creeper. Creeper was created by Bob Thomas at BBN. Dewdney was not aware of the origin of Creeper and Reaper and refers to them as a rumor originating from Darwin and the worm experiments of Shoch and Hupp. The 1984 \"Scientific American\" article on \"Core War\" nevertheless cites the game \"Darwin\", played by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris, and Douglas McIlroy at Bell Labs in 1961. The word \"Core\" in the name comes from magnetic-core memory, an obsolete random-access memory technology.\n\nThe first description of the Redcode language was published in March 1984, in \"Core War Guidelines\" by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney. The game was introduced to the public in May 1984, in an article written by Dewdney in \"Scientific American\". Dewdney revisited \"Core War\" in his \"Computer Recreations\" column in March 1985, and again in January 1987.\n\nThe International Core Wars Society (ICWS) was founded in 1985, one year after Dewdney's original article. The ICWS published new standards for the Redcode language in 1986 and 1988, and proposed an update in 1994 that was never formally set as the new standard. Nonetheless, the 1994 draft was commonly adopted and extended, and forms the basis of the \"de facto\" standard for Redcode today. The ICWS was directed by Mark Clarkson (1985–1987), William R. Buckley (1987–1992), and Jon Newman (1992–); currently the ICWS is defunct.\n\nRedcode is the programming language used in \"Core War\". It is executed by a virtual machine known as a \"Memory Array Redcode Simulator\", or \"MARS\". The design of Redcode is loosely based on actual CISC assembly languages of the early 1980s, but contains several features not usually found in actual computer systems.\n\nBoth Redcode and the MARS environment are designed to provide a simple and abstract platform without the complexity of actual computers and processors. Although Redcode is meant to resemble an ordinary CISC assembly language, it differs in many ways from \"real\" assembly.\n\nDevelopment of implementations of the game continued over the years by several authors. \nThere are multiple versions of the game available, ported for several platforms. For instance \"pMARS\" which is open source software with source code on Sourceforge, or the SDL based \"SDL pMARS\" for Windows.. Recently a fully web based simulator has been created https://www.corewar.io/ removing the need to download any platform specific tooling.\n\nThe common implementation pMars was downloaded 30,000 times between 2000 and 2017 from Sourceforge.\n\n"}
{"id": "39530297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39530297", "title": "Daemonica", "text": "Daemonica\n\nDaemonica is a 3D action-adventure game with RPG elements that was developed by Czech companies RA Images and Cinemax. The game is divided into 5 acts. Cinemax and RA Images planned a sequel to the game but it was cancelled.\n\nDaemonica tells a story of Haresh al-Dorem, the beast hunter, who is known as Nicholas Farepoynt. In the prologue, the player finds out that Nicholas was born as Nicholas Mortimer a son of Roger Mortimer and queen Isabella. who were responsible for the death of King Edward II of England. When Mortimer was executed, Nicholas was sent to a church in France and was renamed Farepoynt. He later became a mercenary and joined the English army in the Hundred Years' War. When he returned to England he met Clarice, a beast hunter. Beast hunters hunt serial killers and other \"human beasts\". They have knowledge of an ancient language of Daemonica. It allows them to call a demon Dahn-en-nyan the soul bearer who can help them to talk with the dead if they know certain facts about the dead. Hunters can also call a demon Marghet-en-dryat who can bring the dead back but there is no known case of a hunter surviving the ritual. Clarice taught Nicholas until they worked on a case in York. Clarice made a mistake that cost her life. Nicholas then received a letter from a Mayor of the small town of Cavorn where a couple had disappeared.\n\nThe game starts as Nicholas gets near Cavorn. He finds out that a murder occurred in the meantime but the only suspect was already executed on the orders of the Mayor. Nicholas starts to investigate and proves that the executed person was innocent for which he earns trust from citizens but hatred from the mayor. He also meets Helen, the beautiful young wife of the mayor and starts to have feelings for her.\n\nDuring his investigation another person comes to Cavorn - Fabius. Fabius tries to convince Nicholas to leave but he rejects. Nicholas eventually finds out that all murders and disappearances are caused by a demon locked in a Crypt of local monastery and Fabius is a member of society that tries to make it secret. Nicholas is then poisoned by the Mayor who is revealed to be controlled by the demon. Nicholas survives but he finds Helen killed and tries to resurrect her but the ritual looks as if not working. Nicholas then goes to the crypt where Fabius reveals that in fact he tries to release to demon to control him to use him for good. He also tries to convince Nicholas to help him. The player has to make a decision.\n\nIf he decides to help Fabius, the demon is pulled into Fabius who then returns to Rome where he helps to make the Church stronger as new crusades across the world are led. The live in Cavorns go on peacefully as no-one notices the shadow that will swallow all.\n\nIf the player refuses to help Fabius so Nicholas kills him and demon tries to control him but is saved by Helen who pulls the demon into her. She says Nicholas that she is a daughter of Yerik whose blood is unbearable to the demon which helps her control him. Nicholas is not truly convinced if he should trust her so the player has to make decision once again.\n\nIf he decides to trust her they live happily together and Nicholas can have a normal life thanks to her. It is not sure if she will be able to hold the demon forever to protect the world or if he will get a control over her one day.\n\nIf the player kills her the world is saved but Nicholas loses any chance of getting a normal life. He leaves the town and continues as a Beast Hunter. The folks of Cavorn have been since then lighting up tho candles for Nicholas and Helen followed by prayer for Nicholas's soul.\n\nThe game was announced by software studio RA Images in January 2005. It was the first video game project of the studio. The game was scheduled for release in Q1 2005.\n\nThe game was released in the Czech Republic in May 2005. It was published by Cinemax that also codeveloped the game. In 2006 the game was published in North America by Meridian4.\n\nThe game has received mostly mixed reviews from critics.\n\nIn December 2008 Cinemax announced that Legends of Daemonca: Fareypoint Purgatory is in development. It was supposed to be a sequel to the original Daemonica. Player would control Nicholas Fareypoint the protagonist of Daemonica as he arrives on a mysterious island. His goal is to escape from this island. The game was later cancelled.\n"}
{"id": "425930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425930", "title": "Der Fuehrer's Face", "text": "Der Fuehrer's Face\n\nDer Fuehrer's Face (originally titled Donald Duck in Nutzi Land) is a 1943 American animated anti-Nazi propaganda short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released in 1943 by RKO Radio Pictures. The cartoon, which features Donald Duck in a nightmare setting working at a factory in Nazi Germany, was made in an effort to sell war bonds and is an example of American propaganda during World War II. The film was directed by Jack Kinney and written by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer from the original music by Oliver Wallace. The film is well known for Wallace's original song \"Der Fuehrer's Face\", which was released earlier by Spike Jones.\n\n\"Der Fuehrer's Face\" won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 15th Academy Awards. It was the only \"Donald Duck\" film to receive the honor, although eight other films were also nominated. In 1994, it was voted Number 22 of \"the 50 Greatest Cartoons\" of all time by members of the animation field. However, because of the propagandistic nature of the short, and the depiction of Donald Duck as a Nazi (albeit a deeply reluctant one), Disney kept the film out of general circulation after its original release. Its first home video release came in 2004 with the release of the DVD sets.\n\nA German oom-pah band—composed of Axis leaders Joseph Goebbels on trombone, Heinrich Himmler on snare drum, Hirohito on sousaphone, Hermann Göring on piccolo and Benito Mussolini on bass drum—marches noisily at four o'clock in the morning through a small town where the trees, windmills, fence posts, and even the clouds are shaped like swastikas, singing the virtues of the Nazi doctrine. As they near Donald Duck's house, Donald is heiling to the song in his sleep. His alarm clock, with all the numbers replaced with swastikas, goes off and he smashes it. His cuckoo clock with a bird that is dressed up as Hitler heils as a clock chime, only for Donald to throw a shoe at it. Passing by Donald Duck's house (the features of which depict Adolf Hitler), the band members poke him out of bed with a bayonet to get him ready for work. Here Donald then faces and \"Heils\" the portraits of the Führer (Adolf Hitler), the Emperor (Hirohito) and Il Duce (Mussolini) respectively, then goes to make breakfast.\n\nBecause of wartime rationing, Donald's breakfast consists of bread that is so stale and hard it resembles wood (and must be sliced using a saw), coffee brewed from a single hoarded coffee bean, and an aromatic spray that smells (and, apparently, also tastes) like bacon and eggs. The band shoves a copy of \"Mein Kampf\" in front of him for a moment of reading, then marches into his house and escorts him to a factory, with Donald now carrying the bass drum and Göring kicking him.\nUpon arriving at the factory (at bayonet-point), Donald starts his comical 48-hour daily shift of screwing caps onto artillery shells coming at him in an assembly line. Mixed in with the shells are portraits of the Führer, so he must perform the Hitler salute every time a portrait appears, all the while screwing the caps onto shells, much to Donald's disgust. Each new batch of shells is of a different size, ranging from individual bullets to massive shells, as large as Donald if not larger. The pace of the assembly line intensifies (as in the Charlie Chaplin comedy \"Modern Times\"), and Donald finds it increasingly hard to complete all the tasks. At the same time, he is bombarded with propaganda messages about the superiority of the Aryan race and the glory of working for the Führer.\n\nAfter a \"paid vacation\" that consists of making swastika shapes with his body for a few seconds in front of a painted backdrop of the Alps as exercise, Donald is ordered to work overtime. While working, the band members begin rushing him for “more shells”. He has a nervous breakdown with hallucinations of artillery shells everywhere, some of which are snakes and birds, some sing and are the same shape of the marching band from the start, music and all (some of the animation from this sequence is recycled from the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence from \"Dumbo\").\n\nWhen the hallucinations clear, he finds himself in his bed, and realizes that the whole experience was a nightmare, but he sees the shadow of a figure holding its right hand up in the form of a Nazi salute. He begins to do so himself until he realizes that it is the shadow of a miniature Statue of Liberty, holding her torch high in her right hand. Remembering he is in the United States, he embraces the statue, grateful of his United States citizenship.\n\nThe short ends with a caricature of Hitler's angry face, and a tomato is thrown at Hitler's face forming the words The End.\n\nBefore the film's release, the popular band Spike Jones and His City Slickers, noted for their parodies of popular songs of the time, released a version of Oliver Wallace's theme song, \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (also known informally as \"The Nazi Song\") in September 1942 on RCA Victor Bluebird Records #11586. The song parodied the Nazi anthem, the \"Horst Wessel Song\". Unlike the version in the cartoon, some Spike Jones versions contain the rude sound effect of an instrument he called the \"birdaphone\", a rubber razzer (also known as the Bronx Cheer) with each \"Heil!\" to show contempt for Hitler (Instead, the cartoon version features the sound of a tuba.) The so-called \"Bronx Cheer\" was a well-known expression of disgust in that time period and was not deemed obscene or offensive. The sheet music cover bears the image of Donald Duck throwing a tomato in Hitler's face. In the Jones version, the chorus line, \"Ja, we is the Supermen—\" is answered by a soloist's \"Super-duper super men!\" effeminately delivered suggesting the prevalence of epicenes in the Party; in the Disney version, these lines are flatly delivered but with effeminate gestures. The recording was very popular, peaking at #3 on U.S. charts.\n\n\nAlthough the film portrays events in Nazi Germany, its release came while the United States also was on total war footing. Coffee, meat and food oils were rationed, civilians were heavily employed in military production, and propaganda in support of the war effort (such as the film itself) was pervasive. The film's criticism therefore emphasizes violence and terror under the Nazi government, as compared with the dull grind that all the warring nations faced.\n\nIn 2010, \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" was ruled by a local court in Kamchatka, Russia to be included in the national list of extremist materials, which was first created in 2002. This was due to a local who received a suspended sentence of six months for uploading it to the internet and \"inciting hatred and enmity\". On July 21, 2016, another Russian court reversed the ruling of the local court, removing the short film from the list. The court highlighted that the film's portrayal of Nazism through caricature form cannot be deemed \"extremist\" in nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The magazine devoted most of its contents to comics for \"mature readers\", and its name draws inspiration from a fable of the same name by Sukumar Ray, which is about a troubled king's search for a mystery crow. The magazine started off in 2009 when six comics enthusiasts from Jadavpur University and an alumnus got together and decided to start a not-for-profit print magazine on comics for Indian readers. The first issue of \"Drighangchoo\" was published in July 2009.\n\nUnlike the focus of \"mainstream\" Indian comics which heavily borrows from the syndicated superhero comics of the North, the issues of \"Drighangchoo\" encouraged local artists and the use of serious story-telling through black-and-white sequential art in the traditional comics format, and the use of experimental and indigenous Indian artistic styles. The narratives in \"Drighangchoo\" mostly used Bengali or English as interface languages, and also the wordless form. The magazine was published bi-annually from \"under the (crow-infested) trees\" of one of the student canteens of Jadavpur University, and had a small number of devoted and enthusiastic readers from the city of Kolkata, and outside.

He fights narkomafia in Colombia. The gameplay is similar to Max Payne. The player can use Bullet time and make jumps with aiming. It is also possible to use your guns in both hands. The game has realistic physics and a destructible environment.\n\nThe game also features boss combats, with the bosses being highlighted with a health meter beneath their portrait. They can intake more damage than the average game enemy, and move faster and deal more damage towards the player.\n\nAfter a successful raid to rescue DA daughter in a nightclub owned by a druglord Alberto Entiendez, Victor Corbet is sent to Colombia to assist the local police in taking down La Valedora Cartel, who were involved in a massacre that killed Victor brother. The police department includes captain Carlos Enterrador, ADA Mia Rodriguez, Sgt. Gabriel Montego and Ricardo \"Rico\" Altemetra, a close friend of Victor.\n\nVictor first assignment consists of eavesdropping a secret meeting of the Cartel in Hotel Paradiso, Bogota, hosted by druglord nicknamed \"El Corsario\". During the meeting, Victor team is attacked by the Cartel, with Victor being the only survivor. Victor raids the Hotel on his own, and kills \"El Corsario\" and several of his men, but the remaining leaders of La Valedora escape by Helicopter.\n\nDue to Victor heroic actions at the hotel, he is nicknamed \"El Matador\" by his fellow comrades. Rico and Victor are then sent to raid an abandoned factory which serves as a secret drug factory for La Valedora. Victor and Rico are tasked to arrest Guillermo Toro, a drug kingpin who is controlling the operations. During the raid, Victor manages to destroy the factory with C-4, but Toro escapes. Victor and the rest of the team, including Enterrador and Mia, corner Toro in a church. The police raids the church, and in the ensuing shootout Toro is heavily wounded. Victor proceeds to arrest him, but is shot by Enterrador.\n\nThe police finds out that La Valedora has a training camp in Colombia ´s jungle. Due to Enterrador distrust of the police force, orders Victor to go on his own to dismantle the training camp, run by a former Israeli agent. Victor raids the camp, killing all hostile forces.\n\nThanks to information retrieved by Victor, the DEA finds out that the leader of La Valedora is Helmut Köch, a former SS soldier who lives in his island fortress. The DEA, with Victor and Montego leading the team, raids the island. Victor kills Köch in a gunfight.\n\nDocuments found in Köch lair reveal that a big drug cargo is being transported in a freighter. Enterrador gathers all police forces to retrieve the cargo, instead of destroying it. Two teams, one led by Rico and Victor, and the other led by Montego, raid the harbor, while Mia serves as air support. During the raid, Rico is shot and killed by an unknown assaultant. Victor backfires on him, and unmasks him, turning out to be Montego. Montego reveals to Victor that Carlos pretends to steal the cargo before dying from his wounds.\n\nVictor, with the help of Mia, raids the freighter, where Enterrador and several of his Special Ops men are gathered. He manages to make his way, killing all of his men, and manages to wound Enterrador. Enterrador justifies all of his actions to Victor, claiming that the justice he served is controlled by men worst than the drug lords he has been fighting. Unbeknownst to Victor, Enterrador plans to shoot him with a gun concealed in his pants.Enterrador takes his gun and points it towards Victor before the screen turns into black and a gunshot is heard.\n\nA mid-credits title card reveals that Mia was promoted after the downfall of the Cartel.

{"id": "21320889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21320889", "title": "Encyclopedia Dramatica", "text": "Encyclopedia Dramatica\n\nEncyclopedia Dramatica (often abbreviated ED and æ) is a parody-themed website, consisting of a wiki that uses MediaWiki software. Launched on December 10, 2004, it lampoons encyclopedia topics and current events, especially those related or relevant to contemporary Internet culture. It often serves as a repository of information and a means of discussion for the internet subculture known as Anonymous. This NSFW Internet site celebrates a subversive \"trolling culture\", and documents Internet memes, culture, and events, such as mass organized pranks, trolling events, \"raids\", large-scale failures of Internet security, and criticism of Internet communities which are accused of self-censorship in order to garner prestige or positive coverage from traditional and established media outlets.\n\nJournalist Julian Dibbell described Encyclopædia Dramatica as the site \"where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist, homophobic and misogynist content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend.\" The site is known for its clickbait advertisements all around it, in addition to having no rules. Ninemsn described Encyclopædia Dramatica as: \n\n\"Wikipedia's evil twin. It’s a site where almost every article is biased, offensive, unsourced, and without the faintest trace of political correctness. A search through its archives will reveal animated images of people committing suicide, articles glorifying extreme racism and sexism, and a seemingly endless supply of twisted, shocking views on just about every major human tragedy in history.\"\n\nOn April 14, 2011, the original URL of the site was redirected to a new website named 'Oh Internet' that bore little resemblance to Encyclopedia Dramatica. Parts of the ED community harshly criticized the changes. On the night of the Encyclopedia Dramatica shutdown, regular ED visitors bombarded the 'Oh Internet' Facebook wall with hate messages. The Web Ecology Project made a downloadable archive of former Encyclopedia Dramatica content. Fan-made torrents and several mirrors of the original site were subsequently generated, before the wiki located at encyclopediadramatica.rs (formerly encyclopediadramatica.ch, encyclopediadramatica.es, and encyclopediadramatica.se) emerged as the only one still active.\n\nEncyclopædia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DeGrippo, also known by the online pseudonym \"Girlvinyl\". DeGrippo found LiveJournal (LJ Drama) in 2000 and became enthralled by the behavior of some of its members:\n\nPeople were accessible and it was bidirectional. Voyeurs and exhibitionists were able to interact in a way that was normalized. That’s why I started ED. It was mostly just personalities that were just so nuts and fascinating.\n\nShe became involved in the LJdrama community, which covered stories on LiveJournal gossip. When the community was banned from LiveJournal, they created their own website. In 2002, two LiveJournal users, Joshua Williams (aka mediacrat) and Andrewpants, became intimately involved with each other. After they broke off their relationship, LJdrama decided to document the resulting drama. Unflattering photographs of Williams were spread on the web, and Williams considered this to be harassment. He threatened legal action, traveled to Portland, Oregon, in order to speak to LiveJournal's abuse team, and reported the alleged harassment to a local TV news station. DeGrippo created Encyclopedia Dramatica in order to \"house some information from livejournal and some drama about hackers Theo DeRaadt and Darren Reed.\"\n\nEncyclopedia Dramatica characterized itself as being \"In the spirit of Ambrose Bierce's \"The Devil's Dictionary\".\" \"The New York Times Magazine\" recognized the wiki as \"an online compendium of troll humor and troll lore\" that it labeled a \"troll archive\". \"C't\", a European magazine for IT professionals, noted the site's role in introducing newcomers to the culture of 4chan's /b/, a notorious Internet imageboard. Encyclopædia Dramatica defines trolling in terms of doing things \"for the \"lulz\"\" (for laughs), a phrase that it qualifies as \"a catchall explanation for any trolling you do.\"\n\nThe targets of this trolling come from \"every pocket of the Web\", to include not only the non-corporeal aspects of Internet phenomena, (e.g. online catchphrases, fan pages, forums, and viral phenomena), but also real people (e.g. amateur celebrities, identifiable internet drama participants and even Encyclopædia Dramatica's own forum members). These are derided in a manner described variously as \"coarse\", \"offensive\", \"obscene\", \"irreverent, obtuse, politically incorrect\", \"crude but hilarious\", and \"crude and abusive\". The material is presented to appear comprehensive, with extensive use of shock-value prose, drawings, photographs, and the like. The emotional responses are then added to the articles, often in similarly derogatory or inflammatory manner, with the purpose of provoking further emotional response. Adherents of the practice assert that visitors to the website \"shouldn't take anything said on Dramatica seriously.\"\n\nArticles at Encyclopædia Dramatica are particularly critical of MySpace as well as users on YouTube, LiveJournal, DeviantART, Tumblr, and Wikipedia. In \"The New York Times Magazine\", journalist Jonathan Dee described it as a \"snarky Wikipedia anti-fansite\". Shaun Davies of Australia's \"Nine Network\" called it \"Wikipedia's bastard child, a compendium of internet trends and culture which lampoons every subject it touches.\" The site \"is run like Wikipedia, but its style is the opposite; most of its information is biased and opinionated, not to mention racist, homophobic, and spiteful, but on the upside its snide attitude makes it spot-on about most Internet memes it covers.\" This coverage of Internet jargon and memes had been acknowledged in the \"New Statesman\", on Language Log, in \"C't\" magazine, and in \"Wired\" magazine.\n\nAccording to Sherrod DeGrippo,\n\nAs long as something wasn’t submitted as illegal or an abuse complaint, I didn’t even see it. Wikis are something that you either closely, closely monitor and manage, or you just let it go.\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Encyclopædia Dramatica deleted its article on Operation Payback. On the same day, Facebook deleted its Operation Payback page, and Twitter suspended Operation Payback's account. An anonymous source told Gawker that the Encyclopedia Dramatica article was deleted as the result of court orders.\n\nDeGrippo reportedly \"came to hate\" Encyclopædia Dramatica. She had hoped that ED would return to its roots and focus on LiveJournal drama. On April 14, 2011, the URL encyclopediadramatica.com was redirected to \"Oh Internet\", an entirely different safe-for-work website that DeGrippo had created. The name \"Oh Internet\" is meant to convey \"Oh, Internet, you are so crazy!\" DeGrippo stated that \"Shock for shock’s sake is old at this point [...] .\" Some regular users of Encyclopædia Dramatica were displeased by the change and attacked the website's official Facebook fan page with \"hate messages and pornography\".\n\nIn a question and answer session at the ROFLCon summit in October 2011, DeGrippo was asked why Encyclopædia Dramatica was closed and replaced with Oh Internet. She replied: \"We were unable to stop the degradation of the content. It just kept getting longer and longer and dumber and dumber and less and less coherent over time.\" She also explained why she had not released the site as an archive, saying that she \"didn't want to\", and suggesting that this would have made her personally responsible for any DMCA and privacy violations that it contained. She also stated that hosting Encyclopædia Dramatica caused her to have troubles involving the FBI. Oh Internet has been offline since late 2013.\n\nRyan Cleary hosted a fork of Encyclopædia Dramatica at encyclopediadramatica.ch Members of this project gathered text and images from Google's web cache and other backups, and a script was created to upload cached information. On June 21, 2011, Scotland Yard arrested Ryan Cleary based on alleged connections to online attacks on Sony. The arrest temporarily disrupted operation of the wiki, but other members were able to resume Cleary's duties. Garrett E. Moore later became the fork's owner. Moore reported difficulties in securing a host for the website.\n\nOn March 19, 2012, encyclopediadramatica.ch was shut down for a short time due to a \"DNS block\". On March 21, 2012, the site moved to a Swedish domain name, at encyclopediadramatica.se, instead of a domain in Switzerland as before. The site's Facebook account later addressed the block, stating that it was because \"we didn't keep up our end of the nic.ch user agreement contract stating that we had to keep a mailing address and phone number in Switzerland.\" In September 2013, the site changed its domain to encyclopediadramatica.es. In October 2014, the site returned to the .se domain. In January 2018, the site changed its domain to encyclopediadramatica.rs.\n\nGarrett E. Moore, the operator of a fork of Encyclopædia Dramatica located at encyclopediadramatica.se (encyclopediadramatica.ch at the time), told an interviewer for \"The Daily Dot\":\n\nPeople take themselves too seriously, they can't laugh at anything. We make fun of everything. I make fun of skinny white computer nerds, but I am one.\n\nWhen asked about \"abusive content\", Moore stated that he removes it when he sees it, then further explained:\n\nI'm not going to leave a 14 year old girl's address up on a page cause some dipshit got mad at her and made an article. But if you dress up like a fox and wear diapers and then take pictures of it? That's fair game, sir.\n\nIn a later interview with \"The Daily Dot\", Moore defended his community's belief in free speech.\n\nIn January 2013, a video game created by EDF user \"gizmo01942\" came to the attention of the media. The game, \"Bullet To The Head Of The NRA\" was controversial because the player could take aim and shoot at members of the National Rifle Association. In February 2015, \"Muhammad Sex Simulator 2015\", another video game by the same EDF user, attracted further controversy because of the then-recent \"Charlie Hebdo\" shootings.\n\nThe website received mainstream media attention after Jason Fortuny used Encyclopædia Dramatica to post photographs, e-mails and phone numbers from 176 responses to a Craigslist advertisement he posted in 2006, in which he posed as a woman seeking sexual encounters with dominant men. The incident was addressed in a blog hosted at \"Wired News\", where the blogger proposes that Encyclopædia Dramatica may be the \"world's lamest wiki\".\n\nIn 2006, \"a well-known band of trolls\" emailed Encyclopædia Dramatica's creator, DeGrippo, demanding edits to the protected (i.e. locked) article describing them. After she refused to do so, the trolls ordered taxis, pizzas, escort services and sent death threats and threats of rape to DeGrippo's apartment.\n\nEncyclopædia Dramatica became a \"favourite target for critics, who accuse Anonymous of propagating hate,\" for allowing alleged members of the group to sometimes use the website as a platform. Through this association, Encyclopædia Dramatica received incidental coverage when actions by members of Anonymous led to the arrest of an alleged pedophile, when they demonstrated against Scientology in London; when a member of the group broke into the e-mail account of former Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, and when a member of Anonymous claimed credit for an attack on the virtual \"Second Life\" headquarters of former presidential candidate John Edwards. The convergence of Encyclopædia Dramatica with the anti-Scientology campaign of Project Chanology was noted by technology journalist Julian Dibbell.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, Encyclopædia Dramatica won the \"People's Choice Winners\" category for favorite wiki in Mashable's 2nd Annual Open Web Awards, with wikiHow as the runner-up and Wikipedia coming in 3rd.\n\nIn December 2008, a message on Encyclopædia Dramatica asked for donations and claimed that the website was under attack and had lost its advertisers.\n\nIn January 2010, the Encyclopædia Dramatica article \"Aboriginal\" was removed from the search engine results of Google Australia, after a lawyer filed a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission saying its content was racist. A search on terms related to the article produced a message that one of the results has been removed after a legal request relating to Australia's Racial Discrimination Act (RDA). The publicity surrounding this served to raise the profile of the site. In March 2010, it was reported that the Australian Human Rights Commission had notified the site by e-mail that according to Australian law, the article \"Aboriginal\" could be in breach of Sections 18C and 18D of its RDA.\n\nIn 2016, a United Kingdom court determined an ED user must pay £10,000 in libel damages for making false statements about a person.\n\nIn 2017, a suit was launched against the website seeking $750,000 USD for alleged copyright infringement. The 'life-threatening' suit is by millionaire Jonathan Monsarrat.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10409", "title": "Eve Arden", "text": "Eve Arden\n\nEve Arden (born Eunice Mary Quedens, April 30, 1908 – November 12, 1990) was an American film, radio, stage, and television actress, and comedian. She performed in leading and supporting roles for nearly six decades.\n\nBeginning her career on Broadway in the early 1930s, Arden's first major role was in the RKO Radio Pictures drama \"Stage Door\" (1937) opposite Katharine Hepburn, followed by roles in the comedies \"Having Wonderful Time\" (1938) and the Marx Brothers' \"At the Circus\" (1939). Arden would go on to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945).\n\nIn the latter part of her career, she played the sardonic but engaging title character of a high school teacher in \"Our Miss Brooks\", winning the first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, and as the school principal in the musicals \"Grease\" (1978) and \"Grease 2\" (1982).\n\nArden was born in Mill Valley, California, on April 30, 1908 to Charles Peter Quedens, son of Charles Henry Augustus and Meta L. (née Dierks) Quedens, and Lucille (née Frank) Quedens, daughter of Bernard and Louisa (née Mertens) Frank, both of German descent. Lucille, a milliner, divorced Charles over his gambling, and went into business for herself.\n\nAlthough not Roman Catholic, young Eunice was sent to a Dominican convent school in San Rafael, California, and later attended Tamalpais High School, a public high school in Mill Valley until age 16. After leaving school, she joined the stock theater company of Henry \"Terry\" Duffy.\n\nShe made her film debut under her real name in the backstage musical \"Song of Love\" (1929), as a wisecracking, homewrecking showgirl who becomes a rival to the film's star, singer Belle Baker. The film was one of Columbia Pictures' earliest successes. In 1933, she relocated to New York City, where she appeared in multiple Broadway stage productions in supporting parts. In 1934, she was cast in that year's \"Ziegfeld Follies\" revue. This was the first role in which she was credited as Eve Arden. Told to change her name for the show, she looked at her cosmetics and \"stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from Elizabeth Arden\". Between 1934 and 1941, she would appear in Broadway productions of \"Parade\", \"Very Warm for May\", \"Two for the Show\", and \"Let's Face It!\".\n\nHer film career began in earnest in 1937 when she signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures, and appeared in the films \"Oh Doctor\" and \"Stage Door\". Her \"Stage Door\" portrayal of a fast-talking, witty supporting character gained Arden considerable notice and was to be a template for many of Arden's future roles. In 1938, she appeared in a supporting part in the comedy \"Having Wonderful Time\", starring Ginger Rogers and Lucille Ball. This was followed by roles in the crime film \"The Forgotten Woman\" (1939), and the comedy \"At the Circus\" (1939), opposite Groucho Marx, a role that would require her to perform acrobatics.\n\nIn 1940, she appeared opposite Clark Gable in \"Comrade X\", followed by the drama \"Manpower\" (1941), opposite Marlene Dietrich. She also appeared in a supporting part in the Red Skelton comedy \"Whistling in the Dark\" (1941), and the romantic comedy \"Obliging Young Lady\" (1942).\nHer many memorable screen roles include a supporting role as Joan Crawford's wise-cracking friend in \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945) for which she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress, and James Stewart's wistful secretary in Otto Preminger's murder mystery, \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959). (One of her co-stars in that film was husband Brooks West.) In 1946, exhibitors voted her the sixth-most promising \"star of tomorrow\".\n\nShe became familiar to a new generation of film-goers when she played Principal McGee in both 1978's \"Grease\" and 1982's \"Grease 2\". She was known for her deadpan delivery of jokes in films.\n\nArden's ability with witty scripts made her a natural talent for radio; she became a regular on Danny Kaye's short-lived but memorably zany comedy-variety show in 1946, which also featured swing bandleader Harry James and gravel-voiced character actor-comedian Lionel Stander.\n\nKaye's show lasted one season, but Arden's display of comic talent and timing set the stage for her to be cast in her best-known role, Madison High School English teacher Connie Brooks in \"Our Miss Brooks\". Arden portrayed the character on radio from 1948 to 1957, in a television version of the program from 1952 to 1956, and in a 1956 feature film. Arden's character clashed with the school's principal, Osgood Conklin (played by Gale Gordon), and nursed an unrequited crush on fellow teacher Philip Boynton (played originally by future film star Jeff Chandler, and later on radio, then on television, by Robert Rockwell). Except for Chandler, the entire radio cast of Arden, Gordon, Richard Crenna (Walter Denton), Robert Rockwell (Mr. Philip Boynton), Gloria McMillan (Harriet Conklin), and Jane Morgan (landlady Margaret Davis) played the same roles on television.\n\nArden's portrayal of the character was so popular that she was made an honorary member of the National Education Association, received a 1952 award from the Teachers College of Connecticut's Alumni Association \"for humanizing the American teacher\", and even received teaching job offers. Her wisecracking, deadpan attitude as the character ultimately became her public persona as a commedienne as well.\nShe won a listeners' poll by \"Radio Mirror\" magazine as the top-ranking comedienne of 1948–1949, receiving her award at the end of an \"Our Miss Brooks\" broadcast that March. \"I'm certainly going to try in the coming months to merit the honor you've bestowed upon me, because I understand that if I win this (award) two years in a row, I get to keep Mr. Boynton,\" she joked. But she was also a hit with the critics; a winter 1949 poll of newspaper and magazine radio editors taken by \"Motion Picture Daily\" named her the year's best radio comedienne.\n\nArden had a very brief guest appearance in a 1955 \"I Love Lucy\" episode entitled \"L.A. at Last\" in which she played herself. While awaiting their food at The Brown Derby, Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) argue over whether a certain portrait on a nearby wall is Shelley Winters or Judy Holliday. Lucy urges Ethel to ask a lady occupying the next booth, who turns and replies, \"Neither. That's Eve Arden.\" Ethel suddenly realizes she was just talking to Arden herself, who soon passes Lucy and Ethel's table to leave the restaurant while the pair gawk.\nDesilu Productions, jointly owned by Desi Arnaz and Ball during their marriage, was the production company for the \"Our Miss Brooks\" television show, which filmed during the same years as \"I Love Lucy\". Ball and Arden became acquainted when they co-starred together in the film \"Stage Door\" in 1937. Ball, according to numerous radio historians, suggested Arden for \"Our Miss Brooks\" after Shirley Booth auditioned for but failed to land the role and Ball – committed at the time to \"My Favorite Husband\" – could not.\n\nArden tried another series in the fall of 1957, \"The Eve Arden Show\", but it was canceled in spring of 1958 after 26 episodes. In 1966, Arden played Nurse Kelton in an episode of \"Bewitched\". She later co-starred with Kaye Ballard as her neighbor and in-law, Eve Hubbard, in the 1967–69 situation comedy \"The Mothers-in-Law\", which was produced by Arnaz after the dissolution of Desilu Productions. In her later career, Arden made appearances on such television shows as \"Bewitched\", \"Alice\", \"Maude, Hart to Hart\", and \"Falcon Crest\". In 1985, she appeared as the wicked stepmother in the \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" production of \"Cinderella\".\n\nArden was one of many actresses to take on the title roles in \"Hello, Dolly!\" and \"Auntie Mame\" in the 1960s; in 1967, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. Arden was cast in 1983 as the leading lady in what was to be her Broadway comeback in \"Moose Murders\", but she wisely withdrew (and was replaced with the much younger Holland Taylor) after one preview performance, citing \"artistic differences\". The show went on to open and close on the same night, becoming known as one of the most legendary flops in Broadway history.\n\nArden published an autobiography, \"The Three Phases of Eve\", in 1985. In addition to her Academy Award nomination, Arden has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Radio and Television (see List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for addresses). She was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nArden was married to Ned Bergen from 1939–1947, and to actor Brooks West from 1952 until his death in 1984 from a heart ailment, aged 67. West and she had four children; all but the youngest were adopted. All four survived their parents.\n\nOn November 12, 1990, Arden died from cardiac arrest and heart disease, aged 82, at her home, according to her death certificate. Some sources, including her manager, Glenn Rose, said she had also been battling cancer. However, cancer is not mentioned in her death certificate. She is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Westwood, Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9997145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9997145", "title": "God of War: Chains of Olympus", "text": "God of War: Chains of Olympus\n\nGod of War: Chains of Olympus is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Ready at Dawn and Santa Monica Studio, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). It was first released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console on March 4, 2008. The game is the fourth installment in the \"God of War\" series, the second chronologically, and a prequel to the original \"God of War\". It is loosely based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused many of the gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of the Sun and the aid of the Titan Atlas, Morpheus and the Queen of the Underworld Persephone intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous installments, with a focus on combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require the player to complete game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to three magical attacks as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. The control setup was reconfigured for the PSP, as it has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2's controller. Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls received praise from critics.\n\nDebuting at No. 5 on the North American charts, \"Chains of Olympus\" achieved the highest composite score for a PSP title from Metacritic and GameRankings. 1UP stated that the game is \"a technical showpiece for Sony, and arguably the best-looking game on the system.\" It won several awards, including \"Best PSP Action Game\", \"Best Graphics Technology\", and \"Best Use of Sound\". In September 2010, \"GamePro\" named \"Chains of Olympus\" the best PSP game. By June 2012, the game had sold 3.2 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling PlayStation Portable game of all time. Together with \"\", \"Chains of Olympus\" was remastered and released on September 13, 2011, as part of the \"\" for the PlayStation 3 (PS3). The remastered version was included in the \"God of War Saga\" released on August 28, 2012, also for PlayStation 3.\n\n\"God of War: Chains of Olympus\" is a third-person single-player video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, minotaurs, hoplites, and sphinxes. Morpheus beasts, shades, banshees, fire guards, fire sentries, hyperion guards, and death knights were created specifically for the game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can use it as a jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.\n\nKratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos: a pair of blades attached to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in \"God of War\"— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.\n\nThe challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Hades (five trials), and requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., Burn 50 soldiers with the Efreet). It is unlocked by completing the game. The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, as rewards. Completion of each of the game's difficulty levels unlocks additional rewards.\n\nAs with the previous games in the \"God of War\" franchise, \"God of War: Chains of Olympus\" is set in an alternate version of ancient Greece, populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings of Greek mythology. With the exception of flashbacks, the events are set between those of the games \"\" (2013) and \"God of War\" (2005). Several locations are explored, including the real world locations of the ancient cities of Attica and Marathon, the latter including fictional settings of the Temple of Helios and the Caves of Olympus, and several other fictional locations, including the Underworld, which features scenes at the River Styx, Tartarus, the Fields of Elysium, and the Temple of Persephone.\n\nAttica is a war-torn city under assault by the Persian Empire and their pet basilisk, and is the site of Eurybiades' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, Morpheus. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, which sits atop the Sun Chariot, which has plummeted to Earth in Helios' absence. Boreas, Zephyros, Euros, and Notos, gods of the north, west, east, and south winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess Eos, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of Triton. The Underworld is the underground realm of the dead and is host to the River Styx and ferryman of the dead, Charon. Tartarus is the prison of the dead and the Titans where the massive Titan Hyperion is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a former Captain of Sparta's Army, and once servant to the God of War, Ares. He now serves the other Olympian Gods in hopes that they will free him of his nightmares. Other characters include Kratos' mentor and ally Athena (Erin Torpey), the Goddess of Wisdom; Eos (Erin Torpey), the Goddess of Dawn and sister of Helios; Persephone (Marina Gordon), the Queen of the Underworld and the main antagonist; and Atlas (Fred Tatasciore), a four-armed Titan imprisoned in Tartarus after the Great War. Kratos' deceased daughter Calliope (Debi Derryberry) briefly reunites with him in the Fields of Elysium and his wife Lysandra appears in a flashback. Minor characters include Helios (Dwight Schultz), the captured Sun God; Charon (Dwight Schultz), the ferryman of the Underworld; and the Persian King (Fred Tatasciore), leader of the Persian forces attacking Attica. The Dream God Morpheus is an unseen character that affects the plot.\n\nDuring Kratos' ten years of service to the Olympian Gods, he is sent to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. After successfully killing the Persian King, decimating his army and slaying their pet basilisk, Kratos observes the Sun fall from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. As he fights his way through the city of Marathon, the Spartan witnesses the black fog of the Olympian Morpheus cover the land. He hears a haunting flute melody, which he recognizes as a melody once played by his deceased daughter Calliope. Finding the Temple of Helios, Kratos is tasked by Athena to find the missing Sun God, as Morpheus has caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber in the absence of light. The Spartan eventually locates Helios' sister, Eos, who tells Kratos that the Titan Atlas has abducted her brother. Eos advises Kratos to seek the Primordial Fires, which he uses to awaken the fire steeds of Helios. The steeds take the Spartan to the Underworld, where he has two encounters with Charon at the River Styx. Although Charon initially defeats Kratos and banishes him to Tartarus, the Spartan returns and destroys the ferryman.\n\nAfter locating the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos is given a choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power to be reunited with his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold the weight of the world on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Kratos is still riding Helios' chariot back into the sky and after seeing the return of the Sun, Kratos loses consciousness from the exertion and plummets to the ground. At the last moment, Kratos is saved by Athena and Helios, and Athena tells Helios that \"He will live.\"\n\nGame developer Ready at Dawn pitched the idea of a \"God of War\" game for the PlayStation Portable to SCE Santa Monica Studio soon after the original \"God of War\" launched. In February 2007, Ready at Dawn posted a teaser featuring \"Coming Soon\" in the \"God of War\" font. An editor from 1UP obtained an early copy of \"God of War II\" and posted the game's instruction manual, featuring a one-page teaser with \"PSP\" in the Omega symbol and stating \"Coming 2007\". On March 12, 2007, \"God of War II\" was launched at the Metreon: \"God of War II\" Game Director Cory Barlog officially confirmed the development of \"Chains of Olympus\", stating \"It is its own story that connects to the overall story. \"God of War\", \"God of War II\", and then if all the stars align \"God of War III\" will be the telling of a trilogy. This PSP story will be a further fleshing out.\" An initial trailer for \"Chains of Olympus\" was released on April 25, 2007, coinciding with the announcement of a demo on UMD—the optical disc medium for the PSP. The trailer is narrated by voice actress Linda Hunt.\n\n\"God of War: Chains of Olympus\" uses a proprietary, in-house engine referred to as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, \"Daxter\" (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for \"God of War\" gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222 megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333 MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.\n\nTwo of the voice actors returned from the previous installments to reprise their roles, which were Terrence C. Carson and Linda Hunt, who voiced Kratos and the narrator respectively. Erin Torpey adopted the dual roles of Athena and Eos. Fred Tatasciore, who voiced different characters in previous installments, returned, and in this game, voiced both Atlas and the Persian King. Carole Ruggier and Michael Clarke Duncan did not return to reprise their roles, which were Athena and Atlas respectively. Voice actor Dwight Schultz voiced both Charon and Helios; Debi Derryberry voiced Calliope and continued this role in a later installment; and Marina Gordon provided the voice of Persephone. Brian Kimmet, Don Luce, and Andrew Wheeler provided the voices of several minor characters and Keythe Farley was the Voice Director.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Gerard K. Marino, but to date, it has not been commercially released. After the release of the demo disc, Ready at Dawn offered pre-order customers a music track on disc titled \"Battle of Attica\". Composer Gerard Marino stated that it was the first cue written for the game, based on concept art and screenshots. Marino composed roughly thirteen minutes of music for the game and re-worked other music from the previous titles. Three tracks from the soundtrack are included as bonus tracks on the .\n\nThe demo disc, officially titled \"God of War: Chains of Olympus – Special Edition: Battle of Attica\", was released on September 27, 2007. In the demo, Kratos battles Persian soldiers and a giant basilisk. The demo progresses through the city of Attica as Kratos chases the basilisk, culminating with Kratos fighting the Persian King. The disc also included a developer video and a lanyard in the shape of the Greek letter Omega. Following the demo's release, a downloadable version was made available through the PlayStation Store in North American and European regions. Due to the delay of the game, Ready at Dawn offered a \"special edition\" version of the demo to pre-order customers, with one Ready at Dawn developer stating that preparation of the special demo disc took up to 40% of the team's production time.\n\n\"God of War: Chains of Olympus\" was originally scheduled to be released during the fourth quarter of 2007, but it was rescheduled and released on March 4, 2008, in North America, March 27 in Australia, March 28 in Europe, and July 10 in Japan, where it was published by Capcom. The game was a commercial success, debuting at No. 5 on the North American charts with 340,500 copies sold in the first month. The game was re-released in Europe on October 17, 2008, as part of Sony's Platinum Range and was also re-released in Japan and North America in April 2009 under Capcom's Best Price and Sony's Greatest Hits labels, respectively. It became available for download from the PlayStation Store on September 30, 2009, in North America, October 1 in Europe, and November 11, 2010, in Japan. Sony released a limited-edition bundle pack only in North America, on June 3, 2008. The pack included the game, a UMD of the 2007 film \"Superbad\", a voucher for the PSP title \"\", and a red edition of the console imprinted with an image of Kratos' face on the rear. As of June 2012, \"Chains of Olympus\" has sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide.\n\nTogether with \"\", the game was released for the PlayStation 3 as part of the \"\" (called \"God of War Collection – Volume II\" in Europe) on September 13, 2011, in North America, September 16 in Europe, September 29 in Australia, and October 6 in Japan. The collection is a remastered port of both games to the PS3 hardware, with features including high-definition resolution, stereoscopic 3D, anti-aliased graphics locked at 60 frames per second, DualShock 3 vibration function, and PlayStation 3 Trophies. \"God of War: Origins Collection\" and full trials of its two games were also released for download on the PlayStation Store on September 13, 2011, in North America. By June 2012, the collection had sold 711,737 copies worldwide. On August 28, 2012, \"God of War Collection\", \"God of War III\", and \"Origins Collection\" were released as part of the \"God of War Saga\" under Sony's line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3 in North America.\n\n\"God of War: Chains of Olympus\" received \"universal acclaim\" according to review aggregator Metacritic with a score of 91 out of 100, and a 91.44% at GameRankings, achieving the highest composite score for a PlayStation Portable title. The game was praised for its graphics and presentation. Matt Leone of 1UP claimed \"Chains of Olympus\" is \"a technical showpiece for Sony, and arguably the best-looking game on the system.\" Robert Falcon of Modojo.com similarly praised the presentation, calling it \"an absolute stunner, the pinnacle of PSP development\". He also praised the visuals as \"absolutely breathtaking,\" and that the \"game moves beautifully throughout, with very little loss in detail or speed.\" However, G4's Jonathan Hunt said that it \"occasionally suffers from screen tearing and framerate drops.\"\n\nSeveral reviewers praised Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls and gameplay. Because the PlayStation 2 (PS2) controller has two analog sticks and the PSP only has one, \"GamePro\" stated \"the lack of a second analog stick could have been problematic but it's not.\" Modojo.com similarly stated that despite the lack of a second analog stick, \"Kratos handles superbly on the PSP\" and that the weapon and magic attacks are \"mapped out perfectly around the PSP's control set-up.\" IGN's Chris Roper even claimed the control scheme \"works better than on the PS2.\" Roper further claimed that Ready at Dawn \"has done a stellar job of keeping Kratos' move set intact,\" stating that \"combat is extremely responsive.\" Matt Leone of 1UP similarly praised developers solution for the control scheme as well as the game's \"fantastic\" pacing. However, \"GamePro\" criticized the relative lack of variety in enemies. The puzzles were criticized, and G4 claimed that some \"are so maddeningly difficult to solve\", while GameSpot's Aaron Thomas noted the lack of puzzles, claiming that it \"could have used more\". \"GamePro\" also criticized the fact that \"You still have to lug boxes around to solve environmental puzzles\". Kristan Reed of Eurogamer also criticized Ready at Dawn for cutting some puzzles, as well as cutting co-op play, multiplayer, dialogue, and characters.\n\nGameSpot and IGN criticized the short length and minimal boss fights, although \"GamePro\" stated that it has \"the same epic feel\" as the previous installments and claimed that if it was the only \"God of War\" title, \"it would still stand on its own merits.\" Cheat Code Central claimed \"Chains of Olympus\" is \"one of the best games ever made for the PSP.\" They claimed that it is \"definitely a must-buy game for all current fans\" and that it \"has everything you've come to expect from \"God of War\", just in a little disc and on a smaller screen.\" GameTrailers went on to praise the replay value for being able to \"bring your powered-up methods of destruction with you.\"\n\nIn IGN's Best of 2008 Awards, \"Chains of Olympus\" received the awards for \"Best PSP Action Game\", \"Best Graphics Technology\", and \"Best Use of Sound\". In GameSpot's Best Games of 2008, it received the \"Readers' Choice Award\". Diehard GameFAN awarded it \"Best PSP Game\" for 2008.

{"id": "101143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101143", "title": "Henny Youngman", "text": "Henny Youngman\n\nHenry \"Henny\" Youngman (original Yiddish surname Yungman; 16 March 1906 – 24 February 1998) was an English-American comedian and violinist famous for his mastery of the \"one-liner\"; his best known one-liner being \"Take my wife ... please\".\n\nIn a time when many comedians told elaborate anecdotes, Youngman's routine consisted of telling simple one-liner jokes, occasionally with interludes of violin playing. These depicted simple, cartoon-like situations, eliminating lengthy build-ups and going straight to the punch line. He was known as \"The King of the One Liners\", a title conferred to him by columnist Walter Winchell. A stage performance by Youngman lasted only 15 to 20 minutes but contained dozens of jokes in rapid-fire succession.\n\nYoungman was born to a Jewish family in London, England. His family moved to Brooklyn, New York, when he was a child. He grew up in New York City, and began as a comedian after he had worked for years at a print shop, where he wrote \"comedy cards\" containing one-line gags. The comedy cards were discovered by up-and-coming comedian Milton Berle, who encouraged Youngman and formed a close friendship with him. Berle said about him, \"The only thing funnier than Henny's jokes is his violin playing.\"\n\nEncouraged by his family to study the violin, Youngman began in show business as a musician. He led a small jazz band called the Swanee Syncopaters, and during performances, he often told jokes. One night, the club's regular comedian did not show up and the owner asked Youngman to fill in. He enjoyed it and began his long career as a stand-up comic. His inoffensive, friendly style of comedy kept his audiences laughing for decades. He first played in clubs and speakeasies, but his break came on Kate Smith's radio show in 1937. Youngman's manager Ted Collins booked him on the show, and he made many appearances on the radio.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Youngman tried to work into films as an actor, but he found little work in Hollywood. He returned to nightclubs and worked steadily, performing as many as 200 shows per year. Working with writer/producer Danny Shapiro, Youngman recorded \"The Primitive Sounds of Henny Youngman\" a \"live\" album for National Recording Corporation in 1959 at the Celebrity Club in St. Louis. The album is still popular today in CD, and is a frequent iTunes download.\n\nLike many comedians, Henny Youngman treated his profession as a working job, one where making a living is difficult, and getting paid for the work is all-important. In numerous interviews, Youngman's advice to other entertainers was to \"nem di gelt\" (Yiddish for \"take the money\").\n\nHe was quoted in an interview with the online magazine \"Eye\": \"I get on the plane. I go and do the job, grab the money and I come home and I keep it clean. Those are my rules. Sinatra does the same thing, only he has a helicopter waiting. That's the difference.\"\n\nWhen the New York Telephone Company started its Dial-a-Joke in 1974, over three million people called in one month to hear 30 seconds of Youngman's material—the most ever for a comedian.\n\nYoungman never retired, and he performed his stage act in venues worldwide until his final days. As his fame passed into legendary status, he never considered himself aloof or above others, and he never refused to perform a show in a small venue or unknown club. In a tribute to Youngman, TV and animation producer Mark Evanier described him in a way that emphasized both his money consciousness and his love of performing:\n\nHe would take his fiddle and go to some hotel that had banquet rooms. He'd consult the daily directory in the lobby and find a party—usually a bar mitzvah reception—and he would go up to the room and ask to speak to whoever was paying for the affair. \"I'm Henny Youngman,\" he would tell that person. \"I was playing a date in another banquet room here and one of the waiters suggested you might want to have me do my act for your gathering here.\" He would negotiate whatever price he could get—$200, $500, preferably in cash—and he would do his act for them.\n\nRoger Ebert described a similar episode in a 2011 film review:\n\nI once observed Henny Youngman taping a TV show in the old NBC studios at the Merchandise Mart. We got into an elevator together. It stopped at the second floor, a private club. A wedding was under way. Youngman got off the elevator, asked to meet the father of the bride and said, \"I'm Henny Youngman. I'll do 10 minutes for $100.\"\n\nYoungman made numerous appearances on television, including a long-running stint on \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\". In 1955, he hosted a TV series entitled \"The Henny and Rocky Show,\" appearing with champion boxer Rocky Graziano. He had cameo appearances in several movies, including \"Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood\", \"History of the World, Part I\", and \"Goodfellas.\"\n\nHe had a larger role as the strip-club owner in Herschell Gordon Lewis's \"The Gore Gore Girls\", a fact he denied vehemently. He made a few recordings, most notably \"The Primitive Side of Henny Youngman\", recorded live in St. Louis and released by National Recording Corporation on the NRC label. The CD is still in print.\n\nHis autobiography is entitled \"Take My Life, Please!\".\n\nYoungman's last movie appearance before his death was in Daniel Robert Cohn's film \"Eyes Beyond Seeing,\" in which he has a cameo as a mental patient claiming to be Henny Youngman.\n\nYoungman's wife Sadie Cohen was often the butt of his jokes (\"My wife said to me, 'For our anniversary I want to go somewhere I've never been before.' I said, 'Try the kitchen!, or \"My wife's cooking is fit for a king. [Gesturing as if feeding an invisible dog.] Here, King; here, King!\" Also, \"Last night my wife said the weather outside was fit for neither man nor beast, so we both stayed home.\") In reality the two were very close, with Sadie often accompanying her husband on his tours. The Youngmans remained married for 59 years until Sadie's death in 1987 after a prolonged illness. While she was ill, Henny had an ICU built in their bedroom, so she could be taken care of at home, rather than in the hospital, as Sadie was terrified of hospitals.\n\nHenny explained the origin of his classic line \"Take my wife, please\" as a misinterpretation: he took his wife to a radio show and asked a stagehand to escort his wife to a seat. But his request was taken as a joke, and Youngman used the line countless times ever after.\n\nYoungman had two children, Gary and Marilyn. Gary started his career screenwriting and directing, continuing to work in the film industry in various capacities. Gary is best known for his 1976 film \"Rush It!\".\n\nWith the exception of a week following his wife's death, and the month he was in his final hospital stay, Henny was known for having worked almost every day for over 70 years without vacations or other breaks.\n\nYoungman developed pneumonia and died on 24 February 1998, three weeks before his 92nd birthday. He is interred in the Mount Carmel Cemetery, Glendale, New York next to his wife Sadie.\n\n\n"}

It provides content on anime, Japanese pop culture and eGames and is currently operated by ABS-CBN Digital Media, a division of the media conglomerate ABS-CBN Corporation. It was formerly a 24-hour Filipino pay TV channel from 2005 to 2018 operated by ABS-CBN narrowcast arm Creative Programs which its programming was composed primarily of Filipino-dubbed Japanese animation.\n\nMuch of the content in Hero is attributed to the fact that Creative Programs Inc's parent company ABS-CBN (through its main network) has produced numerous dubs of anime years before the launch of Hero, as well as maintained an Animax airing block for quite sometime. Aside from those, the channel also airs anime that have not yet seen in any terrestrial or cable channel shown in the Philippines prior to its first showing in the channel, such as \"Mirmo de Pon!\".\n\nThe channel also once featured anime dubbed by Telesuccess, Inc., supplier for most of the anime aired on ABS-CBN's rival GMA Network, before transferring them all to TeleAsia. Some of these are \"Love Hina, Rune Soldier, and Shaman King\". Others seen in the channel were previously shown in English on Cartoon Network's Philippine feed (e.g. Crush Gear Turbo) or, in the case of \"Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh\", on government-controlled RPN 9 (now known as CNN Philippines).\n\nFurthermore, the channel features re-dubs (i.e. it produced its own dubbed version of anime which previously were already dubbed in Tagalog.) Examples of these are \"Mon Colle Knights, Metal Fighter Miku, Zenki, The Slayers, and Voltes V\".\n\nIn 2011, undubbed anime was introduced to the channel with accompanying Filipino-language subtitles in the form of \"\", and the \"Initial D Extra Stage\" OVA. The reason for airing these two anime features in their original Japanese audio is not known.\n\nIn the Summer of 2012, HERO began to greatly increase its lineup of new titles, starting with \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, Naruto Shippuden, Hanasaku Iroha, and Shiki\"; as well as airing the first two series of the \"Sailor Moon\" franchise, and a more complete version of the Aniplex-produced \"Jigoku Shoujo\". Except for \"Sailor Moon\", \"Jigoku Shoujo\" and \"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun\", all of these titles have never been aired on Animax before (Animax airs \"Railgun\" and \"Sailor Moon\" in other countries).\n\nOn December 23, 2017, an Anime Pilipinas article stated that Hero TV will end its broadcast operations on January 31, 2018 after 12 years due to lack of advertising support and change in business direction (before Hero TV, sister stations Tag and ABS-CBN Regional Channel closed down earlier on January 15.) It was publicly announced through a plug that aired in the channel starting January 16.\n\nDuring the last full day of broadcast, January 31, Hero TV aired a Facebook live broadcast, where its staff shared great memories and thanked supporters. Hero TV signed off for the last time on February 1, 2018 at 12:04 am after airing a tribute video that shows past anime titles, and local programs and events produced or sponsored by the station, ending with a final farewell message and the words \"Hero Now Signing Off.\" Few seconds later, cable providers still receiving Hero would see the modified EBU test card that reads \"ABS-CBN TOC SD\" before shutdown until the provider can replace it or automatically scan with another channel, while other providers like Sky Cable (in Metro Manila and in selected metropolitan and large cities) have replaced this channel with Liga, a sports channel that complements the programming of S+A with international football and local sports events, which was silently launched earlier on January 1.\n\nHero was relaunched and demoted as a social media portal on February 7, 2018 and is being handled by the Lifestyle team from ABS-CBN Digital Media. Whilst its news content includes anime, gaming and pop culture, it will not carry anime titles nor establish an anime video-on-demand service. Meanwhile, its sister station Yey! has limited airing of some of the anime titles aired on Hero and will carry the last remaining new titles on Yey! channel including \"Ace of Diamond\" and \"My Hero Academia\".\n\nHero had its two-hour Sunday morning anime block on Jeepney TV beginning March 11, 2018. However, it was later cancelled in July 2018 just before Jeepney TV became available on ABS-CBN TV Plus.\n\nAlthough the channel markets itself as an \"anime channel\", some of the programs it aired were non-anime. They are \"Mission Odyssey\" and \"Shadow of the Elves\", both produced by the Berliner Film Companie, and the tokusatsu or live-action shows \"The Gransazers, Masked Rider Ryuki, and Shaider\".\n\n"}
{"id": "25271563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25271563", "title": "Hmong music", "text": "Hmong music\n\nHmong music is an important part of the culture of the Hmong people, an ethnic group from southeast Asia. Because the Hmong language is tonal, there is a close connection between Hmong music and the spoken language. Music is an important part of Hmong life, played for entertainment, for welcoming guests, and at weddings and funerals. Hmong musical instruments includes flutes such as the dra, leaves also called nblaw, and the qeej or gaeng, a type of mouth organ.\n\nThe Hmong people trace their origin to the Yellow River region of China around 2700 B.C. In the 16th century Hmong leaders formed a kingdom in the central Chinese provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Henan. This kingdom existed for several centuries before being defeated by the Chinese government. Surviving Hmong led to the mountains of Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan, where many Hmong still live today. In Hmong folktales and songs, this ancient Hmong kingdom is celebrated as a golden age. Accompanying the legend is the story of a Hmong messiah who will someday lead the Hmong people to victory against their oppressors and re-establish the ancient kingdom. It is a story that has inspired Hmong insurrections throughout the centuries. Another popular plot for songs is the story of an orphan who becomes a hero through persistence. The orphan in this story can be seen as a metaphor for the Hmong people, who are without their own country and have to survive wherever they go.\n\nHmong used poetry and story cloths to pass down their history and culture to successive generations. Contemporary Hmong songs are made up of poems using rhyme and clever word play or traditional songs. Skilled singers can gain great fame among the Hmong population across the world. Even though many Hmong have left their homeland in China, their songs are still connected to the life they had there.\n\nThere are several different types of vocal songs: Kwv txhiaj (storytelling songs), zaj tshoob (engagement songs), ntau txhuv (wishing songs), laig dab (Invitation songs), hu plig (spirit Invocation songs), ua neeb (possession chant), qhua ke (farewell to the spirit songs), and nyiav (weeping songs).\n\nKwv txhiaj are performed mostly by Hmong couples and involve comparing aspects of one's lover to aspects of nature, or to tell a story or explain the details of a ritual. Types of kwv txhiaj include:\nInstruments are an important part of Hmong music. Hmong Instruments have a tonal quality that allows words to be heard just by playing.\n\nThe most well-known instrument is the qeej, a type of reed pipe, in which each tone corresponds to a Hmong spoken word. It is a free-reed mouth organ, used to play a text-based melody in the middle range. It consists of a wooden wind chest, with a long horizontal tapering neck ending in a mouth hole. The wooden section is made from two identical pieces of mahogany bound together with straps. The six bamboo tubes are variously curving or straight and can also change in length from quite small for a child's instrument to about two meters long for a more experience player. Each bamboo tube has a hole for fingering above the wind chest and a metal reed over a hole in the pipe encircled within the wind chest. For extra volume, the lowest tube, which is also the thickest and shortest one, often has two or three reeds. The tubes are inserted vertically through the wind chest. When the player exhales or inhales and covers one or more holes for fingering, this allows air in the tube in motion to create a musical tone. There are two types of qeej composition: text-based and text-free. Both genres are played successively in rituals, including funerals, ancestral rites, offerings to vital spirits, sacrifices to the drum, and marriages.\n\nThe qeej is more than an instrument in the Hmong culture. The music it plays is like an extension to the Hmong language, meaning every note symbolizes its own word. To Hmong people, the sounds of the Qeej is like speech and Qeej players are known as story tellers. It is most often played at funerals and its purpose is to communicate with the spiritual world by leading the deceased person to its rightful place. If this fails by all means, the deceased spirit may wander back and bring misfortune to the family.\n\nRaj are small, sometimes disposable, wind instruments. There are two types of raj: the raj nplaim and the raj lev les. The more-popular raj nplaim is a free-reed pipe and is a longer flute than the raj lev les. It uses a small reed to create a buzzing tone quality. It is made in many different sizes and can have from five to seven holes. It is played by sealing one's lips around the reed or by putting the top of the instrument in one's mouth and blowing to make the different pitches. The raj lev les is also a free-reed pipe but it is shorter and recorder-like. The raj lev les can be made out of a small piece of bamboo or grass.\nThese instruments are known for playing words rather than melodies. This is done by setting pitches to match certain tones of words. Young boys and girls play songs back and forth that express their feelings to each other. Raj are also played for entertainment purposes or as a way to signal others in the jungle. Although the raj is not played by everyone, most people in Laos could understand the messages played on the instrument because the pitches were based on real tones of the words. Most of these messages were either about loneliness or love.\n\nThe ncas is another instrument used in Hmong music similar to the jaw harp. The ncas is a six-inch, thin strip of wood or brass with a blade cut out from it. The ncas is played by vibrating next to the mouth while blowing air through the blade. It is commonly used in Hmong courting practices.\n\nThe nplooj is a leaf, usually a banana leaf that is curled up and positioned in the mouth so it vibrates when it is blown. It makes loud, very high pitched sounds that can be heard from miles away. The varying pitches are made by pulling on the leaf and blowing to make certain tones that relate to words in the Hmong language. This instrument can be made from almost any nearby plant or tree, making it easily accessible for Hmong children. The nplooj was traditionally used during times of war, where they were used to send signals in combat and secret messages communicated with words played as melodies.\n\nThese traditional forms of music are not as common among younger generations of Hmong, especially those in the Hmong diaspora. Nonetheless, the music can still be heard at Hmong cultural festivals, usually being performed by elders in the community.\n\nIn today's modern society, Hmong bands and solo artists are growing.\n\n"}

Britain in popularity. No one knows where the name of John Hill came from.\n\nJohn Hill & Co was started in 1898 by a former employee of W. Britain named Mr F. H Wood. In contrast to Britains, Johillco was the first British hollowcast figure company to sell their figures individually leading to competition from Britains who later began to sell individual figures and figures painted less ornately to be sold in variety stores like the F. W. Woolworth Company.\n\nJohillco also manufactured Coronation and other souvenir items.\n\nThe firm's original factory was located at 2-22 Britannia Row, Islington, London but the factory was bombed during World War II. In August 1946 the company reopened under new management in Plumbe Street Burnley. Also after World War II, Johillco's chief figure designer Wilfred Cherrington in conjunction with a Mr Leaver started his own company called Cherilea.\n\nIn their book \"The Art of the Toy Soldier\", the authors note that due to the cheapness of the figures and the individuality of their poses, Johillco figures were found more in working-class homes than the expensive Britains that came in boxes of rigid identical poses. The authors also noted the company probably used a variety of sculptors leading to various grades of quality of Johillco figures, that the authors call \"the good, the bad, and the ugly\".\n\nIn addition to toy soldiers and cowboys and Indians, Johillco made many figures of knights and a movie tie-in set of figures from MGM's \"Quo Vadis (1951 film)\" as well as spacemen.\n\nJohillco was slow to realise the effect of production in plastic. From 1956 they began making plastic figures in their hollowcast moulds under the name of Hilco but the company ceased in the early 1960s.\n\n"}

Paint Dancers, using paint, brushes and paper, attend organized events dressed in ready-to-paint and dance clothing.

This departure from traditional painting styles was often referred to as Action painting. Over the years, several variations of the art form have evolved, including an adaptation introduced by the Hippies during the Summer of Love, that integrated the art of body painting with dancing. One of the more recent introductions of Paint Dancing to American culture is being popularized by a grassroots movement created in 2006 by Seattle artist and activist Matt Jones.

Its editor-in-chief was Miika Huttunen, who is the current editor-in-chief of Pelaaja.\n\n\"Pelaaja\" was started by 2002. The longest running editor-in-chief of Pelaaja was Thomas Puha. Its current editor-in-chief is Miika Huttunen, a veteran of the Finnish electronic gaming scene and among the permanent staff is Janne Pyykkönen, who is also the editor-in-chief of H-Town's \"Pelaa!\" magazine. The art director is Lasse Erkola and some of the frequent collaborators include Miikka Lehtonen, Tero Lehtiniemi and Jukka O. Kauppinen.\n\nThe magazine is more akin to European and American videogames magazines than Finnish ones with its focus on exclusive coverage on the latest games and extensive interviews with members of the development community. Game reviews are also a big part of the magazine. The magazine's tagline is \"for the love of gaming\" as the magazine's staff are hardcore gaming enthusiasts, which is evident in the passionate writing of the magazine features. The magazine was started because the people working on the magazine felt there was no high quality games magazine available in Finland which would focus on console games rather than the PC. Another feature is the international vibe of the magazine via Japan- and US- based writers contributing to the magazine.\n\nPelaaja focuses heavily on its art direction, which is handled by Lasse Erkola, with additional design during the years from Thomas Puha. The magazine was redesigned in summer of 2005 and re-launched in October 2005. Another redesign coincided with the magazine's 10th anniversary issue #121 in October 2012. PC games also made a return to the magazine during this redesign.\n\nPuha and Huttunen are known to cable television and public broadcasting channel viewing audiences for both their games related program appearances and their program featuring neat webpages.\n\n\n"}

As the name suggests, this form of drama combines prose as well as poetry in form of songs to convey the story. In a manner, they are very much similar to Musicals. \"Sangeet Natakas\" played a vital role in the development of Marathi theater and thus the Marathi cinema as well as Indian film industry. Sangeet Natak start with praise of Lord Natraja which is called as \"Naandi\" or \"Mangalaacharan\" or \"Suchakpad\" usually the famous one \"Panchatunda Nararundamaldhar\" from \"Sangeet Shakuntal\". They are popular for use of Indian classical music. The \"Dramatic Music\" is called Natya Sangeet, one of the two popular forms of vocal arts in Maharashtra and surrounding states. The other is Bhavageet.\n\nVishnudas Bhave is considered the founder of Marathi theater. In 1843, his group staged the first public performance of Marathi play \"Seeta Swayamvar\" (सीता स्वयं‍वर). The integration of music in the dramas took place quite late in 1879 when play writer and producer Trilokekar presented his musical play Nal-Damayanti (नल-दमयंती). It was the first musical play on Marathi stage.\n\nBut only when Balwant Pandurang Kirloskar (popularly known as Annasaheb Kirloskar) staged his first musical play \"Shaakuntal\", based on Kalidas's play Abhijñānaśākuntalam, on October 31, 1880 in Pune did the trend of Sangeet Natak really start. Kirloskar included 209 musical pieces in his \"Shaakuntal\" of 7 acts. They consisted of a mix of Hindustani and Carnatic classical music, and lighter music.\n\nPrior to the public performance of sangeet natak, attending musical performances was a monopoly of the ruling classes and other rich classes.Common people could not enjoy classical music. Natya Sangeet basically emerged so that the common people could also enjoy classical music as it is based on classical base. \n\nDuring its early period, Sangeet natak was dominated by religious plays like \"Sangeet Saubhdra\", which is legend in Marathi sangeet natak. The trend changed with coming of sangeet Manapman, which depicts bravery of its hero Dheryadhar and his love with Bhamini which was written by Krushnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar.\n\nThe new trend of \"Sangeet Natakas\" caught up with the popularity quite quickly. With British Raj then existing in India, \"Sangeet Natakas\" were compared with the Operas and thus local Marathi Indians found synonymous recreation. In the blooming times, Sangeet Natakas were mainly based on mythological stories of Mahabharata or Ramayana which would hence easily connect with the masses. They did not cover the complete epics but were limited to only small stories in them.\n\nWith popularity & success, experimentation started on stage with abandoning mythological themes and bringing social issues to audiences. \"Sangeet Sharada\", for example, by portraying the feelings of a teenage girl to be married to a widower in his late seventies, brought out a social message. Few dramas, like \"Kichak Vadh\", even agitated the British rulers to the extent that they were banned. \"Kichak Vadh\" compared the Britishers with \"Kichak\", an evil character from \"Mahabharata\" who tried to dishonour \"Draupadi\". \"Draupadi\" was then synonymous with the oppressed common Indian masses.\n\nDuring the 1960s, another turn came in natya sangeet with the emergence of Jitendra Abhisheki, who was credited with applying simplicity to the complex composition of Natya Sangeet.\n\nThe recent play Katyar Kaljat Ghusli by Zee studios opened up a new era of musical cinemas. This movie was based on the legendary play bearing the same name. Its music was composed by Jitendra Abhisekhi and sung by Vasantrao Deshpande.\n\n\nBal Gandharva's \"Gandharva Natak Mandali\"; Vasudeorao Dongre's \"Dongre Mandali\"; Pandoba Gurav Yavateshwarkar's \"Waikar Sangeet Mandali\"; Janubhau Nimkar and Keshavrao Bhosale's \"Swadesh-Hita-Chintak Mandali\", which evolved into \"Lalit-Kaladarsha Mandali\"; and Master Dinanath's \"Balwant Natak Mandali\" were the other main performing companies which were formed in Maharashtra.\n\n\n\nTo attract the audiences, many of the \"Sangeet Natak\"s used to prefix the word \"Sangeet\" before their actual name.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Silver Fox is a former love interest for Wolverine, and currently works for the terrorist organization HYDRA.\n\nSilver Fox first appears in \"Wolverine\" vol. 2 #10 and was created by Chris Claremont and John Buscema.\n\nSilver Fox is a member of the First Nation Blackfoot Confederacy. In the early to late 1900s, she lived with Wolverine as his lover in Canada. She was allegedly murdered by Sabretooth on Wolverine's birthday, but is later revealed to be alive and a member of \"Team X\", the most formidable covert ops team the CIA had to offer. Fox eventually betrays Team X and becomes a member of HYDRA, a subversive terrorist organization.\n\nSilver Fox reappears during the modern period when Wolverine tracks down each member of the Weapon X staff, discovering the studios where many of his memories, which he believes to be real, were staged. Allegedly she kills the professor who had been in charge of the program after Logan left. At this point it is revealed that Silver Fox is in command of a section of HYDRA.\n\nShortly thereafter, Silver Fox captures the assassin Reiko, and forms an alliance with Reiko's boss, Hand Jonin Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Matsu'o is in the process of trying to buy Clan Yashida's underworld connections before Mariko Yashida severs them entirely. Silver Fox dupes Reiko into poisoning Mariko, giving Matsu'o what he wanted. Silver Fox's motivations in this are unclear.\n\nLater, when Mastodon, a member of the Weapon X Program, dies due to the failure of his anti-aging factor, Silver Fox reunites with Logan, Creed, Maverick, and Wraith. She is cold to Logan, and seems not to remember having spent any pleasant time with him. The group infiltrates a secret base and confronts the man who had implanted them with their false memories: Aldo Ferro, the .

After Ferro's defeat, Silver Fox was to be buried in Salem Center. At the church, Logan discovers that her body has been prepared for flight. The father at the church notifies Logan that \"a brick wall with an eyepatch\" gave the order. Suddenly, a S.H.I.E.L.D. carrier arrives with Nick Fury, who states he never imagined the day when a top-ranking HYDRA member would get a full honors S.H.I.E.L.D. burial. Wraith appears as well, having orchestrated the entire funeral, stating \"Salem Center meant nothing to her\". Wraith tells Logan that they found the cabin where he really had lived with Silver Fox a lifetime ago. He gets permission to bury her there, by himself with only a shovel and uses the part of the door with \"Silver Fox + Logan\" in a heart that he had carved into it as a headstone.\n\nWolverine again relives the induced memory of Sabretooth killing Silver Fox on his birthday, although this issue seems to ignore her previous \"return\" to life.\n\nSilver Fox possesses an artificial healing factor and an age suppressant, allowing her to retain her looks after years of being separated from Logan.\n\n\n\n\nKayla Silverfox appears in the video game adaptation of \"\" voiced by April Stewart.\n\n"}

This is usually done to very slow-beat songs, namely sentimental ballads. This simple form of slow dancing is common at dances sponsored by schools or by religious organizations, such as churches or synagogues. In Western popular culture, slow dancing can serve as a symbol of adolescent social awkwardness.\n\nSlow dancing can refer to any slow couple dance (such as certain ballroom dances), but is often associated with a particular, simple style of dance performed by middle school, high school and college students. \n\nWhen two partners dance together, the lead partner- usually male- typically holds their hands against the sides of the following - usually female- partner's hips, buttocks or waist while the follower drapes their hands on the leader's shoulders. The couple then sways back and forth with the music. Foot movement is minimal, but the pair may use their feet to slowly turn on the spot. Because the dance requires little physical concentration, participants often talk to each other while dancing. Some couples who have a close relationship may dance very closely together, in a \"hug-and-sway\" fashion.\n"}
{"id": "1074101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1074101", "title": "Spoon bending", "text": "Spoon bending\n\nSpoon bending is the apparent deformation of objects, especially metal cutlery, either without physical force, or with less force than would normally seem necessary. It is a common form of stage magic, and a variety of methods are used to produce the illusion.\n\nSpoon bending attracted considerable media attention in the 1970s when some people claimed to have the ability to cause such events by paranormal psychic means. The most notable was Uri Geller, who performed by bending metal spoons as well as metal keys and several other objects and materials. Geller's performances were attributed to stage magic by critics such as James Randi and Martin Gardner.\n\nCausing spoons, keys, and other items to appear to bend without any physical force is a common stage magic trick that has many variants. Simply holding a spoon by its neck and rapidly tilting it back and forth can create the illusion that the spoon is bending, due to the way that the human eye perceives the rocking motion.\n\nWhen a spoon is physically bent or broken, it is usually at the point where the object would be easiest to bend by hand. In many cases, the trick uses misdirection, a basic tool of the stage magician. The performer draws the audience's attention away from the spoon during the brief moment while the spoon is being physically bent. The typical bend, where the bowl meets the handle, requires relatively little force. The magician then gradually reveals the bend. When a 1996 BBC television show staged a prank on Uri Geller, it took footage from angles he was not expecting, which showed Geller grasping a spoon firmly with both hands as he stood up to display a bend in it.\n\nOther methods use a metal spoon that has been prepared so that a simple flick will cause it to bend or break. This can be done, for instance, by repeatedly bending the spoon at the desired spot, until the metal cracks and weakens. If the spoon breaks, the magician holds together the two halves of the spoon as if it were unbroken, then slowly relaxes the grip, making the spoon appear to bend before splitting in two.\n\nIf a magician has control over the viewing angle, the trick can be done by using a spoon that is already bent at the start of the trick. The spoon is initially held with the bend along the viewing angle, making it invisible. The magician then turns the spoon slowly to reveal the bend. The magician Ben Harris author of the book \"Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect\" (1985) revealed step-by-step photographs and text showing how to bend keys and cutlery by trick methods.\n\nSome novelty or magic shops sell self-bending spoons (utilizing the physical properties of a nickel titanium alloy) which can be used by amateur and stage magicians to demonstrate \"psychic\" powers or as a practical joke. Such \"self-bending\" spoons will bend themselves when used to stir tea, coffee, or any other warm liquid, or even when warmed by body heat.\n\nIn an experimental study (Wiseman and Greening, 2005) two groups of participants were shown a videotape in which a fake psychic placed a bent key on a table. Participants in the first group heard the fake psychic suggest that the key was continuing to bend when it had remained stationary, while those in the second group did not. The results revealed that participants from the first group reported significantly more movement of the key than the second group.\n\nThe findings were replicated in another study. The experiments had demonstrated that \"testimony for PKMB after effects can be created by verbal suggestion, and therefore the testimony from individuals who have observed allegedly genuine demonstrations of such effects should not be seen as strong evidence in support of the paranormal\".\n\nDue partly to the publicity surrounding Uri Geller in the 1970s, bent spoons have become a common visual symbol of the paranormal. It is shown, for example, in \"The Matrix\", when a young boy bends a spoon to demonstrate the unreality of a computer simulation.\n\nWhile many individuals have claimed the paranormal or psychokinetic ability to bend spoons or manipulate other objects, spoon bending by mental powers alone has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the scientific community. Magician and skeptic James Randi has offered a prize of one million dollars to any person who is able to demonstrate paranormal abilities such as spoon bending.\n\nRetired Boeing Engineer Jack Houck hosted \"PK Parties\" (psychokinesis parties) from 1981 to 1988 where 85% of thousands of participants claimed to have accomplished spoon bending personally.\n\nAuthor Michael Crichton described his successful experience with spoon bending at a psychokinesis party in his 1988 book \"Travels\":\nParapsychologist and author Dean Radin has reported that he was able to bend the bowl of a spoon over with unexplained ease of force with witnesses present at an informal psychokinesis experiment gathering in 2000.\n\nMaureen Caudill, a trainer associated with the Monroe Institute, claims this is significantly easier to achieve when performed in groups rather than alone.\n\nPhysicist John Hasted believed that children could paranormally bend paper clips inside a glass sphere, provided the sphere had a hole in it and they were allowed to take the sphere into a room unobserved. Martin Gardner wrote Hasted was incapable of devising simple controls such as videotaping the children secretly. Stephen North, a British psychic, was tested by Hasted in the late 1970s. Hasted claimed North had the psychokinetic ability to bend spoons and teleport objects in and out of sealed containers. North was tested in Grenoble on 19 December 1977 in scientific conditions and the results were negative. According to James Randi, during a test at Birkbeck College, North was observed to have bent a metal sample with his bare hands. Randi wrote that \"I find it unfortunate that [Hasted] never had an epiphany in which he was able to recognize just how thoughtless, cruel, and predatory were the acts perpetrated on him by fakers who took advantage of his naivety and trust.\"\n\nJean-Pierre Girard, a French psychic, has claimed he can bend metal bars by psychokinesis. Girard was tested in the 1970s but failed to produce any paranormal effects in scientifically controlled conditions. He was tested on January 19, 1977 during a two-hour experiment in a Paris laboratory. The experiment was directed by physicist Yves Farge with a magician also present. All of the experiments were negative as Girard failed to make any of the objects move paranormally. He failed two tests in Grenoble in June 1977 with James Randi. He was also tested on September 24, 1977 at a laboratory at the Nuclear Research Centre. Girard failed to bend any bars or change the structure of the metals. Other experiments into spoon bending were also negative and witnesses described his feats as fraudulent. Girard later admitted that he would sometimes cheat to avoid disappointing the public but insisted he still had genuine psychic power. Magicians and scientists have written that he produced all his alleged psychokinetic feats through fraudulent means.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1981, the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research at Washington University reported a series of experiments they named Project Alpha, in which two teenaged male subjects had demonstrated psychokinesis phenomena, including metal-bending and causing images to appear on film, under less than stringent laboratory conditions. James Randi eventually revealed that the subjects were two of his associates, amateur conjurers Steve Shaw and Michael Edwards. The pair had created the effects by standard trickery, but the researchers, being unfamiliar with magic techniques, interpreted them as proof of psychokinesis.\n\nJohn Taylor had tested children in metal bending. According to Martin Gardner, the controls were inadequate as the children would put paper clips in their pockets and later take one out twisted or be left with metal rods unobserved. James Randi managed to bend an aluminum bar when Taylor was not looking and scratch on it \"Bent by Randi\". In other experiments, two scientists from the University of Bath examined metal bending with children in a room which was secretly being videotaped through a one-way mirror. The film revealed that the children bent the objects with their hands and feet. Due to the evidence of trickery, Taylor concluded metal bending had no paranormal basis.\n\n\n\n"}

These releases were followed by noneducational bonus discs. \"Cluefinders\" held a writing competition in 2001. Sponsored by The Learning Company, the competition was open to 3rd-6th grade classrooms in the United States. The winning essay - a new adventure for the ClueFinders crew, won an iMac. In 1998, The Learning Company was acquired by Mattel for $3.7 billion, considered one of the worst deals in business history; the following year Mattel sold off their The Learning Company assets to Gores Technology Group. 2000's \"\" was the first to include the A.D.A.P.T technology, which allowed teachers and parents to monitor the player's progress and included auto-adjustable levels based on the player's ability. In the year 2000, Mattel Interactive hired professional writers Jill Gorey and Barbara Herndon had designed a concept for a TV series, however, the franchise never made its way to television.\n\nIn 2001, Riverdeep acquired many of The Learning Company's properties from Gores Technology Group by selling $40 million in stock. Carmen Sandiego, ClueFinders, and Reader Rabbit were then licensed to the KidsEdge Website in 2002 where they were available to play among 170 games and activities. In 2003, The ClueFinders' Reading Adventures was reconfigured to run on Windows XP. The 2004 RCN InterACTION service allowed parents to stream over 35 games in series such as Carmen Sandiego, Clifford the Big Red Dog and ClueFinders over a broadband connection. Compilations including multiple previously released titles, such as \"Cluefinders Adventure Pack and \"Cluefinders Triple Pack' have since been created as well as bundled which includes a single ClueFinders title (often \"The ClueFinders Reading Adventures\") among other games (mostly other Learning Company games) in series such as \"Adventure Workshop\" and \"After School Clubhouse\". In addition, the 3rd till 6th grade titles were re-released on the iOS platform on December 19, 2010. Around this time, LeapFrog Enterprises created three Browser games, which cast different voice actors. As of 2017, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (the successor of Riverdeep) is offering the Cluefinders brand as a licensing opportunity on its website.\n\nDevelopment of the games' \"super compelling\" and \"rich\" backstory took 16 months. The ClueFinders' adventures take place in the contemporary real world incorporating some elements of fantasy and science fiction, with merely the continued presence of LapTrap pushing the series into the realm of science fiction. They simultaneously had a sense of urgency toward an end goal while allowing players to explore and use their minds on puzzles. Nevertheless, the opening titles from \"The ClueFinders 5th Grade Adventures\" place the series in the present day. The main cast of \"complex\" and \"flawed\" characters include ClueFinders founder and tomboy Joni, skater dude Owen, mechanically-minded Santiago, literary-minded Leslie, artificial intelligent LapTrap, and intelligent dog Socrates. They were chosen to be around the same age as the players after the art director ran various character designs by a group of kids; unsuccessful designs included animals, rock stars, FBI agents, which came across as babysitters instead of teammates. They were designed with distinct personalities and with identifiable faults to increase their relatability. The developers used a character grid to aid their writing; it contained information such as: \"their flaws, their fears, how they met, where they grew up, and their likely reactions to certain situations\".\n\nThe series consists of \"Multisubject by grade\" programs, in which players practice skills and advance understanding of grade-based content. The player can choose to play the adventure mode or to play the game's activities outside the adventure in \"practice mode.\" Choosing to play the adventure will lead to a follow-up sequence which further establishes the premise as well as the overall goal of the game. The bulk of each game involves traveling between different screens in a predetermined area which has various educational activities. The user will have to play these games to advance. Most of the time, each area will have one activity that needs to be completed to advance onwards, but which can only be played by collecting items from all the other activities in the area. In all the games except for \"The ClueFinders 4th Grade Adventures\", the ClueFinders are split into two teams at the start. A portable red videophone allows the two teams to make contact with each other and clicking on the phone provides the user with game hints from the other team. The other team will typically either be serving as backup, looking for clues, or else be captured and in need of rescue.\n\nDuring the gameplay, 2D computer graphics are used in the style of hand-drawn animated cartoons with animations that use thick outlines and solid colors on two-dimensional backgrounds. For this reason, the series is often described as imitating the look of a Saturday morning cartoon \"Scooby-Doo\" being repeatedly cited by reviewers. Cutscenes, however, use pre-rendered 3D graphics.\n\nWhile Reader Rabbit was popular with younger audiences, the Learning Company came up with ClueFinders to appeal to third graders onward for both boys and girls. To coincide with kids' abstract thinking, the games were activity-centered and included cross-curriculum topics more sophisticated than preschool material, which included algebra, grammar and spelling. To ensure that users actually learned something, the educational content came first before the puzzles, gameplay, and objectives. Andy Young, vice president of product marketing for The Learning Company, noted that the ClueFinders series aimed to show children that it was \"cool to be smart\". The A.D.A.P.T. Learning Technology was introduced into The ClueFinders titles in 1999; the system contained a series of customisable features that would facilitate the player's learning by Assessing abilities, Developing skills, Adjusting levels, Providing help, and Tracking progress.\n\nTwo \"ClueFinders\" books, \"The Mystery of Microsneezia\" and \"The Mystery of the Backlot Banshee\", were written by Ellen Weiss and illustrated by Mel Friedman.\n\nFanFiction.Net currently has exactly eighteen stories featuring the ClueFinders, and a ClueFinders section was added to Games in 2010.\n\n\n\"Computer Shopper\" and \"SuperKids\" described \"3rd Grade Adventures\" as the educational equivalent of the Indiana Jones trilogy, while the Chicago Tribune thought the \"hip environmental mystery\" eased children into applying their thinking and thinking skills through its mystery, animation, and challenges, commenting that it \"shines in almost every way\". \"Kiplinger's Personal Finance thought \" \"works hard for its players' enjoyment\". \"Discovery Education wrote that 5th Grade Adventures \"seamlessly combines fun and learning\".\" \"SuperKids\" praised the \"cartoon quality animation and an alluring storyline\" of \"Math Adventures\", and the Cluedo-inspired gameplay. 01Net asserted that in terms of \"\", the activities take precedence over the merely incidental storyline; in 2001 the site described the series' graphics as \"very colorful\" and \"truly seductive\" but three years later the site decided they were outdated. Asbury Park Press noted that \"Reading Adventures, like Carmen Sandiego Word Detective,\" \"place[d] reading games in the middle of mysteries\". \"Teach\" thought the \"Search and Solve Adventures\" mystery was engaging, and that the game successfully combined storytelling with problem-solving activities, while PC Mag thought it was \"mysterious\", \"chill-inducing\", and \"engrossing\". \"PC Mag\" liked \"The ClueFinders: The Incredible Toy Store Adventure!\"'s maths, science, and language puzzles, and its adjustable levels, while The New York Times praised the main cast's culturally diversity and maturity.\n\n\"Exploring Values Through Literature, Multimedia, and Literacy Events\" highlighted the series for its multicultural and balanced cast in which the nonwhite characters have equal status to the white character, noting that Leslie and Santiago are the main sources of knowledge, though noted there were no examples of software with the primary character being non-white. Meanwhile, while \"The Boston Herald\" commented the series had \"come a long way\", the paper suggested that the decision to include a Caucasian (Joni), Asian (Owen), Black (Leslie), and Latino (Santiago) in its main cast smelt of interference from the California School Board standard. The paper praised the series' \"television-quality animation, broad educational focus and lively situations\", though thought the early games were uneven in difficulty. \"Exploring Values Through Literature, Multimedia, and Literacy Events\" further praised the series' focus on character interdependence; how missions are not successful until and unless they work together. \"Children's Software Review\" managing editor Ellen Wolock criticised The Learning Company for focusing too much of its resources on repackaging its old software, commenting that she received the impression the company was \"just throw[ing] together\" entries in its newer ClueFinders series. \"Working Mother\" thought the series offered a \"painless way for kids to hone their skills\". The Cincinnati Enquirer recommended the \"strong\" series to gamers who were unable to locate the then-soon-to-be-discontinued title \"\", and said \"there is a lot to like\" about entries in the series, such as its closed captioning of later titles.\n\nOne piece of research used the game as a \"tool for assessing how children worked on computers in social interactions and influence acceptance by peers in classroom interactions.\"\n\n\"The ClueFinders' 3rd Grade Adventures\" a top ten best-selling educational title in retail stores during the months of March, April, and May. By 2001, the first six games had sold around 3.5 million copies. \n\nSince its creation in 1998, the ClueFinders series has won over 50 awards and accolades in three years.\n"}

{"id": "30047593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30047593", "title": "Twitter Joke Trial", "text": "Twitter Joke Trial\n\nR v Paul Chambers (appealed to the High Court as Chambers v Director of Public Prosecutions), popularly known as the Twitter Joke Trial, was a United Kingdom legal case centred on the conviction of a man under the Communications Act 2003 for posting a joke about destroying an airport to Twitter, a message which police regarded as \"menacing\". The conviction was widely condemned as a miscarriage of justice, and was appealed three times, the conviction being quashed as a result of the third appeal.\n\nDuring late December 2009 and early January 2010, cold weather had resulted in considerable disruption across northern England. Robin Hood Airport in South Yorkshire was one of many airports which was forced to cancel flights. On 6 January 2010, an intending traveller, Paul Chambers, then aged 28, who was planning to fly to Northern Ireland to meet his then girlfriend (later wife), posted a message on Twitter:\n\nA week later, an off-duty manager at the airport found the message whilst doing an unrelated computer search. The airport management considered the message to be \"not credible\" as a threat, but contacted the police anyway. Chambers was arrested by anti-terror police at his office, his house was searched and his mobile phone, laptop and desktop hard drive were confiscated. He was later charged with \"sending a public electronic message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character contrary to the Communications Act 2003\". On 10 May, he was found guilty at Doncaster magistrates' court, fined £385 and ordered to pay £600 costs. He lost his job as a consequence.\n\nA number of legal commentators and celebrities criticised the conviction and called for it to be overturned. They include journalist Nick Cohen, who drew comparison with Milan Kundera's anti-communist novel \"The Joke\"; television writer Graham Linehan; and the comedian and television presenter Stephen Fry, who offered to pay Chambers' fine and subsequent legal bills.\n\nChambers lost an appeal against his conviction. Judge Jacqueline Davies, sitting with two magistrates, heard his appeal in Doncaster Crown Court; she judged that the tweet contained \"menace\" and that Chambers must have known that it might be taken seriously. Thousands of Twitter users responded by reposting Chambers' Tweet including the hashtag #iamspartacus, in reference to the climactic \"I am Spartacus!\" scene in the 1960 film \"Spartacus\".\n\nA further appeal to the High Court was heard on 8 February 2012, in which the two judge panel of Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Irwin failed to reach a decision after initially reserving judgement. The \"appeal by case stated\" was made by Chambers' barristers, Ben Emmerson QC and Sarah Przybylska; David Allen Green, who acted for Chambers in earlier proceedings, also acted as his solicitor, through Preiskel & Co LLP. The appeal was entirely on points of law and centred on the correct interpretation of section 127(1) of the Communications Act 2003.\n\nA second High Court appeal, before a panel of three judges, headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, opened on 22 June 2012. One of the arguments made by Chambers' barrister for this last appeal, John Cooper QC, was that if the tweet was \"menacing\" so was John Betjeman's poem, \"Slough\", pleading \"Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!\". He also asked whether Shakespeare would have been prosecuted if he had tweeted his line from \"Henry VI, Part 2\" (Act IV, Scene 2), \"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers\". The latter reputedly drew laughter from the judges. On 27 June, the judges announced a reserved judgement. Chambers arrived at court accompanied by Stephen Fry and the comedian Al Murray.\n\nChambers' conviction was quashed on 27 July 2012. The approved judgement concluded that \"a message which does not create fear or apprehension in those to whom it is communicated, or who may reasonably be expected to see it, falls outside this provision [of the 2003 Act]\". Accordingly, the appeal against conviction was \"allowed on the basis that this 'tweet' did not constitute or include a message of a menacing character\".\n\nIt has been claimed that staff at the Crown Prosecution Service had been in favour of dropping the case, to the point of informing Chambers, via his solicitor, that they would not oppose the final appeal, but had then been overruled by their head of service, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer. Chambers' MP, Louise Mensch, called for a House of Commons committee to investigate Starmer's behaviour.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40295180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40295180", "title": "Wanita dan Satria", "text": "Wanita dan Satria\n\nWanita dan Satria (; Indonesian for \"The Woman and the Hero\") is a 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) directed by Rd Ariffien and produced by Ang Hock Liem for Union Films that is probably lost. Starring Djoewariah, Ratna Djoewita, Hidajat, Z. Algadrie, and Moesa, it follows a womaniser named Soedrajat who abuses his status to gain women's trust before ultimately getting his comeuppance. Reviews were mostly positive, with one praising the film's depiction of women's issues in a Muslim society.\n\nSoedrajat abuses his high social status in order to womanise and becomes his rich uncle's heir despite the latter having a son, the kindly and noble Soelarsa. The uncle is disappointed with Soelarsa and considers Soedrajat the better man. Being considered high class, he is unwilling to associate with people of the lower classes. Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at first sight. By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him.\n\nAt the wedding, however, the terrible truth about Soedrajat is revealed. One of his former conquests, Tarmini, stands up and tells the crowd, including Soelarsa, of the bridegroom's true nature. In a rage, Soedrajat takes a revolver and shoots Tarmini. With her dying breath, Tarmini makes one last confession. Her father then takes revenge on Soedrajat.\n\n\"Wanita dan Satria\" was produced by Ang Hock Liem for Union Films. It was directed by Rd Ariffien, a former theatre leader and nationalist journalist who had made his directorial debut the preceding year with \"Harta Berdarah\". The story was written by Saeroen, a former journalist with several screenwriting credits for Union.\n\nThe black-and-white film starred Djoewariah, Ratna Djoewita, Hidajat, Z. Algadrie, and Moesa. Moesa was the most experienced of these: he had entered the industry in 1938 with \"Fatima\", a production by Tan's Film, and had been with Union since 1940. Djoewariah had been on Union's payroll since \"Bajar dengan Djiwa\" in 1940, while Ratna Djoewita and Hidajat had not appeared in any films before 1941.\n\n\"Wanita dan Satria\" was released in 1941, reaching Bandung by August and Surabaya by September. The film was open to all ages. A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning. As part of the growing movement to attract Indonesian intellectuals, the marketing staff emphasised the respectable (non-theatrical) background of the actors; the intelligentsia had little respect for traditional theatre and its players.\n\nA review in the Surabaya-based \"Soerabaijasch Handelsblad\" wrote that the film \"gives a clear picture of the precarious position of Indonesian women and motivates the desire for a firmer outline of her rights in the Moslem society.\" Another review in the same newspaper wrote that the film \"is captivating from start to finish\", one which \"the film audience in Surabaya should certainly not miss\".\n\nAfter \"Wanita dan Satria\", Union produced a further two films; none of these were by Rd. Ariffien, who had left the company. Saeroen likewise left soon after, joining Star Film. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles. Neither Ratna Djoewita nor Hidajat appeared in any films after 1941.\n\nThe film is likely lost; the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\n"}
{"id": "42071573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42071573", "title": "Wreckfest", "text": "Wreckfest\n\nWreckfest is a racing video game developed by Bugbear Entertainment and published by THQ Nordic. \"Wreckfest\" is described as the spiritual successor to the \"FlatOut\" series and a cross between \"FlatOut\", \"Destruction Derby\" and cult 1989 PC racer \"Street Rod\". A notable feature of the game engine is the use of soft-body damage modelling, which enables location-based damage that affects the driving dynamics of vehicles in a realistic fashion. After a four-year long early access phase, the Microsoft Windows version was released in June 2018, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions scheduled to be released on March 31, 2019.\n\nThe final game is intended to include a variety of gameplay features, including traditional track racing and demolition derbies. The racing gameplay follows the same fundamental rules as most modern racing games, such as \"Need for Speed\" or \"Gran Turismo\". The player controls a car in a race or demolition derby, the goal being to win the race or be the sole survivor of the derby respectively. Before participating in an event the player must choose a vehicle, select either manual or automatic transmission, and finally select either a dirt or tarmac track on which to race. Players will also be able to buy and sell vehicles, customise vehicles, and perform \"research\".\n\nThe races themselves focus heavily on \"vehicular combat\", where players have to find a balance between defensive tactics such as avoiding debris or opponents' vehicles and more aggressive tactics such as grinding against opponents and forcing them out of the way in order to overtake them or avoid harm. While \"Wreckfest's\" focus on physics and vehicular damage is similar to previous destruction-based racing games such as Criterion's \"Burnout\", it follows a somewhat slower and more strategic approach, resulting in a more traditional racing gameplay experience than in comparable games.\n\nDevelopment on \"Next Car Game\" began in 2012, and was first announced by Bugbear Entertainment on the \"Next Car Game\" blog in August 2013. In an interview with IGN, lead game designer Janne Suur-Näkki stated that the game should reach a \"feature-complete state\" in 2014, with all key features implemented. In a press release published by Eurogamer, \"Next Car Game\" was officially announced for PC.\n\nDue to the lack of publisher support, the development team provided early access to the game via pre-orders on the official \"Next Car Game\" website as well as Steam Early Access and also created a Kickstarter campaign as alternate means of raising revenue in order to develop the game. The overhaul of the physics engine has caused updates to the game to slow significantly. The game was last updated in August 2018.\n\nBugbear launched a Kickstarter campaign on November 1, 2013 in an effort to fund the development of \"Next Car Game\", with a goal of $350,000 to complete the game, and a stretch goal of $1.5 million to create PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. The campaign was cancelled on November 22, after it became \"obvious\" that the game would not reach its funding goal, having only raised $81,722. Lead game designer Janne Suur-Näkki described the Kickstarter campaign as a bewildering and disappointing experience, as Bugbear had to go to \"great lengths\" to make the campaign happen due to Kickstarter and Finnish legislation imposing \"considerable challenges\" on the project.\n\nAfter failing to meet the $350,000 goal of the Kickstarter campaign, Bugbear concentrated efforts on a pre-order campaign being run via the \"Next Car Game\" official website. A playable \"technology sneak peek\" was made available for download to supporters who had pre-ordered the game, the sneak peek featured 24 vehicles and a single level which the developers used internally to test the game's damage engine. Following a highly positive response from players regarding the sneak peek, Bugbear released an extended version called \"Sneak Peek v2.0\" to all pre-order supporters. This extended sneak peek included additional features such as new destructive machinery, more dynamic destructible objects, and a \"physics cannon\".\n\nFollowing the success of the \"Technology Sneak Peek\", an early access version of the game was released shortly before Christmas in 2013. The early access release featured two playable vehicles and three tracks, two of which were traditional race tracks while the other was a demolition derby arena.\nThe early access release was highly successful and received great feedback from sim racers. By the end of the Christmas week the game had already sold for more than Bugbear's initial funding goal of $350,000 on Kickstarter. \"Next Car Game\" was subsequently released on Steam Early Access on 15 January 2014, with special discount prices offered until the 29 January. The game found tremendous success on the Steam Early Access platform, earning over $1 million in sales during a single week.\n\nOn October 3, 2014, Bugbear made an announcement on the game's blog entry for the game's sixth build that \"Next Car Game\" was now officially titled \"Wreckfest\". The announcement came with a definition of the term \"wreck fest\" written on Urban Dictionary. In the same announcement, Bugbear also announced an eighteen-player online multiplayer has been introduced with new deathmatch and team deathmatch game modes, as well as a new track and a new car. The developer also said that they were aiming for twenty-four-player multiplayer for the final release, but will need to spend more time optimizing the game's network code. It was released out of early access on June 14, 2018. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were originally scheduled for release on November 20, 2018, but were delayed to 2019.\n\n\"Wreckfest\" received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n"}
