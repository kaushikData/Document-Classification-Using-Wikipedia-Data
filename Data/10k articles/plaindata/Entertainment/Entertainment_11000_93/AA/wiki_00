The play depicts the developing relationship between two arms limitation negotiators, one Russian and one American, over a year of negotiations.\n\n\"A Walk in the Woods\" was first presented at the Yale Repertory Theater, New Haven, Connecticut, in March 1987. Directed by Des McAnuff the cast starred Josef Sommer as the Russian, Andrey Botvinnik and Kenneth Welsh as the American, John Honeyman. It was next produced at the La Jolla Playhouse, California in July 1987, directed by McAnuff and starring Lawrence Pressman (as John Honeyman) and Michael Constantine (as Andrey Botvinnik).\n\n\"A Walk in the Woods\" premiered on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on February 10, 1988 in previews, officially on February 28, 1988, and closed on June 26, 1988 after 21 previews and 137 performances. Directed by Des McAnuff, the cast starred Robert Prosky as Andrey Botvinnik and Sam Waterston as John Honeyman.\n\nThe play was presented at the Westport Country Playhouse, Connecticut, in September 1988. Directed by Maureen F. Gibson, the cast starred Lawrence Pressman (as John Honeyman) and Michael Constantin] (as Andrey Botvinnik).\n\nThe play was produced in the West End at the Comedy Theater in November 1988. The cast starred Alec Guinness (Andrey Botvinnik) and Edward Herrmann (John Honeyman), directed by Ronald Eyre.\n\nThe play was produced Off-Broadway by the Keen Company at The Clurman Theatre at Theatre Row in September 2014. The cast starred Paul Niebanck (John Honeyman) and Kathleen Chalfant (as Irina Botvinnik), directed by Jonathan Silverstein. Blessing commented on changing the character of the Soviet diplomat from a man to a woman: \" 'I've formally been asked for my approval to change the gender of one or the other negotiator in this play four times, that I recall. In each case I gave it...I think the gender change can wake us up a bit more to a play that discusses issues that haven’t been on the front burner (in quite this way at least) for decades. It reminds us that more and more women are finding their way into our society’s biggest socio-political discussions.' \" The character of the Soviet diplomat had previously been played by a woman, in the production at the Northern Stage in Vermont, which transferred to London at the Tricycle Theatre in October 2011. Press materials for this production stated \"the director's decision to cast a woman in the role keeps the production topical, reflecting the more recent appointments of women such as Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton to positions of diplomatic global power.\"\n\nTwo arms negotiators stroll in the woods above Geneva, Switzerland, in the late summer, away from the glare of the negotiating table. They are a Soviet diplomat, Andrey Botvinnik age 57, and John Honeyman age 45, an American negotiator. The two men eventually develop a relationship, although their personalities differ. Botvinnik is friendly and enjoys American culture, Honeyman is formal and idealistic.\n\nNote: the play is suggested by a real-life incident, which occurred in 1982. \"Negotiators Paul H. Nitze and Yuli A. Kvitsinsky left the official Geneva sessions for an unofficial \"walk in the woods\" and achieved a breakthrough, soon rejected by their Governments.\"\n\nFrank Rich, in his review of the Broadway production for \"The New York Times\", wrote: \"...as a piece of theater, 'A Walk in the Woods' is the esthetic equivalent of Switzerland, and not only because its setting is 'a pleasant woods on the outskirts of Geneva.' The play at the Booth fudges the distinctions of actual international politics and arms negotiations, choosing instead to telescope the messy, life-or-death conflict into a sentimental relationship between two likable envoys.\"\n\nAlvin Klein, in reviewing the Westport Country Plahouse production for \"The New York Times\", wrote: \"Mr. Blessing's play is a [c]one of ideas, intelligence and some semblance of wit. The dramatic action and character exposition he has provided is negligible. It remains for the actors to establish complete characters and this Mr. Constantine and Mr. Pressman do with immense skill.\"\n\nThe play was nominated for the 1988 Tony Award , Play and Actor in a Play (Prosky). Prosky won the 1988 Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding Actor in a Play.\n\nThe play was a finalist for the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nAlec Guinness was nominated for the 1988 Olivier Award, Actor of the Year in a New Play, and the play was nominated as the BBC Award for the Play of the Year\n\nThe play was adapted into a 1988 television film, written by Blessing and directed by Kirk Browning.\n"}

It is the fourth and final installment in \"American Pie Presents\" film series, a spin-off of the \"American Pie\" franchise. The film stars Bug Hall, John Patrick Jordan, Kevin M. Horton, Brandon Hardesty, and Eugene Levy. This was Sherman Hemsley's final film appearance before his death on July 24, 2012.\n\n\"American Pie Presents: The Book of Love\" was released direct-to-DVD in the United States on December 22, 2009.\n\nThe film begins with Rob entering his bedroom, and attempting to masturbate with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (similar to the apple pie scenario in the first film). While he is doing this his dog, Frizzie, tries to eat the sandwich, and Rob's little brother Cody takes a video of the ordeal. Later, Rob meets with his friends, Nathan and Marshall Lube, at school. Nathan reveals that his girlfriend, Dana, has pledged to abstain from sex until marriage despite the fact that she has already slept with six other people. Rob talks to Heidi, a girl he is attracted to, and Stifler. Stifler states that if Rob doesn't make a move on Heidi, he will. In class, Lube has a vivid fantasy about a group of cheerleaders, particularly one named Ashley Lawrence. Rob and Heidi meet later in the school library where she discloses that she is a virgin, and wishes to just \"get it [sex] over with\". At the school dance, Nathan tries to get to second base with Dana, but only manages to offend her due to her abstinence pledge. Rob attempts to tell Heidi how he feels about her but is interrupted by Nathan and Lube. He eventually finds her in the library about to have sex with another student, and drops a lit candle in a bin in shock. This sets the library on fire, which sets off the water sprinklers.\nThe next day, when Rob and Heidi are cleaning the library, Rob finds a secret compartment containing 'The Bible' (The Book of Love). He shows the book to Nathan and Lube and explains that it is a sex manual that has been compiled over forty years by the students who found it. The book is regarded as legendary, but unfortunately has been damaged by the water.\nLater in the local mall, Rob attempts to test a tip in the book; 'Simple Flattery'. He approaches Ashley in a lingerie store and complements her. Ashley leads him into a changing room, takes off her bra and top, and makes him steal a bra for her. Unfortunately Rob is caught and forced to pay with his mom's credit card. Meanwhile, Nathan goes to Dana's church service to talk to her, but accidentally broadcasts the explicit and highly personal conversation to the entire congregation on the church's PA system. Dana's father then bans her from seeing Nathan. When she receives her credit card bill, Rob's mom tries to talk to him about it, prompting Rob to sarcastically say that he likes wearing women's underwear. He is again filmed by his little brother, who again posts the footage on the internet for the whole school to see.\nThe next day, Heidi, Imogen, and Dana are at a school basketball game in which Rob and Stifler are playing. A girl called Katie tries to talk to Stifler, but he brushes her off. Rob again attempts to tell Heidi how he feels, but is unable to. Lube discovers a page in The Bible which tells of a brothel in Canada and a prostitute, Monique, who is very experienced. The entry was written in 1975, but Lube misreads the date as 1995, and they decide to visit. When they meet Monique the boys are disgusted, but Nathan states that they should go for it anyway. Nathan and Lube make Rob go first, but Monique dies while performing oral sex on him. They panic and drive back to the USA.\nRob and Heidi are once again in the library where Rob finally tells her he is attracted to her. Heidi feels the same, and they agree to meet at Stifler's party later. At the party Heidi hears Rob shout \"Tonight, I'm getting laid!\", and runs upstairs. Stifler again brushes off Katie when she tries to talk to him. Lube tells Ashley how he feels about her and guarantees sexual satisfaction, but she still turns him down. Ashley's friend is impressed with his promise and tells Lube to meet her upstairs, but when she finds an offensive text on his phone she storms out. Nathan attempts to reconcile with Dana but offends her, making her leave once again. Rob finds Heidi in bed with Stifler and leaves the room. Heidi follows him downstairs, but Rob refuses to talk to her and begins to drink heavily. He declares \"only assholes get laid!\" and then behaves crudely to a random girl, who promptly goes to bed with him. She asks him to have sex with her from behind, but he hallucinates and sees Heidi saying; \"You aren't seriously going to stick your dick in that, are you?\". Rob then throws up on the girl's back. The next morning his mother asks him if he drove home drunk, and shows him a film she received on her phone of Rob throwing up on the girl the night before.\nIn an attempt to restore The Bible, Rob and his friends resolve to find all of the people who originally wrote it in order to recreate it, starting with the original creator, Noah Levenstein. They eventually succeed in recreating the book.\nRob and his friends then go on the school ski trip. In a log cabin where a few students are playing strip poker, Katie again attempts to talk to Stifler, who again brushes her off. She bets Stifler that if she wins at poker he has to apologise to her and run naked in the snow. Stifler loses and is forced to apologise and go outside naked, where he is humped by a moose. Due to last night's ordeal, Imogen keeps him company and the two form a bond. The other students are riding up the mountain in gondola ski lifts, but Nathan has sex with Dana in the lift control room and accidentally shut off the lifts' power. In one lift, Rob and Heidi reconcile and kiss. Ashley and Lube are in another lift, where Lube falls out when trying to go for help. When Ashley climbs down to him, Lube tells her how he really feels about her, moving her to tears. Heidi and Rob return to the cabin and have sex. Lube and Ashley do the same.\nThe story ends with Rob, Nathan, and Lube returning the newly restored Bible to where Rob found it, after Rob has added his signature to it. As a finale, Rob's brother, Cody, enters his bedroom to find an online film of him putting a vacuum cleaner on his penis. To his horror it has been viewed almost 10 million times. Rob ends the film with the words \"Gotcha, ha ha\".\n\n\n\"The Book of Love\" was filmed in Vancouver. The East Great Falls High was actually Centennial Secondary School in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The tram scene up the mountain is located at Vancouver's Grouse Mountain.\n\n"}

There was no coordination between the national spectrum management authorities in either country to establish the frequency allocations. The management of the spectrum in both countries is largely the product of their economical and political situation. New Zealand didn't start to develop television service until 1965 due to World War 2 and its economic harm in the country's economy.\n\nThe demand and planning for television in Australia intensified after WW2, with the Chifley government first favouring the existing British model (state monopoly) in 1948, and New Zealand used a similar model during the introduction of television in the 1960s. Private broadcasting did not come to the country until the 1980s, but there was no spectrum expansion to cope with the new arrangement.\n\nAustralian television broadcasting commenced in 1956 in Melbourne and Sydney to coincide with the 1956 Summer Olympics.\n\nThree stations commenced operations on a ten channel spectrum arrangement: the ABC operating in the VHF low band (VHF Ch 2), and the commercial stations operating in the VHF high band (VHF Ch 7 & 9). At the outset, commercial stations were independently owned, but due to economic forces network affiliations were soon established.\n\nThis pattern of television spectrum allocation was replicated in most of the state capital cities over the subsequent decade, with the exception of Hobart (one commercial service on VHF 6) and eventually Darwin (both the ABC and the commercial service were allocated in the VHF high band).\n\nGeographical conditions differed in Melbourne and Sydney. The Melbourne transmission towers were located on the nearby Mount Dandenong, and their elevation and broadcasting power on an otherwise relatively flat terrain meant that the broadcasting signal could be reached for some considerable distance, although there were some areas that experienced reception difficulties due to hills or buildings.\n\nIn the Sydney \"basin\" (formed by the Blue Mountains) the broadcast towers were collocated on the original studio sites, and given the undulating geography of Sydney there were many areas that experienced reception difficulties. The Blue Mountain terrain in the West of Sydney meant that capital city broadcasting did not penetrate into the hinterland of NSW, unlike that of Melbourne. It is possible that the penetration of weak signals into the Victorian hinterlands hastened the demand for the establishment of regional television stations, which commenced in 1961.\n\nThe Australian Government restricted regional television broadcasting to one commercial service and a repeater station of the national broadcaster from the capital city ABC station. Regional television stations tended to be allocated to VHF 6, 8 or in some cases 10.\n\nIn popular culture, there is a TV series \"50 Years of New Zealand Television\" that covers in Episode 1 some of the early difficulties of getting TV broadcasting started in NZ, but with no coverage at all with respect to Frequency Allocation.\n\nNew Zealand for all practical purposes did not get television broadcasting of any kind until around 1960, when a Pay TV system was allowed to operate in Auckland.\n\nThe existing documentaries on TV development in NZ don't cover Frequency Allocation\n\nThe United Kingdom and New Zealand until recently shared an FM broadcasting allocation of 88.0 MHz to 105.0 MHz. Since the early 2000s both nations have full use of the standard FM Stereo region due to reallocation activities related to their separate implementation strategies for digital television.\n\nThis smaller FM Band allocation (less than 20 MHz : 88 MHz to 108 MHz—typical of FM in the rest of the world) can be traced to the 405 line system's VHF allocation block. The UK adopted the 405 line system but NZ did not. The slightly smaller allocation only posed problems for the UK for its densely populated metropolitan regions, but NZ had few problems with the smaller allocation.\n\nNZ's allocation for FM remained smaller as if NZ had adopted the 405 line system. New Zealand considered adopting the 405 line system in the late 1950s to early 1960s but adopted PAL instead. This impacted the frequency allocation block for FM broadcasting making it smaller. New Zealand's FM frequency allocation issue was not fixed until the late 1990s, when the FM band was expanded to the standard full 20 MHz block. As of the mid-2010s NZ totally abandoned its VHF band for UHF channels above 25.\n\nThere is a frequency offset for many DTV channels between Australia and NZ, because of historical reasons relating to the introduction of PAL.\n\n\n\nDVB-T channel allocation note\n\nTable notes : Text in \"italics\" means these frequencies are not currently used but set aside as a Guardband or for future use.\n\nThe ABC has the highest number of transmission sites: often, but not always, SBS and ABC signals are transmitted from the same masts.\n\nSome commercial broadcasters have a call sign that operates over multiple areas, whereas others may only serve a single area. This is due to historical ownership of regional stations. Nevertheless, most regional stations are now affiliated with the major metropolitan networks.\n\nChannel 25 is being used as a Guardband, but could be used if a channel reallocation be needed.\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\nAustralia\n"}

Onyx claims they're back, but not in the form we expected them to be in. They should have thought about what they were naming this LP before it was released, because with this title, many had high expectations, it's nowhere near being a complete travesty. Is this album commercial? More than one may expect. This LP has gotten horrible reviews by critics as well as die hard Onyx fans.

There are approximately 1,000 baseball players in Israel in 16 cities across the country. Volunteer coaches and donors are instrumental to the growth and development of the sport as baseball resources are very limited within the country. Israel is currently ranked 19th in the world in the sport.\n\nBaseball was first played in the British Mandate of Palestine on July 4, 1927. The first field in Israel was built in Kibbutz Gezer in 1979, and the country now has a baseball field at the Yarkon Sports Complex in Petach Tikva. Israel sends national teams of various age groups to international baseball tournaments each year. The best recent showing to date in International Play (Pool A) was a 1st place by the Israeli Juvenile (ages 10–12) in the 2009 European Championships (CEB). Between 500 and 1,000 Israelis regularly play baseball in amateur league play. Baseball is growing at an accelerated pace, with much greater baseball identity associated with the country.\n\nThe Israel Association of Baseball (IAB), established in 1986, is a non-profit organization in Israel. Their goal is to promote and develop baseball in Israel. In order to accomplish this they teach baseball to youth, organize national tournaments as well as aid in assisting Israeli teams to compete internationally, and procuring the required equipment. Additionally they will help organize the league, ensure they have a proper field, train the coaches, umpires and player.\n\nThe IAB is a member of The Olympic Committee of Israel, The Confederation of European Baseball and The International Baseball Association. The above organization in addition to the Israel Sports Authority, recognizes the IAB as the sole governing body for baseball in Israel.\n\nNotable players to play in the IAB include Alon Leichman and Dean Kremer.\n\nThe following clubs are registered to participate in the IAB; these are mostly youth clubs (Senior teams have a star next to their name:)\n\nUnder the authority of the IAB the Israel Baseball Academy launched in October 2014. The first year's program started in mid-October at Yarkon Sports Complex in Petah Tikva.\n\nAcademy players will partake in weekly training. This will give them the opportunities to play in the Israel National Team Program, to be recognized as Elite Athletes in the IDF. The program is also recognized by Major League Baseball and will give them access to programs designed for the best young players in Europe.\n\nFormer IAB National Director Nate Fish and National Team Coach David Schenker were the first coaches for the academy. Dan Rothem, a former college pitcher and Israel National Team player will be the pitching coach. Each year the program plans to include 10 kids age 14-21. In addition to the first year's participants there are 20 kids which are being scouted for year two.\n\nThere are currently 24 players aged 14-18 in the Israel Baseball Academy. National Coach, Ryan Willen, a former catcher at division 3 Washinton & Jefferson College runs the Academy. Additionally, former Japanese professional coach and player by the nickname of \"KAZ\" assists in operating and maintaining the high-level product offered to the nations best players.\n\nIn 2007, the Israel Baseball League played its one and only season. The six league teams were the Tel Aviv Lightning, Netanya Tigers, Bet Shemesh Blue Sox, Petach Tikva Pioneers, Modi'in Miracle, and Ra'anana Express. All the leagues games were played at three ballparks. The Yarkon Sports Complex, Gezer Field, and Sportek Baseball Field.\n\nIn November 2007 it was announced that a new six-team league, the Israel Professional Baseball League, was taking shape, and would play its first season in 2008. Those behind the new league included billionaire Jeffrey Rosen, a major IBL investor who also owns the Maccabi Haifa basketball team, which he bought in the summer of 2007, and is the chairman of Triangle Financial Services of Aventura, Florida; Andrew Wilson, who was a facilitator on the ground for the IBL and now works for Rosen; Alan Gardner, a lawyer from New York, who was the centerfielder for the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox; and Michael Rollhaus, a businessman from Queens and major IBL investor.\n\nIsrael, was placed in the Qualifier 1 bracket with Spain, South Africa and France.\n\nIsrael competed in their first qualifying match for the 2013 tournament on 19 September 2012. In this game they defeated South Africa by a score of 7-3. Nate Freiman had two home runs in the victory.\n\nIsrael's second qualifying match was against Spain on 21 September 2012. Israel won the game by a score of 4-2. Nate Freiman once again homered twice for Israel in the victory.\n\nIsrael's third qualifying match was once again against Spain on 23 September 2012. Israel lost this game by a score of 9-7 in 10 innings. With the victory Israel was eliminated from the tournament and Spain moved on to the next round. Although Israel had won their first two games they were eliminated due to the tournaments modified double-elimination format. This meant that the final game was winner-take-all.\n\nIn September 2016, Israel competed in the 2017 Qualifier 4 round. Colorado Rockies coach Jerry Weinstein served as the manager. Israel's roster included 20 MLB-affiliated minor leaguers, making up 86% of the team, more than any other team in the qualifiers even before including recent Major Leaguers. \n\nIsrael won all three of their games in the qualifier, beating Great Britain twice and Brazil once. With the win, Israel will play in Pool A in South Korea in March 2017, against South Korea, Taiwan, and Netherlands. In the first round, Israel again swept the round, to advance to the second round in Pool E.\n\nIn June 2015 Dean Kremer became the first Israeli to ever be selected in the Major League Baseball draft, when he was drafted by the San Diego Padres. It was announced on July 22 that he would honor his commitment and play for the UNLV Rebels, which left three years on his eligibility at the time, with the plan of playing professionally after college. In the 2016 Major League Baseball Draft, Kremer was picked in the 14th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers, 431 overall. His signing was announced by the Dodgers on 16 June and he made his professional debut on 3 July for the Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer Baseball League.\n\nCurrently there are three main ballparks in Israel.\n\nIn January 2017 the roster of the Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic team traveled to Beit Shemesh to participate in the ground breaking ceremony for the first ever dedicated baseball field in Israel. The field is expected to take approximately 2-3 months to design, and be available for use by the end of 2017.\n\n"}

Acting as a prequel to the 1986 12-issue \"Watchmen\" limited series by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, the project consists of eight limited series and one one-shot (though two were initially planned) for a total of 37 issues.\n\nMoore stated in 1985 that if the \"Watchmen\" limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would possibly create a 12-issue prequel series called \"Minutemen\" featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story. DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as \"Rorschach's Journal\" or \"The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary\", as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because \"The 'Nam\" was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a \"Nite Owl/Rorschach team\" (in the manner of \"Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)\", and also in the sense that the original Charlton characters Blue Beetle and The Question had worked together as a team from time-to-time). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals. Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of a \"Minutemen\" series, because it would have \"[paid] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books—with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting to see how we got to the conclusion.\"\n\nIn 2010, Moore told \"Wired\" that DC offered him the rights to \"Watchmen\" back earlier that week, if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects. Moore said that \"if they said that 10 years ago, when I asked them for that, then yeah it might have worked ... But these days I don't want \"Watchmen\" back. Certainly, I don't want it back under those kinds of terms.\" DC Comics co-publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded, \"DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves.\"\n\nFollowing months of rumors about a potential \"Watchmen\" follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced seven prequel limited series under the \"Before Watchmen\" banner: \"Rorschach\", \"Minutemen\", \"Dr. Manhattan\", \"Comedian\", \"Silk Spectre\", \"Nite Owl\", and \"Ozymandias\". The books were written by J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and drawn by Lee Bermejo, J. G. Jones, Adam Hughes, Andy Kubert, Joe Kubert, and Amanda Conner. Every issue featured a two-page installment of the backup series \"Curse of the Crimson Corsair\" written by Len Wein and drawn by original \"Watchmen\" colorist John Higgins. The backup was inspired by the \"Tales of the Black Freighter\" story within a story from the original \"Watchmen\". A \"Before Watchmen: Epilogue\" one-shot was announced but never published.\n\nGibbons stated, \n\nMoore criticized the project, calling it \"completely shameless\", and stated he was not interested in monetary compensation, but rather “What I want is for this not to happen.” Moore elaborated,\n\nWriter/Artist: Darwyn Cooke\n\nHollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, recounts his exploits with The Minutemen during the 1940s, while in the midst of his retirement, he faces opposition to the publication of his tell-all autobiography, \"Under the Hood\" in the early 1960s.

Formerly known as the Cartoon Research Library and the Cartoon Library & Museum, it holds the world's largest and most comprehensive academic research facility documenting and displaying original and printed comic strips, editorial cartoons, and cartoon art. The museum is named after the Ohio cartoonist Billy Ireland.\n\nCovering comic books, daily strips, Sunday strips, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, magazine cartoons, and sports cartoons, the collection includes 450,000 original cartoons, 36,000 books, 51,000 serial titles, and of manuscript materials, plus 2.5 million comic strip clippings and tear sheets.\n\nThe Cartoon Library began in 1977 when the Milton Caniff Collection was donated to Ohio State and delivered to the School of Journalism, which was headed by Lucy Shelton Caswell, who became the Milton Caniff Reading Room first curator. Interviewed by Matt Tauber, Caswell detailed the museum's origins and how she became involved:\n\nFrom two classrooms off the back hallway of the Journalism Building in 1977, the collection expanded to three classrooms and became part of the University Libraries. By 1989, the three classrooms were filled, and the library moved into a larger space, eventually requiring the use of off-site storage as the collection continued to expand. (At that point, the facility was named the Cartoon Research Library.)\n\nIn 1992, United Media donated the Robert Roy Metz Collection of 83,034 original cartoons by 113 cartoonists.\n\nIn 1998, the San Francisco Academy of Comic Art Collection was acquired from its director, Bill Blackbeard, giving the library the largest collection of newspaper comic-strip tear sheets and clippings in the world. Six semitrailer trucks transported this collection from California to Ohio.\n\nIn 2007, King Features Syndicate donated its proof-sheet collection, consisting of over two million strips (a duplicate set was donated to Michigan State University's Comic Art Collection).\n\nIn June 2008, the collection of the International Museum of Cartoon Art (more than 200,000 originals with an estimated value of $20 million) was transferred to the Cartoon Library & Museum. Founded in 1973 by cartoonist Mort Walker, the IMCA collection includes a wide variety of original cartoon art (comic strips, comic books, animation, editorial, advertising, sport, caricature, greeting cards, graphic novels, and illustrations), display figures, toys, and collectibles, plus works on film and tape, CDs, and DVDs. The 2009 exhibition \"From Yellow Kid to Conan: American Cartoons from the International Museum of Cartoon Art Collection\" was held at the Cartoon Library and Museum from June to August.\n\nIn September 2009, it was announced that the Ohio State University Board of Trustees approved a new name, Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum, in recognition of a $7 million gift from an anonymous donor to support the renovation of Sullivant Hall. The museum was named in honor of William Addison Ireland (1880 – May 29, 1935), a self-taught cartoonist (and native of Chillicothe, Ohio) well known throughout Ohio as Billy Ireland. A native of Chillicothe, Ohio, Billy Ireland was a self-taught cartoonist who was hired by \"The Columbus Dispatch\" shortly after his 1898 high school graduation. Until his death, Ireland worked in Columbus for the \"Dispatch\", drawing both editorial cartoons and his Sunday feature, \"The Passing Show\". His work was exhibited by the museum in 2003. \n\n\nThe Milton Caniff Collection consists of 12,000 original artworks by Caniff, 85 boxes of memorabilia, and more than 450 boxes of manuscript materials, fan letters, and business records.\n\nAs the museum's collection of original art and manuscripts evolved and expanded, it added the Nick Anderson Collection, the Jim Borgman Collection, the Eldon Dedini Collection, the Edwina Dumm Collection, the Woody Gelman Collection of Winsor McCay cartoons, the Walt Kelly Collection, the collection of agent Toni Mendez, and the Bill Watterson Collection. The Bud Blake Collection includes more than 5,800 of the cartoon panels he drew for King Features Syndicate from 1954 to 1965, plus 10,000 daily and Sunday \"Tiger\" originals. Comic-book collections include the Will Eisner Collection; the Jay Kennedy Collection has more than 9,500 underground comic books.\n\nThe museum's collection includes work by Anne Mergen, who was the only female editorial cartoonist in the United States for much of her career.\n\nArchival professional records include the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, National Cartoonists Society, Newspaper Features Council, and the Cartoonists Guild. A biographical registry of cartoonists contains files for more than 5,000 cartoonists and clipping files organized by cartoon-related subjects.\n\nThe library sponsors programs related to cartoon art by staging exhibitions, lending for exhibits elsewhere, and hosting speakers, seminars, workshops and conferences. Some physical exhibitions have been made available as digital exhibitions.\n\nThe Festival of Cartoon Art has been held triennially since 1983. Featuring two days of lectures, panel discussions, exhibitions, and receptions, it attracts cartoonists, comics scholars, fans, collectors, and students. Leading cartoonists have spoken at the festival, including Lynda Barry, Milton Caniff, Will Eisner, Jules Feiffer, Ben Katchor, Patrick Oliphant, Jeff Smith, Art Spiegelman, Garry Trudeau, and Bill Watterson.\n\nCaswell remained as curator from 1977–2010. She is author of several books on cartooning, including \"Illusions: Ethnicity in American Cartoon Art\" (Ohio State Libraries, 1992) and \"Arnold Roth: Free Lance\" (Fantagraphics, 2001).\n\nJenny E. Robb became the museum's new curator on January 1, 2011, following the December 31, 2010, retirement of Caswell, who returned as curator of special projects in March 2011. Before arriving at Ohio State in 2005, Robb was curator of the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco for five years. She has master's degrees in history and museum studies from Syracuse University. Wendy Pflug joined the staff as associate curator in December 2011. Associate Curator and Assistant Professor Caitlin McGurk, who started as a Visiting Curator in February 2012, manages the libraries outreach efforts, including instruction, exhibits, tours, and social media.\n\nOther staffers include Assistant Curators Susan Liberator and Marilyn Scott.\n\nIn May 2010, the Ohio State University Press announced Studies in Comics and Cartoons, a series of books edited by Caswell and Jared Gardner, associate professor in the Department of English. Books published in this series will focus on comics and graphic literature with monographs and edited collections covering the history of comics and cartoons from the editorial cartoon and early sequential comics of the 19th century through contemporary international comics and online comics.\n\nIn 2017, the Ohio State University Press began publishing \"Inks\", a new journal for the Comics Studies Society.

Schulz, made a donation of $1 million with a promise of a matching grant if more funds were raised for the renovations. Her challenge was that she would provide an additional gift of $2.5 million if Ohio State raised the same amount from other sources to reach a $6 million total. Cartoonist Bil Keane and his family answered the Schulz Challenge with a $50,000 gift.\n\nThe $20.6 million project was completed in 2013, with Sullivant Hall housing both the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum and Ohio State's Department of Dance. \n\n\nSelect collections have been digitized and are available as part of the library's Digital Exhibits collection.\n\n\n"}

Roberts (April 27, 1879 – January 21, 1930), sometimes referred to as \"Ragtime\" Bob Roberts, was an American novelty singer in the early years of the 20th century.\n\nHe was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Nicholas (Nick) Roberts, a well-known clown who became the proprietor of one of the country's leading touring pantomime companies. Bob Roberts is assumed to have traveled widely with his father's shows in his youth. He made his recording debut for Columbia Records in 1902, and initially recorded remakes of other artists' records before starting to make recordings of new songs. Among the most successful of his early recordings for Columbia were \"Hurrah For Baffin's Bay\" and \"By The Sycamore Tree\", both in 1903.\n\nRoberts also recorded for Edison, Victor, and other companies. He recorded prolifically, recording some songs for several different labels. One of his biggest comedy successes was with \"The Woodchuck Song\", written by Theodore Morse, with a chorus of \"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\", which he recorded in 1904 for Edison, Columbia, Victor, and Zon-O-Phone Records. He also recorded for both Edison and Columbia as part of a duo with Albert Campbell.\n\nHe was at the peak of his recording career between 1903 and 1907, when he rivaled Billy Murray for popularity, and received a similar payment of $30 for each recording. He and Murray occasionally recorded together, as on \"Oh! Oh! Sallie\", in 1905. Roberts was a leading exponent of the comedic \"coon song\", such as \"Wouldn't It Make You Hungry\", written by Harry Von Tilzer, and \"I'm Satisfied\", many of them recorded for Zon-o-phone, a subsidiary of Victor.\n\nThe number of his recordings started to diminish around 1908, perhaps because he devoted more of his time to stage performances. Roberts spent long periods touring in vaudeville, where he became a popular monologist, and was a leading attraction at the Regal Theater in Los Angeles. However, he also continued to record for Edison, Columbia, Victor, and other labels such as Indestructible.\n\nHe had further popular success in 1911 with his recording of \"Woodman, Woodman, Spare That Tree\", from the \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1911\", and in 1912 with the earliest recording of \"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\", for Victor Records. He did not record for any of the major companies after 1913 but, between 1914 and 1917, recorded for the Rex Talking Machine Company as Robert Roberts, including a duet with fellow vaudevillian Elida Morris.\n\nBy the 1920s, Roberts had given up touring and returned to live in Cincinnati. According to Jim Walsh, he ran a pool hall there, and in the late 1920s appeared on radio station WCKY in a show called \"Adolph and Otto\".\n\nHe died in 1930.\n"}

Therefore, comic shows were usually looked down upon in feudal China. During the late Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) and Republic of China period, different styles of comedy flourished in big cities and the genre of xiangsheng, comic drama began to emerge. Since the 1980s, with the rapid development of media throughout the country, different kinds of comedy have arisen. They became the favorite form of entertainment for the populace. Currently, the most popular genres of Chinese comedy are Chinese skit and Xiangsheng.\n\nXiangsheng (), also known as crosstalk, is a traditional Chinese comedic performance in different forms of dialogue. Xiangsheng is a language art combining four basic techniques: speaking, imitating, teasing, and singing. It can be conducted by one or two performers. It is one of the most popular forms of entertainment because its language is rich in puns and allusions. New developments have been applied to this traditional art in order to keep pace with the times. Xiangsheng is a very contemporary performance. Comedians place emphasis on creating new works and injecting new elements into traditional works making them more relevant to current affairs. It is performed in the form of a dialogue between two performers, or, much less often, a solo monologue or, even less frequently, a multi-person dialogue.\n\nChinese skit is a form of performance about small things in people's daily lives. Chinese skit is generally regarded as originating in 1980s. It has inherited qualities, and developed from other forms of comedy, such as stage play, xiangsheng, errenzhuan and comic drama. A skit revolves around just one topic, but with a lot of action and lively language. Through promotion by the Spring Festival Gala Evening over 20 years, Chinese skit became a very popular artistic form in China. The first skit in China was “eating noodles” (in 1984) which was performed by Chen Peisi.\n\nThe typical form of Shanghai-style stand-up comedy is the style known as \"Shanghai Qing Kou\", which was created by Zhou Libo — a most famous stand-up comedian in China. \"Shanghai Qing Kou\" originated from different forms of local stand-up comedy in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. It is a style of comedy in which the performer speaks directly to the audience on socially popular topics. In the performances the performer will include his or her personal experiences.\n\n"}

The group is best known for performing a free hour-long lawn show every Friday at 1 p.m. in front of Tommy Trojan. In addition to their weekly shows, the troupe writes and produces a full-length sketch comedy show every semester.\n\nCommedus quickly established itself as a fixture within the USC theater community, and has served as a stepping-stone in the careers of many USC alumni.\n\nTwice a year, Commedus puts on an original sketch comedy show for the student body, shortly before finals week, showcasing original material written and performed by the Commedus cast (commonly known as the \"Commedes\"). The show is widely acclaimed by the USC theater community, and performances are regularly sold out. Commedus is currently in the process of filming sketches, which will be released on the troupe's website.\n\nEvery spring, Commedus performs 24 straight hours of improv as a fundraiser. The event begins at 2 p.m. Thursday and ends with Commedus' regular lawn show, from 1-2 p.m. Friday. The event has become a staple of the Commedus calendar, and is well-attended throughout its twenty-four-hour span.\n\nCommedus Interruptus holds auditions each Fall, open to undergraduates of all majors. The primary auditions are administered jointly with three other USC improv troupes: Second Nature, The Merry Men, and Spoiler Alert, after which each troupe will offer callbacks on an individual basis. Commedus is unique, however, in that it requires an additional workshop phase: eight candidates are selected to be mentored by the troupe over a six-week period, after which 1-4 will be invited onto the troupe proper. This unusual process is designed to assess the candidates' ability to display talent consistently, take direction and improve over time, and work collaboratively with the rest of the group.\n\n\nAdditionally, the following comedy groups have been formed by alumni of the Commedus cast:\n\nIn 2013, Commedus Interruptus Alumni Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney were made featured players on the legendary New York-based sketch comedy show, \"Saturday Night Live\".

{"id": "6098808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6098808", "title": "Dead Silence", "text": "Dead Silence\n\nDead Silence is a 2007 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell, the creators of \"Saw\". The film stars Ryan Kwanten, Judith Roberts, Donnie Wahlberg, and Amber Valletta. While the movie did receive negative reviews at its release, it has since gathered a cult following.\n\nJamie Ashen and his wife, Lisa, receive an anonymous gift of a ventriloquist doll called \"Billy\". While Lisa is playing with Billy, a figure approaches her, causing her to scream. Jamie finds her dead with her tongue cut out. After Jamie is released from custody by Detective Jim Lipton due to lack of evidence, he spots inside Billy's box a mysterious message about \"Mary Shaw\", a deceased ventriloquist from his hometown, Raven's Fair.\n\nAt Raven's Fair, Jamie visits his estranged and wealthy father, Edward (who uses a wheelchair), and his much-younger wife, Ella, for information regarding Mary Shaw. Dismissing them as superstitions, Jamie arranges for Lisa's funeral with the help of a local mortician, Henry Walker. Jamie meets Henry's senile wife, Marion, who tells him of the danger of Mary and her puppet, Billy. After burying Billy, Jamie is confronted by Detective Lipton in his motel room, the latter still doubting Jamie, and digs up Billy, after Jamie leaves the cemetery where Mary Shaw and the rest of her dummies are buried. \n\nHenry tells Jamie that Mary Shaw was a famous ventriloquist who was publicly humiliated when a young boy named Michael rudely claimed that he could see her lips moving during one of her performances. Michael disappeared some weeks later, and his family blamed it on Shaw and lynched her. Mary's last wish was to have her body turned into a dummy and buried with her 101 dolls. Henry, then the young son of the local mortician, saw Shaw (after she was turned to a dummy) rise up, but Henry was spared thanks to his having kept his mouth shut. This is because Shaw takes her revenge by killing only those who scream. Jamie finds out that Michael, the first victim, was his great uncle; the Ashen family were the ones who killed Shaw by cutting out her tongue, and she has been seeking revenge against their entire bloodline by killing them in the same way.\n\nWhile crawling under the house after discovering Marion with the Billy puppet, Henry is killed by Shaw, who steals his tongue. Detective Lipton discovers that all of Shaw's dolls have been dug up. He informs Jamie, who receives a call from \"Henry,\" asking him to go to Shaw's theatre. There, both Jamie and Detective Lipton discover 100 of the dolls lined up with Michael's body, which has been turned into a marionette. Through a clown doll, Shaw reveals to Jamie that she killed his wife because she was pregnant with his son, thus killing any potential newborn of the Ashen family. Jamie and Lipton burn the theatre and all of Shaw's dolls, though in the process, Shaw successfully makes Detective Lipton scream and kills him.\n\nBack at his father's residence, Jamie is confronted by Mary Shaw, but he repels her by throwing Billy (the 101st and last of the remaining dummies) into the fireplace. He is horrified to learn that his father had already died long ago; the current \"Edward\" is a doll converted from his corpse and controlled by Ella, who is the \"perfect doll\" for Shaw, created just before her death. He screams as Ella, possessed by Mary Shaw, lunges at him.\n\nThe film ends with Jamie reciting a nursery rhyme about Shaw and a photo album with human puppets is shown: Lisa, Henry, Detective Lipton, Edward, Ella, and Jamie himself.\n\n\n\"Dead Silence\" was released in the United States on March 16, 2007, with an \"R\" rating.\n\nIn the United States, as of April 16, 2007, the film's total domestic gross has been worth US$16.5 million (according to Box Office Mojo), and screenings of \"Dead Silence\" were ceased in most theatres sixteen days following its release; the film's estimated production budget was US$20 million. As of April 1, 2009, US$5,408,331 has been generated globally. Worldwide the film has grossed $22,217,407. \nTentative plans for a sequel were abandoned.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 21%, based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"More tasteful than recent slasher flicks, but \"Dead Silence\" is undone by boring characters, bland dialogue, and an unnecessary and obvious twist ending.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 34 out of 100, based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavourable reviews\".\n\nThe film was released on DVD on June 26, 2007 with an \"unrated\" version also released, and the same occurred for the HD DVD product. The film has since grossed US$17,304,718 in overall DVD sales.\n\n\"Dead Silence\" was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on October 25, 2010. In May 2015, it was announced that Universal Studios would be releasing the film to Blu-ray Disc in the U.S. It released on August 11, 2015.\n\nLakeshore Records released the soundtrack of \"Dead Silence\" on March 20, 2007. The CD contains 31 tracks, the first track being the song \"We Sleep Forever\" performed by American rock band Aiden (despite not actually being featured within the film itself). The rest of the CD is taken up by Charlie Clouser's film's score. Clouser has worked on many film scores such as the \"Saw\" series and \"\".\n\n\nMany alternate scenes were released on the unrated DVD and HD DVD and are listed below: \n\n\nIn his personal blog, screenwriter Whannell reveals the origins of the film within the context of the \"Hollywood\" film industry. In a candid post entitled \"Dud Silence: The Hellish Experience of Making a Bad Horror Film\", Whannell explains that the film was conceived following the advice of his agent at the time and that a \"script doctor\" was eventually employed by the production studio. Whannell concludes the post with a description of the key lessons that were learned following the \"Dead Silence\" experience:\nAfter everything is said and done, I'm almost glad \"Dead Silence\" happened, because it gave me an extreme, coal-face lesson in what not to do. It was like learning to swim by leaping off Niagara Falls. I only write scripts on spec now, which means that I write them in my own time without getting paid and then take them out into the world to see if anyone's interested. Never again will I enter the arranged marriage of selling a pitch. I have also become very gun-shy about working with studios. In the world of independent film, what you write ends up on screen. Plus, they don't have the money to bring in script doctors! Works fine for me. Who knows, maybe one day I will work with a studio again...\n\n"}
{"id": "22490533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22490533", "title": "Euphorium", "text": "Euphorium\n\nEuphorium was a site-specific theater installation produced by Antenna Theater that ran from 2000 to 2002 in San Francisco, California, London, England, and Black Rock City, Nevada. \n\nThe piece is based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem, Kubla Khan. It was one of a series of installations Antenna Theater's director, Chris Hardman, describes as \"walkmanology\", in which audience members are guided through a set wearing headphone devices. For Euphorium, the audience members were given specially-designed helmets that included not only stereo speakers, but also a periscope-like device by which they would view a diorama created on a room's ceiling as they walked slowly through the performance. Infrared triggers would initiate various mp3-encoded audio segments as they passed. The result was alternately described as an immersive multimedia performance, and \"gothic theater\".\n\nHardman had founded a successful company, Antenna Audio, by applying the innovation to self-guided museum tours, beginning with Alcatraz Island. The production also made use of a 19th-century optical technique known as \"Pepper's Ghost\", and various puppetry techniques, which Hardman learned in the 1970s as a member of Bread and Puppet Theater at Coney Island.\n\nThe initial production ran from 2000 to 2001 in an old army building in the Presidio of San Francisco that also included a mock opium den. In 2002-2003 Antenna partnered with Soho Theatre Company for a run in the cave-like basement of The Roundhouse in Camden Town, London.\n\nCritical response was mixed, with some complaining that the show's technology and effects were unrefined. The production was also criticized as being confusing, and showing a misunderstanding of the meaning of Coleridge's poem.\n"}
{"id": "33075071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33075071", "title": "Fire Emblem Awakening", "text": "Fire Emblem Awakening\n\nFire Emblem Awakening is a tactical role-playing video game, developed by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console in April 2012 in Japan, and April 2013 outside Japan. It is the thirteenth entry in the \"Fire Emblem\" series, and the first to be developed for the Nintendo 3DS. The gameplay, like previous \"Fire Emblem\" games, focuses on tactical movement of characters across a battlefield fighting enemy units. Other features include the ability to build relationships between the characters to improve their abilities, adjustable difficulty levels, a mode that disables the permanent death of characters, and multiple camera perspectives in battle.\n\nThe story of \"Awakening\" takes place 2000 years after the events of the and \"Fire Emblem Gaiden\", focusing on a group of soldiers from the kingdom of Ylisse. The player controls a customizable Avatar character, (known widely by Fire Emblem fans as Robin, his/her default name) who suffers from amnesia. The Avatar is taken in by Chrom, the prince of Ylisse, and his personal army known as the \"shepherds\" of Ylisse. Over the course of the story, the Avatar aids Chrom's army in defending Ylisse from monsters dubbed the Risen, and attacks from the hostile nation of Plegia.\n\nDevelopment of \"Fire Emblem Awakening\" began in 2010, with multiple veterans of the \"Fire Emblem\" series filling key development roles. Development was handled by Intelligent Systems with supervision from Nintendo. As the series had seen declining sales with previous installments, \"Awakening\" was designed as the possible last entry in the series, with elements from all previous \"Fire Emblem\" games incorporated. Due to the 3DS still being fine-tuned by developers, the team's decisions for content and graphics were made based on what they thought was feasible for what they had available to them. However, some gameplay options and proposals were met with mixed feelings, such as the option to disable permanent character death, often known as 'permadeath', a staple of the \"Fire Emblem\" franchise.\n\nUpon release, the game received critical acclaim and achieved strong sales worldwide, with many critics praising the new additions to the traditional gameplay and accessibility to newcomers of the series. After release, the game was nominated for multiple awards from video game publications, often being cited as one of the best games on the 3DS platform, is credited with boosting sales for the 3DS and is considered one of the best role-playing video games of all time. \"Awakening\"s commercial success ensured the continuation of the series. The successor of \"Awakening\", \"Fire Emblem Fates\", was released in Japan in June 2015, and in Western territories in February 2016.\n\nIn \"Fire Emblem Awakening\", the player begins the game as one of the central characters, a customizable Tactician Avatar: the Avatar's gender, hair color, feature types, and voice can all be customized. There are two modes of play: Casual Mode and Classic Mode. In Classic mode, characters defeated in battle are permanently dead, unable to be used for the rest of the game. Casual Mode enables the player to disable permanent character deaths. With permanent death disabled, fallen units are restored after the completion of the battle. When Chrom or the Avatar character dies in battle in any mode, the player receives a \"Game Over\" message and must restart the battle. The game has multiple difficulty levels: the three standard modes are Normal, Hard and Lunatic. A fourth difficulty level, Lunatic+, is unlocked after completing the game on Lunatic mode. The playing mode and difficulty level are selected at the beginning of a new game.\n\nAfter the player is given access to a party of characters, they can travel across a world map both to new locations and revisit old locations. The time of day on the world map is synced to the player's time zone and time of day. New locations can contain main story missions as well as side stories where new characters can be recruited. Previously visited locations have shops where the player can acquire new weapons. They also can contain random enemy skirmishes. Between missions, players can go to a customizable central base called the Barracks, where the player can watch scenes between characters and perform other activities. The player can recruit approximately forty characters, not including characters included in downloadable content. The game features multiple uses of the Nintendo 3DS-exclusive SpotPass and StreetPass functions via the world map. During navigation, the player can encounter other players and interact via StreetPass. The player can do battle with a party of up to ten characters from another player's world. Whichever player wins the battle gains access to the party. Avatars can also be either befriended or defeated in battle, and loaned out to other players using this function.\n\n\"Awakening\" uses a turn-based tactical role-playing battle system. The terrain is displayed on the top screen of the 3DS, while unit information is displayed on the bottom screen. Before each battle, the player selects a limited number of characters from their roster for use in battle. The player can either control each unit manually or activate an auto-battle option. Character movement is dictated by a tile-based movement system. During combat, player-controlled sprite characters and enemy units controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) each get one turn where they position their units. An additional turn is added when unaffiliated AI-controlled units are in the field. Playable characters positioned next to each other in the field will support one-another, granting buffs, and performing actions such as blocking attacks. Two characters can also pair up as a single mobile unit, enabling both units to attack at once. As the relationship between characters strengthens, they gain greater bonuses to their strength and effectiveness when paired up in battle. During combat, the perspective switches to a 3D scene between combatants. Optional camera angles, including a first-person view through the eyes of playable characters, can be activated using the 3DS stylus.\n\nDuring battles, characters earn experience points (XP) through successful actions during battle. When the character has reached 100 XP, their level is raised by one, increasing various stats including health and attack power. New skills are also learned by each character. The game includes a character class system, with approximately forty classes available. Each character, including the Avatar, has a starting class. When a unit reaches Level 10, they can either upgrade or change their classes using special items called Master Seals and Second Seals. A Master Seal promotes the character's class, improving character stats and giving access to new ability sets or weapons. A Second Seal allows a character to change class, or \"reclass\", when they are either at Level 10 or have reached their current Advanced Class. Upon reclassing, a character's experience level is reset to Level 1 while their stats and abilities are retained. The classes that most characters can reclass into are limited. The exception to this is the Avatar, who is able to reclass into any class available to their gender. Regardless of future changes, characters retain learned skills from earlier classes. A character's class affects both their attack capabilities and their mobility on the battlefield: for example, mages and archers can attack at greater ranges than melee units, mounted units have more powerful attacks than foot units, while flying units have greater mobility and range.\n\nRelationships between characters are built up through Support conversations between chapters. The normal rankings of relationships are C to A, with A standing for a close friendship. For characters of opposing genders, an additional S ranking is available, in which the characters fall in love, marry and have children. Relationships also have a direct impact during battles, with certain character pairings granting positive effects such as increased mobility or an automatic guarding action. A couple's children can be found and recruited in optional chapters made available by the parent characters' marriage, with their appearance and in-game abilities varying depending on who their parents were. Most characters have a specific list of units which they can have Support conversations with; the Avatar can build a relationship with all characters, and (depending on their chosen gender) marry any unit from any generation as long as they are not a direct descendant.\n\nThe game takes place approximately 2000 years after the events of \"\". In ancient times, the Fell Dragon Grima attempted to destroy the world. To stop Grima, the Divine Dragon Naga (voiced by Mela Lee) chose the ruler of the Halidom of Ylisse (known as the First Exalt) and granted them power through two magical objects: Falchion, a sword with the power to slay dragons; and the Fire Emblem, a magical shield. Using these, the Exalt struck down Grima, sending it into a long slumber. In the intervening period, the continents of Archanea and Valentia became known as Ylisse and Valm.\n\nBy the present time, the land of Ylisse is divided between Halidom of Ylisse, which continues to worship Naga, and is ruled by Exalt Emmeryn (voiced by Erin Fitzgerald) and defended by the Shepherds, her brother Chrom's (voiced by Matthew Mercer) militia force; the kingdom of Plegia, which worships Grima; and Regna Ferox, a country whose rulers periodically compete for dominance. Fifteen years prior to \"Awakening\", the last Exalt of Ylisse, Emmeryn's father, waged a religious war against Plegia, which greatly damaged both countries and left bitterness on both sides. Ylisse has slowly recovered from the war thanks to Emmeryn's peaceful actions.\n\nAfter dreaming of killing Chrom, the amnesiac Avatar wakes up in a field and is found by Chrom and members of his personal army, the Shepherds. The Avatar joins the Shepherds, after exhibiting the qualities of a tactician when they defend a nearby town from Plegian bandits. After gaining an alliance with Regna Ferox, the Shepherds move to fight both Plegia's forces and revenant monsters called the Risen; they are helped by a masked man calling himself \"Marth\". After a confrontation between Plegia and the Shepherds, Emmeryn is almost killed by Validar and his minions. The assassination plot is foiled with aid from \"Marth\", who has prior knowledge of the event, and is also revealed to be a woman. Soon after, Plegian forces capture Emmeryn as she goes to parley with King Gangrel, Plegia's ruler, and prevent another war. Gangrel demands the Fire Emblem in exchange for Emmeryn's life. Though Chrom almost accepts Gangrel's terms, Emmeryn stops him by throwing herself over a cliff, becoming a martyr to both Ylisse and Plegia. Eventually, the Shepherds triumph over Plegia, defeating Gangrel and restoring peace to the continent.\n\nTwo years after Gangrel's defeat, Chrom inherits the throne of Ylisse, marries, and fathers a newborn daughter named Lucina. Chrom leads the Shepherds again when Emperor Walhart of Valm threatens to invade Ylisse. During the campaign, \"Marth\" returns, and reveals that she is a Lucina from an alternate timeline from more than 10 years in the future where Grima has been resurrected, and used a time traveling spell devised by Naga to return to the past in order to prevent the events leading to her future. To combat Grima, Chrom must perform the \"Awakening\", a ritual that grants him Naga's power, by combining the Fire Emblem with five magical gems divided among the nations. During and after the war in Valm, the Shepherds manage to retrieve four of the gemstones. They are then ambushed by Validar, the new king of Plegia and the Avatar's father, after he offers them the last gemstone. Validar takes control of the Avatar and steals the Fire Emblem from Chrom. He also reveals that the Avatar was born as the ideal vessel for Grima. Lucina realizes that Grima used the Avatar to kill Chrom in her timeline, and attempts to execute them; Chrom forces her to stand down, remaining confident the Avatar can overcome Grima's control. Alternatively, if the Avatar is Lucina's husband or mother, Lucina is unable to go through with it and stands down on her own. The Shepherds manage to track down Validar, who uses the Avatar to attack Chrom, mirroring the events of their nightmare. However, the Avatar uses their foreknowledge to prevent Chrom's death, allowing the Shepherds to kill Validar and recover the Fire Emblem.\n\nAt this point, the possessed Avatar from Lucina's future appears, revealing that the present timeline Avatar's amnesia was caused by Grima's unsuccessful attempt to possess them. The future Avatar then uses the power gathered for Grima's resurrection to restore its dragon form. In a race against time, Chrom performs the Awakening and summons Naga. Although Chrom now has the power to stop Grima, Naga reveals that she only has enough power to put Grima to sleep for another thousand years. Naga explains that the only way to truly destroy Grima is to have him destroy himself through the Avatar, which could come at cost of the Avatar's life. Naga tells them that the Avatar will only survive if their bonds with Chrom and the Shepherds are strong enough. In the final battle, the Shepherds manage to weaken Grima. Chrom, already set against the sacrifice of the Avatar, offers to deliver the final blow to the fell dragon. Depending on the player's final choice, the game will reach one of two different endings. If the player lets Chrom deal the final blow, Grima is put back to sleep for another thousand years, though the Avatar is left with regrets. If the player stops Chrom from dealing the final blow, the Avatar will kill Grima, causing both to vanish. Chrom and the Shepherds refuse to believe that the Avatar is dead, and vow to find them and bring them home. In a post-credits scene, the Avatar wakes up in a field similar to the beginning of the game, where Chrom and Lissa find them and welcome them home.\n\nThe original planning for \"Fire Emblem Awakening\" began in 2010, when Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota was finishing his work on \"Xenoblade Chronicles\". The game was co-developed by Nintendo and regular \"Fire Emblem\" developer Intelligent Systems. Among the staff members were veterans of the \"Fire Emblem\" series, including project manager Masahiro Higuchi, who had first worked on \"\", and Intelligent Systems producer Kouhei Maeda, who first worked as a scenario writer for \"\". The first proposals were made after the completion of \"\", a remake for the Nintendo DS of the . Development was very slow for the first year, during which time producer Hitoshi Yamagami organized the game's development structure. Once this was completed, he handed the main production duties over to co-director Genki Yokota. The art director was Toshiyuki Kusakihara. Character designs were done by Kusakihara and Yūsuke Kozaki. Kusakihara was brought on board to offer a fresh perspective on the \"Fire Emblem\" series and new ideas for the team, while Kozaki was brought in to help create a distinctive art style that would be well received overseas, as had his previous work for the Wii title \"No More Heroes\". During development, Kusakihara and Kozaki had lengthy meetings about various aspects of the game. These meetings became so time-consuming that Kusakihara compared his situation to the legend of Urashima Tarō.\n\nDue to declining sales for the series, the developers were told by Nintendo that \"Awakening\" would be the last \"Fire Emblem\" game if it failed to sell above 250,000 units. This caused panic for the team, with them considering including a high number of elements new to the game. Among the concepts were a modern-day setting or using the planet Mars as a setting. Eventually, the team decided that these elements would alienate rather than attract players and stuck to the medieval setting and style of previous \"Fire Emblem\" titles. As a compromise, the team decided to make it the \"culmination\" of all the games in \"Fire Emblem\" series to that point, incorporating gameplay elements from multiple titles. This approach was approved by the team and the proposal was completed within a month, though the decision also created difficulties with choosing which elements to include, and how to balance them so they did not clash with one another. The game's final title, \"Awakening\", was born from this concept of an ultimate \"Fire Emblem\" game. It was initially just casually suggested by Yamagami when discussing ideas for a title with Yokota, and Yokota liked it. As development progressed, the team continued to come up with ideas that increased workload, but they maintained a positive attitude and pushed forward in spite of the consequent pressures. Internally, the game was known as \"Fire Emblem Fin: The Children from the Brink\".\n\nMaeda was mainly responsible for the original scenario, thinking out the rough outline before the team created the events of each chapter in detail. Some plot points, such as the true identity of \"Marth\", were planned from an early stage, while many of the other plot twists came about during its development. Many of them were added at the suggestion of team members from both Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. Two key story themes while developing the game were the love for the characters, and the bonds characters developed over the course of the story. The latter theme was expressed in gameplay through the cooperative behavior of adjacent characters. While voice acting was included, it was limited to snappy lines meant to evoke a certain feeling. This was because the team had concerns about the amount of content in the game, which would increase a great deal with full voice acting, and its effect on the pacing. The team also used multiple well-known Japanese voice actors for the characters. Special voice overs and visuals were created for the character \"confession\" sequences. All the main characters had a personalized back story, and appropriate personalities were chosen for them. The first one to be finalized was the child character Inigo, who was created by character planner Nami Kumoru. A large team of writers were employed to create the character dialogue, and a story bible containing the characters' personality traits was created for the writers to work from. While developing the playable and enemy characters, the team used feedback from fans saying they should name all the characters, including foot soldiers. Wanting to give the impression of every character having their own lives, they created full artwork for all characters. Creating the characters proved to be one of the hardest parts of development. While designing the characters, Kozaki took their backstories into account: for example, the thief character Gaius was drawn with a sack of sweets, as he had a love for them. Kozaki was also responsible for creating the 2D artwork which represented the characters during conversations.\n\nOnce Nintendo gave the go-ahead for development, Intelligent Systems formed a small internal development team to handle the project. \"Awakening\" was the first \"Fire Emblem\" game for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was as yet unreleased and still undergoing final development. Because of this, the team had a large number of ideas for features to include, but they also only had a limited idea of what the system was capable of. Consequently, they had difficulties deciding how the 2D sprites and 3D environments would interact with each other, and ensuring they did not clip through objects. One notable feature missing from in-game character models was their feet. The original idea was to add a unique and uniform deformation to characters. As the team did not have much knowledge of the platform's CPU strength, the amount of character bones they could include were intentionally limited. This meant that the bones needed for the operation of ankles and feet were omitted. Later, it was discovered that ankles and feet could be included, but the team decided to leave that for a future game if it came to pass. A different explanation was that the team wanted players to focus on the top half of characters, so made their heads the largest part of their character models while shrinking their feet.\n\nThe concept for character graphics on the map underwent changes. Initially, some of the team felt that accurately displaying a character's equipment and class would be enough, but later it was decided to give them all individual characteristics. They were also able to add more unique character expressions than previous \"Fire Emblem\" games, enabling a greater emotional range during scenes of drama. A different element was the environmental effects the team incorporated, such as dust clouds when characters performed actions in battle. For the full-motion cutscenes, the team wanted to create a sense of grandeur and spectacle, using the openings of Taiga drama series as inspiration. Japanese animation company Kamikaze Douga was in charge of supervising the production and art assets of the game's cutscenes. Cutscene animation was handled by Studio Anima. According to team members, their request to Studio Anima was to make the world \"come alive\" during the full-motion sequences, which were included at crucial moments in the plot.\n\nThe first part of the game to receive full attention from the team was the gameplay. As a test map, the team used the opening map for \"Mystery of the Emblem\". One of the early options was switching between 16x16 and 24x24 pixel characters depending on the camera's overhead distance. In the end, the team used a hardware-based scaling system instead of switching between graphics types so as to keep the frame rate consistent in battle. While designing the levels, the team created both maps with a plot-driven structure and maps that allowed for player freedom. An aspect of the battle system new to the series was the inclusion of an optional first-person viewpoint during battles. This was done with western players in mind, as developers wanted to both give players an option on their perspective in battle and demonstrate the platform's 3D effects. The difficulty levels proved a point of debate amongst the team, ranging from the naming of difficulties to whether to include the ability to adjust it on the fly, which some felt was contrary to \"Fire Emblem\" traditions. There was also debate about both the inclusion and mechanics of the marriage system. While some aspects went smoothly, there was contention about the ability to marry any of the characters, and Kusakihara's suggestion of having characters kissing at the conclusion of each romance was vetoed by the team. An effort was made to make the interface and graphics easy for players to understand. An example of this was the cursor, which in previous games had been a triangular shape and for \"Awakening\" was changed to a pointing hand. One of the more controversial ideas that made it into the final game was the \"Casual Mode\", first introduced in \"New Mystery of the Emblem\". Initially opposed by staff members at Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, Yamagami and others successfully defended the feature. Yamagami's stance was that modern gamers would not be pleased with needing to invest extra time because a character had died. In another interview, team members said that \"Awakening\" was the first time the team conformed to the popular image of Nintendo games being easy to play and user-friendly.\n\nThe game was first announced in September 2011 as part of Nintendo's 2012 lineup for the 3DS, alongside titles such as \"Monster Hunter 4\" and \"Bravely Default\". As part of its release, Nintendo created a limited edition Nintendo 3DS bundle with \"Awakening\" pre-installed. The game's localization and western release was planned from an early stage, hence the inclusion of multiple aesthetic and gameplay elements meant to appeal to a western audience. The localization process was handled collaboratively by independent video game localization company 8-4 and Nintendo of America. The localization process took approximately one year. The game was first announced for release in Europe in February 2012, with the stated release period being that year. In April of the same year, Nintendo of America registered a web domain for \"Fire Emblem Awakening\". Its North American release was confirmed in June through Nintendo's Twitter account. The release windows for western regions were announced in December. For its western release, the game included both the English and Japanese voice tracks. Like in Japan, a limited 3DS bundle with \"Awakening\" pre-installed was created for North America and Europe, with Europe also receiving the 3DS XL model as part of the bundle. There was some confusion upon its release in North America: on the day of release, while it was available through Nintendo's online store, multiple online retailers did not have it stocked. While Nintendo was fairly non-committal on the incident, they did state that due to variabilities in shipping, retailers could received stocks on different days.\n\n\"Fire Emblem Awakening\" was the first packaged title released by Nintendo to receive downloadable content (DLC) after launch, taking the form of additional maps and characters from previous entries in the \"Fire Emblem\" series. The idea for DLC content came up when the game was close to completion. Due to this, the team could not do anything that would invalidate the main story. For the additional playable characters, the team focused on the main cast, picked out the most suitable, and left the final choice to Maeda. Starting from the game's release, over twenty different playable maps were released over several months at the rate of one map per week. Nintendo decided to release downloadable content for the game in all available regions. After it becomes available, the DLC can be accessed using the game's SpotPass system: within the context of the game's world, after a certain point in the game, the characters can access an area called the Outrealm Gate, being transported to the DLC maps. Various artists have contributed illustrations for the downloadable characters, including those who have worked on previous titles, such as Senri Kita, and newcomers, such as Kimihiko Fujisaka. One of the DLC maps received censorship upon release in North America and Europe, with a shot of a female playable character altered to hide her knickers.\n\n\"Fire Emblem Awakening\" has received widespread critical acclaim, holding an aggregate score of 92/100 on Metacritic, based on 72 reviews. After its release, \"Awakening\" was placed on GameSpot's list of the best games on the 3DS, and reached second place on a similar list by GameTrailers. IGN included the game on two different lists: it reached #2 on their list of the top 25 Nintendo 3DS games, and #21 on their list of the top 125 Nintendo games of all time. \"Slant Magazine\"s staff ranked it the eleventh best video game of 2013.\n\n\"Famitsu\" said in its review that the game could be enjoyed by hardcore fans and newcomers alike, as it made accommodations for both, and particularly praised the new gameplay features. IGN's Audrey Drake called \"Awakening\" \"the most fluid and stunning strategy RPG experience available on a portable, and features the best storytelling and production value of any 3DS game to date.\" Jeremy Parish, writing for 1UP.com, said that though the \"Fire Emblem\" series had changed little over the years while holding a place of respect within the genre, the changes Intelligent Systems implemented made \"Awakening\" \"an engrossing title that should enjoy impressive shelf life.\" His main criticism was against the enemy AI, which occasionally unbalanced the gameplay. Ray Carsillo of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", while sharing Parish's opinion on the lack of a restart option, called \"Awakening\" \" probably the best \"Fire Emblem\" to come to the States yet.\" While Eurogamer's Rich Stanton, giving the game a perfect score, called it \"a special game\", praising its story themes and how it made him care about his characters.\n\nGameTrailers said that the game \"takes positive strides forward with new additions like enhancements to the social system and battle mechanics, and the series’ established formula is all the better for it.\" Despite feeling mixed about the interface and multiplayer, GameSpot's Heidi Kemps called \"Awakening\" the best installment in the series for some time. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for Polygon, said that the development team had \"added just enough to the time-tested \"Fire Emblem\" formula to bolster its challenges without cutting away its roots.\" \"Game Informer\"s Kimberley Wallace said that \"[\"Awakening\"] made me scratch and claw for victory, and I savored every moment.\" Chris Carter of Destructoid, similar to \"Famitsu\", recommended it to old and new players, saying: \"If you've been itching to get into a Fire Emblem game, this is a great place to start. If you've been playing them all along, you'll feel right at home.\"\n\n\"Awakening\" was nominated for multiple awards after release. At the 2012 \"Famitsu\" Awards 2012, \"Awakening\" was among the games awarded the magazine's Excellence Award. In the west, it was nominated in the \"Best RPG\" category at the Spike Video Game Awards 2013. It was nominated in multiple categories in Destructoid's 2013 Game of the Year awards, including Game of the Year, Best Role-Playing Game, Best Story, and Best Soundtrack. It was also nominated for GameSpot's Game of the Year 2013 in the Nintendo 3DS category. In IGN's Best of 2013 awards, it won in both the Best 3DS Strategy Game and Best 3DS Story categories. At the Game Developers Choice Awards 2014, it was nominated in the Best Handheld/Mobile Game category.\n\nThe game's Japanese version sold exceptionally well, with it being the fastest selling entry in the series since detailed weekly tallies began. During its opening week, the game managed to sell 242,600 units, reaching the top of the sales charts and beating the debut sales of the previous two \"Fire Emblem\" releases. It sold through 81.63% of its initial shipment, causing sell-outs in some stores. Japanese sales tracker Media Create attributed the initial high sales to Nintendo's promotional campaign. Demand for the limited Japanese bundle also exceeded Nintendo's expectations, as the pre-order website crashed from the amount of people trying to buy it. As marketing the game as any product other than a limited edition would have violated a Japanese commercial law, Nintendo were unable to reopen the pre-orders after the initial sales period despite complaints. By the beginning of 2013, the game had sold 455,268 units, placing it among the top 30 high-selling titles for 2012. In addition to the main game, Nintendo reported that 1.2 million units of downloadable content had been sold by September 2012, bringing in an additional 380 million yen (about $4.8 million).\n\nSales in the west were equally good. During its first month on sale in North America, the game sold 180,000 units, with 63,000 units of the total sales being eShop downloads. These figures gave \"Awakening\" the best ever first month sales for the franchise in North America. Sales of the title continued to rise in the coming months, with the total figure reaching 240,000 units by April, including a further 20,000 digital sales. By September, total sales in North America had reached 390,000 units. In the UK, \"Awakening\" debuted in third place on the charts behind \"\" and \"BioShock Infinite\". The game and the hardware bundle collectively boosted sales of the 3DS and 3DS XL by nearly 50% over the previous week. As of December 2014, the game had sold just over 1.9 million copies worldwide, and has become the best-selling \"Fire Emblem\" title in the west.\n\nThe game's strong sales, well exceeding the figure set by Nintendo during development, saved the \"Fire Emblem\" series from cancellation. In January 2015, a new \"Fire Emblem\" title created for the 3DS by the same team as \"Awakening\", \"Fire Emblem Fates\", was announced for a worldwide release. The success of \"Awakening\" has been credited with popularizing the 3DS platform among other Japanese RPG developers, such as Square Enix and Atlus.\n\n\"Awakening\"s success has also resulted in characters making appearances in other Nintendo games. Lucina and the Avatar, under their default character name \"Robin\" and using their default male and female appearance, were featured in the crossover fighting video game \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\". Chrom was considered for the game, but was deemed too similar to other \"Fire Emblem\" characters in the game, so his appearance was relegated to a small non-playable cameo, however, he was made playable in the franchise's next entry Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Lucina and the Avatar were also made available as playable characters in \"\" for those who purchased their Amiibo figures and connected them to the 3DS. Costumes based on Chrom and Lucina are also available in Capcom's \"\" video game, in a cross-promotion done with Nintendo. During promotion for \"Fates\", a \"Fire Emblem\"-themed trading card game was released. A set themed after \"Awakening\" includes a code to download Lucina as a playable character in \"Fates\". Chrom & Lucina are both playable units in \"Project X Zone 2\", and multiple characters from \"Awakening\" feature in \"Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE\", a crossover with the \"Megami Tensei\" series.\n"}
{"id": "2217320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217320", "title": "First of the Summer Wine", "text": "First of the Summer Wine\n\nFirst of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom written by Roy Clarke that aired on BBC1. The pilot originally aired on 3 January 1988, and the first series of episodes followed on 4 September 1988. The show ran for two series of six episodes each, with the final episode airing on 8 October 1989. The pilot episode was produced and directed by Gareth Gwenlan. Both series of episodes were produced and directed by Mike Stephens. The BBC has never shown repeats of the show, although repeats do occasionally appear in the UK on satellite station Gold. The show was broadcast in Australia on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation network in the early 1990s.\n\n\"First of the Summer Wine\" was a prequel to Clarke's long running show, \"Last of the Summer Wine\", portraying the youth of the principal characters from the mother show in the months leading up to World War II. With the possibility of war hanging over them, the young men and women enjoy their youth while trying to find a place for themselves in the world. The show used young, mostly unknown actors to play the characters, with only two actors from the original series making an appearance in the prequel.\n\nWith the success of \"Last of the Summer Wine\", the BBC approved a new series which Roy Clarke would carry over characters of the original show. With the new series, Clarke hoped to show the lives of his characters as they were in the \"first summer\" of their lives, as opposed to the last summer depicted in \"Last of the Summer Wine\". While there would still be the \"shadow of the Grim Reaper\" hanging over them, this time it would be because of World War II, not due to their old age.\n\nFor the new series, Clarke used mostly young, inexperienced actors to fill the roles of the characters carried over from the original series. The actors were required to mimic the vocal characteristics and mannerisms already established in \"Last of the Summer Wine\" to create a continuity between the two series.\n\nThe show features much 1920s and 1930s music, which adds to the nostalgic feel of the show. The theme tune is \"Sweet and Lovely\", sung by Al Bowlly, accompanied by Roy Fox and his Band. The recording was made in London on 18 September 1931.\n\n\"First of the Summer Wine\" followed a group of young men and women, some of whom were adapted from \"Last of the Summer Wine\", with others being specifically created for the new show. The men consisted of Paul Wyett as the scruffy and immature Compo Simmonite; David Fenwick as meek and deep-thinking Norman Clegg; Paul McLain as snobbish ladder-climber Seymour Utterthwaite; Richard Lumsden as the eager soldier Foggy Dewhurst; Gary Whitaker as the love-smitten Wally Batty; and Paul Oldham as their friend, Sherbert. The women consisted of Helen Patrick as the object of Wally's affections, Nora Renshaw; Sarah Dangerfield as Ivy; Joanne Heywood as Dilys, Judy Flynn as Lena, and Linda Davidson as Anita Pillsworth.\n\nThe adults around the young people act as supporting characters. Peter Sallis and Maggie Ollerenshaw play David and Violet Clegg, Norman's parents. Derek Benfield portrays Mr Scrimshaw, the manager of the shop where Ivy, Dilys, Sherbert, Norman and Seymour work.\n\n\"First of the Summer Wine\" takes place between May and September 1939, in the months leading up to World War II. The series revolves around the diary entries of the young Norman Clegg. Each episode begins with him resting on his bedroom windowsill and greeting the day; the words \"the diary of Norman Clegg, aged 18 years\" introduce the theme of each episode.\n\nEpisodes revolve around the antics of the young men of a small Yorkshire village and their usually level-headed female counterparts, all of whom are grappling with the world around them, their youth, and their experiences with the opposite sex. With rumblings of war on the European continent as Hitler’s Nazi Germany and Great Britain become increasingly poised for war, the lives of the young men and women will be changed forever.\n\nThe scenario uses retroactive continuity. In \"Last of the Summer Wine\", Seymour is introduced in later series, and is initially unknown to the other central characters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52162523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52162523", "title": "Japanese Television Cartel", "text": "Japanese Television Cartel\n\nThe Japanese Television Cartel was a cartel formed by the seven largest Japanese T.V. manufacturers. It operated from the 1950s until at least 1974. During that time period it engaged in illegal activities such as dumping, as well as price and output manipulation with the goal of taking control over the Japanese and American T.V. markets. Its operation halted in the aftermath of a series of investigations conducted by the authorities of the two countries.\n\nIn 1950, the Japanese economy entered a phase of rapid growth which would last until 1973. This period was characterized by a number of protectionist policies including but not limited to the enactment of discriminatory laws towards foreign trade partners, the insulation and oligopolization of capital markets, the bureaucratic allocation of foreign exchange as well as state coordinated acquisition of foreign technology. The adoption of large scale production techniques and foreign know-how, led to a reduction in unit cost, which allowed large companies to expand their operations with the aid of loans from the country's largest banks which were given at sub-equilibrium interest rates. Nevertheless, Japan's leap into industrialization was not matched by the development of its product distribution systems, which remained largely unchanged. Companies reacted to the resulting bottleneck effect in sales by vertically integrating their sales systems, through the creation of informal business groups known as keiretsu. The formation of keiretsu, enabled manufacturers to enter into collusion with distribution companies by fixing the price of the product at an artificially low level, while the distributors' losses were secretly refunded through a system of rebates. Distributors were accordingly rewarded or punished for their cooperation and loyalty. \n\nBeginning its rise in the mid 1950s the Japanese home appliance production increased 25-fold by 1968. Pioneered in Europe and the United States, television technology spread to Japan by means of licensing arrangements and technical assistance from companies such as Westinghouse, Philips, General Electric, Zenith Electronics and Western Electric. The Japanese television market was dominated by seven companies, namely Hitachi, Toshiba, Matsushita, Sony, Sanyo, Sharp and Mitsubishi, who controlled a combined 99.9% of the market share. Facing the aforementioned distribution bottlenecks, television producers began dividing Japan into territories, thereafter assigning wholesalers to each one. With the wholesale industry under their complete control, television companies went on to create an undercover \"Market Stabilization Group\" which included the six of the biggest players in the industry excluding Sony. An investigation by the Fair Trade Commission of Japan (FTCJ) uncovered a series of monthly, clandestine meetings, conducted by the higher management echelons of the industry over a period of 15 years. The group admitted to intentionally limiting the profit margin of retailers, minimizing sales to non-affiliated retailers, horizontal price and output manipulation. A further investigation also revealed the existence of a vertical price-fixing scheme between Sony and Matsushita. Despite the findings the FTCJ did not impose major fines or structural adjustments to those involved until the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. lawsuit was launched in the United States in 1985.\n\nInvestigation within the US revealed the presence of five interconnected working groups involving all seven of the major Japanese companies, which met from 1964 until at least 1974. The groups, actively shared data on topics such as production, inventory, and shipment sizes. The information was then in ways similar to the ones already implemented in Japan. The cartels maintained an economic policy of increasing prices at the Japanese market while also dumping their products abroad, in an effort to damage their American competitors through predatory pricing. American companies failed to exploit their sudden competitive advantage on the Japanese market, while also suffering heavy losses domestically. The restructuring of the American television market resulted in the exit of 21 companies and the fall of numerous others into Japanese hands. Dumping and the aggressive use of rebates were determined to be forms of customs fraud under the 1921 U.S. Anti-Dumping Act, however. The U.S. Federal agencies such as the International Trade Commission conducted dozens of investigations, resulting in the Japanese-American Orderly Marketing Agreement, which limited the import of Japanese TV sets. In April 1980, the companies involved in the cartel were ordered to pay $66 million; however the collection of the fine was delayed for a significant time period as litigation continued. \n\n\n"}

Their mission is to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ in way which is comical and entertaining but that also makes you think. Over the years, \"Jesus Army Productions has developed a reputation for bringing wit and humour to serious pieces, while preaching God's word.\"\n\"To the uninitiated, Jesus Army Productions pushes the envelope in getting its message across. The producers do not hold back on using everyday vices such as sex, lust and vanity to convey their message of salvation to the audience.\"\n\nIn the year 2000 a young man named Rommel Hall became the Drama Coordinator of UCCF. At the time he didn't know much about the performing arts except that \"drama was the ability to tell a story on stage\". So with ideas in his head and Jesus by his side, Hall launched out into the dramatic realm.\n\nWith Hall at the helm, the UCCF Drama Group put on several full-length productions: \"Stop, Think, Choose\" – September 2001, \"Living in the Real World\" 8 March 2002 \"Our Choice TV\" September 2002 and \"Tales From the Script\" March 2003.\n\nUCCF Drama also won a bronze award at the 2002 National Independence Festival of Creative Arts NIFCA, held in Barbados every November.\n\nIt was from UCCF Drama that Jesus Army Productions was birthed.\n\nIn 2004 Jesus Army Productions released an EP entitled \"The Genesis\". From it came the hit song \"Crisis\" which peaked at No. 2 for three weeks on the musical charts of Barbados' Christian radio station.\n\nAll songs written by Rommel Hall\n\n\n\nIn July 2004, in conjunction with Christfestival, a now defunct event once held at UWI annually, Jesus Army Productions staged their first major dramatic production- \"Our Choice TV: Unloaded\". The production involved a series of short skits showing how the television can have adverse effects on a person's life. From within this production came the critically acclaimed \"Jesus is the One\" which drew a parallel between Jesus Christ and Neo of the movie The Matrix and \"The Must-Have Trade Expo\". The latter went on to win \"Most Promising Dramatic Piece\" at NIFCA 2004.\n\nOn 16 September 2006, Jesus Army Productions staged their second major dramatic production entitled \"Bad Friday\" at the Queen's College (Barbados) School Hall. The production focussed on the Woodley family and their reaction to an impending disaster which would ensure the extinction of the human race. \"Bad Friday\" went on to win \"Concert/Event of the Year\" at the 2007 Flame Gospel Awards, held in Barbados annually.\n\nTrapped in an Elevator is the critically acclaimed stageplay performed at the 2007 National Independence Festival of Creative Arts. \"It told of the pitfalls in the lives of six people – a mother and her indisciplined daughter who was abandoned by her father; two best friends who were impregnated by the same man who turned out to be a runaway father; a man who wanted to kill himself because his marriage was called off; and\nthe narrator who has [a] little trouble with his wife.\"\nThe piece, performed at the NIFCA Performing Arts Gala on Sunday 18 November 2007 received a Silver Award, The Wendell Smith Trophy for Best Directed Play and Most Promising Performance by a Community Group.\n\nOn 22 and 23 November 2008, Jesus Army Productions hosted their fifth 5th anniversary show.

The Commission's \"Regulations concerning Interactive Gaming\" were first enacted in July, 1999.\n\nThe permits issued by the Commission to online gaming operators are called Client Provider Authorizations. The Commission charges an initial application fee for a Client Provider Authorization of US$25,000, plus an application fee of US$5,000 for each Key Person Licence. Application fees include the cost of the first annual fee for both Client Provider Authorizations and Key Person Licences and are refundable if an application is not granted.\n\nThe Mohawk Council of Kahnawake and the Commission have consistently asserted that the jurisdiction to enact the \"Kahnawake Gaming Law\" is an aspect of Kahnawake's Mohawk or \"aboriginal rights\" that have existed since time immemorial and that were most recently recognized and affirmed in subsection 35(1) of Canada's Constitution Act, 1982. Since it was first established in 1996, the legality of the \"Kahnawake Gaming Law\" and the activities of the Commission have never been challenged under the laws of Canada or any other jurisdiction.\n\nIn July, 2007, in a case that raised a challenge to a decision of the Commission refusing the issuance of a permit, the Quebec Superior Court decided in favour of the Commission. However, because the court ruled against the plaintiff it stated that \"the Court does not consider it necessary to rule on the validity ... of the gaming law\".\n\nPresently, the Commission licences over 50 online gaming operators, representing an estimated 250 online gaming sites.\n\nIn September 2009, following a lengthy investigation, the Commission issued its decision in what has become known as the Ultimate Bet cheating scandal. The Commission's decision affirmed that cheating had occurred on the Ultimate Bet poker site and imposed a number of sanctions on Ultimate Bet's ownership, Tokwiro Enterprises, including: a direction that approximately US$22,000,000 be refunded to Ultimate Bet players, a fine in the amount of US$1,500,000 and a direction that Ultimate Bet modify its operations in numerous specific ways to ensure there would be no further incidences of cheating.\n\nIn September 2016, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement announced that it had reached an understanding with the Kahnawake Gaming Commission wherein the KGC would no longer provide licenses to gambling operators who accept customers from the United States of America.\n\n"}

{"id": "48556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48556", "title": "List of chess variants", "text": "List of chess variants\n\nThis is a list of chess variants. Many thousands of variants exist; the 2007 catalogue in \"The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants\" estimates that there are well over 2,000, with the author noting that many more known variants were considered too trivial for inclusion. This list includes those variants for which an article exists on the English Wikipedia, as well as some other variants of importance. \n\nThese chess variants are derived from chess by changing the board, board setup, pieces, or rules.\n\nMany variants employ standard chess rules and mechanics, but vary the starting position of the pieces or number of pieces.\n\nThese variants use standard boards and pieces, but the pieces start on nontraditional squares. In most such variants, the pawns are placed on their usual squares, but the position of other pieces is either randomly determined or selected by the players. The motivation for these variants is usually to nullify established opening knowledge. The downside of these variants is that the initial position usually has less harmony and balance than the standard chess position.\n\nThese variants use standard chess pieces on a standard board, but players begin with unorthodox numbers of pieces. For example, starting with multiple queens or fewer pawns. Many such games use unbalanced starting positions, with one player having more or less of a particular piece than the other player.\n\nIn these variants, the same pieces and rules as in chess are used, but the board is different; It can be smaller or larger, the shape of either the board or individual spaces can be non-square or modular, or it can even be extra-dimensional or unbounded. The movement of pieces in some variants is modified in concurrence with the geometry of the gameboard.\n\nThese variants introduce changes in the mechanics of the game, such as movement of pieces, rules for capturing, or winning conditions, using standard chess pieces.\n\n\n\n\nIn these variants one or both players can move more than once per turn. The board and the pieces in these variants are the same as in standard chess.\n\nIn contrast to classical chess, these are not games of perfect information; luck or chance events are added as an element, such as in poker or backgammon.\n\n\nMost of the pieces in these variants are borrowed from chess. The game goal and rules are also very similar to those in chess; however, these variants include one or more fairy pieces which move differently from chess pieces.\n\n\nThere are a number of variants which use the empress (rook + knight) and princess (bishop + knight) compound pieces. The empress is also named marshall, chancellor, etc. The princess is also called cardinal, archbishop, janus, paladin, etc. Another compound piece is the amazon (queen + knight). To adapt to the new pieces, the board is usually extended to 10×8 or 10×10 with additional pawns added.\n\n\nThe pieces in these variants are borrowed from both chess and another game. The game goal and rules are either the same or very similar to those in chess. However, these variants include one or more fairy pieces which move differently from chess pieces.\n\n\nA number of variants have been developed where the playing area is in three dimensions.\nSimilar to solitaire, there are a few chess variants for a single player. Unlike chess puzzles, these variants have a random starting position. Some of these are similar to permutation chess problems, for example the game Queen's Quadrille, which was invented by Karen Robinson in 1998. All chess pieces (except pawns) are randomly placed on a 4×4 board. Then one of the queens is removed and the game is started. Pieces move as usual, however capturing is not allowed. A player can move white and black pieces in any order, without regard for colour. The goal is to move the queen along a predetermined pattern; for example from one corner to the other, or visit all squares on the board only once. The same idea is found in the game Hippodrome, which was invented by Andy Lewicki in 2003. The initial position is obtained by placing four knights on the first row and all other pieces from a chess set (except pawns) on the remaining fields. Then one of the pieces (except knights) is removed and the game is started. The goal is to move all knights to the opposite rank.\n\nIn 1998 Robinson also invented a game which Hans Bodlaender named Chess Contradance, as the setup is like a contradance with the two lines facing each other. The pieces are setup as in regular chess, but without pawns. The first and eighth ranks are safe havens, i.e., no piece can be captured on these ranks. The object of the puzzle is to move the pieces such that all pieces move to the opposite back row without ever putting any piece in danger of being captured. Black and White alternate moves.\n\n\nThese variants are very different from chess and may be classified as abstract strategy board games instead of chess variants.\n\nSome of these games have developed independently while others are ancestors or relatives of modern chess. The popularity of these variants may be limited to their respective places of origin (as is largely the case for shogi), or worldwide (as is the case for xiangqi). The games have their own institutions and traditions.\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nShogi\n\nXiangqi\n\nOthers\n\n"}

NOS ), English: Dutch Broadcast Foundation, is one of the broadcasting organizations making up the Netherlands Public Broadcasting system. It has a special statutory obligation to make news and sports programmes for the three Dutch public television channels and the Dutch public radio services.\n\nThe foundation's remit derives from the Dutch Media Act 2008, which stipulates that the NOS produce regular and frequent programming of a public service nature, including, notably, a full and impartial news service and coverage of parliamentary procedures and debates, as well as reporting on sporting and other national events.\n\nThe NOS also acts as technical co-ordinator for the Dutch public broadcasting system as a whole. In the event of emergencies and/or the breaking of a major news story, it can assume control of the public networks in order to provide co-ordinated coverage of events in co-operation with the other members of the systems. \n\nThe NOS does have correspondents in multiple countries, including a permanent studio in Washington DC. \n\nProgrammes produced by the NOS include its daily television and radio bulletins, the \"NOS Journaal\". Parliamentary reports are shown from a special studio in The Hague. It also supplies news programmes aimed at children (\"Jeugdjournaal\"), teens and young adults (\"NOS op 3\") and sports fans (\"NOS Langs de Lijn\", \"NOS Studio Sport\"). Programmes are made available via television, radio and online. The NOS also broadcast text pages and a website, which are both often used by the public.\n\nThe Netherlands Radio Union (NRU) was established in 1947. After several failed attempts to create a public broadcasting system and link up with a national station, the NRU was created as a union of broadcasting associations that provided operational support. The associations were responsible for their own output, but studios, orchestras and outside broadcast facilities were managed by the NRU. Weekly radio plays were also the domain of the NRU and would run until 1986. The NRU became the Dutch founding member of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands Television Service (NTS) was created in 1951, two years after public television returned to the airwaves. The NTS served as a similar organization to the NRU, in that broadcast and transmission facilities were supplied to member associations for making programmes.\n\nIt wasn't until 1956 that the NTS itself produced its first programme, a news bulletin called the \"NTS Journaal\". This was followed by a sports round-up, \"Sport in Beeld\" \"(Sports Illustrated)\" in 1959, and in 1967 of \"Langs de Lijn\" \"(Along the Line)\", a joint production of several broadcasting associations.\n\nA new Media Act was passed into law in 1967, merging the Netherlands Radio Union and the Netherlands Television Foundation. The new organization, the \"Nederlandse Omroep Stichting\" \"(Netherlands Broadcasting Service)\" was created on 29 May 1969. The NOS, as was its predecessors, was tasked with co-ordinating the whole public broadcasting system, as well as providing news and sport bulletins. It also inherited the technical and production facilities needed to make and broadcast radio and television programmes. All broadcasting members of the NRU and the NTS were made members of the NOS.\n\nOn 2 May 1977, a strike by sound engineers affected television news broadcasts. Upset viewers called on all broadcasters to resolve the situation.\n\nOn 1 April 1980 the NOS launched its teletext service, in the framework of supplying news and information. It first experimented with teletext in 1977. In 1981. on the 25th anniversary, the NOS aired its first televised youth news bulletin, called the Jeugdjournaal.\nThe Media Act of 1988 meant several changes to NOS and the broadcasting system. The Services Department, which was made up of the technical, broadcast and transmission facilities of the NOS, was privatised, which meant the broadcasting associations were required to pay to use the facilities. The Netherlands Broadcast Production Company (NOB) consisted of those facilities, mainly based in Media Park in Hilversum. The Media Act also required broadcasting association members take up positions on the NOS Board of Directors. A new government commission oversaw content and financial matters, as well as admitting potential new broadcasting associations.\n\nIn 1995, saw another Media Act enacted which saw the broadcasting duties of the NOS greatly reduced, with the creation of the Nederlandse Programma Stichting \"(Netherlands Programming Service)\". The NPS took on the programming tasks of the NOS concerning culture, art, children, education and ethnic-minorities, whilst the NOS concentrated on news, sport and live events.\n\nA new Supervisory Board replaced the Board of Directors in 1998. The previous management was replaced with a three-man board, now charged with developing strategies and responsibility for all public output. Programming co-ordinators were appointed for each television and radio network and channel identities were created, largely replacing the varying on-air presentation of the pillar broadcasters. The broadcasting associations also have a degree of input through the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn 2002, the coordination element of the public broadcast system, administered by the NOS were now made clearer with the creation of an unbrella organization, Publieke Omroep \"(Public Broadcasting)\", while programme makers operated under the name \"RTV NOS\". The reorganization caused NOS to be loosened from the public broadcasting system, causing it to be a neutral member of NPO, and then starting to reorganize itself.\n\nIn 2005, saw the organization obtain a new corporate identity. The previous NOS logo was in use for 36 years and featured the initials of the company in lower case, with round and obtuse angles. The new logo was designed by graphic designers Lambie-Nairn, complete with new idents for its television programmes. The typeface was Gotham.\n\nIts news-gathering operations also changed, with the news departments for radio, television and internet merging and re-organized into different sections (NOS, NOS News, NOS Sports, with NOS Events added in 2009).\n\nAn announcement made by the Minister of Education in 2007 confirmed a further division of the NOS. The umbrella group \"Publieke Omroep\", managed by the NOS was to be legally separated and renamed Nederlandse Publieke Omroep \"(Netherlands Public Broadcasting)\". The move was to ensure the NOS operated under the same conditions as its fellow broadcasting associations, as well as transferring membership of the European Broadcasting Union.\n\nIn 2009, the NOS became fully independent and now has its own Board of Directors.\n\nSince 2012, the NOS has got a new style and layout and, for some programs, other titles. The biggest change is visible in the 8 o'clock NOS Journaal (traditionally the most viewed and therefore the most important news broadcast of the NOS), where they adopted standing presentation.\n\nThe NOS is responsible for news, sport, political and events programming on the public service television networks and produce the following:\n\nBesides broadcasting on the main three public television channels, The NOS is also responsible for two digital channels, \"NPO Nieuws\" and \"NPO Politiek\":\n\n\nOn the radio the NOS is responsible for the following programmes:\n\nThe NOS is also responsible for the news and sports site of the Dutch public broadcasters. The editorial staff of the internet pages is also responsible for the teletext pages on NPO 1, NPO 2 and NPO 3.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43161585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43161585", "title": "Pariah (play)", "text": "Pariah (play)\n\nPariah () is a one-act play written by August Strindberg.\n\nStrindberg wrote \"Pariah\" along with his play \"Creditors\" in the town of Holte, Denmark during the winter of 1888–1889. He was in Denmark to create a theatre of his own, following the example he admired of the Théâtre Libre in Paris, which had been founded two years earlier. Strindberg’s theatre would present naturalistic plays, and the artistic director would be his wife, Siri von Essen. It was to be called “The Scandinavian Experimental Theatre”, and then was renamed “Strindberg’s Experimental Theatre”. Beset with disasters, not the least of which was the censorship of his play, \"Miss Julie\", the theatre had a tumultuous and extremely brief history. The theatre premiered in Holte on March 9, 1889 with a triple bill: \"Pariah\", \"Creditors\", and \"The Stronger\". The evening was a success, with applause and curtain calls. Even harsh critics were won over, with the exception of a newspaper reviewer who demanded that Strindberg be deported. The performance was then repeated in the nearby Swedish town, Malmö.\n\nIn the audience at Malmö was Ola Hansson, who had just published a short story from which, Strindberg claimed in a program note, the title and theme of \"Pariah\" were taken. However, Hanssen said he didn’t recognize anything of his original theme. Hanssen also reports that at this time he had lent Strindberg a book of mysteries by Edgar Allan Poe, and that Poe was a significant influence on Strindberg’s writing at this time. A possible example of that influence, is that a scene of psychological detective work occurs in Poe’s short story, \"The Gold Bug\", that appears to have inspired an episode in \"Pariah\". Strindberg's original title for the play is “\"Paria\"”, with its Hindu etymology. Some English translations use the title, “The Outcast”, which, however, can be confused with an earlier play by Strindberg, “The Outlaw”.\n\nImportant to Strindberg with this and other plays, such as \"Miss Julie\" and \"The Father\", was his desire to achieve the ideals of Naturalism in drama as described and analyzed by the French author and theorist, Emile Zola — the \"nouvelle formule\". Strindberg modeled \"Pariah\" on the \"Les Quarts d’Heure\" (1888) plays of the French writers Gustave Guiches and Henri Lavedan, which, in his essay “On Modern Drama and Modern Theatre”, Strindberg describes as dramas reduced to a single scene.\n\n\"Pariah\" carries on, in a veiled manner, a debate that Strindberg had been having through postal correspondence with the philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, who in \"Götzen-Dämmerung\", portrays a criminal as a strong person, who is just misdirected in life. In \"Pariah\" the criminal, Mr. Y, is portrayed as weak and a criminal from birth. Strindberg in this play shows some influenced of his reading of the French translation of the \"l’uomo delinquente\" (1876) by Cesare Lombroso, an Italian criminologist, who promotes the idea that criminality can be discerned in a person’s external self, as happens in the play, when Mr. X notices that Mr. Y is “terribly narrow between the ears.”\n\nThe play involves a battle of brains between two men, “Mr. X\" and\" Mr. Y’’ in a Darwinian struggle for survival. The men are in a room in a farmhouse during a storm. A box of gold sits on the table, for which Mr. X is responsible. Both have committed crimes in their personal history. Mr. X, in his youth, murdered a man, but he was not caught, and he explains why it is right that he avoided punishment. As for Mr. Y, he forged a financial document, which secured a loan. For this he was caught and sent to prison, and he explains why it was unfair that he was punished. As both stories are shared during the play, it sets the men against one another. Which one is really the most guilty, and have either of them atoned for his sin? Mr. Y finally rationalizes that Mr. X. should pay Mr. Y a penalty or a bribe as a way of bringing \"a little better balance into these unequal human conditions.\" Or it can be seen as Mr. X paying a bribe to keep Mr. Y quiet about Mr. X's crime. The atmosphere becomes tense and threatening, and the contest comes to a head when Y becomes armed with a knife, and X is armed with a stronger will, and can use his greater mental prowess to overpower Y.\n\n\nThe text of \"Pariah\" in the Edwin Björkman translation online.\n"}
{"id": "171435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171435", "title": "Plot device", "text": "Plot device\n\nA plot device, or plot mechanism, is any technique in a narrative used to move the plot forward. A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the suspension of disbelief. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.\n\nMany stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the Indiana Jones film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", he is trying to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant; in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", Jones is on a search for the Holy Grail. This plot device is also used in the \"Arabian Nights\" tale of \"The City of Brass,\" in which a group of travelers on an archaeological expedition journeys across the Sahara to find a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn.\n\nSeveral books in the Harry Potter series orient around a certain object. In \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", Harry believes there is a magical stone in Hogwarts with special powers. Lord Voldemort needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.\n\nThe One Ring from J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, \"The Lord of the Rings\" has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as Nick Lowe puts it: \"Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa.\"\n\nA MacGuffin is a term, popularized by film director Alfred Hitchcock, referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance. Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, \"In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers.\" This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from The Lord of the Rings), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.\n\nMacGuffins are sometimes referred to as \"plot coupons\" (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to \"collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a dénouement\". The term was coined by Nick Lowe.\n\nThe term \"deus ex machina\" is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.\n\nThe Latin phrase \"deus ex machina\" has its origins in the conventions of Greek tragedy, and refers to situations in which a mechane (crane) was used to lower actors playing a god or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.\n\nThe Greek tragedian Euripides is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play \"Alcestis\", the eponymous heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions. In the end, though, Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a \"deus ex machina\" is Gandalf in \"The Hobbit\". With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was Aristotle in his \"Poetics\", where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.\n\nA shoulder angel is a plot device used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see Negative associations of left-handedness in language). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the id, ego and super-ego in Psychoanalysis, with the person in the center of the dispute being the ego between the super-ego Angel and the id Devil.\n\nThe function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in whodunits, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.\n\nA \"plot voucher\", as defined by Nick Lowe, is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.\n\n"}
{"id": "12168152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12168152", "title": "Re-recording mixer", "text": "Re-recording mixer\n\nA re-recording mixer in North America, also known as a dubbing mixer in Europe, is a post-production audio engineer who mixes recorded dialogue, sound effects and music to create the final version of a soundtrack for a feature film, television program, or television advertisement. The final mix must achieve a desired sonic balance between its various elements, and must match the director's or sound designer's original vision for the project. For material intended for broadcast, the final mix must also comply with all applicable laws governing sound mixing (e.g., the CALM Act in the United States and the EBU R128 loudness protocol in Europe). \n\nThe different names of this profession are both based on the fact that the mixer is not mixing a live performance to a live audience nor recording live on a set. That is, he or she is re-recording sound already recorded elsewhere (the basis of the North American name) after passing it through mixing equipment such as a digital audio workstation and may dub in additional sounds in the process (the basis of the European name). While mixing can be performed in a recording studio or home office, a full-size mixing stage or dubbing stage is used for feature films intended for release to movie theaters in order to help the mixer envision how the final mix will be heard in such large spaces. \n\nDuring production or earlier parts of post-production, sound editors, sound designers, sound engineers, production sound mixers and/or music editors assemble the tracks that become raw materials for the re-recording mixer to work with. Those tracks in turn originate with sounds created by professional musicians, singers, actors, or foley artists. \n\nThe first part of the traditional re-recording process is called the \"premix.\" In the dialog premix the re-recording mixer does preliminary processing, including making initial loudness adjustments, cross-fading, and reducing environmental noise or spill that the on-set microphone picked up. In most instances, audio restoration software may be employed. For film or television productions, they may add a temporary/permanent music soundtrack that will have been prepared by the music editor, then the resulting work will be previewed by test audiences, and then the film or television program is re-cut and the soundtrack must be mixed again. Re-recording mixer may also augment or minimize audience reactions for television programs recorded in front of a studio audience. In some cases, a laugh track may augment these reactions.\n\nDuring the \"final mix\" the re-recording/dubbing mixers, guided by the director or producer, must make creative decisions from moment to moment in each scene about how loud each major sound element (dialog, sound effects, laugh track and music) should be relative to each other. They also modify individual sounds when desired by adjusting their loudness and spectral content and by adding artificial reverberation. They can insert sounds into the three-dimensional space of the listening environment for a variety of venues and release formats: movie theaters, home theater systems, etc. that have stereo and multi-channel (5.1, 7.1, etc.) sound systems.\n"}
{"id": "21611071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21611071", "title": "Record Store Day", "text": "Record Store Day\n\nRecord Store Day is an annual event inaugurated in 2008 and held on one Saturday every April and every \"Black Friday\" in November to \"celebrate the culture of the independently owned record store\". The day brings together fans, artists, and thousands of independent record stores across the world. A number of records are pressed specifically for Record Store Day, with a unique list of releases for each country, and are only distributed to shops participating in the event. The event began in the United States and remains headquartered there. Record Store Day has official international organizers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Spain.\n\nOriginally pitched as an idea to create an event similar to Free Comic Book Day by Bull Moose Music's Chris Brown and Criminal Record's Eric Levin, the concept for Record Store Day was created during a brainstorming session at a meeting of independent record store owners in Baltimore, MD. Record Store Day was officially founded in 2007 by Eric Levin, Michael Kurtz, Carrie Colliton, Amy Dorfman, and Don Van Cleave, and is now celebrated at stores across the world, with hundreds of recording and other artists participating in the day by making special appearances, performances, meet and greets with their fans, the holding of fund raisers for community non-profits, and the issuing of special vinyl and CD releases along with other promotional offerings to mark the occasion.\n\nEach store holds their own party for the day, to celebrate the perceived individuality of each store, and the place it holds in its community. Although Record Store Day, the day, only occurs once a year, Record Store Day, the organization, provides promotions, marketing, and other opportunities for stores throughout the year, maintaining a website, social media and other means of promulgating its views about the value of independent record stores. Record Store Day is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Dept. of Record Stores, along with the Coalition of Independent Music Stores and the Alliance of Independent Media Stores.\n\nUniversal Music's sales manager, Marc Fayd’Herbe, has described Record Store Day as \"the single best thing that has ever happened\" for independent record shops. The 2013 event was credited with the highest U.S. vinyl sales, and the 2014 edition resulted in independent retailers recording the highest percentage of physical album sales, since the SoundScan system was introduced in 1991. In their 2015 Libera awards, the American Association of Independent Music awarded Record Store Day its \"Marketplace Ally\" award. Record Store Day 2016 produced the biggest week of sales for the vinyl LP format since the introduction of SoundScan.\n\nThe event has been criticized for catering to record collectors, rather than casual music fans, and delaying the release of non-affiliated records by monopolizing the capacity of record pressing plants. Major labels have been accused of hijacking the event, and the policy of shops being obliged to buy on a no-return basis has been criticized, along with many of the limited releases being re-sold online within hours, at inflated prices.\n\nMetallica officially kicked off the event at Rasputin Music in Mountain View, California, on April 19, 2008. There were approximately 10 special Record Store Day releases in the first year, including releases by Death Cab For Cutie, R.E.M., Stephen Malkmus, Vampire Weekend, The Teenagers, Black Kids, and Jason Mraz. Approximately 300 stores launched Record Store Day in the United States, including Waterloo Records (Austin, Texas), School Kids Records (Research Triangle, North Carolina), and Vintage Vinyl (Evanston, Illinois).\n\nEnglish singer-songwriter Billy Bragg met Record Store Day co-founder Michael Kurtz in an airport and agreed to help kick off Record Store Day in the United Kingdom with a special live appearance. The first organized involvement by UK stores included Piccadilly Records (Manchester), Jumbo Records (Leeds), Resident (Brighton), Sister Ray (London), Rough Trade (London), Rapture (Witney), Spillers (Cardiff, Wales), and Avalanche Records (Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland).\n\nThe second annual Record Store Day was celebrated on Saturday, April 18, 2009 with approximately 85 special releases and appearances by the likes of Slayer, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Iron & Wine, The Stooges, MC5, Wilco, Disturbed, Killswitch Engage, Erykah Badu, Talib Kweli, The Eagles of Death Metal. The total number of artist appearances in the US was approximately 500. Wilco's Jeff Tweedy announced that \"there would be no Wilco if it weren't for independent record stores\" and the band made a surprise appearance on Record Store Day @ the Disc Exchange in Knoxville, TN. Eagles of Death Metal's Jesse Hughes announced that he was the official \"Ambassador of Record Store Day\" and the band made an appearance at Rhino Records. Mayor Mike Bloomberg announced that the City of New York officially recognized Record Store Day as a citywide event and the judges on American Idol talked about their favorite records in honor of Record Store Day in the episode of American Idol prior to the event. Even though 95% of the special releases made for Record Store Day were for the USA, the event began to grow internationally with over 1,000 record stores in the US, the UK, Ireland, Japan, Canada, Italy, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, and Germany all participated in the international event.\n\nThe third annual Record Store Day took place on Saturday, April 17, 2010. The official ambassador for the event was Joshua Homme. The official book of the event was \"Last Shop Standing: Whatever Happened to Record Shops?\" by Graham Jones. KCRW's Gary Calamar and Phil Gallo also released their own self-published book, \"Record Store Days\", which talks about independent record stores, with artist quotes provided by www.recordstoreday.com used throughout the book, and a specific chapter devoted to Record Store Day. NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg and New York City once again honored the day. Anything Anything with Rich Russo released a vinyl album of local bands performing on his radio show as well as doing a bus tour visiting numerous New York and New Jersey record stores. Several artists made in-store appearances to mark the event:The Smashing Pumpkins announced that they would kick off the tour promoting their new album with a special Record Store Day concert at Amoeba in Hollywood, CA. Other artists to announce special appearances included Frank Black, Exene Cervenka, Angie Stone, Jason Derulo, Alice in Chains, Mastodon, Josh Ritter, HIM, Slash, Sick Puppies, Care Bears on Fire, and Emmylou Harris. The year's event was also celebrated by giving young artists an opportunity to showcase their talent in the form of a national \"Record Store Day: High School Battle of the Bands\". Local, participating independent record stores nominated one local high school band by picking a cut from the band's supplied recording and entered their name and song cut into the contest. A panel of record executives and members from the Fender Corporation judged the entrants. Nine national semi-finalists were chosen to appear on a limited edition, compilation vinyl LP of their winning songs. Pressed by Gotta Groove, the LP features digital convenience. On the day of the event, it was announced that the grand prize winning band was SANUK, an indie band of HS students from Indianapolis, Indiana. They received a generous prize package of musical gear from the Fender Corporation and recording time with recording greats - Jack Ponti and Kevin \"The Caveman\" Shirley. SANUK was championed by their local record store, Indy CD & Vinyl. The sponsors of the contest were Caroline Distribution and EMI Label Services, Fender, and Fender Music Foundation. Aside from the Band Battle contest, many participating record stores had a line-up of live talent performing throughout the day. In 2010, more than 1,400 independent record stores participated in the unofficial holiday. More than 1,000 were from the US alone. Record stores saw a 41% increase in sales over the previous year's celebration, and a 109% increase over the previous Saturday's sales. By this time, the event had become such a nationally recognized event, that in the U.S., it was even referenced on \"Saturday Night Live.\" During the year, the first Black Friday Record Store Day was also held, on November 26, 2010.\n\nThe fourth annual record store day took place on Saturday, April 16, 2011. The official ambassador for the event was Ozzy Osbourne. Over six-hundred artists celebrated the event with in-store appearances, making it the world's largest music event of its kind. Artists who made in-store appearances included Beastie Boys, the Foo Fighters, Duran Duran, My Chemical Romance, Wiz Khalifa, Todd Rundgren, Anvil, Del McCoury and the New Orleans Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Regina Spektor, Jack White and Jerry Lee Lewis, the dBs, The Raveonettes, TV on the Radio, Frightened Rabbit, the Deftones, Chuck D, the Beach Boys' Al Jardine, Lonely Island, and Josh Groban. Most of the releases for the year were limited between 300 and 7000 copies worldwide. According to Billboard Magazine, the 182,000 bump in unit sales in the week that Record Store Day was held was directly attributed to the success of the event itself. The official film of the event was \"Sound It Out\", a feature-length documentary directed by Jeanie Finlay, documenting the Sound It Out Records shop in Stockton-on-Tees, the very last record shop in Teesside. The film premiered to critical acclaim at SxSW and had its joint premiere at SheffDocFest and the Edinburgh International Film Festival. During the year, the second Black Friday Record Store Day was also held, on November 25, 2011. Additionally, this Record Store Day featured an exclusive 12\" vinyl reissue of New Order's 1981 debut single \"Ceremony\" that included not only the song and its B side, \"In a Lonely Place,\" but also the original 1980 demo recordings of those tracks by New Order's previous incarnation, Joy Division. This particular release was significant as it marked the first official release of the full Joy Division recording of \"In a Lonely Place,\" which had been recovered earlier that year.\n\nThe fifth annual Record Store Day took place on Saturday, April 21, 2012. The official ambassador for the event was Iggy Pop. Over 400 different releases were made for the day. To coincide with Record Store Day 2012, the UK's Official Chart Company launched the Official Record Store Chart, a weekly music chart based solely on sales from independent record shops. The chart was first issued on 20 April 2012, the eve of Record Store Day 2012.\n\nAhead of the 2013 edition, held on April 20, Record Store Day co-founder Michael Kurtz was awarded a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres, for his work \non Record Store Day, by the French government. The official ambassador was Jack White of White Stripes fame and founder of Third Man Records. The White Stripes album \"Elephant\" was reissued in a limited edition 10th anniversary double LP, consisting of one black-and-red colored disc and one white disc, the band's signature tri-color scheme.\n\nBoards of Canada used RSD 2013 to launch a viral marketing campaign for their much anticipated album, Tomorrow's Harvest, when a new vinyl record by the band was placed in a New York City record store for purchase. The record allegedly sold on eBay for $5,700 but the buyer ended up being a fraud. It was later sold in a closed auction for an undisclosed sum.\n\nRecord Store Day 2014 was held on April 19, 2014. The ambassador for this year was Chuck D. Exclusive releases in the UK included Little Richard, and Coldplay, and in the US, Chvrches, Soundgarden, Joan Jett, The Yardbirds, Tears For Fears, and Cage the Elephant.\n\nRecord Store Day 2015 was held on April 18, 2015. The ambassador for this event was Dave Grohl. Exclusive releases in the UK included Neal Hefti and Phil Collins; and in the US, Echosmith, The White Stripes, The Bee Gees, Foo Fighters, Buzzcocks, and In This Moment.\n\nRecord Store Day 2016 took place on April 16, 2016. Exclusive releases included albums by David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Madonna, Gerard Way, Patti Smith, Deftones, Frank Zappa, and the Doors. Having kicked off the first Record Store Day with an in-store appearance, Metallica served as ambassador for the first time this year, marking the occasion with an album recorded live at the Bataclan in Paris, with all money raised going to victims of the terrorist attack at the venue the previous November. The band also reissued their first two albums, \"Kill 'Em All\" and \"Ride the Lightning\", to coincide with the event.\n\nRecord Store Day 2017 took place on Saturday, April 22, 2017. The ambassador for the event was St. Vincent, making her the Day's first female ambassador. It was the tenth celebration of independent record stores. In a rare occurrence, the special releases in the United States included a classical title: a 1967 recording of Shostakovich's Cello Concerto No. 2 published by Warner Classics, pressed in the style of a Soviet Roentgenizdat.\n\nRecord Store Day 2018 took place on Saturday, April 21, 2018. To celebrate, The Alarm visited stores in London, New York, and Los Angeles throughout the day. Special releases included albums by Prince, Ella Fitzgerald, and Bruce Springsteen, among others. The BBC released two full-cast television soundtracks of the \"Doctor Who\" serials \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" and \"City of Death\" with newly commissioned gatefold artwork. The ambassadors for the event were Run The Jewels.\n"}
{"id": "9271105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9271105", "title": "Sanctuary (TV series)", "text": "Sanctuary (TV series)\n\nSanctuary is a Canadian science fiction-fantasy television series, created by Damian Kindler and funded largely by the Beedie Development Group. The show ran for four series from 2008 to 2011; a fifth series was planned but never made.\n\nThe show is an expansion of an eight-webisode series that was released through the Internet in early 2007. Seeing the success of the web series, Syfy decided to buy the broadcast rights to the series and pay to re-stage the series in a season of thirteen episodes.\n\nThe show centers on Dr. Helen Magnus, a 157-year-old teratologist (born August 27, 1850), and her team of experts who run the Sanctuary, an organization that seeks out extraordinarily powerful creatures and people, known as Abnormals, and tries to help and to learn from them while also having to contain the more dangerous ones.\n\nThe series premiered on October 3, 2008, in both Canada and the United States and on October 6 in the United Kingdom. The premiere drew in more than 3 million viewers, making it the highest rated original series premiere for Syfy since \"Eureka\" debuted in July 2006. The premiere two-parter, \"Sanctuary for All\", was a combination and rewriting of the first four webisodes and was followed by \"Fata Morgana\", based on Webisodes 5-8. Amanda Tapping, with all of the original cast from the web series, made the transition to the television series. A second season of 13 episodes aired in 2009–10, and \"Sanctuary\" was renewed for a third season of 20 episodes on December 12, 2009.\nThe second season premiered on Friday, October 9, 2009, in the 10 pm timeslot. In Australia, the program debuted on Pay Television's Sci Fi and on free-to-air channel ABC2, where Season 1 started on March 1, 2010, each Monday at 9:30 pm. Season 2 commenced on July 12, 2010, in the same timeslot. Season 3 premiered Friday, October 15, 2010, on Syfy in its original 10 pm timeslot. In January 2011, \"Sanctuary\" was renewed for a fourth season, which finished airing on December 30, 2011. On May 21, 2012, Syfy announced that \"Sanctuary\" will not be returning for a fifth season and that the show has been cancelled. On October 8, 2012, PPI Releasing announced that it would distribute the series in U.S. syndication, starting fall (autumn September/October) 2013.\n\n\"Sanctuary\" follows the exploits of Dr. Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) and her quest to protect various cryptids, legends, and abnormal animals/people with certain extraordinary powers and abilities (what most people would consider \"monsters\"). She heads the Sanctuary Network, which consists of large facilities known as \"Sanctuaries\" scattered throughout the world serving as safe havens for these \"Abnormals\". She is initially aided in her quest by her reluctant protégé Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne); her intrepid, if somewhat reckless, daughter Ashley (Emilie Ullerup); the talkative geek and lycanthrope Henry Foss (Ryan Robbins), a computer and security expert; and her taciturn, \"Homo heidelbergensis\"-like assistant, played by Christopher Heyerdahl (unnamed, but listed as \"Bigfoot\" in the show's credits).\n\nThe history of Dr. Magnus is gradually revealed. In her youth she was trained by her father, a gifted Victorian-era scientist, to study the world and protect the unusual. Helen was a member of a group of experimental scientists known as \"The Five\", which also included Nikola Tesla (Jonathon Young), Nigel Griffin, Dr. James Watson (Peter Wingfield), and Magnus's lover John Druitt (Heyerdahl again), who wanted to push the boundaries of their understanding of the physical world through unconventional means. At some point during their partnership, Magnus acquired a vial of untainted vampire blood and used it in a serum that \"The Five\" injected into themselves. After the injection, they each developed Abnormal traits: Magnus experienced drastically slowed aging, and longevity with no clear limit; Nigel Griffin acquired the power to become invisible at will; Dr. James Watson's intellect was tremendously heightened; Nikola Tesla underwent transformation into a vampire, with the additional power of electrical manipulation; John Druitt developed longevity and the ability to teleport through time and space, but, already unstable and soon possessed by a malevolent energy creature (explained Season 2 Episode 11), he was driven to give in to his dark impulses, and becomes Jack the Ripper.\nEpisode Three introduces \"The Cabal\", a powerful shadow organization that captures, studies, and experiments on Abnormals, in the belief that the Abnormal population is a threat to the human species. During the first-season finale, \"Revelations\", they test a small amount of a biological weapon named Lazarus that causes all types of Abnormals to become extremely violent, attacking anyone nearby and then dying painfully. This is part of The Cabal's overall plan to incite humanity against the Abnormals so that they can wipe out the entire Abnormal population and gain greater influence over humanity. They brainwash Ashley, and in season two, convert her into a vampiric supersoldier, using her as a template for a small army which attacks the Sanctuary network. Against all odds, Magnus and her teams stop them at the Old City Sanctuary, and Ashley, in a moment of clarity, apparently sacrifices herself. Her father, Druitt, hunts down and kills the heads of the Cabal, which seems to disband.\n\nAs season two progresses, Magnus grapples with denial, then grief, and finally accepts the loss of Ashley. Meanwhile, the team adjusts to newcomer Kate Freelander (Agam Darshi), a former freelance Cabal operative. They also deal with their relationships (Magnus's in particular) to the remaining members of the Five, and increased international coordination in the wake of the Cabal's attacks on the Global Sanctuary Network that Magnus had established. It emerges that an enormous marine Abnormal, Big Bertha, had been preserved rather than euthanized by Magnus, and that Bertha is, somehow, a sapient being named Kali existing on a psychic or spirit plane, intricately tied to nature and Abnormals around the world. At the end of the second season and beginning of the third, a man named Edward Forsythe (Callum Blue) tries to take control of Bertha, and NY Sanctuary House Head Terrence Wexford (Paul McGillion) goes rogue trying to destroy her, even attempting to depose and kill Magnus.\n\nUltimately, Bertha/Kali is saved and Wexford is ousted, but more questions are raised than answered. Will visits the spirit plane via induced cardiac arrest, and while there he sees two other powerful beings in addition to Kali; encounters Helen's father, who gives Will a message for her; and then spontaneously returns to life with no brain damage after an unprecedented length of time. The Sanctuary team speculate that the beings are avatars of Abnormals as powerful as Big Bertha, one of which may have been the source of the earthquake that stopped a destructive tidal wave started by Kali's wrath. Meanwhile, Gregory Magnus's message leads the Sanctuary team to old birthday gifts that he had given to Helen years before, which in conjunction produce a tangible holographic map or miniature representing an unknown steampunk-style city. This is eventually revealed to be Praxis, an advanced underground civilization of humans and Abnormals. After an initial period of mistrust (exacerbated by the antics of Adam Worth (Ian Tracey), an old enemy of Helen's who inspired Jekyll and Hyde), Helen and her team save the world and reach an entente, with Gregory acting as ambassador. However, the peace does not last long. Worth, who escaped, manipulated unhappy Abnormals in Praxis while experimenting with a dangerously unstable energy source to power a time machine. The end results of his machinations were the destruction of Praxis, several armies of displaced Abnormals marching on the upper world, and his escape to the past to attempt to save his daughter, with Magnus hot on his heels.\n\nMagnus is able to thwart Worth and prevent any major changes to the timeline, then returns to the present by living through the intervening years again. She and her team manage to end the Abnormal assault on humanity without too much bloodshed, but still must contend with increasing persecution from the Special Counter-Insurgency Unit (SCIU), an anti-Abnormal agency. Magnus is forced to cut the Sanctuary network's ties to the UN, reputable banking institutions, etc. in order to maintain independence, a move made possible by her extensive preparations during her second trip through the twentieth century. Additionally, a number of Hollow Earth Abnormals refuse to remain quietly underground and engage in terrorist activities against humans. Matters come to a head when a contingent of these Abnormals, led by Caleb, agree to cease their violent activities in exchange for Magnus' help in establishing a homeland in Old City. She agrees, but SCIU is highly suspicious due to the group's former attacks. This skepticism proves justified, since Caleb plans to release a substance that would bring out latent Abnormal traits in normal humans, effectively eradicating the species. Magnus is also prepared for this betrayal, taking Caleb out with a massive explosion that destroys the Sanctuary. Now presumed dead, she is free to begin anew in an Edenic underground city based on the work of Buckminster Fuller and Albert Einstein, one last secret from her repeated century.\n\n\n\nThe series is produced by Stage 3 Media based in Vancouver, British Columbia, founded in 2006. The webisodes were filmed from January 3 to January 31, 2007, at Bridge Studios. \"Sanctuary\" is filmed almost entirely using the green screen technique. Unlike many other shows, elaborate sets are not built for the scenes to be filmed; instead, they are created using CGI technology. Production on the television version of \"Sanctuary\" began in early 2008, with a reshooting of the pilot episode, \"Sanctuary for All\". The first season cost an estimated $21 million (CAN), and filmed in Burnaby, British Columbia. In December 2008, the series was confirmed to have been picked up for a second season of thirteen episodes. The second season began production in the end of March/beginning of April, 2009. Guest stars for the second season include Agam Darshi, who will play con-artist Kate Freelander, former \"Stargate SG-1\" actor Michael Shanks as Jimmy for the ninth episode, entitled \"Penance\", and former \"Stargate Atlantis\" actor Paul McGillion, who will play Wexford, a character he played in the webseries, in the final two episodes.\n\n\"Sanctuary\" is the first television series in North America to use the RED camera exclusively. The RED camera system does away with tape and film and records straight to a hard drive allowing the Anthem Visual Effects and the series' post production team immediate access to the day’s footage, and is capable of recording at resolutions up to 4096 horizontal by 2304 vertical pixels, four times the resolution of current day HD. Along with being a primary cast member, Amanda Tapping is also an executive producer on the show, but according to Tapping herself in an interview with \"The Today Show\", she does not get paid extra as an executive producer, mainly because what salary the executive producers would get would go towards paying for the sets, because the series is not backed up by a studio. Although heavily reliant on virtual sets, a few episodes in the first season, including \"Kush\" and \"Requiem\", were filmed on practical sets, including the fuselage of an aircraft. The series also took a different filming style for the \"Cloverfield\"-esque \"Instinct\".\n\nUnlike traditional TV series, the primary distribution channel for \"Sanctuary\" was originally the Internet. Episodes were sold directly to viewers on the official website. The web episodes or \"webisodes\", are about 15–20 minutes in duration and were released bi-weekly. The success of the webisodes led the Syfy Channel to commission a 13-episode season for 2008. The first four webisodes were rewritten and reshot as a two-hour premiere episode, \"Sanctuary for All\". After the deal with the SciFi channel, the webisodes were moved to the Sci Fi network on Hulu.com.\n\nIn its first season on Syfy, the original series, \"Sanctuary\" has averaged a 1.9 Household rating; 1,044,000 Adults (ages 18–49); 1,371,000 Adults (ages 25–54) and 2,366,000 total viewers. The pilot episode, \"Sanctuary for All\" received a Nielsen household rating of 2.2, the highest rated original series premiere from Syfy since the series premiere of \"Eureka\" in July 2006. The 2.2 rating represented more than 2.7 million viewers; 1.08 million among the adult 18–49 demographic and 1.4 million among the adult 25–54 demographic. This placed \"Sanctuary\" the number one cable program among adults 25–54, and number four among adults 18–49. The ratings success also boosted the web series to 1.2 million views. In the United Kingdom, both parts placed the series first place on the top ten viewing programmes for ITV4 during the two weeks they aired. The first part was viewed by 565,000, while the second part received a higher viewing figure of 608,000.\n\n\"Sanctuary\" has a score of 56 on Metacritic, signifying \"mixed or average reviews\" based on 7 television reviewers. Tori Ireland Mell of \"IGN\" called the series an intriguing story, and a mind-blowing concept, and believes the series from a production standpoint was executed well. Some reviewers have made comparisons between \"Sanctuary\" and British science fiction series \"Torchwood\" and \"Primeval\", as well as drawing comparisons between Dr. Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) and Daniel Jackson from \"Stargate SG-1\". \"USA Today\" reviewer Bill Keveney said that Amanda Tapping had reached her \"comfort zone,\" and continued with further positive reaction to the TV series. Rick Bentley from \"McClatchy Newspapers\" commented Tapping's role as Dr. Helen Magnus was a way for the actress to make a name for herself outside of \"Stargate SG-1\" as character Samantha Carter.\n\nMaureen Ryan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" described the show as \"competent if not particularly innovative sci-fi,\" and said that the series might be of interest to fans of Tapping's earlier works. Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" believed that the series does not have \"the narrative force of \"Battlestar Galactica\" or the wit and creativity of \"Eureka\",\" further stating \"it's not an embarrassment for the channel, but it doesn't raise the stakes either.\n\n\"Sanctuary\" has been nominated for six Constellation Awards. The series has also been nominated for ten Leo Awards and won four of these in 2009.\n\n"}
{"id": "7288221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7288221", "title": "Sasuke (TV series)", "text": "Sasuke (TV series)\n\nSasuke (サスケ; stylized in Japan as SASUKE) is a Japanese sports entertainment television special in which 100 competitors attempt to complete a four-stage obstacle course. An edited version, named Ninja Warrior, is screened in at least 18 other countries.\n\nRecorded on location at Midoriyama studio in Yokohama, it airs on Tokyo Broadcasting System between Japanese television drama seasons. The show's name \"Sasuke\" is named after Sarutobi Sasuke, a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling. Each three-hour special (with the exception of \"Sasuke\" 24 which lasted 5 hours) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 35 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, except in 2017). The show is produced by TBS and is one of the spin-offs of , another sports entertainment competition, which aired on G4 under the name \"Unbeatable Banzuke\". Until the 10th competition, \"Sasuke\" was broadcast as a special part of \"Muscle Ranking\", but it became an independent program when \"Muscle Ranking\" was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time \"Sasuke\" did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness. After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to \"Sasuke\", TBS renamed the show Sasuke Rising for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS renamed the show once again Sasuke Ninja Warrior since the 35th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. \"Sasuke\" consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in \"Sasuke\" 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 35 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were in the 4th competition (1999), Makoto Nagano in the 17th competition (2006), Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st competition (2015).\n\nThe popularity of \"Sasuke\" has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. \"Kunoichi\", perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of \"Sasuke\" restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n\"American Ninja Warrior\" is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with \"Sasuke\" (with American finalists participating on the \"Sasuke\" course in Japan), it was at one point the G4 network's highest rated show. As of season 4, \"American Ninja Warrior\"'s popularity has allowed it to move to the NBC network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter \"Sasuke\" even after the inception of \"ANW\".\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, United Kingdom, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France (TF1), Germany (RTL), Italy (NOVE of Discovery Networks) in 2016, and Israel (Keshet Media Group) . An Australian version launched on Nine Network in July 2017. Netflix also started airing \"Ultimate Beastmaster\", broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a \"Sasuke\" inspired show.\n\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, Bulgaria, China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.\n\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the \"Sasuke\" course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.\n\nThe six consisted of:\n\n\n† – Nagano touched the top of the Shin-Cliffhanger after swinging from the second to the third ledge. He disqualified himself, admitting his error and bowing out after he reached the next platform.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> – Nagano was allowed a second attempt at the First Stage due to a malfunction of the Slider Jump.\n\n\n† – Takeda had no number in the 18th tournament. He was around the 86th person to run the course.\n\n† – Yamamoto was hurt in the 7th competition when he dislocated his shoulder and in the 23rd he re-injured his shoulder.\n\n\n\n† – In the 12th competition, Yamada was disqualified on the Spider Walk for failing to remove his gloves used on the Chain Reaction obstacle. \nAlthough he was disqualified, he did manage to clear the 2nd Stage with 3.4 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Sasuke New Stars (in contrast to the All stars) are new younger competitors who have made a name for themselves on the recent editions of the course. \"Shin Sedai\" or New Stars became famous since \"Sasuke\" 17, after Shunsuke Nagasaki made it to the Final Stage. There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in \"Sasuke\" 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage. Membership in the New Stars has included the following:\n\n\n\n\n† – Kanno touched part of the frame with his foot and climbed along the side of the platform, thereby going off the course.\n‡ – Kanno withdrew before Double Salmon Ladder because of a shoulder injury.\n†† – Kanno dislocated his shoulder immediately after clearing the Warped Wall, and timed out on top of the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n† – Kishimoto did not run the course because of his back injury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld-class athletes, including Olympians, have attempted \"Sasuke\":\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in \"Sasuke\" over the years, including professional team handball player Daisuke Miyazaki, who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in \"Sasuke\" 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In \"Sasuke\" 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in \"Sasuke\" 26, he failed the First Stage Rolling Escargot.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: Tomoko Hagiwara, Koki Sakamoto, and Daisuke Nakano. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic gymnasts (and twin brothers) Paul and Morgan Hamm, have competed in \"Sasuke\". Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further – in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\nDecathlete Paul Terek competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of \"Pro Sportsman No. 1\" in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd \"American Ninja Challenge\" competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in \"Sasuke\" 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to \"Sasuke\" in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in \"Sasuke\" 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\nHenry Cejudo, gold medal-winning wrestler at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a free runner from G4's \"American Ninja Challenge 2\", first competed in \"Sasuke\" 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in \"\", a televised professional parkour tournament.\n\nLevi did not compete in \"American Ninja Warrior\" 3 to try to earn a spot for \"Sasuke\" 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.\n\nLevi however did compete \"American Ninja Warrior\" 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.\n\nHe has not competed in \"American Ninja Warrior\" ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.\nIn the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.\n\n\n\n† - Hamm cleared the Second Stage with 0.1 seconds left, but walked through the gates without hitting the buzzer and as a result, was disqualified.\n\n\n\n† - Levi was supposed to compete in the 26th tournament, having earned a spot in the \"American Ninja Warrior\" preliminaries, but was ultimately unable to do so after breaking his wrist on \"\", which occurred prior to the 26th tournament. His spot in the tournament went to ANW alternate, Adam LaPlante (who failed on the Halfpipe Attack in Stage 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBulgarian gymnast and six-time Olympian (1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012) Yordan Yovchev (spelled on G4 as Jordan Jovtchev) first competed in the 8th competition. During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time. He competed in the 15th competition but failed the Warped Wall in the First Stage. He later came back to compete in \"Sasuke\" 20, where he failed the Warped Wall again. He also competed in \"Sasuke\" 23, where he managed to pass all of the other obstacles but sadly timed out on the final rope ladder.\n\n\nSouth Korean gymnast Yeo Hong-chul, silver medalist in the men's vault at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. He competed four times but has never gotten past the First Stage. In the 7th competition, he was unable to beat the Rolling Log; In the 8th, he failed the Quintuple Step; In the 11th, he timed out on the Warped Wall. And in the 12th, he timed out on the Rope Climb.\n\nSpanish gymnast Gervasio Deferr, 2000 and 2004 Olympic Champion in the vault and 2008 silver medalist in the floor exercise, competed in the 10th competition but timed out a few feet from the buzzer on the First Stage's Rope Climb.\n\n\n\nK-1 mixed martial artist Genki Sudo has competed in five tournaments, failing at the Jump Hang (6th, 12th), the Rolling Log (13th), Duodectuple Step (23rd), and the Log Grip (24th). Another mixed martial artist, Sanae Kikuta competed in the 8th and 10th tournaments, where he fell off of the Rolling Log in the First Stage; in the 12th tournament, he fell on the Plank Bridge in the First Stage. Other K-1 fighters who have competed include Tatsuji (19th competition, failed the Jumping Spider), Yudai (20th competition, failed the Rokudantobi), Andy Ologun (18th competition, failed the Rope Glider; 20th competition, failed the Log Grip), Bobby Ologun (22nd competition, failed the Log Grip), Bernard Ackah (19th competition, failed the Jumping Spider), and Takeru has competed in four tournaments, failing the Hedgehog (30th), Warped Wall (31st), Tarzan Rope (32nd) when his foot touched the water, cleared the First Stage (33rd) but failed the Salmon Ladder Nobori, and Backstream (34th). He had a surprising fail on the modified Fish Bone (35th).\n\nFormer Pride Fighting Championships and Pancrase Japanese mixed martial artist and pro wrestler Ikuhisa Minowa, competing in DREAM known as \"Minowaman\", was featured in the 26th competition wearing red wrestling tights, pads, and boots. He failed the second obstacle, \"Hazard Swing\" after jumping from the swing, and missing the rope on the platform, falling into the water below. He also competed in the 29th competition, but failed the first obstacle, the \"Long Jump\", where he landed feet first onto the sandbox and jumped backwards into the water. Japanese featherweight mixed martial artist from DREAM Hideo Tokoro (announced as a \"freelance fighter\") was featured right after Minowaman in the 26th competition where he failed to grab the rope to swing himself to the other side in the first obstacle \"Step Slider\".\n\nSeveral professional wrestlers have also competed, including Tiger Mask, The Great Sasuke (referred to as \"Great Ninja Warrior\" in the US and UK versions), Minoru Suzuki, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Kota Ibushi and Naohiro Hoshikawa. Suzuki and Tanahashi were the Triple Crown Heavyweight and IWGP Heavyweight Champion, respectively, during their runs in the course.\n\nSeveral Japanese or Japan-based entertainers have taken part in \"Sasuke\", including action movie star Kane Kosugi and his brother Shane. Kane made the Third Stage in the 1st, 4th and 6th competitions, failing on the Pole Bridge, Cliffhanger and Body Prop, respectively. In the 7th competition, he made the Second Stage but failed the Spider Walk, his earliest exit from a competition. He reached the Final Stage in the 8th competition, becoming, alongside Yordan Yovchev, the first foreigner to make it that far. Competing in heavy rain, Kane timed out on the Rope Climb; he has not competed since. Shane timed out on the Second Stage's Wall Lift in the 2nd competition, then failed the First Stage's Rolling Log in the 3rd competition. In the 4th, he came close to completing the First Stage but timed out on the Rope Climb. In the 6th and 7th competitions, he made it to the Third Stage, failing both times on the Body Prop. In the 8th competition, he failed to get past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Unlike his brother, Shane competed in the 9th competition, where he failed the Big Boulder in the First Stage.\n\nOther entertainers who have competed include , host of several NHK children's programs; Shigeyuki Nakamura, a champion of the Muscle Gym event in \"Kinniku Banzuke\"; actor-singer Kazumi Morohoshi, a former member of the band Hikaru Genji who is now a solo artist; actor/announcer Kenjirō Ishimaru; and actors Masaki Nomura and Shōei. Sato debuted in the 18th tournament and failed the First Stage's Flying Chute. In the 19th tournament, he failed the Log Grip. In the 20th competition, he timed out before he attempted the Tarzan Rope. In the 21st competition, he timed out on the Warped Wall. In the 22nd, Sato finally cleared the First Stage but failed the Metal Spin in the Second. In \"Sasuke\" 23, he failed the Jumping Spider. In \"Sasuke\" 24, he failed the Metal Spin again. He missed \"Sasuke\" 25, but failed the Jumping Spider again in \"Sasuke\" 26. He missed \"Sasuke\" 27 and 28 but competed in 29, where he shocked the crowd by unexpectedly going out on the first obstacle, the Long Jump. Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. Shōei competed three times. He competed in \"Sasuke\" 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in \"Sasuke\" 7. He finally made it past the First Stage and Second Stage in \"Sasuke\" 8. He struggled in Stage 3 on the Propeller Bars, and failed the Body Prop.\n\nActor James Okada, a graduate from a martial arts academy, competed in the 6th and 7th competitions. In his first attempt, he failed the Jump Hang in the First Stage, but in the next tournament, he made it all the way to the Third, where he was defeated by the first obstacle, the Propeller Bars.\n\nActor and singer Tetsuji Sakakibara competed four times (23rd–26th tournaments) but never cleared the First Stage, failing on the Jumping Spider in the 23rd and 24th tournaments, the Jump Hang in the 25th tournament, and the Half-Pipe Attack in the 26th tournament.\n\nActor Ryosuke Yamamoto competed in \"Sasuke\" 30 and \"Sasuke\" 31. He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in \"Sasuke\" 30. In \"Sasuke\" 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orugōru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.\n\nVoice actress Tomoko Kaneda competed in \"Sasuke\" 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband Wataru Mori, an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since \"Sasuke\" 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in \"Sasuke\" 20 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in \"Sasuke\" 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in \"Sasuke\" 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In \"Sasuke\" 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in \"Sasuke\" 35.\n\nGolden Bomber members Kenji Darvish and Yutaka Kyan also competed in \"Sasuke\" 31. Kyan failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Darvish had previously competed in \"Sasuke\" 28 and 30 and failed the First Stage. In \"Sasuke\" 31, he finally completed the First Stage and failed the Cross Slider in the Second Stage. In \"Sasuke\" 32, Kyan did better on the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance on the new obstacle Tie Fighter. Darvish failed at the Tie Fighter when he lost his balance. In \"Sasuke\" 33, Darvish almost cleared the First Stage but shockingly failed the Lumberjack Climb with only several centimeters to finish the obstacle. Kyan failed Quad Steps. In \"Sasuke\" 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting in \"Sasuke\" 35.\n\nModel Shimon Okura competed in \"Sasuke\" 30. He failed on the Log Grip on the First Stage. He came again to \"Sasuke\" 31, doing better on the Log Grip, but he missed the nets on the Jump Hang Kai. Then he joined \"Sasuke\" 32. He fell on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he tried to get to the red sandbag.\n\nA.B.C-Z member Ryoichi Tsukada competed in \"Sasuke\" 31; he timed out at the Lumberjack Climb. Then, he competed again on \"Sasuke\" 32. He completed the new obstacle Tie Fighter and Double Pendulum, but he failed to reach the top of the Warped Wall. In \"Sasuke\" 33, he cleared the First Stage for the first time. He failed Salmon Ladder Up. Johnny's Jr. Hikaru Iwamoto failed the transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill. He failed on the TIE Fighter in \"Sasuke\" 35.\n\nSeveral Japanese comedians have taken part in \"Sasuke\", including (\"The Monkey\"), Koriki Choshu (\"the most famous gut in Japan\" and 2nd on G4's Craziest Contestants Poll), Passion Yara (\"screaming wacko\" and 5th on G4s craziest contestants poll), Masaki Sumitani (\"Razor Ramon H.G.\" or \"Hard Gay\"), Yoku Hata (\"Guitar Samurai\"), Tetsurō Degawa, and . Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges – for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st–3rd competitions), a record that is shared with \"Sasuke\" all-star Makoto Nagano, but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in \"Sasuke\" 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include Yoshio Kojima, who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26–28), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman Masumi Yagi was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian Eiko Kano (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian competed nine times in \"Sasuke\". He debuted in \"Sasuke\" 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In \"Sasuke\" 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In \"Sasuke\" 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In \"Sasuke\" 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for \"Sasuke\" 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In \"Sasuke\" 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in \"Sasuke\" 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in \"Sasuke\" 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in \"Sasuke\" 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the late action star, which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n45-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-\"Sasuke\" tournament (except \"Sasuke\" 22), starting with \"Sasuke\" 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former \"Super Sentai\" stuntwoman Chie Nishimura, who did so in the 2nd tournament. She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in \"Sasuke\" 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in \"Sasuke\" since.\n\nAll three women who achieved \"kanzenseiha\" on \"Kunoichi\" \"(Women of Ninja Warrior)\", the female equivalent of \"Sasuke\", have also competed in \"Sasuke\" itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n\n\n\nAmerican gymnast Kacy Catanzaro, who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during \"American Ninja Warrior\" qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for \"Sasuke\" 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and \"American Ninja Warrior\" standout, stuntwoman Jessie Graff – the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (\"ANW All-Stars\") – was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in \"Sasuke\" 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in \"Sasuke\" history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in \"Sasuke\". In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament.\n\nIn fall 2007, the G4 network held a contest called the \"American Ninja Challenge\", whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in \"Sasuke\" 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's \"Attack of the Show!\" on August 28–30 to demonstrate their \"Ninja Warrior\" skills. On August 31, Michigan State University Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, Greenville, South Carolina native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's \"Ninjafest\". Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's \"Ninjafest 2\" on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in \"Sasuke\" 20th tournament; both are free runners. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's \"Ninjafest 3\" on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in \"Sasuke\" 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg – the first woman to qualify – of Valley Village, California. They joined \"American Ninja Challenge\" 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from \"Attack of the Show!\", Olivia Munn and Kevin Pereira, to compete in \"Sasuke\" 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe ulnar nerve injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of \"Ninjafest 4\". The competitors' videos were judged by \"Attack of the Show\" Olivia Munn. The winner, David Campbell, was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 Jessie Graff went on to compete in \"Sasuke\" 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1–100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory). In the 10th competition the number system ran from 901 to 1000 to indicate that 1000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and then ran from 1901 to 2000 in the 20th competition to indicate that 2000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and from 2901 to 3000 during the 30th competition to indicate roughly 3000 attempts on \"Sasuke\". All air dates are of the Japanese broadcast on TBS.\n\nAired: September 27, 1997\n\nAired: September 26, 1998\n\nAired: March 13, 1999\n\nAired: October 16, 1999\n\nAired: March 18, 2000\n\nAired: September 9, 2000\n\nNote: This is the first tournament where no one failed the Second Stage.\n\nAired: March 17, 2001\n\n^Went 2 1/2 meters up then fell down.\n\nAired: September 29, 2001\n\n^ Jovtchev fell off the Spider Climb after the walls split at the 15 second limit.\n\nAired: March 16, 2002\n\nAired: September 25, 2002\n\nAired: March 21, 2003\n\nAired: October 1, 2003\n\nAired: April 6, 2004\n\nAired: January 4, 2005\n\nAired: July 20, 2005\n\nAired: December 30, 2005\n\nAired: October 11, 2006\n\nAired: March 21, 2007\n\nAired: September 19, 2007\n\nNote: This is the first tournament where nobody cleared the Second Stage, marking the earliest end of a tournament.\n\nAired: March 26, 2008\n\nAired: September 17, 2008\n\nAired: March 30, 2009\n\nAired: September 27, 2009\n\nAired: January 1, 2010\n\nAired: March 28, 2010\n\nAired: January 2, 2011\n\nAired: October 3, 2011\n\nAired: December 27, 2012\n\nAired: June 27, 2013\n\nAired: July 3, 2014\n\nAired: July 1, 2015\n\nAired: July 3, 2016\n\nNote: This is the second tournament where no one failed the Second Stage.\n\nAired: March 26, 2017\n\nAired: October 8, 2017\n\nAired : March 26, 2018\n\nOne hundred participants are given the opportunity to attempt the First Stage, a course which primarily tests one's speed. The object is to hit the buzzer at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th \"Sasuke\" competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being \"Sasuke\" All-Stars), a record in \"Sasuke\" history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first \"Kunoichi\", where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n+ — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock. From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. \"Sasuke\"\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a \"Sasuke\" competition.\n\n+ — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n+ — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\nTo date, the Final Stage has known six forms. Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as \"kanzenseiha\" (), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on \"Ninja Warrior\" as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated \"Sasuke\" in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15 meter (49 ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to . It consists of a Spider Climb followed by a Rope Climb. After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared Yordan Yovtchev during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20 meter (66 ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5 meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of \"Sasuke Rising\". Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4 m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18–24 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7–17 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24 m. The Spider Climb (スパイダークライム) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5 m, while the Rope Climb (綱登り) was slightly modified in length at 11.5 m from that of its original predecessor, at 10 m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35 second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was ¥2,000,000 (about US$). The prize has now increased to ¥4,000,000 (about US$) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a Nissan Fuga was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.\n\nBelow is an incomplete list of the international versions with their own \"Sasuke\"/\"Ninja Warrior\" courses, excluding the original Japanese version and its rebroadcast in other countries.\n\nThese winners are not including the \"kanzenseiha\" (Total Victory) winners from the original Japanese version, or under any other varied rules (including \"Team Ninja Warrior\" in Denmark and the United States).\n\nThe program previously aired on G4 in the United States under the name Ninja Warrior. Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese play-by-play commentary and interviews with the competitors have English subtitles, while the competitor profiles, replays, and introductions were dubbed by voice actor Dave Wittenberg.\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of \"Ninja Warrior\" stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the Esquire Network on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if \"Ninja Warrior\" would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show \"American Ninja Warrior\" to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by \"USA Today\" says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\"\n\nThe popularity of the \"American Ninja Challenge\" has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called \"American Ninja Warrior\", which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by Akbar Gbaja-Biamila and Matt Iseman. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by \"Sasuke\" First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n\"American Ninja Warrior\" aired only the American finalists during the \"Sasuke\" obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA second season was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in \"Sasuke\" 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals. This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the \"Sasuke\" obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider). The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the \"Sasuke\" course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the \"Sasuke\" competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former \"American Gladiators\" champion and gladiator Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. David Campbell, despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, \"Sasuke\" 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe third season of \"American Ninja Warrior\" debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time \"Sasuke\" veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard, Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and \"\" competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow \"Jump City: Seattle\" competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from \"Jump City\" who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan , second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time \"Sasuke\" veteran Brian Orosco all saw their \"Sasuke\" dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to \"Sasuke\", nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for \"Sasuke\" 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, David Campbell almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 K-Swiss Endorsement Deal, the competitors at \"Sasuke\" 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA fourth season of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted \"American Ninja Warrior\" title. The entire format was changed as well – regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its fifth season on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its sixth season on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and Esquire Network with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its seventh season in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during \"Sasuke\" 34.) The network has renewed the show once again for its eighth season in 2016 with new qualifying cities including Los Angeles and Oklahoma City. The network has renewed the show for its ninth season in 2017 with three new cities: San Antonio, Daytona Beach, and Cleveland. The tenth season of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall.\n\nIn 2014, the first \"Sasuke\"-based team competition was started, pitting five \"Sasuke\" All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five \"American Ninja Warrior\" stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural \"Sasuke\"/\"Ninja Warrior\" world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in Aoba-ku in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from \"Sasuke\", while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from \"American Ninja Warrior\". The match was composed of four rounds – one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6–0 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\nWith the success of \"American Ninja Warrior\", Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called \"Team Ninja Warrior\" on October 9, 2015. The spin-off consists of 24 teams of three members featuring past and current \"ANW\" contestants from the first seven seasons. The series began airing on January 19, 2016 and is hosted by Akbar Gbaja-Biamila and Matt Iseman with sideline reporter Alex Curry.\n\n\"College Madness\" features college teams in a five-week competition. The second season began airing on November 22, 2016 with Iseman and Biama as hosts and \"ANW\" season six contestant Kacy Catanzaro as the sideline reporter.\n\nUSA renewed the show for its second full season.\n\nIn 2018 the network renamed the show to \"American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja\" with Iseman, Biama, and Curry as hosts and new teams for its third season.\n\nOn May 2, 2018, Universal Kids announced a second spin-off called \"American Ninja Warrior Junior\". The spin-off consists of 192 kids from across America as they compete head to head in three different age brackets: 9-10, 11-12, and 13-14 years old. Each bracket will be mentored by All-Star Ninja Mentors: Drew Dreschel, Barclay Stockett, Kevin Bull, Natalie Duran, Najee Richardson and Meagan Martin. The series began airing on October 13, 2018, with Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, joined by Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez as hosts.\n\nThe American-edited \"Ninja Warrior\" episodes are broadcast in the United Kingdom on Challenge. The show has been re-edited to remove the subtitles from the footage of the competitors taking part in the stages, but retain them for contestant interviews. The \"Ninja Killer\" and \"Warrior Wipeout\" sections remain, but there is only one advertisement break halfway through the show.\n\nThe show was voiced-over by Stuart Hall for its first three series, aired between 2007 and 2008. In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over. Challenge has now removed Hall's commentary from the first three series, following his imprisonment in June 2013, and re-dubbed them with new commentary by North. As of July 2012, all American edited episodes, covering all tournaments up to \"Sasuke\" 27, had aired in the UK. A new run of edited episodes airing in March 2016 was produced in the UK for Challenge, covering the \"Sasuke Rising\" tournaments, once again voiced by North. Another run of brand new edited episodes airing in June 2018 was again produced in the UK for Challenge, covering \"Sasuke\" tournaments 31–34, also voiced by North.\n\nIt was announced on 22 December 2014 that a UK remake of the format, similar to that of the American version, would be aired on ITV in 2015. The first series began on 11 April 2015. It is produced by ITV Studios subsidiary company, Potato and hosted by Ben Shephard, Rochelle Humes and Chris Kamara.\n\n\"American Ninja Warrior\" and \"Swedish Ninja Warrior\" are broadcast in Australia on SBS Two.

The obstacles on each side were different, and the top 20 fastest times on each side advanced to Stage 2. In Stage 2, common \"Sasuke\" obstacles (Salmon Ladder, double Warped Wall) appeared, and competitors had 100 seconds to clear this stage. Only eight competitors made it to Stage 3, which featured typical Stage 3 obstacles: Pole Maze, Spinning Bridge, Rumbling Dice, Spider Flip, Cliffhanger, and Pipe Slider. All competitors failed on Stage 3, with Le Van Thuc making it the furthest (failed dismounting onto the platform from the Pipe Slider).\n\n\"Sasuke Vietnam\" Season 2 began airing on May 19, 2016.

{"id": "2882360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882360", "title": "Sideswipe (Transformers)", "text": "Sideswipe (Transformers)\n\nSideswipe is a fictional robot superhero character in the \"Transformers\" franchise. Because of trademark restrictions, toys of the character are sometimes marketed as SideSwipe.\n\nSideswipe (sometimes\" 'Agujero in Mexico, Lambor in Japan, Frérot Québec, Freccia\"' (meaning \"arrow\") in Italy) is described in his tech file as a brave but often brash warrior. He is almost as skilled as his twin brother Sunstreaker in combat, but is less ruthless. Sideswipe transformed into a red Lamborghini Countach, while his brother, Sunstreaker, transformed into a yellow Lamborghini Countach. Because of his jetpack, Sideswipe was one of few G1 Autobots with the ability to fly and capacity for space flight.\n\nIn 1984 CBC's The Journal did a report on how some people considered Transformers like Sideswipe and other war toys too violent for children. Dreamwave comics artist Pat Lee says his favorite Transformer is Sideswipe.\n\nSideswipe was part of the initial crew of Autobots aboard the \"Ark\" when it crash-landed on Earth four million years ago. He awakened along with his fellow Transformers in 1984, with both he and his brother being reformatted into Lamborghini sports cars. Sideswipe loaned Optimus Prime the use of his rocket pack when the Decepticons nearly escaped from Earth with a starship full of energon. Throughout Seasons 1 and 2, Sideswipe was voiced by Michael Bell.\n\nSideswipe and Sunstreaker often operated together. When antimatter-fueled Decepticons attacked the Ark on one occasion in the episode \"Roll for It\", Sideswipe and Sunstreaker took to the air to battle with the incoming seeker jets, in a rambunctious, if ultimately ineffective, display of \"jet judo.\"\n\nWhen investigating tremors that were shaking the Autobot base, Ironhide's scanner found some interesting objects inside a rock wall. Sideswipe, using his piston-like arms, helped Brawn remove the rock wall and found a cave full of dinosaur bones, the discovery of which would lead to the development of the Dinobots.\n\nTowards the end of 1985, Sideswipe, impersonating himself as the Stunticon Breakdown, is among the team of five Autobots who disguised themselves as the Stunticons. Penetrating the Decepticons' camp, the Autobots ran into trouble when the real Stunticons arrived, trying to prove their identities by forming Menasor. With a combination of Windcharger's magnetic powers and Mirage's illusion-creating ability, the Autobots were able to appear as Menasor too, but the deception was soon revealed, though they were still able to thwart the Decepticons' plans. Another major role for Sideswipe was stopping the Combaticons' plot to pull the Earth into the sun, in which he and other Autobots team up with Decepticons to travel to Cybertron. Sideswipe himself reversed the effects of the plot, saving the Earth.\n\nIn an early script for \"\" there was a scene planned where Sideswipe, Red Alert and Tracks hop off Ultra Magnus to attack Devastator, but they are pushed back and Red Alert is shot in the back and killed.\n\nSideswipe appears in the first two episodes of the Japanese series \"\", participating with Ultra Magnus, the Trainbots, and Prowl (who may have mistakenly appeared, as he was killed in \"The Transformers: The Movie\") on a shootout against the Triple Changers, Soundwave, and Sixshot. During a segment of this intense shootout, Sideswipe manages to hit Frenzy and later, after foiling a new Decepticon assault, has also a line.\n\nSideswipe appeared in the 1984 sticker and story book \"Return to Cybertron\" written by Suzanne Weyn and published by Marvel Books.\n\nSideswipe was featured in the 1985 Transformers audio book \"Autobots' Lightning Strike\".\n\nSideswipe appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book \"The Lost Treasure of Cybertron\" by Marvel Books.\n\nSideswipe was featured in the 1993 \"Transformers: Generation 2\" coloring book \"Decepticon Madness\" by Bud Simpson.\n\nSideswipe returned in the pages of the BotCon exclusive \"\" comics. He was amongst the Autobot heroes of the Great War welcomed back to Cybertron. However, all of them were transported away by Unicron. Reformatted into a new body, he was forced to fight for Unicron's amusement (and unbeknownst to all, so that the Spark energy from fallen combatants could revitalize his own shattered frame). He ends up fighting his own brother. All were subsequently freed by the resurrected Optimus Primal, and Sideswipe went on to serve him as part of the new Autobot faction.\n\nAlthough Universe ended at issue #3, the flashback of Optimus Prime would reveal what happened. In the final battle between the forces of Optimus Primal and Unicron, the Chaos-Bringer had disappeared (due to the events of \"\"), with Primal's forces barely making it out. Sideswipe was among those seen escaping.\n\nIn this reimagining of the Generation One story, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist Cobra organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. In this storyline Sideswipe and Sunstreaker both turned into Cobra Stingers. Destro attempted to use them in a battle against G.I. Joe, but the two of them were temporarily put out of commission by Wheeljack. They were later seen fighting the Decepticons on Cobra Island.\n\nSideswipe reappeared in the third crossover series as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force trying to rescue Optimus Prime. Sideswipe returned in the fourth crossover as part of a group led by Prowl working with former G.I. Joe leader Hawk to stop the spread of Cybertronian technology on Earth. After failing to apprehend Destro, the group relaxed on their ship - only to be attacked by the Monster Pretenders, with Sideswipe being incapacitated. He was later shown being repaired.\n\nBefore the civil war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, Sideswipe was a merchant. After the war broke out he joined the Autobots. When Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobots splintered into smaller factions. Sideswipe stayed with the main Autobot force, now under the leadership of Prowl.\n\nWith the Autobots learned that the Decepticons were testing a new mobile command base at the Praetorus Wharf, Sideswipe was part of a small investigation team led by Prowl. They discovered the mobile command base to be Trypticon and were forced to battle with little chance of success until the giant Decepticon was ordered to leave.\n\nSome time after being reawakened on Earth four million years later, Sideswipe was aboard a ship named 'The Ark II' created by the Autobots and their human allies to end the war on Earth and return to Cybertron. However, the ship was sabotaged and exploded shortly after take-off. The human allies were killed, but Sideswipe and other Autobots were lost in the ocean. Sideswipe and the other lost Autobots were later found by Optimus Prime who used the Matrix to revive them. Sideswipe fought in the battle against the Decepticons in San Francisco, attacking Soundwave with Sunstreaker.\n\nWhen Ultra Magnus came to Earth claiming that the Earth-based Autobots were Cybertonian criminals; Optimus Prime surrendered and returned to Cybertron with half of his force. Sideswipe was amongst those ordered to stay behind, now under the command of Jazz.\n\nSideswipe and the other Autobots who remained on Earth were attacked by Starscream and Bruticus. Sideswipe fell in this battle and was later repaired by the Earth Defense Command.\n\nAs part of a small group led by Jazz and Marissa Faireborn of the Earth Defense Command to search for missing soldiers and solve the mystery of the deserted city, Sideswipe found and battled the Insecticons along with his twin brother Sunstreaker. After defeating the Insecticons, the Autobots rejoined the other Autobots and were led by Prowl to the site of the future Autobot City: Earth.\n\nIn \"Transformers Invasion\" Sideswipe is among the Autobots in Canada who help get people to safety from an Earthquake caused by \"Shattered Glass\" Ultra Magnus using the Terminus Blade.\n\nLong Haul appears in \"A Flash Forward\" by Fun Publications. In the year 2005 Devastator attacks Autobot City. He is opposed by Ultra Magnus, Sideswipe, Red Alert and Tracks. Firing every weapon they have, the Autobots are able to force Devastator to break apart into the individual Constructicons. Now outnumbered the Autobots retreated. Red Alert is killed covering the withdrawal, as Megatron watches. These events and others are related to Jhaixus by Runabout and Runamuck in 2013.\n\nSideswipe appears in the story \"\" where he is among the reinforcements from Autobot City to respond to the Decepticon attack at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Once there the Autobots are able to defeat the Decepticons, but during the fight the Autobots are exposed to refined Forestonite, which enhances and mutates Cybertronian systems. He gets enhanced to his \"Generation 2\" form.\n\nSpark commands an Autobot shuttle crewed by Blaze, Hubcap, Sideswipe, Streetstar and Windbreaker into space where they intercept a distress call from Spike Witwicky on the planet Nebulos. When the Autobots arrive on Nebulos they meet Spike and Carly Witwicky, Chip Chase and the Autobots Brainstorm, Chromedome, Crosshairs and Highbrow who inform them that the Nebulan scientist Hi-Q is missing. They learn from Hi-Q's assistant Hi-Test that Hi-Q had security monitors and through them discover the scientist was kidnapped by the Decepticons Runabout and Runamuck.\n\nLong ago, before the war, Sunstreaker and Sideswipe were law enforcers working under the Senate, and were involved with the arrest of Impactor.\n\nSideswipe made his first IDW Publishing appearance in the \"\" issue on Galvatron. Assigned to Hound's unit on Cybertron guarding Thunderwing's body.\n\nChafing under Hound's command due to Sunstreaker going missing on Earth (in \"\"), Sideswipe clashed with his superior, even going over his head to call Optimus Prime on Earth, being reprimanded as a result. However, the matter was rendered moot when the mysterious Galvatron appeared, killing Leadfoot. An enraged Sideswipe blasted him, and was blasted aside as a result. While the rest of Hound's unit engaged Galvatron, Sideswipe recovered and blew apart Galvatron's head with a single full-powered shot. As Hound chastised him, the undead Galvatron recovered and rendered the whole unit unconscious with one blast, before leaving with Thunderwing.\n\nSideswipe and his unit were redeployed to Earth under Optimus Prime's orders in issue #1 of \"\", but were rediverted to Garrus-9 following the Decepticons' abduction of the Monstructor components.\n\nSideswipe has appeared among the Autobots on Cybertron in \"All Hail Megatron\". He now appears to have a form based on the \"Universe Classics Series\" Sideswipe toy.\n\nIn the original \"Marvel Transformers\" comics, Sideswipe's role was largely similar to that of the animated series, serving as a loyal warrior under Optimus Prime.\n\nSideswipe joined the list of the long-term injured during the \"Dinobot Hunt\". He was charged, along with Bluestreak and Huffer, with bringing in the powerful Dinobot, Grimlock. Unfortunately, the party found the mentally ill Grimlock locked in vicious combat with Sludge, who had been planted there by the Decepticons. Sideswipe was seriously injured while trying to contain the situation, but managed at least to put out a distress call, alerting Prowl and Optimus Prime.\n\nHe appeared to avoid deactivation by the Underbase powered Starscream, he was not seen again after issue #50 of the US comic.\n\nHe appeared again in the Generation 2 comics as part of a raiding party under Grimlock that was outthought and captured by the forces of Jhiaxus. He was freed by Prime, and later appeared battling the Swarm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a release of an unused \"Generation 2\" Go-Bots mold, the name Side Swipe is reused for the first time on an unrelated toy to the original. This toy did not receive any characterization and did not appear in the show or any other fiction.\n\nOriginally called Stepper in the Japanese series \"Micron Legend\", he was renamed Sideswipe (with a space) when Hasbro released the series in America. Transforming into a blue Nissan Skyline, Sideswipe's alternate mode is as realistic as an Armada toy can get to an actual vehicle. However, his robot mode is considered by many to be very poorly designed and is the subject of much ridicule.\n\nNote: Early packaging of Sideswipe spelled his name without a space, but it was later added. According to online posts by Hasbro employees there was a mixup in the naming of Sideswipe and Mini-Con Nightbeat, and the original intention was for them to have each other's name, making this toy a true homage to the original Nightbeat.\n\nSideswipe first appears in the Armada episode \"Past\"(Part 1) as a rookie in Optimus Prime's squad. He is rather ridiculous and awkward youth. In the animated series it is revealed that once he had been saved from Decepticon execution by Blurr, and has travelled to Earth to join him at last. But Blurr is not too glad to have such a subordinate. So, by Prime's consent, he charges Hot Shot to take care of Sideswipe. Initially Hot Shot is displeased very much that he has to fuss over such a misfit, but he begins to train him, however. When Hot Shot's former friend Wheeljack arrives and attacks him, Sideswipe does his best to defend his trainer. And when Sideswipe himself is taken a prisoner by Wheeljack, Hot Shot immediately races to his rescue. Though the conflagration threatens to consume them all, Hot Shot abandons the fight to save Sideswipe, successfully getting him out just in time. Since this moment Sideswipe hero-worships his new friend, much to Hot Shot's amusement, though the latter sometimes feels annoyed with such enthusiastic displays of friendship and even tries to get away from his admirer.\n\nSideswipe always did everything to prove his fighting skill to everyone in practice, but he never had become a great warrior, however. Nevertheless, he proved to be a real boon for the Autobots because of his good understanding of the computers (for example, he succeeded in deciphering the secret access code of the Decepticon Base revealed by Starscream). Later, Sideswipe served as Hot Shot's most loyal soldier when that one briefly took command of the Autobots after Optimus Prime's death.\n\nSideswipe also appeared in Dreamwave's \" Transformers: Armada\" comic, with a much lesser role. He first appeared in issue #14. He was one of a team of Autobots under Jetfire who investigated odd Space Bridge activity at the Decepticon HQ - unaware it had been taken over by the Heralds of Unicron. Bludgeon was still present, and stalked Jetfire's team. Sideswipe survived relatively unscathed - unlike Blurr and Dropshot - and helped to eventually destroy the samurai Decepticon.\n\nSideswipe was last seen in issue #18 of the Armada series and did not make any appearances in the Transformers: Energon comic series.\n\nThis Sideswipe (again spelled without a space) is an alternate universe version of the \"Generation 1\" character from the BotCon exclusive \"Shattered Glass\" comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots are evil.\n\nAlthough initially an evil Autobot, Sideswipe was betrayed by Optimus Prime - who killed Sideswipe's mentor Drench. Sideswipe repainted himself in Drench's colors while bearing a scar across his chest, and joined the Decepticons to avenge his mentor's death. He is partnered with the Decepticon Micromaster Whisper, who he refers to as his \"Mini-Con.\"\n\nSideswipe appears as a member of Megatron's forces in the \"Transformers: Timelines\" story \"Shattered Glass\" by Fun Publications. He befriends a lost Autobot named Cliffjumper, a traveler from another dimension where the Autobots are heroic, and helps the Decepticons in the attack on the Ark launch site.\n\nSideswipe appears in the fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", a text based story. He defends the Arch-Ayr fuel dump from an Autobot attack and later helps capture the Dinobots and for the Decepticons. Cliffjumper and Sideswipe then track to an ancient crypt, which ends up being the home of the life-creating computer known as the Omega Terminus. They are joined by the Autobots and , who are also hunting Grimlock. The enemies end up joining forces to fight Grimlock, the Terminus and a host of zombie transformers, including Drench and this world's . They escape, but their memories of the event are suppressed by the Terminus.\n\nIn \"Do Over\", Sideswipe is present when announces the impending launch of the \"Nemesis\", designed to stop the Autobot warship known as the \"Ark\". The \"Nemesis\" launches after the \"Ark\", and after a brief battle the \"Nemesis\" is shot down and crashes on Earth, with the crew escaping in stasis pods. Although not directly depicted, Sideswipe is a member of the crew of the \"Nemesis\".\n\nIn \"Blitzwing Bop\", Sideswipe, and stop a scheme by and to make attack drones from human cars by implanting control devices in the cars in a car wash.\n\nSideswipe appears in the and of the live action film series. He transforms into a Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Concept in 2009 and a Chevrolet Centennial Corvette convertible in 2011. He has two wheeled feet like Bonecrusher from the first film. Sideswipe is armed with guns, a back-mounted machine gun and Cybertanium blades. Early concept art of Sideswipe portrayed him as being red, but he ended up silver, presumably due to director Michael Bay's notion that the color red does not photograph well on film (the same reason Optimus Prime in the film series is primarily blue over red). His Hasbro battle bio states that he is 15 ft. tall and that he is a master in almost every form of martial arts on Cybertron.\n\nIn \"Revenge of the Fallen\", Sideswipe first appears in the chase in Shanghai, China, pursuing the Decepticon Sideways. Using his wheeled feet to maneuver, Sideswipe somersaulted over him while shooting at him, then threw one of his arm blades into the front of Sideways' vehicle mode. As he landed, Sideswipe reattached the blade (which was still embedded in Sideways) and forced it lengthwise down Sideways' body, cutting him in half. He was also seen in the fight against the Decepticons after Optimus Prime was killed by Megatron as Bumblebee and the twins escaped with Sam. Sideswipe was surrounded by the human military and forced to go back to the Autobot base alongside Ironhide, Ratchet, Arcee, Chromia, Elita-One and Jolt. They arrived in Egypt and fought against many Decepticons. Sideswipe was the first to spot Sam and watched as Optimus Prime was resurrected. Sideswipe was brushed aside by The Fallen when he teleported in front of them.\n\nSideswipe returns in \"\" as one of the main Autobots. He accompanies Bumblebee, Que/Wheeljack, and Dino/Mirage when they investigated a nuclear facility in the Middle East. Later he joined Dino and Bumblebee in accompanying the humans to find out more about the Space Race. Sideswipe helped Bumblebee and Dino fight the three Dreads on the highway, who are after Sentinel Prime, using his stealth force weapons to shoot at Hatchet. He then helped Ironhide finish off Crowbar and Crankcase in a \"Mexican Standoff\", as Sideswipe called it. Sideswipe was expelled from Earth along with the other Autobots and was thought to have perished when Starscream destroyed the Xanthium. He participated in the final battle in Chicago. He was captured by the Decepticons and witnessed the death of Que. He almost shared Que's fate, but escaped after Wheelie and Brains crashed a Decepticon carrier ship. He helped Bumblebee and Ratchet fire at incoming Decepticons, and briefly battled Sentinel Prime alongside them, but he was blasted backwards by the treacherous Prime. Sideswipe was among the surviving Autobots at the end of the film.\n\nIn Transformers: The Last Knight reveals that Wheelie and Topspin have survived being hunted by Cemetery Wind. And given that Sideswipe was also mentioned to have been killed by Cemetery Wind in \"Age of Extinction Topps Europe collector cards\", the only Autobots who survived the end of Dark of the Moon whose current status is unknown is Dino and Roadbuster.\n\nSideswipe first appeared in \"Transformers: Alliance\" #4 as one of the Autobots who responded to Optimus Prime's call to Earth. He joined with Optimus' team as part of NEST.\n\nSideswipe was spotlighted in \"Tales of the Fallen\" #2, which revealed the Autobot trained under Ironhide, and was charged with protecting an Autobot colony from the Decepticons. The Decepticon attacked and killed all but Sideswipe, laying waste to the colony. Sideswipe vowed revenge, and upon arriving on Earth, chased after his nemesis without care for any innocent in the crossfire. Ironhide arrived and tried to stop Sideswipe, but it was only when Ironhide called Sideswipe \"no better than the enemy\" did Sideswipe stand down, and Demolishor escaped.\n\nSideswipe appears in \"Transformers: Nefarious\" #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. steals an RV in Seattle and is chased by and , who keep her occupied until Sideswipe arrives and defeats her. She is taken to N.E.S.T. headquarters on Diego Garcia to be examined by Ratchet. Sideswipe was disgusted by her decision to disguise herself as a human.\n\nSideswipe is shown to be helping Optimus Prime against Megatron. Later he fights against Barricade and . Afterwards he helps Ratchet against . Sideswipe is later seen with Ratchet transporting energon when they are attacked by Starscream and Mindwipe.\n\nSideswipe is playable character in the PSP version of \"\", the video game tie-in to the 2007 live-action \"Transformers\" film.\nHe is a part of the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Character and Map Pack Plus DLC pack that was released on August 27 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. He is also a playable character in the PSP version and the Autobot Nintendo DS version, which is during Challenge Modes only.\n\nSideswipe is among the characters who appear in the \"TRANSFORMERS CYBERVERSE Battle Builder Game\".\n\nSideswipe is only a playable character in the multiplayer section of the PS3 and Xbox 360 games \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" and \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\".\n\nAll toys of this character (except the RPM/Speed Stars diecast cars) are officially licensed from General Motors.\n\n\nSideswipe appears in the novels \"\", \"\", and \"\".\n\nSideswipe is one of the playable Autobots in the 2010 video game \"\". He, along with and , are captured by the Decepticons and taken to Kaon prison as part of an elaborate plan to free Zeta Prime and other imprisoned Autobots. The trio battle and his minions on their way to rescuing Zeta Prime.\n\nSideswipe also appears in its sequel \"\" where he helps get Jazz and Cliffjumper to the Sea of Rust to search for Grimlock.\n\nSideswipe appears in \"\" as a playable character in Single Player mode and an unlockable character in the new Escalation mode. In the game, he helps Ironhide retrieve the Dark Spark before the Decepticons do, and deliver it to Optimus Prime.\n\nSideswipe appears as one of the main characters in the \"\", the sequel series to \"Transformers: Prime\", voiced by Darren Criss. Originally a rebellious Autobot on Cybertron who delights in vandalism, Sideswipe is captured by Lieutenant Bumblebee and Female Cadet Strongarm and ends up traveling with them to Earth. He ends up an unlikely member of Bumblebee's new team along with Grimlock and the Mini-Con Fixit, attempting to recapture fugitive Decepticons.\n\n\nSideswipe is one of the BotCon 2011 exclusive figures, painted in his \"Generation 2\" black and red colors.\n\nAfter the events of \"Transformers Animated\" the Stunticons set up a Stunt Convoy show in the city of Kaon and used it as a cover to attempt to break Megatron out of his detention at Trypticon. Their efforts were thwarted thanks to the efforts of Cheetor, Optimus Prime and Sideswipe. The Stunticons were placed in detention with Megatron and an attempt to rescue them was made by the Decepticons Blot, Mindwipe, Oil Slick, Scalpel, Sky-Byte and Strika.\n\nHis tech spec appeared on a lithograph sold at Botcon 2011.\n\nSideswipe is an Autobot who turns into a car.\n\nKreon Sideswipe appeared in the animated short \"Last Bot Standing.\"\n\nKreon Sideswipe appeared in the animated short \"Bot Stars.\"\n\nKreon Sideswipe appeared in the animated short \"The Big Race.\"\n\nKreon Sideswipe appeared in the animated short \"A Gift For Megatron.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "375327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375327", "title": "Zoopraxiscope", "text": "Zoopraxiscope\n\nThe zoöpraxiscope (initially named \"zoographiscope\" and \"zoogyroscope\") is an early device for displaying moving images and is considered an important predecessor of the movie projector. It was conceived by photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge in 1879 (and built for him by January 1880 to project his famous chronophotographic pictures in motion and thus prove that these were authentic). Muybridge used the projector in his public lectures from 1880 to 1895. The projector used 16\" glass disks onto which Muybridge had an unidentified artist paint the sequences as silhouettes. This technique eliminated the backgrounds and enabled the creation of fanciful combinations and additional imaginary elements. Only one disk used photographic images, of a horse skeleton posed in different positions. A later series of 12\" discs, made in 1892–1894, used outlines drawn by Erwin F. Faber that were printed onto the discs photographically, then colored by hand. These colored discs were probably never used in Muybridge's lectures. All images of the known 71 disks, including those of the photographic disk, were rendered in elongated form to compensate the distortion of the projection. The projector was related to other projecting phenakistiscopes and used some slotted metal shutter discs that were interchangeable for different picture disks or different effects on the screen. The machine was hand-cranked. \n\nThe device appears to have been one of the primary inspirations for Thomas Edison and William Kennedy Dickson's Kinetoscope, the first commercial film exhibition system. Images from all of the known seventy-one surviving zoopraxiscope discs have been reproduced in the book \"Eadweard Muybridge: The Kingston Museum Bequest\" (The Projection Box, 2004).\n\nAs stipulated in Muybridge's will the original machine and disks in his possession were left to Kingston upon Thames, where they are still kept in the Kingston Museum Muybridge Bequest Collection (except for four discs that are in other collections, including those of the Cinémathèque française and the National Technical Museum in Prague).\n\nMuybridge also produced a series of 50 different paper 'Zoopraxiscope discs' (basically phenakistiscopes), again with pictures drawn by Erwin F. Faber. The discs were intended for sale at the 1893 World's Fair at Chicago, but seem to have sold very poorly and are quite rare. The discs were printed in black-and-white, with twelve different discs also produced as chromolithographed versions. Of the coloured versions only four different ones are known to still exist with a total of five or six extant copies.\n\n\n"}
