The \"p\" stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. The \"480\" denotes a vertical resolution of 480 pixels, usually with a horizontal resolution of 640 pixels and aspect ratio (480 × = 640) or a horizontal resolution of 854 or less (848 should be used for mod16 compatibility) pixels for an approximate aspect ratio (480 × = 853.). Since a pixel count must be a whole number, in Wide VGA displays it is generally rounded up to 854 to ensure inclusion of the entire image. The frames are displayed progressively as opposed to interlaced. 480p was used for many early Plasma televisions. Standard definition has always been a 4:3 aspect ratio with a pixel resolution of 640 × 480 pixels.\n\nThe ATSC digital television standards define 480p with 640×480p (4:3) pixel resolutions, at p24, p30, or p60 frames per second.\n\nBoth 480p24 and 480p30 are more common in countries that use or have used the interlaced NTSC system like North America and Japan (these formats are somewhat compatible with that system, when used to broadcast progressive film content).\n\n"}
{"id": "15411738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15411738", "title": "Abhinaya", "text": "Abhinaya\n\nAbhinaya (Sanskrit \"abhi-\" 'towards' + \"nii-\" 'leading/guide') is the art of expression in Indian aesthetics. More accurately it means \"leading an audience towards\" the experience (\"bhava\") of a sentiment (\"rasa\"). The concept, derived from Bharata Muni's \"Natya Shastra\", is used as an integral part of all Indian classical dance styles.\n\n\"Abhinaya\" can be divided into four, according to the \"Natya Shastra\".\n\nAngika Abhinaya denotes the movements of angas like head,hands,waist and face. Pratyangas like shoulder, shoulder arm's,thighs,knees and elbows and upangas like eyes, eyelid,cheeks,nose, lips and teeth. Additional hastas (hand gestures) also plays an important role in expressing feelings.\n\nSpeech is used in drama and also in music when the singer expresses the emotion through his or her singing. In the Kuchipudi and Melattur styles of Indian classical dance the dancers often mouth the words of the songs (\"padartha abhinaya\"). Kerala still has stage art forms that have \"Vāchika Abhinaya\" as a dominant component - Koodiyattam, Nangyar Kooothu, Ottan, Seetangan & Parayan - the tree types of Thullal, Mudiyettu are the most popular.\n\nAnother means of representation of the play is indeed the costumes and physical decorations of the actors and the theatre. In dramas, and dance dramas, costume and making are distinguished by the sex, race, sect or class or the social position of the characters, giving the production of the presentation some semblance of reality.\nThe decorations of the stage theatre including lights and accessories are related to the scene of the depiction in which enhances the rasa between the audience and artists also comes under this category.\n\nIn kathakali there are totally different dress and makeup for 4 different characters; the good characters have green makeup while the demons have kati vesham in which the nose is painted red. But in solo dance performances \"aharya abhinaya\" is a convention to it.\n\n\"Sāttvika Abhinaya\" is the mental message, emotion or image communicated with the audience through the performer's own inner emotions. The dancer or actor has to use experience, something authentic, to capture the audience and to elicit an empathetic response.\nThe human activity in other words, is traditionally classified as belonging to the mind, voice and body. Bharatha Muni in Natyashastra mentioned that sathva is something originated in mind\n\nA principal division is that between \"natyadharmi abhinaya\" and \"lokadharmi abhinaya\". The former is poetic and stylistic in nature, following a codified manner of presenting emotion and expression which pertains to the conventions of the stage, which appear to have greater 'artistry' by virtue of taking something from natural life and rendering it in a suitably stylised way. \"Lokadharmi abhinaya\" is the opposite: realistic and un-stylised, involving very natural expression and movement, as occurs in daily life. Often this is the more difficult as the possibilities for interpretation of an emotion or a line of poetry are endless.\n\n"}

With the advent of the internet, blogs and online magazines have proliferated reflecting the community's multitudinous religious, political, and cultural orientations.\n\nThe primary Australian Jewish news source is \"The Australian Jewish News\" (also known as The AJN), a hard copy weekly that also produces a website; owned by Robert Magid and edited by Zeddy Lawrence.\n\nIts major rival is an online news magazine, J-Wire, which publishes similar content. It is owned and operated by Henry Benjamin.\n\nA recent entry into the market is the free monthly hard copy newspaper, \"The Jewish Report\", which bills itself as a tool for fostering social cohesion.'\n\nAlongside zines, and other community newsletters, Melbourne Jewry produced two literary journals, the \"Melbourne Chronicle\", in the 1980s and \"Generation Magazine\". The \"Melbourne Chronicle\" initially produced a companion Yiddish edition; however, like the Australian Jewish News, which also published additional material in Yiddish, the dwindling Yiddish-speaking market proved incapable of supporting it.\n\nAfter \"Generation Magazine\" ceased publication in the 1990s, there was a period in which there was no dedicated publication for Australian Jewish literary expression. In 2009, however, a group of young Jewish writers launched the online magazine, Galus Australis. It billed itself as a pluralist space for the discussion of Jewish Australian ideas and stories, but it ceased publication in 2015.\n\nJewish Women of Words is the newest literary venture in the Australian Jewish media scene.\n\nAustralian Jewry's religious and political diversity is best reflected in its blogs. The conservative collective blog, known as Jews Down Under/ publishes opinion pieces arguing from a right wing Zionist perspective; while the Australian Jewish Democratic Society and +61J publish content more critical of the Israeli government.\n\nNotable individual blogs have similarly provided the community with a platform for expression. The first such blog, in 2009, to be reported in the wider Australian media was The Sensible Jew, written by Alex Fein. It provided controversial critiques of communal politics. Blogs such as Pitputim and The Fifth Chelek, meanwhile, concern themselves more with religious argument.\n\nRadio and television have also provided the Jewish community with a broadcast outlet. The long running TV show, The Shtick, first airing on channel 31 and then moving to YouTube, features stories and segments about Jewish life in Melbourne. Melbourne Jewish Radio has also had a long tradition and the SBS station currently provides a service in Hebrew. The community attained a radio licence in 2011 and established the station, LionFM; however, this was short lived as its license was revoked. In its place is the community run radio organisation, J-Air, which bills itself as, 'the Jewish voice of Melbourne'\n"}

It was only available on 12″. It is Australia's best-selling single ever and was the No. 1 single in Australia in 1983 for eight weeks, seven of them consecutive.\n\nThe single was banned in Victoria for a week, due to the B-side \"The Comedy Commando\". This led to a gap between the record's first number one placing (15 August) and its seven-week run at the number one spot (5 September – 17 October).\n\nThe single was rereleased on CD in 2003 (EMI 7243 5 52755 0 9), containing the A-side and the video for the A-side, but not the original B-side.\n\nThe sketch is built on extensive sets of equivocations that form puns relating to Australian place names and icons, for example:\n\nMy mate, Boomer, rang.

{"id": "261737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261737", "title": "Backyard Basketball", "text": "Backyard Basketball\n\nBackyard Basketball is a series of entries into the \"Backyard Sports\" franchise of video games. The first game was developed by Humongous Entertainment and published by Infogrames Entertainment SA and released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh platforms in 2001. Additional games have been released on a variety of consoles, each sporting different characters and slightly altered gameplay mechanics.\n\nAs with the other entries into the \"Backyard Sports\" franchise, \"Backyard Basketball\" has received notoriety for its inclusion of pro basketball players as playable characters. The first incarnation included Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie. The most recent release includes Stephen Curry as its mascot.\n\n\"Backyard Basketball\" offers two primary modes of gameplay: Single Game, which allows the player to select a team to compete against a computer-controlled team, and Season Play, which allows the player to select a team to compete against a series of computer-controlled teams over an 18-game season, including two best-of-three playoff series and a best-of-five championship series should the player achieve a large number of victories. The Single Game mode also allows the player to compete against a second player or to practice using a single character.\n\nBefore games can occur, the player has the option to modify a variety of settings. These include court selection, A.I. difficulty (easy, medium, or hard), the presence of certain rules (fouls, fatigue, violations, shot control, and power-ups), sound options (game music, background sounds, and in-game dialogue), controls, and team names. Team modification also involves the customization of jerseys.\n\nThe game's controls are set to mouse usage by default, capitalizing on a point & click style of gameplay to move characters around. The game is also compatible with keyboards and game pads.\n\nThe selection of team members follows one of two settings: First Five Picks, which allows each player to select their team members freely, or Full Draft, which forces each player to select their team members one at a time in an alternating fashion. Eachp'otential team member, including younger versions of Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie, is ranked according to five statistics operating on a 1 to 10 scale. These include Inside Shooting (the relative accuracy of the character's shot from inside the three-point line), Outside Shooting (the relative accuracy of the character's shot from beyond the three-point line), Ballhandling (the relative likelihood that the character will not have the ball stolen or blocked on offense), Defense (the relative likelihood that the character will be able to steal or block the ball on defense), and Quickness (the relative speed at which the character moves along the court). Players also have the option to customize rookie characters with either manually chosen or randomly allocated statistics, as well as heights, skin tones, shooting hands, birthdays, and names. Although rookie characters generally have lower overall statistics compared to pre-rendered players, they have the additional ability to increase all of their statistics by three levels should the player's team make the playoffs in Season Play.\n\nGameplay in \"Backyard Basketball\" is set to a point & click control scheme by default. With three characters on the court at one time, the player clicks at various locations on the court to guide the character with the ball to that location. Clicking on a teammate causes the character to pass the ball to that teammate while clicking the basket (indicated by a basketball icon) causes the character to attempt a shot. If shot control is on, then players have the option to make the shooting character pump fake by clicking rapidly, finally shooting the ball when the click is held down. If shot control is off, then the character will automatically release the shot once the basketball icon is clicked.\nOn defense, the player can switch between characters to control by clicking on them as they run about, guiding the chosen character by clicking the location on the court where he or she should go. If an opposing character is clicked when an 'X' symbol hovers by them, the character nearest him or her will attempt to steal the ball. If a pair of hands appears near the basket when an opposing character goes to shoot the ball, the nearest character will attempt to block the shot or rebound the ball.\n\nEach quarter of a game lasts approximately three minutes while each overtime period (if necessary) lasts approximately one minute. The longer characters play without rest, the more tired and prone to mistakes (poor shooting and ball-handling) they will be; as such, substitutions can be made after any completed play or during a time-out. Characters will recover their energy while on the bench (only two players can stay on the bench at a time). Granted, a character's energy will never decrease if the fatigue option is turned off.\n\nOver the course of a game, power-ups may occasionally be rewarded to teams. The majority of these power-ups are useful, such as the flaming ball (which guarantees that the next attempted shot will go in), the tornado (which increases the speed of all characters on the court), the doughnut (which causes the next character who attempts a shot to automatically attempt a slam dunk), and 110% Juice (which provides energy to otherwise tired players if the fatigue option is turned on). However, some power-ups provide detrimental effects, such as the icy ball (which makes shots more likely to miss), the stick of butter (which reduces the team's ball-handling abilities), and the ice cream truck (which prevents the entire team from moving for a brief period of time).\n\n\"Backyard Basketball\" games have been released numerous times to a variety of platforms. In 2001, the first game of the series was released for Windows and Macintosh featuring Kevin Garnett as the game's primary mascot, and Lisa Leslie. In 2004, a game was released for the Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, and PC, featuring Tim Duncan as its primary mascot. The game was released once more in 2007, this time for the Nintendo Gamecube and Nintendo DS as well as the aforementioned systems, featuring Paul Pierce as its primary mascot. The game has most recently been released as a mobile app featuring Stephen Curry as its primary mascot.\n\nBackyard Basketball 2007 is a sports game released late 2006. This is the fifth iteration of the Backyard the game is Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. A planned release for the Nintendo GameCube was cancelled.\n\nIn the United States, the debut version of \"Backyard Basketball\" sold 780,000 copies and earned $13.2 million by August 2006, after its release in October 2001. It was the country's 15th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all \"Backyard Sports\" games released between January 2000 and August 2006, including \"Backyard Basketball\", had reached 5.3 million units in the United States by the latter date.\n\n\"Backyard Basketball\" has received low to mixed reviews throughout its multiple releases. Ivan Sulic of IGN awarded the original version a score of 6.5 out of 10, complimenting the simplistic gameplay and colorful graphics while lamenting the amount of crashes that the game is susceptible to encountering. Chris Adams of IGN awarded the 2007 Nintendo DS version the same score, commenting that the addition of new gameplay modes offered more variety.\n\n"}

The character was a self-proclaimed \"quaffer of culinary consciousness\" and traveled around New York City, mostly in The Bronx, documenting various ethnic cultures and their indigenous cuisines, represented typically by the small food establishments (including restaurants, food trucks, street vendors, and grocery stores) he visits. Baron Ambrosia appeared in Fornal's self-produced video podcast \"Underbelly NYC\", the public-access television cable TV channel BronxNet's \"Bronx Flavor\", and \"The Culinary Adventures of Baron Ambrosia\" on the Cooking Channel. In 2012, Fornal won a New York Emmy (best on-camera talent: performer/narrator) for his portrayal of Baron Ambrosia. Fornal stopped using the character after the feature length film \"BARON AMBROSIA IS DEAD\" to pursue exploration and documentary film-making full time.\n\nThe Baron Ambrosia character first appeared in 2006 in the video podcast \"Underbelly NYC\" which was distributed through Liberated Syndication. The show reached a number #1 ranking under iTunes culinary podcasts. Fornal produced, in total, eight episodes of \"Underbelly NYC\".\n\nIn early 2008, Baron Ambrosia re-emerged in \"Bronx Flavor\" on BronxNet, a Public-access television cable TV channel in Bronx, NY.\n\nBoth series focus on Baron Ambrosia's adventures in food (mostly ethnic cuisines and restaurants that are not covered by mainstream media). \"Bronx Flavor\" focuses strictly on his adventures in the Bronx. In both shows, Baron Ambrosia involves local business owners, diners, and passers-by in comedic sketches. All \"Underbelly NYC\" and \"Bronx Flavor\" episodes are written, directed, and edited by Fornal.\n\nThe show's following stems largely from its balance of education and humor. Each episode typically begins with the Baron describing a particular ethnic community and then focuses on its culinary heritage. The Baron will then hunt it down and get into a comical situation stemming from his obsessive personality and knack for over-indulgence.\n\nIn May 2011 Baron Ambrosia began filming a special for the Cooking Channel entitled \"The Culinary Adventures of Baron Ambrosia.\" Cooking Channel's official description of the project appears on their website…\n\n\"Culinary adventure-seeker Baron Ambrosia faces banishment from his hometown of the Bronx after being accused of pie theft by Grandmaster Mele Mel. Challenged by an athletic duel, he takes to the streets of Newark, NJ in search of the famed Jersey Devil fajitas, said to bring super-human strength to anyone that consumes them. Along the way, he’s distracted by other food delights Newark has to offer including Trinidadian roti, Italian hot dogs and Portuguese dry soup.\"\n\nOn November 6, 2011 \"The Culinary Adventures of Baron Ambrosia\" pilot aired on the Cooking Channel.\n\nOn June 1, 2012 Episode 001\"The Culinary Adventures of Baron Ambrosia\" premiered on the Cooking Channel entitled “The Just Desserts of P.T. Barnum”. \"After finding a treasure map hidden in a haunted carousel, Baron makes his way through Bridgeport, CT in search of P.T. Barnum’s tasty treasure. With circus ghosts close on his heels, Baron explores the world of Peruvian ceviche, enjoys some Haitian oxtail, and catches a ride on a food truck filled with Jamaican jerk chicken.\"\n\nOn November 2, 2013 Ambrosia premiered his first feature-length movie based on the Bronx Flavor series, \"Baron Ambrosia is Dead\". The movie screened on the lawn at the Andrew Freedman Mansion on the Grand Concourse and was free for the community.\n\nOn October 5, 2014, Ambrosia appeared and served as consulting producer on Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown episode on the Bronx. Bourdain referred to Ambrosia as, “an evangelist for introducing the manifold splendiferous delights of his mighty borough to the ignorant. He has a show on the TV, and throws parties where he serves creatures that would make Andrew Zimmern turn gray and slump unconscious to the floor. A showman, iconoclast, explorer, and gourmet.” \n\nOn July 27, 2008 Baron Ambrosia appeared in The Bronx's Dominican Day Parade in his purple roadster the P-Rex to publicize the show.\n\nIn February 2009, \"Bronx Flavor\" received a New York Emmy Awards nomination.\n\nBaron Ambrosia appeared on the May 27, 2009 episode of Cash Cab, after two strikes Ambrosia won $800 on the \"Double or Nothing\" bonus question.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported on Baron Ambrosia, \"Underbelly NYC\", and \"Bronx Flavor\" on July 22, 2009, describing the current show this way: \"flashy production numbers aside, at bottom \"Bronx Flavor\" is an effort to educate and entertain without pretension.\"\n\nBaron Ambrosia appeared as a featured speaker at the National Association of Broadcasters Sony Software User's Event on April 12, 2010. Also in 2010, Sony used Baron Ambrosia to promote its Vegas Pro suite of video editing software.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported on May 5, 2010 that \"NYC Life will show the third season of \"Bronx Flavor\" on Wednesdays at 9 ... [after this, the] Baron will re-emerge with a new show, tentatively titled \"Spice Hunter NYC\", which will allow him to tour all five boroughs in search of exotic flavors and crazier story lines.\"\"\n\nOn Wednesday May 12, 2010, with BronxNet's consent, \"Bronx Flavor\" Season 3 was rebroadcast on NYC Life (a component of NYC Media). NYC Life reaches all five boroughs as well as parts of Connecticut and New Jersey. As part of the campaign, NYC Life put Baron Ambrosia's face (along with other show hosts) on 103 New York City bus shelters. Footage from the show is also included in a preview reel of the network's new programming on small monitors in 13,000 taxicabs.\n\nOn May 14, 2010, \"The New York Times\" critic Ariel Kaminer reviewed \"Bronx Flavor\" saying, \"In its own bizarre way, the show’s humor is as unpredictable, and as specific to its time and place, as Monty Python was to Oxbridge of the late 1960s (fewer references to Proust, and more to bikini waxing).\"\"\n\nOn November 19, 2010 Baron Ambrosia started a \"Stomp Out Domestic Violence\" campaign by releasing a Public Service Announcement.\n\nOn December 12, 2010 Baron Ambrosia received a proclamation from Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. proclaiming him the official culinary ambassador to the Bronx.\n\nOn December 30, 2010 BronxNet premiered the first episode of 'Bronx Flavor Season 4' at the Paradise Theater on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. After the screening Grandmaster Mele Mel performed.\n\nFebruary 17, 2011 Bronx Flavor received its second New York Emmy Nomination.\n\nIn March 2011, Baron Ambrosia was funded by Sony Software to travel to Port-au-Prince, Haiti where he filmed the finale for Season 4. While in Haiti Ambrosia visited \"Le Ciné Institute\" in Jacmel and taught students how to edit with Vegas Pro Software. The story was documented in a project entitled \"Giving Voices\".\n\nOn October 14, 2011 was elected to be a member of The Explorers Club.\n\nOn November 6, 2011 Baron Ambrosia received a proclamation from Newark Mayor Corey Booker proclaiming him a culinary ambassador to the city of Newark.\n\nOn April 1, 2012, Justin Fornal won the New York Emmy for \"On-camera talent: Performer/narrator\" for his portrayal of Baron Ambrosia.\n\nOn June 2, 2012 Mayor Bill Finch of Bridgeport, Connecticut officially proclaimed June 2 \"Baron Ambrosia Day\".\n\nOn June 12, 2012 a 20X80 foot billboard advertising \"The Culinary Adventures of Baron Ambrosia\" went up on the neon 'Welcome to the Bronx' sign on the Bruckner Expressway where the RFK Bridge enters the Bronx.\n\nBaron Ambrosia is the President of the Bronx Pipe Smoking Society which holds an annual small game dinner in the Bronx. Dishes served have included raccoon, porcupine, bobcat, coyote, skunk & beaver castor schnapps. All the meat is captured in the wilds of the Adirondack Mountains and is prepared by a team of chefs selected by Ambrosia. The events are invite only and are designed to introduce alternative protein sources as well as celebrate native eating traditions. The first dinner was held at the abandoned Bronx County Courthouse January 29, 2011. The 2nd annual dinner was held at the Latvian Society's Daugavas Vanagi House February 11, 2012 The third annual dinner was held at the Andrew Freedman Home March 3, 2013 \n\nOn July 27, 2013 Baron Ambrosia became the first person in recorded history to swim the length of the Bronx using the Bronx River.

The swim was done to protest street violence and showcase the positive attributes of Camden. A lawyer representing Camden County threatened to have Ambrosia arrested if he attempted the swim on the planned date of October 11. Baron swam under cover of night to avoid detection by law enforcement.\n\n1.

{"id": "21858666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21858666", "title": "Beam-index tube", "text": "Beam-index tube\n\nThe beam-index tube is a color television cathode ray tube (CRT) design, using phosphor stripes and active-feedback timing, rather than phosphor dots and a beam-shadowing mask as developed by RCA. Beam indexing offered much brighter pictures than shadow-mask CRTs, reducing power consumption, and as they used a single a electron gun rather than three, they were easier to build and keep in alignment.\n\nPhilco led development of the beam-indexing concept in a series of developments they called the Apple tube. In spite of lengthy development, they were never able to manufacture a cost-competitive indexing tube, and eventually abandoned the concept. The major problem was the cost of the indexing electronics, which in later modems required an expensive photomultiplier tube.\n\nNew detectors and transistor-based electronics led to the system being re-introduced as the Uniray in the 1970s. It was highly competitive in price terms, but competing against greatly improved shadow mask designs and the new Trinitron. Several Japanese companies used the Uniray for a variety of specialist purposes, the best-known being the Sony Indextron series. The system also saw some military use, due to its low sensitivity to magnetic interference.\n\nIn conventional black and white (B&W) televisions, the CRT screen has a uniform coating of phosphor that emits white light when struck by electrons. The beam from an electron gun at the back of the tube is deflected (most commonly) by the varying fields from magnetic coils so it may be directed at any point on the screen. Electronic circuits known as time base generators pull the beam across the tube and down, creating the scanning pattern used in television signals. An amplitude modulated signal is used to control the acceleration of the beam, controlling the brightness as it is pulled across the screen.\n\nColor televisions are based on using phosphors of the three additive primary colors (red, green and blue, RGB). In order to produce reasonable resolution similar to that of a black and white set, the phosphors have to be deposited in very small dots or stripes. An electron gun at the back of the tube cannot be focused tightly enough to hit only a single phosphor color if that phosphor is as small as desired. Some secondary system needs to be used to refocus the beam.\n\nRCA ultimately solved this problem with a shadow mask. In this system three separate electron guns are each aimed from different directions at a spot just behind the screen. There, a metal plate with very small holes is used to refocus the beam. Because the beams hit the plate at different incoming angles, they separate again on the far side of the plate, hitting the individual dots of color phosphor. The downside to this approach is that the plate also cuts off the majority of the beam, as much as 85% of it, leading to low image brightness. Much effort was put into developing alternate ways of directing the electron beams to the correct phosphor that would not block as much of the beams.\n\nA number of solutions were attempted that used a single electron gun and some sort of electrical or magnetic field very close to the screen to provide the same result as the shadow mask. RCA worked on a system with charged wires that pulled the beams slightly toward them, with stripes of colored phosphors above them. The problem was that the wires had to be placed very close to each other to provide the required resolution, while also being powered with high voltages to provide enough deflection, which made it very difficult to keep the signals from leaking from wire to wire. Development was abandoned when the shadow mask proved successful.\n\nErnest Lawrence developed a similar system known as Chromatron that used a grid of fine wires behind the screen to electrically deflect the beam, but it suffered from the same basic problem as RCA's approach. In spite of years of development, no one was able to produce a commercially viable version. Sony's failed attempt to produce a practical Chromatron inspired the development of their Trinitron aperture grille system.\n\nSingle-gun systems like the Chromatron create color by varying the intensity of the beam to adjust the brightness for each color component, and then using a second system to ensure that instantaneous signal ends up on the correct phosphor. The beam-index tube uses an alternate solution which allows the beam to scan normally as in a black and white television with no secondary focussing system, and instead rapidly varies the intensity of the beam when it knows it is over the correct color. To do this, the tube requires some way to accurately time the beam's passage along the tube, with enough accuracy to ensure the proper color is hit.\n\nPhilco's approach to the problem of properly indexing the beam in relation to the phosphors relied on the process of secondary emission, where high-speed electrons will entrain electrons from a surrounding material, creating a pulse of additional current. Unlike the shadow mask, where small dots of phosphor are used, the apple tube used vertical stripes of color patterned across the tube. The most basic indexing concept uses a fourth stripe of phosphor between adjacent RGB stripes that gives off light that cannot be seen by the eye, but can be seen by electronics within the television.\n\nSeveral different arrangements of components, materials and electronics were used while researching this approach during a ten-year development period, during most of which time it was kept secret. The most common system, first publicly demonstrated in 1956, used stripes of magnesium oxide deposited on the back of aluminum as the indexing system. In order to ensure the electronics had enough time to respond to the indexing signal and adjust the color, a separate \"pilot beam\" was generated from the gun and positioned to lead the main \"writing beam\" by a small distance within the tube. When the indexing beam hit the magnesium oxide, a shower of electrons was given off, which were collected by a conductive coating of carbon deposited on the inside of the tube. The low power pilot beam had just enough power to dimly light the tube to a just-visible even background intensity.\n\nSince both the pilot and writing beams hit the index stripes, two signals would be generated as the beams swept across the tube. In order to distinguish between them, the pilot beam was modulated with a varying signal timed so that it was at maximum power only when it would be in the approximate location of the index stripes. The frequency of the modulating signal was a function of the tube geometry; on a 21\" inch tube the index stripes were positioned 0.51 inches apart, a single horizontal sweep takes about 53 microseconds, so the signal had to be modulated at 7.4 MHz.\n\nThe original modulating signal was then compared with the amplified return signal from the secondary emission process, producing a net output that varied in phase by the difference in position between the estimated and real position of the beam. This phase signal was then sent into the conventional color decoder, adjusting the chroma on the fly. The writing beam, positioned to sweep the spaces between the indexes while the pilot beam was on them, received the chroma signal so that its power was modulated to produce the correct amounts of color when it was on top of those stripes. By the time it reached the index stripe the pilot's modulating signal would be at its minimum, and the strong signal given off by the writing beam would simply be ignored.\n\nIn order to ensure the positioning of the pilot and writing beams remained as constant as possible, the apple tube used a unique electron gun arrangement. The beams were produced from a single anode and two closely spaced cathodes, resulting in the beams traveling in slightly different directions. They were then magnetically focused so they crossed at a point just in front of the electron guns, where a single-slit aperture was used to clear up the signal to produce a sharp-edged elliptical beam pattern. The deflection coils were positioned around the aperture, so by having both beams pass by the deflection coils while superimposed, the deflection of both was equal. The beams then spread out again on the far side of the aperture, where a second focussing arrangement ensured both were traveling parallel to each other.\n\nThe electrons emitted from the index stripes were low-power, and thus traveled at low speed to the pickup point at a \"button\" on the rear of the tube. Since the travel time was a significant factor, the timing of the phase comparison had to be adjusted as the beam swept the face of the tube – at the sides of the tube the electrons were close to the tube pickup, but when the beams were in the middle of the tube they had a longer distance to travel. Additional timing circuitry was needed to account for this.\n\nActually building the apple tube's electronics proved to be difficult. The fast response needed to adjust the color signal based on the index was difficult to build using the tube-based electronics of the era, and the apple tube's electronics chassis was thus much more expensive than conventional shadow mask sets. Their demonstration unit had eight more tubes than a similar shadow mask system, which at that time represented a significant cost. Additionally, the secondary emission did not provide a sharp signal, and crosstalk between the pilot and writing beams was always a problem.\n\nAnother solution to the indexing problem was introduced by David Goodman of New York University. He replaced the electron emitter of the Philco design with a new material that gave off x-rays. These were received by scintillators at the back of the tube, beside the guns. As the light speed was independent of power and essentially instant compared to the timing needed for the indexing, the new design allowed the elimination of the complex timing circuitry of the original design.\n\nGiven all of the problems that the apple tube was having, Philco engineers adopted the design as the \"advanced apple\" tube. Their version used a new material that gave off ultraviolet light in place of the x-rays, and replaced the scintillators with a single photomultiplier tube. The flashes of light given off by the index stripes were amplified by the photomultiplier and then sent into the color decoder as normal. Delays in the timing circuitry itself were taken care of by slightly adjusting the position of the index stripes on the tube. This eliminated much of the circuitry associated with the index timing, and led to a lower-cost chassis.\n\nHowever, it also introduced the photomultiplier, a complex tube of its own that was at that time still in its developmental infancy and relatively expensive. After some development the company was able to reliably produce advanced apple systems, but the cost of production was too high at about $75 per tube ($ today) and tooling at $15 million ($ million today) made the system unattractive.\n\nDevelopment of the system was also picked up by Sylvania and Thorn Electrical Industries in the UK, who published details on what they called the \"Zebra tube\" in 1961. They were apparently successful in their work, but as no color television standard effort was making headway in Britain at the time, no commercial versions were forthcoming from this development either.\n\nAfter Philco gave up on the apple system, the rights were purchased by one of the engineers, David Sunstein. After many years he re-introduced the advanced apple design as the Uniray. The introduction of low-cost photodiodes dramatically changed the complexity and cost equations of the advanced apple indexing system, and the introduction of all-in-one timing systems implemented as integrated circuits did the same on the chassis side of the system. What was once a useful but impractical device became cost effective by the early 1970s.\n\nSunstein produced a prototype Uniray system using an original Philco tube and new electronics, and started shopping the concept around in 1972. There was some effort to license the system to Japanese companies, most of whom had licensed the shadow mask from RCA and were facing stiff competition from Sony's newly introduced Trinitron system. Several companies started development of Uniray-based televisions in the later 1970s, and several different products were introduced in the 1980s.\n\nSince the beam indexing adjusted the beam position as the beam was scanning across the tube, external magnetic fields had little effect on the image. This made the system particularly useful for avionics displays where the systems were subject to heavy interference from surrounding equipment. Rockwell International received a patent in 1978 on this use. Ferranti in the UK also offered a 4 by 3 inch beam-index tube as the mapping display in the Panavia Tornado mid-life upgrade.\n\nHitachi started development of the advanced apple system for television use, but instead used it for much more limited applications. The only widespread use was in the color viewfinders of handheld video tape recorders, first introduced in 1983 in a 1½ inch form. The rejection of interference from the nearby rotating magnetic recording head made a color viewfinder practical. The single gun and brighter images for any given gun power levels also meant that the indexed display was much more power efficient than conventional systems, allowing it to be used in battery powered applications.\n\nSony also did some development with the Uniray concept, introducing a range of products under the \"Indextron\" trade name. Their first product was the FP-62 \"Vidimagic\" projection television system. The Indextron tube was so bright that it could directly project an enlarged image in a front projection television without the need for three separate tubes, eliminating convergence problems. A second version with built-in Betamax VCR was sold as the PF-60. A better-known application was the KVX-370, a 4-inch \"bedside\" television with a built-in alarm clock and radio.\n\nSanyo used the bright images to make a new style of tube they called the \"lollipop\". It used an electron gun arranged at right angles to the display, extending down instead of to the rear. Magnetic focussing in such a geometry would be hard to achieve so the system was naturally suited to the Uniray concept. The result was a 3-inch display only 1½ inches deep, although it was several inches long. They demonstrated the system in a small television similar to the Sony Indextron.\n\nThe optically indexed tube displayed images by lighting vertical stripes of colored phosphor arranged in a red-green-blue pattern. A single electron gun was used to paint the stripes, and the beam strength is modulated in order to produce different colors.\n\nEach RGB pattern was followed by a single stripe of UV phosphor on the inside face of the tube, where the light was not visible to the viewer. Light given off by this stripe was captured by a photomultiplier tube on the outside of the tube that was positioned over a clear window in the tube surface. The signal from the photomultiplier was amplified and sent into the color decoder circuit.\n\nThe color decoder electrically subtracted the signal from the photomultiplier from the existing color burst signal. This resulted in a phase difference that advanced or retarded the modulation of the single beam. This way even if the beam was advancing too fast or too slow, the index system would adjust the timing on the fly to ensure proper colors were produced. In order to receive a signal strong enough to index with, the beam had to be left on at all times, which reduced contrast ratio in relation to conventional tubes.\n\nThe beam-index tube bears some resemblance to two other types of television tubes which also used vertical stripes of colored phosphor instead of dots or grids. The Chromatron used two sets of fine wires suspended behind the display area to electrically focus its single beam, one set of wires pulling the beam towards the red side and the other towards the blue. The grids were aligned so the beam would normally focus onto the green stripe in the middle, but by varying the relative voltage between the two the beam could accurately hit the colored stripes. In practice the wires were difficult to keep aligned with the phosphors, and gave off electrical noise that interfered with the radio receivers in a television application. It saw some use in military settings, including some commercial television use in the Yaou, Sony 19C 70 and the Sony KV 7010U.\n\nThe other similar design is the Trinitron, which combined the vertical stripes of the beam-index and Chromatron tubes with a new single-gun three-beam cathode and an aperture grille instead of a shadow mask. The result was a design with the mechanical simplicity of the shadow mask design and the bright images of the beam-index system. Trinitron was a major product for Sony for several decades, representing the high-point of conventional color TV displays until the widespread introduction of plasma displays and LCD televisions in the 21st century.\n\n"}

With the new public interest in puppetry, both in America and worldwide, Christians began to see the potential in this art form.\n\nBeginning then and continuing to this day, churches in nearly every Christian denomination have started small puppet groups. Usually such groups' purpose is to serve their own children's ministry programs, but some reach outside their own walls, performing for other churches or secular venues. Some teams travel internationally to third-world countries, where children and adults have neither experienced this kind of entertainment, nor heard about Jesus Christ.\n\nChristian puppetry has grown so large that thousands of performers gather yearly at festivals to showcase, share, and learn more about their art form. One of the largest Christian puppet supplies distributors, \"One Way Street\", hosts regional festivals to serve church teams, as well as a worldwide festival (I-Fest), lasting an entire week. In 2006, Atlanta puppeteer Raymond Carr dramatized a humorous take on his background in Christian puppetry in the performance \"A Sunday Morning Puppet Show\" at the Center for Puppetry Arts.

The idea of controlling what the audience sees is a major responsibility of any puppeteer, and blacklight has provided a new way of accomplishing it.\n\nDowel rod puppetry combines interpretive dance and the use of (typically) two simple dowels.

However, it may also refer to films made \"about\" New Zealand by filmmakers from other countries. Due to the comparatively small size of its film industry, New Zealand produces many films that are co-financed by overseas companies.\n\nThe history of cinema in New Zealand is almost as long as the medium itself. The first public screening of a motion picture took place in 1896. A documentary made in 1900 is the oldest surviving New Zealand film, while the first feature film made in New Zealand premiered in 1914. A small-scale industry developed between the 1920s and the 1960s, but it wasn't until the 1970s that locally made films began to attract significant audiences.\n\nFrom the 1990s onward, New Zealand-made films have increasingly found international success, including both those with local funding and themes, and overseas ventures such as \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, which was made largely with funding from Hollywood.\n\nIn October 1978, the New Zealand Film Commission was formalised by Parliament under the Third National Government.\n\nUnder Section 17 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978, the functions of the Commission are to:\n\nWith this Act, the New Zealand film industry became more stabilised. Section 18 of the Act, entitled \"Content of Films\", defines what makes \"a New Zealand film\". To qualify, a film must have \"significant New Zealand content\", judged by taking into account the following:\n\nThese defining aspects have in recent years caused debate on whether films like \"The Frighteners\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" qualify as New Zealand films. The impact of the New Zealand Film Commission upon the industry was significant in getting films made, coming to a definition of NZ Film, and helping establish a Screen Industry in New Zealand.\n\nMost New Zealand films are made by independent filmmakers, often on a low budget and with sponsorship from public funding sources. Few New Zealand-made films have been specifically commissioned for the international market by international film distributors.\n\nRecently, international film companies have become more aware of the skills of New Zealand filmmakers, and have increasingly used the country as a shooting location and also somewhere to finish production of their feature films.\n\nPrivate funding for New Zealand films has often been in short supply, although for a period in the early 1980s, tax breaks resulted in a production boom. Although the trend seems to be changing for the better, some New Zealand directors and actors have been ignored in large part by their own country, despite success overseas, and often had to work in the US, Australia, and the UK as a result.\n\nThe first public screening of a motion picture in New Zealand took place on October 13, 1896 at the Opera House in Auckland. The screening—which was in fact a demonstration of Thomas Edison's kinetograph—was part of a show presented by Charles Godfrey’s Vaudeville Company. The first screening of a colour film—one using a colour process, not just a colourised black-and-white film—was on December 24, 1911 in Auckland. The film was shown simultaneously at the Globe Picture Theatre in Queen Street and the Kings Theatre on Upper Pitt Street (now the Mercury Theatre).\n\nThe first filmmaker in New Zealand was Alfred Whitehouse, who made ten films between 1898 and mid-1900. The oldest surviving New Zealand film is Whitehouse's \"The Departure of the Second Contingent for the Boer War\" (1900).\n\nThe first feature film made in New Zealand is arguably \"Hinemoa\". It premiered on August 17, 1914 at the Lyric Theatre, Auckland.\n\nNew Zealand's oldest surviving cinema is the Roxburgh, located in Central Otago. It was opened on December 11, 1897. The editors of the local newspaper, the \"Mt. Berenger Mail\", wrote in the issue of December 10: \"We would draw the attention of the public to the Salon Cinématographe entertainment in the Athenӕum Hall to-morrow evening. This is an opportunity which should not be missed of witnessing life scenes.\"\n\nNew Zealand's was a small-scale film industry between the 1920s and 1960s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Rudall Hayward made a number of feature films on New Zealand themes. \"Rewi's Last Stand\" was probably his best, but little of this 1925 film survives. The film was remade with sound in 1940. Independent filmmaker John O'Shea was active from 1940 to 1970 making New Zealand cinema; his company Pacific Films produced numerous short films as well as the three New Zealand feature films made in that period: \"Broken Barrier\" (1952) with Roger Mirams; \"Runaway\" (1964); and \"Don't Let It Get You\" (1966).\n\nHowever, most New Zealand-made films of the period were documentaries. The National Film Unit was a government-funded producer of short films, documentaries, and publicity material. \"This is New Zealand\", a short film made for the World Expo in 1970, was extremely popular there and subsequently screened in New Zealand cinemas, garnering considerable acclaim. It used three separate projectors to create a wide-screen image. The film was restored in 2006 and shown at the 2007 New Zealand International Film Festivals.\n\nIn 1978, the New Zealand Film Commission was established. Its aim was to ecourage and promote the national film industry, and a number of film projects have been funded by the commission.\n\nOne of the first New Zealand films to attract large-scale audiences at home was \"Sleeping Dogs\", directed by Roger Donaldson in 1977. The film, a dark, political action thriller that portrays the reaction of one man to the formation of a totalitarian government and the ensuing guerrilla war, introduced Sam Neill as a leading actor. The imagery of large-scale civil conflict and government repression would be realised only a few years later when the 1981 Springbok Tour caused nationwide protests and clashes with police.\n\n\"Sleeping Dogs\" is also notable as the first full-length 35mm feature film made entirely by a New Zealand production crew. Before then, films such as 1973's \"Rangi's Catch\" had been shot in New Zealand, where they were set, but were produced and directed by foreign crews.\n\n1981 saw the release of the road film \"Goodbye Pork Pie\", which made NZ$1.5 million. Director Geoff Murphy was lured away by Hollywood, but he made two other key New Zealand films: \"Utu\" (1983), about the land wars of the 1860s, and a nuclear-apocalypse science-fiction story, \"The Quiet Earth\" (1985). Bruno Lawrence, who appeared in both films, became a star.\n\nMelanie Read was the first woman to write and direct a New Zealand feature film with the 1984 thriller \"Trial Run\". In 1987 Barry Barclay's film \"Ngati\", screenplay by Tama Poata and starring veteran actor Wi Kuki Kaa, was released to critical acclaim and some box-office success. \"Ngati\" is recognised as the first feature film to be written and directed by a person of Māori descent.\n\nMerata Mita was the first Māori woman to write and direct a dramatic feature film, when she directed \"Mauri\" in 1988. An accomplished documentary film-maker, Mita made landmark documentaries including \"Bastion Point: Day 507\" (1980), about the occupation of land there, and \"Patu!\" (1983), a film about the controversial and violent anti-apartheid protests during the 1981 Springboks rugby tour from South Africa.\n\nThe late 1980s saw the reinvention of the New Zealand short film, beginning with Alison Maclean's \"Kitchen Sink\". Instead of trying to be short features focused on dialogue and character, the new shorts tried instead to \"push the envelope\" in terms of visual design and cinematic grammar. An explosion of visually rich and compelling works emerged that seemed to have more in common with European art-house cinema than Hollywood.\n\nKey examples of these are: \"The Lounge Bar\" (The Front Lawn), \"Kitchen Sink\" (Alison Maclean), (Simon Perkins; Paul Swadel), \"Stroke\" (Christine Jeffs), \"La Vie en Rose\" (Anna Reeves), \"A Game With No Rules\" (Scott Reynolds), \"Eau de la vie\" (Simon Baré), \"O Tamaiti (The Children)\" (Sima Urale)—which won the Silver Lion Best Short Film at the Venice Film Festival—and \"Two Cars, One Night\" (Taika Waititi), which was nominated for the Best Short Film Oscar.\n\nThe early 1990s saw New Zealand film gain international recognition, most obviously with Jane Campion's \"The Piano\" (1993), which won three Academy Awards. Peter Jackson's \"Heavenly Creatures\" (1994) and Lee Tamahori's \"Once Were Warriors\" also received international acclaim and high grosses in a number of countries. \"The Piano\" and \"Heavenly Creatures\" showed an increasing tendency for New Zealand films to be partially or completely funded by overseas production companies, and star non-local actors (for example, Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel in \"The Piano\", and Kate Winslet in \"Heavenly Creatures\"). This did not stop the migration of New Zealand talent to the United States: Tamahori, Melanie Lynskey of \"Heavenly Creatures\" and Canadian-born \"Piano\" star Anna Paquin are now all primarily based in America.\n\nA notable exception to the migration tendency is Peter Jackson, who has continued to make films in New Zealand. Jackson's career began with low-budget comedies such as \"Bad Taste\" (1987) and \"Meet the Feebles\" (1989). He was eventually noticed by Hollywood, and in the 2000s directed \"The Lord of the Rings\" series. Although made with mainly foreign funding (helped by a tax break from the New Zealand government) and featuring a primarily international cast, Jackson filmed the movies in New Zealand, using a largely Kiwi production crew, helping create an enormous skill base in the New Zealand film industry.\n\nThis has led to a number of prominent Hollywood films being made in New Zealand, with major international productions not only filming there but also using the country's various post-production facilities and special effects companies. Among these films are \"The Last Samurai\" and \"\". While the funding for these movies has come largely from the United States, the trend has helped New Zealand film studios and filmmakers develop skills and improve facilities.\nHowever, some industry figures claim that having large international productions employ New Zealand crews has its downside. One New Zealand filmmaker recently complanied that it has become difficult to employ cameramen on a low-budget New Zealand film, as cameramen are now used to large wages. Other filmmakers find that the opposite is true, and argue that the greater number of local professionals may actually have driven wages down from the relative heights of the 1980s. Another alleged downside is that big-budget international productions swallow up any funding New Zealand has available, making it far more difficult for local productions to get made. \n\nDespite this, the amount of local content has significantly increased, with \"Whale Rider\" (2002) becoming the second-highest-grossing North American independent film of 2003 and third-highest worldwide, earning $40.1 million. Other notable films include \"In My Father's Den\" (2004) and \"The World's Fastest Indian\" (2005). Both films did well at the New Zealand box office, with the latter beating \"Once Were Warriors\" to become the highest-grossing New Zealand film at the domestic box office, earning over 6.5 million—a record beaten by \"Boy\" in 2010\".\"\n\nSam Neill and Judy Rymer's \"Cinema of Unease\" was made in 1995. It is seen as an accessible and important history of New Zealand cinema.\n\nThe latter part of the first decade of the new century saw the expansion of Peter Jackson's filmmaking empire, with the producer-director optioning the rights to \"The Lovely Bones\", \"Halo\", \"The Dam Busters\" and the fantasy series \"Temeraire\". Major productions such as \"Avatar\" and the 2007 blockbuster \"\" used Jackson's Wellington studios and the services of the special-effects company Weta Digital.\n\n\"Eagle vs Shark\" (2007) was director Taika Waititi's first feature film, starring Jemaine Clement and Loren Horsley. The film earned over at the box office. Waititi's film \"Boy\", released in 2010, topped the box office receipts for the opening week, earning more on its opening day than any previous locally made film, becoming the highest-grossing New Zealand film of all time. In 2014 the mockumentary \"What We Do in the Shadows\", directed by Waititi and Clement, was released to substantial critical acclaim. Two years later, Waititi released \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople,\" starring Sam Neill and Julian Dennison, a film that became the new highest-grossing opening weekend box office New Zealand film on home soil, beating the record set by \"Boy\" six years prior.\n\n\"The Ground We Won\" is a 2015 slice-of-life film following a rural rugby team through the triumphs and challenges of their season.\n\nThe New Zealand Film Archive was founded and incorporated on March 9, 1981. Film enthusiast, critic and historian Jonathan Dennis (19532002) was a driving force behind the archive, and became its first director. The archive was set up to preserve and restore significant New Zealand film and television images. It now holds a collection of much of early New Zealand cinema film and holds public screenings of its collection.\n\nMuch of the early cinema film made in New Zealand has been lost, as it was printed on nitrate, which is unstable. In 1992, when film enthusiasts and the New Zealand Film Archive realised how much of New Zealand's film heritage was being lost, they mounted the \"Last Film Search\" and found 7,000 significant films, both in New Zealand and around the world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5704", "title": "Comic strip", "text": "Comic strip\n\nA comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as webcomics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in South Korea alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.\n\nStrips are written and drawn by a comics artist or cartoonist. As the name implies, comic strips can be humorous (for example, \"gag-a-day\" strips such as \"Blondie\", \"Bringing Up Father\", \"Marmaduke\", and \"Pearls Before Swine\").\nStarting in the late 1920s, comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories, as seen in \"Popeye\", \"Captain Easy\", \"Buck Rogers\", \"Tarzan\", and \"The Adventures of Tintin\". Soap-opera continuity strips such as \"Judge Parker\" and \"Mary Worth\" gained popularity in the 1940s. All are called, generically, comic strips, though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that \"sequential art\" would be a better genre-neutral name.\n\nIn the UK and the rest of Europe, comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines, with a strip's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more. Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as \"Liberty\" and \"Boys' Life\" and also on the front covers of magazines, such as the \"Flossy Frills\" series on \"The American Weekly\" Sunday newspaper supplement.\n\nStorytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history. One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry. Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England, where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced. William Hogarth's 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences, such as \"A Rake's Progress\", and single panels.\n\nThe \"Biblia pauperum\" (\"Paupers' Bible\"), a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages, sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths—which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips.\n\nIn China, with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image, experiments with what became \"lianhuanhua\" date back to 1884.\n\nThe first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century. \"The Yellow Kid\" is usually credited as one of the first newspaper strips. However, the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip.\n\nSwiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe Töpffer (Geneva, 1799–1846) is considered the father of the modern comic strips. His illustrated stories such as \"Histoire de M. Vieux Bois\" (1827), first published in the USA in 1842 as \"The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck\" or \"Histoire de Monsieur Jabot\" (1831), inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists. In 1865, German painter, author, and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip \"Max and Moritz\", about two trouble-making boys, which had a direct influence on the American comic strip. \"Max and Moritz\" was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children's stories such as \"Struwwelpeter\" (\"Shockheaded Peter\"); in one, the boys, after perpetrating some mischief, are tossed into a sack of grain, run through a mill, and consumed by a flock of geese. \"Max and Moritz\" provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks, who created the \"Katzenjammer Kids\" in 1897. Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain, sawing logs for snoring, speech balloons, and thought balloons originated in Dirks' strip.\n\nHugely popular, \"Katzenjammer Kids\" occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium. When Dirks left William Randolph Hearst for the promise of a better salary under Joseph Pulitzer, it was an unusual move, since cartoonists regularly deserted Pulitzer for Hearst. In a highly unusual court decision, Hearst retained the rights to the name \"Katzenjammer Kids\", while creator Dirks retained the rights to the characters. Hearst promptly hired Harold Knerr to draw his own version of the strip. Dirks renamed his version \"Hans and Fritz\" (later, \"The Captain and the Kids\"). Thus, two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the comics pages for decades. Dirks' version, eventually distributed by United Feature Syndicate, ran until 1979.\n\nIn the United States, the great popularity of comics sprang from the . \"The Little Bears\" (1893–96) was the first American comic strip with recurring characters, while the first color comic supplement was published by the \"Chicago Inter-Ocean\" sometime in the latter half of 1892, followed by the \"New York Journal\"'s first color Sunday comic pages in 1897. On January 31, 1912, Hearst introduced the nation's first full daily comic page in his \"New York Evening Journal\". The history of this newspaper rivalry and the rapid appearance of comic strips in most major American newspapers is discussed by Ian Gordon. Numerous events in newspaper comic strips have reverberated throughout society at large, though few of these events occurred in recent years, owing mainly to the declining role of the newspaper comic strip as an entertainment form.\n\nThe longest-running American comic strips are:\n\nMost newspaper comic strips are syndicated; a syndicate hires people to write and draw a strip and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee. Some newspaper strips begin or remain exclusive to one newspaper. For example, the \"Pogo\" comic strip by Walt Kelly originally appeared only in the \"New York Star\" in 1948 and was not picked up for syndication until the following year.\n\nNewspaper comic strips come in two different types: daily strips and Sunday strips. In the United States, a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays, Monday through Saturday, as contrasted with a Sunday strip, which typically only appears on Sundays. Daily strips usually are printed in black and white, and Sunday strips are usually in color. However, a few newspapers have published daily strips in color, and some newspapers have published Sunday strips in black and white.\n\nThe popularity and accessibility of strips meant they were often clipped and saved; authors including John Updike and Ray Bradbury have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips. Often posted on bulletin boards, clipped strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed, photocopied or mailed. The \"Baltimore Sun\"'s Linda White recalled, \"I followed the adventures of \"Winnie Winkle\", \"Moon Mullins\" and \"Dondi\", and waited each fall to see how Lucy would manage to trick Charlie Brown into trying to kick that football. (After I left for college, my father would clip out that strip each year and send it to me just to make sure I didn’t miss it.)\"\n\nThe two conventional formats for newspaper comics are strips and single gag panels. The strips are usually displayed horizontally, wider than they are tall. Single panels are square, circular or taller than they are wide. Strips usually, but not always, are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from panel to panel. A horizontal strip can also be used for a single panel with a single gag, as seen occasionally in Mike Peters' \"Mother Goose and Grimm\".\n\nEarly daily strips were large, often running the entire width of the newspaper, and were sometimes three or more inches high. Initially, a newspaper page included only a single daily strip, usually either at the top or the bottom of the page. By the 1920s, many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together. During the 1930s, the original art for a daily strip could be drawn as large as 25 inches wide by six inches high. Over decades, the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller, until by 2000, four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip. As strips have become smaller, the number of panels have been reduced.\n\nProof sheets were the means by which syndicates provided newspapers with black-and-white line art for the reproduction of strips (which they arranged to have colored in the case of Sunday strips). Michigan State University Comic Art Collection librarian Randy Scott describes these as \"large sheets of paper on which newspaper comics have traditionally been distributed to subscribing newspapers. Typically each sheet will have either six daily strips of a given title or one Sunday strip. Thus, a week of \"Beetle Bailey\" would arrive at the \"Lansing State Journal\" in two sheets, printed much larger than the final version and ready to be cut apart and fitted into the local comics page.\" Comic strip historian Allan Holtz described how strips were provided as mats (the plastic or cardboard trays in which molten metal is poured to make plates) or even plates ready to be put directly on the printing press. He also notes that with electronic means of distribution becoming more prevalent printed sheets \"are definitely on their way out.\"\n\nNEA Syndicate experimented briefly with a two-tier daily strip, \"Star Hawks\", but after a few years, \"Star Hawks\" dropped down to a single tier.\n\nIn Flanders, the two-tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily strips like \"Spike and Suzy\" and \"Nero\". They appear Monday through Saturday; until 2003 there were no Sunday papers in Flanders. In the last decades, they have switched from black and white to color.\n\nSingle panels usually, but not always, are not broken up and lack continuity. The daily \"Peanuts\" is a strip, and the daily \"Dennis the Menace\" is a single panel. J. R. Williams' long-run \"Out Our Way\" continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip, \"Out Our Way with the Willets\". Jimmy Hatlo's \"They'll Do It Every Time\" was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.\n\nSunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section. Early Sunday strips (known colloquially as \"the funny papers\", shortened to \"the funnies\"), such as \"Thimble Theatre\" and \"Little Orphan Annie\", filled an entire newspaper page, a format known to collectors as full page. Sunday pages during the 1930s and into the 1940s often carried a secondary strip by the same artist as the main strip. No matter whether it appeared above or below a main strip, the extra strip was known as the topper, such as \"The Squirrel Cage\" which ran along with \"Room and Board\", both drawn by Gene Ahern.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the original art for a Sunday strip was usually drawn quite large. For example, in 1930, Russ Westover drew his \"Tillie the Toiler\" Sunday page at a size of 17\" × 37\". In 1937, the cartoonist Dudley Fisher launched the innovative \"Right Around Home\", drawn as a huge single panel filling an entire Sunday page.\n\nFull-page strips were eventually replaced by strips half that size. Strips such as \"The Phantom\" and \"Terry and the Pirates\" began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, such as the \"New Orleans Times Picayune\", or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or dropped panels. During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. The last full-page comic strip was the \"Prince Valiant\" strip for 11 April 1971.\n\nComic strips have also been published in Sunday newspaper magazines. Russell Patterson and Carolyn Wells' \"New Adventures of Flossy Frills\" was a continuing strip series seen on Sunday magazine covers. Beginning January 26, 1941, it ran on the front covers of Hearst's \"American Weekly\" newspaper magazine supplement, continuing until March 30 of that year. Between 1939 and 1943, four different stories featuring Flossy appeared on \"American Weekly\" covers.\n\nSunday comics sections employed offset color printing with multiple print runs imitating a wide range of colors. Printing plates were created with four or more colors—traditionally, the CMYK color model: cyan, magenta, yellow and \"K\" for black. With a screen of tiny dots on each printing plate, the dots allowed an image to be printed in a halftone that appears to the eye in different gradations. The semi-opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create an optical effect of full-color imagery.\n\nThe decade of the 1960s saw the rise of underground newspapers, which often carried comic strips, such as \"Fritz the Cat\" and \"The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers\". \"Zippy the Pinhead\" initially appeared in underground publications in the 1970s before being syndicated. \"Bloom County\" and \"Doonesbury\" began as strips in college newspapers under different titles, and later moved to national syndication. Underground comic strips covered subjects that are usually taboo in newspaper strips, such as sex and drugs. Many underground artists, notably Vaughn Bode, Dan O'Neill, Gilbert Shelton, and Art Spiegelman went on to draw comic strips for magazines such as \"Playboy\", \"National Lampoon\", and Pete Millar's \"CARtoons\". Jay Lynch graduated from undergrounds to alternative weekly newspapers to \"Mad\" and children's books.\n\n\"Webcomics\", also known as \"online comics\" and \"internet comics\", are comics that are available to read on the Internet. Many are exclusively published online, but the majority of traditional newspaper comic strips have some Internet presence. King Features Syndicate and other syndicates often provide archives of recent strips on their websites. Some, such as Scott Adams, creator of \"Dilbert\", include an email address in each strip.\n\nMost comic strip characters do not age throughout the strip's life, but in some strips, like Lynn Johnston's award-winning \"For Better or For Worse\", the characters age as the years pass. The first strip to feature aging characters was \"Gasoline Alley\".\n\nThe history of comic strips also includes series that are not humorous, but tell an ongoing dramatic story. Examples include \"The Phantom\", \"Prince Valiant\", \"Dick Tracy\", \"Mary Worth\", \"Modesty Blaise\", \"Little Orphan Annie\", \"Flash Gordon\", and \"Tarzan\". Sometimes these are spin-offs from comic books, for example \"Superman\", \"Batman\", and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\".\n\nA number of strips have featured animals ('funny animals') as main characters. Some are non-verbal (\"Marmaduke\", \"The Angriest Dog in the World\"), some have verbal thoughts but are not understood by humans, (\"Garfield\", Snoopy in \"Peanuts\"), and some can converse with humans (\"Bloom County\", \"Calvin and Hobbes\", \"Mutts\", \"Citizen Dog\", \"Buckles\", \"Get Fuzzy\", \"Pearls Before Swine\", and \"Pooch Cafe\"). Other strips are centered entirely on animals, as in \"Pogo\" and \"Donald Duck\". Gary Larson's \"The Far Side\" was unusual, as there were no central characters. Instead \"The Far Side\" used a wide variety of characters including humans, monsters, aliens, chickens, cows, worms, amoebas, and more. John McPherson's \"Close to Home\" also uses this theme, though the characters are mostly restricted to humans and real-life situations. Wiley Miller not only mixes human, animal, and fantasy characters, but also does several different comic strip continuities under one umbrella title, \"Non Sequitur\". Bob Thaves's \"Frank & Ernest\" began in 1972 and paved the way for some of these strips, as its human characters were manifest in diverse forms — as animals, vegetables, and minerals.\n\nThe comics have long held a distorted mirror to contemporary society, and almost from the beginning have been used for political or social commentary. This ranged from the conservative slant of \"Little Orphan Annie\" to the unabashed liberalism of \"Doonesbury\". \"Pogo\" used animals to particularly devastating effect, caricaturing many prominent politicians of the day as animal denizens of Pogo's Okeefenokee Swamp. In a fearless move, Pogo's creator Walt Kelly took on Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, caricaturing him as a bobcat named Simple J. Malarkey, a megalomaniac who was bent on taking over the characters' birdwatching club and rooting out all undesirables. Kelly also defended the medium against possible government regulation in the McCarthy era. At a time when comic books were coming under fire for supposed sexual, violent, and subversive content, Kelly feared the same would happen to comic strips. Going before the Congressional subcommittee, he proceeded to charm the members with his drawings and the force of his personality. The comic strip was safe for satire.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, comic strips were widely associated with publisher William Randolph Hearst, whose papers had the largest circulation of strips in the United States. Hearst was notorious for his practice of yellow journalism, and he was frowned on by readers of \"The New York Times\" and other newspapers which featured few or no comic strips. Hearst's critics often assumed that all the strips in his papers were fronts for his own political and social views. Hearst did occasionally work with or pitch ideas to cartoonists, most notably his continued support of George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat\". An inspiration for Bill Watterson and other cartoonists, \"Krazy Kat\" gained a considerable following among intellectuals during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nSome comic strips, such as \"Doonesbury\" and \"The Boondocks\", may be printed on the editorial or op-ed page rather than the comics page because of their regular political commentary. For example, the August 12, 1974 \"Doonesbury\" strip was awarded a 1975 Pulitzer Prize for its depiction of the Watergate scandal. \"Dilbert\" is sometimes found in the business section of a newspaper instead of the comics page because of the strip's commentary about office politics, and Tank McNamara often appears on the sports page because of its subject matter. Lynn Johnston's \"For Better or for Worse\" created an uproar when one of its supporting characters came out of the closet and announced he was gay.\n\nThe world's longest comic strip is long and on display at Trafalgar Square as part of the London Comedy Festival. The London Cartoon Strip was created by 15 of Britain's best known cartoonists and depicts the history of London.\n\nThe Reuben, named for cartoonist Rube Goldberg, is the most prestigious award for U.S. comic strip artists. Reuben awards are presented annually by the National Cartoonists Society (NCS).\n\nToday's strip artists, with the help of the NCS, enthusiastically promote the medium, which is considered to be in decline due to fewer markets (today few strips are published in newspapers outside the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, mainly because of the smaller interest there, with translated versions of popular strips - particularly in Spanish - are primarily read over the internet) and ever-shrinking newspaper space. One particularly humorous example of such promotional efforts is the Great Comic Strip Switcheroonie, held in 1997 on April Fool's Day, an event in which dozens of prominent artists took over each other's strips. \"Garfield\"’s Jim Davis, for example, switched with \"Blondie\"’s Stan Drake, while Scott Adams (\"Dilbert\") traded strips with Bil Keane (\"The Family Circus\"). Even the United States Postal Service got into the act, issuing a series of commemorative stamps marking the comic-strip centennial in 1996.\n\nWhile the Switcheroonie was a one-time publicity stunt, for one artist to take over a feature from its originator is an old tradition in newspaper cartooning (as it is in the comic book industry). In fact, the practice has made possible the longevity of the genre's more popular strips. Examples include \"Little Orphan Annie\" (drawn and plotted by Harold Gray from 1924 to 1944 and thereafter by a succession of artists including Leonard Starr and Andrew Pepoy), and \"Terry and The Pirates\", started by Milton Caniff in 1934 and picked up by George Wunder.\n\nA business-driven variation has sometimes led to the same feature continuing under a different name. In one case, in the early 1940s, Don Flowers' \"Modest Maidens\" was so admired by William Randolph Hearst that he lured Flowers away from the Associated Press and to King Features Syndicate by doubling the cartoonist's salary, and renamed the feature \"Glamor Girls\" to avoid legal action by the AP. The latter continued to publish \"Modest Maidens\", drawn by Jay Allen in Flowers' style.\n\nAs newspapers have declined, the changes have affected comic strips. Jeff Reece, lifestyle editor of \"The Florida Times-Union\", wrote, \"Comics are sort of the 'third rail' of the newspaper.\"\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, all Sunday comics received a full page, and daily strips were generally the width of the page. The competition between papers for having more cartoons than the rest from the mid-1920s, the growth of large-scale newspaper advertising during most of the thirties, paper rationing during World War II, the decline on news readership (as television newscasts began to be more common) and inflation (which has caused higher printing costs) beginning during the fifties and sixties led to Sunday strips being published on smaller and more diverse formats. Daily strips have suffered as well, in 1910 the strips had an unlimited amount of panels, covering the entire width page, while by 1930 most \"dailies\" had four or five panels covering six of the eight columns occupied by a traditional broadsheet paper, by 1958 those four panels would be narrower, and those would have half of the space a 1910 daily strip had, and by 1998 most strips would have three panels only (with a few exceptions), or even two or one on an occasional basis, apart from strips being smaller, as most papers became slightly narrower. While most cartoonist decided to follow the tide, some cartoonists have complained about this, with \"Pogo\" ending in 1975 as a form of protest from its creators against the practice. Since then \"Calvin and Hobbes\" creator Bill Watterson has written extensively on the issue, arguing that size reduction and dropped panels reduce both the potential and freedom of a cartoonist. After a lengthy battle with his syndicator, Watterson won the privilege of making half page-sized Sunday strips where he could arrange the panels any way he liked. Many newspaper publishers and a few cartoonists objected to this, and some papers continued to print \"Calvin and Hobbes\" at small sizes. Opus won that same privilege years after \"Calvin and Hobbes\" ended, while Wiley Miller circumvented further downsizings by making his \"Non Sequitur\" Sunday strip available only in an extremely vertical (near-page-long) arrangement. Few newspapers still run half-page strips, as with \"Prince Valiant\" and \"Hägar the Horrible\" in the front page of the \"Reading Eagle\" Sunday comics section. Actually Universal Uclick and United Media practically have no half-page comics, with the remaining strips from both syndicates in this format are published only as \"thirds\", \"fourths\", and \"sixths\" (also called \"third tabs\").\n\nIn an issue related to size limitations, Sunday comics are often bound to rigid formats that allow their panels to be rearranged in several different ways while remaining readable. Such formats usually include throwaway panels at the beginning, which some newspapers will omit for space. As a result, cartoonists have less incentive to put great efforts into these panels. \"Garfield\" and \"Mutts\" were known during the mid-to-late 80s and 1990s respectively for their throwaways on their Sunday strips, however both strips now run \"generic\" title panels.\n\nWith the success of \"The Gumps\" during the 1920s, it became commonplace for strips (comedy- and adventure-laden alike) to have lengthy stories spanning weeks or months. The \"Monarch of Medioka\" story in Floyd Gottfredson's \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip ran from September 8, 1937 to May 2, 1938. Between the 1960s and the late 1980s, as television news relegated newspaper reading to an occasional basis rather than daily, syndicators were abandoning long stories and urging cartoonists to switch to simple daily gags, or week-long \"storylines\" (with six consecutive (mostly unrelated) strips following a same subject), with longer storylines being used mainly on adventure-based and dramatic strips. Strips begun during the mid-1980s or after (such as \"Get Fuzzy\", \"Over the Hedge\", \"Monty\", and others) are known for their heavy use of storylines, lasting between one and three weeks in most cases.\n\nThe writing style of comic strips changed as well after World War II. With an increase in the number of college-educated readers, there was a shift away from slapstick comedy and towards more cerebral humor. Slapstick and visual gags became more confined to Sunday strips, because as \"Garfield\" creator Jim Davis put it, \"Children are more likely to read Sunday strips than dailies.\"\n\nMany older strips are no longer drawn by the original cartoonist, who has either died or retired. Such strips are known as \"zombie strips\". A cartoonist, paid by the syndicate or sometimes a relative of the original cartoonist, continues writing the strip, a tradition that became commonplace in the early half of the 20th century. \"Hägar the Horrible\" and \"Frank and Ernest\" are both drawn by the sons of the creators. Some strips which are still in affiliation with the original creator are produced by small teams or entire companies, such as Jim Davis' \"Garfield\", however there is some debate if these strips fall in this category.\n\nThis act is commonly criticized by modern cartoonists including Watterson and \"Pearls Before Swine\"'s Stephan Pastis. The issue was addressed in six consecutive \"Pearls\" strips in 2005. Charles Schulz, of \"Peanuts\" fame, requested that his strip not be continued by another cartoonist after his death. He also rejected the idea of hiring an inker or letterer, comparing it to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts. Schulz's family has honored his wishes and refused numerous proposals by syndicators to continue \"Peanuts\" with a new author.\n\nSince the consolidation of newspaper comics by the first quarter of the 20th century, most cartoonists have used a group of assistants (with usually one of them credited). However, quite a few cartoonists (e.g.: George Herriman and Charles Schulz, among others) have done their strips almost completely by themselves; often criticizing the use of assistants for the same reasons most have about their editors hiring anyone else to continue their work after their retirement.\n\nHistorically, syndicates owned the creators' work, enabling them to continue publishing the strip after the original creator retired, left the strip, or died. This practice led to the term \"legacy strips,\" or more pejoratively \"zombie strips\"). Most syndicates signed creators to 10- or even 20-year contracts. (There have been exceptions, however, such as Bud Fisher's \"Mutt and Jeff\" being an early — if not the earliest — case in which the creator retained ownership of his work.) Both these practices began to change with the 1970 debut of Universal Press Syndicate, as the company gave cartoonists a 50-percent ownership share of their work. Creators Syndicate, founded in 1987, granted artists full rights to the strips, something that Universal Press did in 1990, followed by King Features in 1995. By 1999 both Tribune Media Services and United Feature had begun granting ownership rights to creators (limited to new and/or hugely popular strips).\n\nStarting in the late 1940s, the national syndicates which distributed newspaper comic strips subjected them to very strict censorship. \"Li'l Abner\" was censored in September 1947 and was pulled from the Pittsburg Press by Scripps-Howard. The controversy, as reported in \"Time\", centered on Capp's portrayal of the U.S. Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\"\n\nAs comics are easier for children to access compared to other types of media, they have a significantly more rigid censorship code than other media. Stephan Pastis has lamented that the \"unwritten\" censorship code is still \"stuck somewhere in the 1950s.\" Generally, comics are not allowed to include such words as \"damn\", \"sucks\", \"screwed\", and \"hell\", although there have been exceptions such as the September 22, 2010 \"Mother Goose and Grimm\" in which an elderly man says, \"This nursing home food sucks,\" and a pair of \"Pearls Before Swine\" comics from January 11, 2011 with a character named Ned using the word \"crappy\". Naked backsides and shooting guns cannot be shown, according to \"Dilbert\" cartoonist Scott Adams. Such comic strip taboos were detailed in Dave Breger's book \"But That's Unprintable\" (Bantam, 1955).\n\nMany issues such as sex, narcotics, and terrorism cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips, although there are exceptions, usually for satire, as in \"Bloom County\". This led some cartoonists to resort to double entendre or dialogue children do not understand, as in Greg Evans' \"Luann\". Young cartoonists have claimed commonplace words, images, and issues should be allowed in the comics. Some of the taboo words and topics are mentioned daily on television and other forms of visual media. Webcomics and comics distributed primarily to college newspapers are much freer in this respect.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "984290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=984290", "title": "Dragon Quest III", "text": "Dragon Quest III\n\nDragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation, originally released as Dragon Warrior III in North America, is a role-playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix. It is the third installment in the \"Dragon Quest\" series and was first released for the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America. The game saw an enhanced remake for the Super Famicom (the Japanese version of the Super NES) in 1996 and the Game Boy Color in 2001, and a port to mobile phones and the Wii in 2009 and 2011. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on September 25, 2014, and worldwide as \"Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation\" on December 4, 2014. It was the first time the game was given an official English subtitle.\n\nThe first three \"Dragon Quest\" games are part of the same story, and \"Dragon Warrior III\" is the first game chronologically, as well as the third game that features the hero Erdrick (Loto in the Japanese releases and Game Boy Color localization). The story follows \"the Hero\" who is tasked with saving the world from the archfiend Baramos. Gathering a group of companions into a party, the Hero must travel the world, stopping at various towns and locations, and find his way to the Demon Lord Baramos's lair.\n\n\"Dragon Quest III\" is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the original \"Dragon Quest\" and \"Dragon Quest II\". The game uses basic role-playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler door opening, a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" command, and a \"Full HP\" command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier \"Dragon Quest\" games were non-linear in structure, \"Dragon Quest III\" featured an even more open-world experience. It also allowed the player to freely swap characters in and out of their party and introduced the day/night cycle in which certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at specific times of the day.\n\n\"Dragon Quest III\" features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. At the start of the game, the player begins as a single male or female hero but is able to recruit members at the local tavern. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose to be any of the following of either gender: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. A character who changes classes has their stats halved and restarts at experience Level 1, retaining their spells and, in the remakes, their personality. This allows a player to create a character that knows Wizard spells but has the defense of a Soldier. Unlike most \"Dragon Quest\" parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles in order to win more gold.\n\nIn the remakes, after selecting a character, the player can change the character's starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern. Also, each character has a personality trait which affects the growth rate of their abilities. The Hero's personality is determined by the player's choices and actions during a dream sequence at the start of the game, while other characters' personalities are determined by their status at the end of the character generation process. Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters. A character's personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories, or permanently changed by using certain consumable books.\n\nThe game starts in the castle town of Aliahan. Like the rest of the \"Dragon Quest\" worlds, this castle is set in a medieval time period, complete with knights and magicians. The party explores several caves, ruins, and castles during the adventure. The geography of \"Dragon Quest III\" largely corresponds to the actual geography of Earth, and many towns correspond to their real-world cultures, including \"Romaly\" for Rome, \"Portoga\" for Portugal, \"Assaram\" near present-day Iraq (derived from \"as-salamu alaykum\"), \"Jipang\" for Japan and even a \"New Town\" in eastern North America that experiences a revolution against an overbearing ruler.\n\n\"Dragon Quest III\" is set many years before the original \"Dragon Warrior\" in a world separate from the first two games. A wicked fiend named Baramos threatens to destroy the world. The story revolves around the Hero, son or daughter (the player can choose to be either male or female, with few gameplay changes) of the legendary warrior Ortega. On their sixteenth birthday, the Hero (from here on referred to as \"they\" for the sake of convenience) is summoned to the castle and is given by the King of Aliahan the challenge to rid the world of the evil archfiend Baramos, which Ortega attempted in the past but seemingly perished in a volcano. The Hero then is able to recruit up to three traveling companions to help fight Baramos.\n\nThe Hero leaves their home country of Aliahan to travel the world and complete their father's quest to defeat Baramos. A major portion of the adventure is the quest to acquire the last two of the three keys needed to open doors throughout the game. After saving two people of the town of Baharata from the rogue Kandar and stealing back the King of Romaly's crown, the Hero receives Black Pepper, which they then trade for a sailing ship at Portoga. With the ship, the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird Ramia. Ramia allows the Hero and their party to travel to Baramos' castle, which is surrounded by mountains.\n\nAfter defeating Baramos in a ferocious battle and returning to Aliahan, the Hero's celebration is cut off as Zoma, Baramos's master and the game's true villain, reveals his existence. He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World, which the Hero jumps into. The Dark World is, in fact, Alefgard (of the previous installments of the series), where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original \"Dragon Quest\", including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff. Rubiss, a legendary sage, has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero, and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return. These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation. Along the way, the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma's monsters, then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos, now turned into the powerful Baramos Bomus and later into the skeletal Baramos Gonus. With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen, the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard, but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return to the land and the Hero will not live long enough to stop it. For their bravery, the Hero receives the title of Erdrick (Loto). The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard, leaving their sword and armor to be passed down throughout the ages so that their descendants can continue to protect the world from evil.\n\nAs with the other main games in the \"Dragon Quest\" series, \"Dragon Quest III\"s scenario was designed by Yuji Horii, whereas the artwork was done by Akira Toriyama, of \"Dragon Ball\" fame. Koichi Sugiyama composed all the music for \"Dragon Quest III\". Chunsoft president Koichi Nakamura, co-creator of \"Dragon Quest\", stated he contributed about \"10%\" of the games programming. The game was released a year after the original, a longer period of development than its predecessor, and reflected the ever-lengthening game development process of the series. Yuji Horii, in a 1989 interview, said that developers had perfected the series' game structure in \"Dragon Quest III\", and this was reflected by the transition from one character's quest to a party of heroes. The password system used on the first two \"Dragon Quest\" titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii's dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record . Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere, which turned out to be unworkable during \"Dragon Quest III\"s development when the game's world map concept was used first by another game maker in \"Mirai Shinwa Jarvas\", but Horii's team was too far into development to change anything. Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player feel like they have become the main character, but at one point in the story, Horii was forced to make the hero shout, \"Leave him to us! Run! Quick!\"\n\nThe game was localized in North America as \"Dragon Warrior III\" in 1991 (though not officially released until 1992). Several changes were made in this version. Among them were the addition of a new title sequence (in the original, it was on a simple black screen with the title of the game in the center), and a new prologue which depicted Ortega, who also was given a brand new sprite in this version, fighting a Dragon, and being dragged into the volcano (in the original, the player was unaware of Ortega's fate, until talking to the King for the first time). There were also brand new music cues, including one for the title sequence, and one that played after Ortega died for real near the end. To accompany the localization credits, the ending theme was extended to include a reprise of the Alefgard theme. It's unclear whether Sugiyama was brought back to score these new tracks, or someone else was brought in. The menu when starting a new or old save file also added the menu music from \"Dragon Quest IV\" (in the original, the menu was silent). Finally, most of the monsters were given a tremendous boost in experience points.\n\nThe Super Famicom version, released in late 1996, during the last days of the Super NES in North America, was never brought to North America, due to Enix America Corporation's closure in 1995. By the time Enix of America returned, the SNES had been discontinued in North America. However, the next remake, for the Game Boy Color, was released in both Japan and the US.\n\nThe Game Boy Color version is based on the Super Famicom version. For the North American release of the \"Dragon Quest III\" Game Boy Color remake, Enix decided to give the packaging an anime feel, due to fan demand on Enix's message boards. Both remake versions of \"Dragon Quest III\" offer many new features and changes. The game received a new translation, incorporating many adult elements that were cut from its original American release, and becoming the first Game Boy Color RPG with a \"Teen\" rating. It was also the largest Game Boy Color game released in North America, with 32 Mb ROM and 256Kb of save-state SRAM on one cartridge. A new class, the Thief, was added to the roster in each of the remakes. Many of the names of the classes were changed in the English localization of the Game Boy Color version, such as Soldier to Warrior. Also, in the new versions was the ability to change into the Jester class at Dhama, which was not allowed in the original. New mini-games were added to the remakes, including Pachisi (called Suguroku in Japan / Treasures and Trapdoors as of the Dragon Quest V Remake), which is a giant board game style adventure from which the player can win items. This game is based on Horii's series \"Itadaki Street\". The Mini Medal system, which lets players collect hidden medals to gain new items, seen in later \"Dragon Quest\" games (it originated in \"\"), was added. Another medal system, Monster Medals, lets players collect medals from fallen enemies, was added in Game Boy Color remake, and two players could trade Monster Medals via a Game Link Cable. Two bonus dungeons become available after the main quest is over. The remakes feature updated graphics. An overhauled introduction for the game was made, similar to the one in the original \"Dragon Quest III\", which included Ortega's battle with the Dragon Queen. Monster and attack animation in battles were added, a feature first introduced in \"\". A personality system was added to the remakes of \"Dragon Quest III\". A pre-game sequence in which the player answers moral dilemmas similar to that in \"Ultima IV\" determines the Hero's personality. The personality of the other members of the party is determined by the stat-raising seeds that the player gives them during the character generation process. Personalities determine which stats increase when a character levels up. The personalities may be changed by use of special items and books.\n\nIt was announced in May 2011 that Square Enix will be releasing \"Dragon Quest III\" in Japan, as both the Famicom and Super Famicom ports as part of the September released of \"Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Commemoration Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I & II & III\" for the Wii. A quick save feature was added to this version of the game, allowing for pauses at any time, but the save file is deleted upon resuming.\n\nKoichi Sugiyama composed and directed the music for the game. \"Dragon Quest III\"s music is featured on \"Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1\", \"Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 2\", and \"Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 3\", each album a compilation of music from the first six \"Dragon Quest\" games. This game's music has also been featured on other \"Dragon Quest\" compilation albums, such as \"Dragon Quest on Piano Vol. II\", which was released in 1990, and \"Dragon Quest Best Songs Selection ~Loula~\", released in 1993. A compilation album of \"Dragon Quest III\"s music was put on \"Dragon Quest III ~And into the Legend...~ Remix Symphonic Suite\" and was published by Sony Records in 1996. In 2011 Sugiyama played a concert focused on \"Dragon Quest III\" in his \"Family Classic Concert\" series he has done for many years, playing fifteen of the games songs.\n\n\"Dragon Quest III\" sold over one million copies on the first day with almost 300 arrests for truancy among students absent from school to purchase the game, and 3.8 million copies total in Japan. In Japan, the Super Famicom remake sold 1.4 million units, with nearly 720,000 units sold in 1996 alone. The Game Boy Color version sold a lower 604,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2001, and eventually became the fifth best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 638,551 copies sold. Together with the sales of the remakes, \"Dragon Quest III\" is the most successful title in the series and one of the best-selling role-playing games in Japan. As of November 2010, Japan mobile phone version was downloaded more than 1,000,000 times. Wii \"Dragon Quest Collection\" sold 403,953 copies in 2011.\n\nA survey conducted by the magazine \"Famitsu\" in early 2006 among its readers placed \"Dragon Quest III\" as the third most favorite game of all time, being preceded by only \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy VII\", It is often mistakenly thought that in 1988 the game's success caused the Japanese government to outlaw further releases of \"Dragon Quest\" games on school days. In truth, Enix themselves decided to hold off the release of future \"Dragon Quest\" games until weekends. The North American release of \"Dragon Quest III\" did not meet nearly as much success. Considered an improvement over the first two games, \"Dragon Quest III\" \"kept the same ugly graphical style and clumsy interface\", explained Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra. The North American release's poor sales are partly due to the fact that the game was released after the release of 16-bit gaming systems, making it seem archaic to gamers. Critics found the new day/night system and the addition of an in-game bank praiseworthy. Its reputation has risen in America since its release, primarily due to its gameplay innovations, leading Nintendo Power to list it as number 176 on their Top 200 Games list. IGN later listed it as the 96th best Nintendo Entertainment System game. GamesRadar ranked it the 17th best NES game ever made. The staff chose it over the other \"Dragon Warrior\" titles due to its job system which they felt had depth and was influential to video games.\n\nThe Game Boy Color remake received very good reviews from critics. GameSpot gave the Game Boy Color version a \"good\" 7.6/10, saying that \"DWIII is a worthy port of its old NES ancestor, but its firm grounding in the RPG old-school means that only the hard-core need apply.\" Nintendo Power gave the remake a 4/5, while IGN gave the game a perfect 10/10.\n\nThe manga series, , was written by Chiaki Kawamata and Junji Koyanagi with artwork by Kamui Fujiwara and was published in \"Monthly Shōnen Gangan\" from 1991 through 1997. The series was later compiled into for 21 volumes published by Enix; in 1994 it was released on CD and was released for the PlayStation Portable on December 11, 2009 as part of manga distribution library. In 1996 an anime movie based on the manga was released on video cassette.\n\nA sequel series, , published by Square Enix started in 2005 and is still ongoing; as of December 2012, fifteen volumes have been released. The first four volumes were written by Jun Eishima and all the rest volumes written by Takashi Umemura. All of them have been supervised by Yuji Horii with artwork done by Kamui Fujiwara. \"Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshō\" is meant to take place between \"Dragon Quest III\" and \"Dragon Quest\".\n\nAfter monsters possessed the Carmen's king for seven years, the kingdom fell to the hordes of evil. The only survivors were Prince Arus and an army General's daughter, Lunafrea. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Loran, a child by the name of is born with the name Jagan per the orders of Demon Lord Imagine. As Loto's descendant, Arus, along with Lunafrea, set out to defeat the monsters and restore peace to the world.\n\n\"Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshō ~Monshō o Tsugumono-tachi e~\" takes place 25 years after the events in \"Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshō\". The world is once again in chaos and a young boy, , sets out gathering companions to once again save the world from evil. \"Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshō\" was popular in Japan, it has sold 18 million in Japan. Its sequel \"Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshō - To the Children Who Inherit the Emblem\" has also sold well in Japan. For the week of August 26 through September 1, 2008, volume 7 was ranked 9th in Japan having sold 59,540 copies. For the week of February 24 through March 2, 2009, volume 8 was ranked 19th in Japan having sold 76,801 copies. For the week of October 26 through November 1, 2009, volume 9 was ranked 16th in Japan having sold 40,492 copies for a total of 60,467.\n\n"}

Inoe Perbatasari would go on to make one more film for Jacatra Pictures, \"Poetri Rimba\", later that year.\n\nIt is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\n"}
{"id": "106366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=106366", "title": "Eubie Blake", "text": "Eubie Blake\n\nJames Hubert Blake (February 7, 1887February 12, 1983), known as Eubie Blake, was an American composer, lyricist, and pianist of ragtime, jazz, and popular music. In 1921, he and his long-time collaborator Noble Sissle wrote \"Shuffle Along\", one of the first Broadway musicals to be written and directed by African Americans. Blake's compositions included such hits as \"Bandana Days\", \"Charleston Rag\", \"Love Will Find a Way\", \"Memories of You\" and \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\". The musical \"Eubie!\", which opened on Broadway in 1978, featured his works.\n\nBlake was born at 319 Forrest Street in Baltimore, Maryland, to Emily \"Emma\" Johnstone (1861–1927) and John Sumner Blake (1838–1917), both of whom had been slaves. He was the only surviving child of eight, all the rest of whom died in infancy. In 1894, the family moved to 414 North Eden Street, and later to 1510 Jefferson Street. John Blake earned US$9.00 weekly working as a stevedore on the Baltimore docks.\n\nBlake's musical training began when he was four or five years old. While out shopping with his mother, he wandered into a music store, climbed on the bench of an organ, and started \"foolin’ around\". When his mother found him, the store manager said to her, \"The child is a genius! It would be criminal to deprive him of the chance to make use of such a sublime, God-given talent.\" The Blakes purchased a pump organ for US$75.00, making payments of 25 cents a week. When Blake was seven, he received music lessons from a neighbor, Margaret Marshall, an organist for the Methodist church. At age 15, without his parents' knowledge, he began playing piano at Aggie Shelton's Baltimore bordello. Blake got his first big break in the music business in 1907, when the world champion boxer Joe Gans hired him to play the piano at Gans's Goldfield Hotel, the first \"black and tan club\" in Baltimore.\n\nAccording to Blake, he also worked the medicine show circuit and was employed by a Quaker doctor. He played a Melodeon strapped to the back of the medicine wagon. Blake stayed with the show only two weeks, however, because the doctor's religion didn't allow the serving of Sunday dinner.\n\nBlake said he composed the melody of the \"Charleston Rag\" in 1899, when he would have been only 12 years old. It was not committed to paper, however, until 1915, when he learned to write musical notation.\n\nIn 1912, Blake began playing in vaudeville with James Reese Europe's Society Orchestra, which accompanied Vernon and Irene Castle's ballroom dance act. The band played ragtime music, which was still quite popular. Shortly after World War I, Blake joined forces with the performer Noble Sissle to form a vaudeville musical act, the Dixie Duo. After vaudeville, the pair began work on a musical revue, \"Shuffle Along\", which incorporated songs they had written, and had a book written by F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles. When it premiered in June 1921, \"Shuffle Along\" became the first hit musical on Broadway written by and about African-Americans. The musical also introduced hit songs such as \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\" and \"Love Will Find a Way.\"\n\nBlake made his first recordings in 1917, for the Pathe record label and for Ampico piano rolls. In the 1920s he recorded for the Victor and Emerson labels among others.\n\nIn 1923, Blake made three films for Lee DeForest in DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process: \"Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake\", featuring their song \"Affectionate Dan\"; \"Sissle and Blake Sing Snappy Songs\", featuring \"Sons of Old Black Joe\" and \"My Swanee Home\"; and \"Eubie Blake Plays His Fantasy on Swanee River\", featuring Blake performing his \"Fantasy on Swanee River\". These films are preserved in the Maurice Zouary film collection in the Library of Congress collection. He also appeared in Warner Brothers' 1932 short film \"Pie, Pie Blackbird\" with the Nicholas Brothers, Nina Mae McKinney, and Noble Sissle. That same year he and his orchestra provided as well most of the music for the film \"Harlem Is Heaven\".\n\nIn July 1910, Blake married Avis Elizabeth Cecelia Lee (1881–1938), proposing to her in a chauffeur-driven car he hired. Blake and Lee met around 1895, when both attended Primary School No. 2, at 200 East Street in Baltimore. In 1910, Blake brought his newlywed to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he had already found employment at the Boathouse nightclub.\n\nIn 1938, Avis was diagnosed with tuberculosis. She died later that year, at the age of 58. Of his loss, Blake said, \"In my life I never knew what it was to be alone. At first when Avis got sick, I thought she just had a cold, but when time passed and she didn’t get better, I made her go to a doctor and we found out she had TB … I suppose I knew from when we found out she had the TB, I understood that it was just a matter of time.\"\n\nWhile serving as bandleader with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II, he met Marion Grant Tyler (1896-1982), the widow of the violinist Willy Tyler. Blake and Tyler married in 1945. She was a performer and a businesswoman and became his valued business manager until her death in 1982. In 1946, as Blake's career was winding down, he enrolled in New York University, graduating in two and a half years. Later his music career revived, culminating in the hit Broadway musical, \"Eubie!\".\n\nBlake was a frequent guest of \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"Merv Griffin\". He was featured by leading conductors, such as Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Fiedler. In 1977 he played Will Williams in the Jeremy Kagan biographical film \"Scott Joplin\". By 1975, he had been awarded honorary doctorates from Rutgers, the New England Conservatory, the University of Maryland, Morgan State University, Pratt Institute, Brooklyn College, and Dartmouth. On October 9, 1981, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"Eubie!\", a revue featuring the music of Blake, with lyrics by Noble Sissle, Andy Razaf, Johnny Brandon, F. E. Miller, and Jim Europe, opened on Broadway in 1978. The show was a hit at the Ambassador Theatre, where it ran for 439 performances. The production received three nominations for Tony Awards, including one for Blake's score. The show was filmed in 1981 with the original cast members, including Lesley Dockery, Gregory Hines and Maurice Hines. Blake performed with Gregory Hines on the television program \"Saturday Night Live\" on March 10, 1979.\n\nBlake continued to play and record until his death, on February 12, 1983, in Brooklyn, just five days after celebrating his purported 100th birthday (actually his 96th birthday).\n\nHe was interred in Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His headstone, engraved with the musical notation of \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\", was commissioned by the African Atlantic Genealogical Society (AAGS). The bronze sculpture of Blake's bespectacled face was created by David Byer-Tyre, curator and director of the African American Museum and Center for Education and Applied Arts, in Hempstead, New York. The original inscription indicated his correct year of birth, but individuals close to him insisted that Blake be indulged and paid to have the inscription changed.\n\nBlake was reported to have said this on his birthday in 1979, but it has been attributed to others, including Adolph Zukor, Mae West, and Mickey Mantle. The quotation appeared in print at least as early as 1966, when it was attributed to an anonymous 90-year-old golf caddie.\n\n\n\n\n"}

(2009)\n\nFederal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502 (2009), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court that upheld regulations of the Federal Communications Commission that ban \"fleeting expletives\" on television broadcasts, finding they were not arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Constitutional issue, however, was not resolved and was remanded back to the Second Circuit and re-appealed to the Supreme Court for a decision in June 2012.\n\nThe case entered the Supreme Court's docket in October 2007 and specifically concerns obscene language broadcast on the Fox television network from two \"Billboard\" Music Awards shows from 2002 and 2003. In the 2002 show, presenter Cher said \"fuck 'em\" regarding people who she believed criticized her; in the 2003 show, presenter Nicole Richie stated regarding her television show: “Why do they even call it \"The Simple Life\"? Have you ever tried to get cow shit out of a Prada purse? It’s not so fucking simple.” \n\nIn 2004, the FCC prohibited \"single uses of vulgar words\" under any circumstances, including previous instances where it gave leeway for \"fleeting\" expletives that networks unknowingly allowed to enter the airwaves. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in the case \"Fox et al. v. Federal Communications Commission\" (06-1760) that the FCC cannot punish broadcast stations for such incidents.\n\nOn the week of March 17, 2008, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear this case. The Supreme Court heard arguments from the case on November 4, 2008, which was also Election Day. Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Associate Justice Antonin Scalia expressed support for the FCC.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision on April 28, 2009 that the Federal Communications Commission had not acted arbitrarily when it changed a long-standing policy and implemented a new ban on even \"fleeting expletives\" from the airwaves. The Court explicitly declined to decide whether the new rule is constitutional, and sent that issue back to the lower courts for their review. Justice Antonin Scalia, in the majority opinion, wrote: \"The FCC’s new policy and its order finding the broadcasts at issue actionably indecent were neither arbitrary nor capricious.\" In the dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens claimed that this decision was hypocritical given the presence of television commercials for products treating impotence or constipation.\n\nIn its decision, \"the court did not definitively settle the First Amendment implications of allowing a federal agency to censor broadcasts,\" and left that issue for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. However, Justice Clarence Thomas's separate opinion openly stated his willingness to overturn \"Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation\" and \"Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission\", the two cases on which all FCC authority rest, even as he joined the majority on procedural grounds.\n\nUpon remand, the Second Circuit addressed the actual Constitutionality of the fleeting expletive rules, striking it down in July 2010. The FCC re-appealed the case. On June 21, 2012, the Court decided the re-appeal narrowly, striking down the fines as unconstitutionally vague, but upholding the authority of the FCC to act in the interests of the general public when licensing broadcast spectrums to enforce decency standards, so long as they are not vague, without violating the First Amendment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11896722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11896722", "title": "Fritz Grünbaum", "text": "Fritz Grünbaum\n\nFritz Grünbaum (7 April 1880 in Brno, Moravia as Franz Friedrich Grünbaum – 14 January 1941 at the Dachau concentration camp, Germany) was an Austrian Jewish cabaret artist, operetta and pop song writer, director, actor and master of ceremonies.\n\nDuring his childhood and adolescence Grünbaum lived with his family in Brünn which were dealing in art. At an age of 18 years, he attended law school in Vienna which he concluded, in fact, as a doctor, but more and more he began to show interest for literature. \n\nAfter the law studies, he began as a master of ceremonies at Vienna Cabaret Die Hoelle, where he had his first performance in the operetta \"Phryne\" in 1906. From 1903 on he composed first libretti, among others with Robert Bodanzky and made his appearance as an actor in the most different minor parts on many Vienna Cellar Stages and Revue Theatres.\n\nUntil the beginning of World War I (in which he enlisted himself as a voluntary in 1915) again and again he travelled to Berlin – the first time in 1907 in order to perform at \"Chat Noir\" – to act as master of ceremonies at Rudolf Nelson's theatres. In 1914, Grünbaum acted for the first time at Kabarett Simpl, the legendary Vienna Cabaret where he also acted time and again in the time to come. Together with Karl Farkas he developed in 1922 the so-called \"Doppelconférence\" originated from Hungary and presented at the \"Budapester Orpheum\" of Vienna, and led it to its highest spot.\n\nIn fact, Grünbaum was described by acquaintances as an \"adorable contemporary\", but this fact did not impede him to slap an imperial and royal officer in 1910 at the \"Hölle\" restaurant when he proclaimed anti-Semitic slogans during the programme. After that, he continued with his performance. Later the officer challenged Grünbaum to a duel during which Grünbaum was injured. In 1914, Grünbaum was infected by the war frenzy and in 1914 he joined military service. In spring of 1916 he fought at the Italian front, but he returned disenchanted and from that time he attracted attention by pacifistic slogans.\n\nFrom 1926, Grünbaum was working at Vienna Bürgertheater. In 18 stage settings he and Karl Farkas had beautiful girls show their legs with the music of Egon Neumann in \"Journal der Liebe\" and Rita Georg parade in a breeches part. The guest performance of the Marischka revue which began on 1 October 1927 fully fit into this schema. Performance no. 430 of \"Wien lacht wieder\" took place. In thirty stage settings, Grünbaum and Karl Farkas (music by Ralph Benatzky) performed last year's pop song revue which had not lost its popularity with 120 players and 900 fancy dresses.\n\nHe again and again commuted between Berlin and Vienna. In Berlin he acted in films and wrote pop songs, he wrote scripts, in Vienna he was working at different cabarets. In 1933, his texts became more political in Vienna. On the occasion of one of his last performances at Vienna's Cabaret Simpl during the programme of \"Metro Grünbaum – Farkas tönende Wochenschau\", he was still joking: \"I see nothing, absolutely nothing, I think I got astray in national socialist culture.\"\n\nOn 10 March 1938, the day German troops marched into the alpine republic, together with Karl Farkas he was acting for the last time in \"Simplicissimus\". After that, they were put under stage ban. The next day, he tried to flee to Czechoslovakia, but he and his wife were sent back at the border. He hid quite a while in Vienna, but then he was betrayed and transported to the Dachau concentration camp. Later he was taken to Buchenwald and subsequently returned to Dachau. He died at the Dachau concentration camp on 14 January 1941 after having acted for a last time on New Year's Eve for his fellow-sufferers. A star was dedicated to him on the cabaret Walk of Fame. He is buried at Vienna Central Cemetery, Old Israelite Part, Gate 1.\n\nFritz Grünbaum was married three times. After his first marriage with Karolina Nagelmüller (1908–1914), he married a colleague Mizzi Dressl and in 1919 he married Lilli Herzl with whom he stayed until her deportation to Minsk in 1942.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Fritz Grünbaum was a well-known art collector, especially of Austrian modernist art, whose artworks were featured in famous catalogues and exhibitions. His collection extended to over 400 pieces, 80 of them works by Egon Schiele (1890–1918). This collection disappeared during the Nazi period and 25% of the collection appeared on the art market in the early 1950s through Swiss art dealer Eberhard Kornfeld. The fate of the rest is unknown.\n\n\n\n\nTranslated from , which lists as references:\n\n"}
{"id": "5049138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5049138", "title": "Gaymer", "text": "Gaymer\n\nGaymer and gay gamer are umbrella terms used to refer to the group of people who identify themselves as gay and have an active interest in video games or tabletop games, also known as gamers. Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender gamers are often categorized under this term.\n\nThis demographic has been the subject of two large surveys that attracted press coverage: by Jason Rockwood in 2006, who noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure, and another one in 2009 focusing on what gaymers expect of video games. A gaming convention oriented to LGBT gaming and geek culture, GaymerX, first took place on August 3 and 4, 2013, in San Francisco.\n\nSome game publishers introduce LGBT themes in their games to attract this market segment, and news companies cover salient examples of gay-friendly content, and incidents and controversies that these themes raise among their player bases.\n\nChris Vizzini, owner of the gaming site \"Gaymer.org\", was involved with several online communities (in special with Reddit) between 2007 and 2013 in a controversy and legal dispute over the trademark of the term \"gaymer\", which ended when Vizzini surrendered the right to the term and the trademark was cancelled.\n\nIn 2006, a sociological study at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign looked at the gay gamer subgroup focusing on the profile of a \"gaymer\", and concerns they have regarding the perception of them in the gaming community and visibility of gay characters in games. The study's author noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure: \"Gay gamers experience a double edged sword of prejudice... The mainstream gay culture and media is not supportive of video games. Then you have the video game culture that is not supportive of gay culture. So you have these people stuck in the middle who have this double edged prejudice.\" With about 10,000 respondents the survey exhibited a reverse bell curve of gamer sexuality, with most people identifying as either completely heterosexual or homosexual. Only a \"very small minority\" of the respondents to the first survey supported the use of the term \"gaymer\". .\n\nIn late August 2009, Full Sail University student Paul S. Nowak began a second survey of gaymer play preferences. The survey focused on \"questions of content such as plot, genre, customization and other in-game experiences.\"\n\nThe survey team reported that over 7000 people participated in the survey. The results of Nowak's survey were used by Nowak to \"build a profile of the gay gamer community and gain unique insight into this financially untapped demographic\". These results were not published in an academic journal, though a later Nowak's book lists gaymers as preferring role-playing video games, pertaining to the hardcore \"explorer/achiever\" gamer type, and appreciating good plot and good quality \"homosexual content\", which he defines as game content \"which reflects homosexual orientation in a positive or equal-to-heterosexual-orientation context\".\n\nThe believe that young, white, heterosexual males were the force driving the industry forward was strongly challenged by the record-breaking success of \"The Sims\". Video game developer Maxis had resisted Will Wright's goal of creating the title on the grounds that \"girls don't play video games.\" The title was seen as unappealing to young heterosexual males. In the 1990s, the industry began to make some effort to market games to women by creating software titles with strong, independent female characters.\n\nEven some games that are considered to appeal mainly to the non-traditional demographic continue to censor homosexuality. But some video game companies are now moving to further expand their marketing base to include the perceived market of affluent gaymers by including LGBT characters and supporting LGBT rights. Critics of the suppression of gay identity often conclude that, as homosexuality is normalized in broader culture, it will be in video games as well.\n\nLittle is known about what it is like to work within the industry as a gay individual. As a result, much of the information that does come to light is in dispute. Dani Bunten, a Trans woman, designed some of the earliest multiplayer games. In 1996, Jacque Servin, a Maxis employee, was fired when he put implied gay characters into the \"SimCopter\" game. Depending on the news source, Servin claims to have done it because he was upset at being grossly overworked at Maxis or as some type of political statement.\n\nWell-known gay writer and movie director Clive Barker was involved in the creation of games \"Undying\" and \"Jericho\". Both of these games received a personal subtitle \"Clive Barker's\".\n\nOne reason many cite for the lack of visible participation by gaymers is the unwelcoming regulations of in-game interactions such as the creation of and advertisement of queer-friendly guilds in MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Players who attempt to use the general chat channel for recruitment can experience a backlash of harassment and verbal abuse from other players as well as the game moderators. \nIn cases like this, game companies and administrators may alienate game players through intensive policing.\n\nIn 2006, Sara Andrews started a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ)-friendly guild to create a safe place for this community. In January 2006, Andrews used the general chat channel, because most guilds recruit members this way, to recruit players to her LGBTQ-friendly guild ‘‘Oz’’.\n\nAfter posting this, goal administrators quickly contacted Andrews informing her that this was a breach of the games terms of service. The Blizzard terms of service asserts that ‘‘sexual orientation,’’ including both clear and masked language, which ‘‘insultingly refers to any aspect of sexual orientation pertaining to themselves or other players’’ is banned. Andrews ‘‘was warned by a Blizzard game master that this violated the company’s policy on harassment,’’ and ‘‘Blizzard went so far as to threaten Andrews with banishment from the game if she continued’’. Blizzard later apologized for this warning, saying that an administrator misinterpreted the policies against harassment.\n\nVideo game magazine The Escapist devoted Issue 222 to gay gamers and characters with the title \"Queer Eye for the Gamer Guy\" (similar to the TV show title).\n\nThe MMORPG game The Lord of the Rings Online dropped a planned online marriage feature because of the controversy around restrictions on same-sex and inter-species marriage. The online magazine for gaymers \"GayGamer.net\" commented that, while J. R. R. Tolkien was a devout Christian, his stance on gay rights isn't known as the topic wasn't a public issue at the time.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, a Kickstarter project was started for GaymerCon, which was later renamed to GaymerX, for a convention that billed itself as being \"the first gaming convention focused on LGBTQ geek culture.\" Within five days, the Kickstarter project passed the funding goal of $25,000 USD, and after the full funding period of 30 days, the project reached the final total of $91,389.\n\nGaymerX took place on August 3 and 4, 2013, in San Francisco. The event has received support from Electronic Arts and GLAAD.\n\nIn April 2007 Chris Vizzini, owner of the gaming site \"Gaymer.org\", sought to trademark the term \"gaymer\" with respect to online communities and obtained it in March 2008. In 2012, he sent a cease and desist letter to reddit's /r/gaymers \"subreddit\" forum, for alleged trademark infringement. Vizzini has been criticized by the reddit and gaymer communities, who cite examples of use from as early as 1991, and a Yahoo Groups online community with that name created in 2000. Vizzini's website was taken out of service in September, 2012; he has claimed that this was due to a denial of service attack. On two occasions Vizzini posted new threads to the /r/gaymers forum explaining his position and apologizing for \"hurting his own people\", but not for filing the trademark.\n\nOn January 24, 2013, members of /r/gaymers, supported by pro bono lawyers from Perkins Coie and Electronic Frontier Foundation, filed a petition at the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel Vizzini's trademark on the term, on the basis that it was used with that meaning since the mid-1990s. Vizzini reinstated his intent to defend the trademark on the site's name, that he started as an online community on 2003 as a way to build a positive brand from a term that had negative connotations.\n\nOn June 25, 2013, it was announced that Gaymer.org was being officially closed down. On August 22, 2013, the US Patent and Trademark office officially canceled the trademark after Vizzini decided to surrender the mark.\n\nIn 2014 Nintendo, and their life simulator videogame, \"Tomodachi Life\", which allows for the creation of avatars called Mii's to interact with one another came under fire for only allowing opposite sex Mii's to flirt with one another or become married leading to disappointment amongst LGBTQIA+ fans of the company. Nintendo responded by stating that \"Nintendo never intended to make any form of social commentary with the launch of 'Tomodachi Life,'\" Nintendo of America Inc. said in a statement. \"The relationship options in the game represent a playful alternate world rather than a real-life simulation. We hope that all of our fans will see that 'Tomodachi Life' was intended to be a whimsical and quirky game, and that we were absolutely not trying to provide social commentary.\" Nintendo later apologized for the incident and disappointing their fans stating \"We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life,\" Nintendo said in a statement released Friday. \"Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game's design, and such a significant development change can't be accomplished with a post-ship patch.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1942786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942786", "title": "Gershon Legman", "text": "Gershon Legman\n\nGershon Legman (November 2, 1917 – February 23, 1999) was an American cultural critic and folklorist, best known for his books \"The Rationale of the Dirty Joke\" (1968) and \"The Horn Book: Studies in Erotic Folklore and Bibliography\" (1964).\n\nLegman was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania to Emil and Julia Friedman Legman, both of Hungarian-Jewish descent; his father was a railroad clerk and butcher. \nAfter a failed stab at rabbinical school Legman attended and graduated from Scranton's Central High School, where Jane Jacobs and Cy Endfield were classmates. He enrolled in the University of Michigan for one semester in the fall of 1935, but left without sitting for his exams. He then settled in New York City where for a number of years he was a part-time freelance assistant to the physician and sexological researcher Robert Latou Dickinson at the New York Academy of Medicine while simultaneously working in the bookshop of Jacob Brussel, where a brisk business was done in publishing and selling contraband erotica; while spending long hours at the New York Public Library acquiring an autodidactic education. In the late 1940s he became the editor of the little magazine \"Neurotica\".\n\nThroughout his career Legman was an independent scholar without institutional affiliation, except for one year during 1964–1965 when he was a writer in residence at the University of California, San Diego, in the first year of the new campus' undergraduate programs. He pioneered the serious academic study of erotic and taboo materials in folklore. He also was a talented raconteur and could spin out tales non-stop for hours.\n\nAs a young man he acquired a number of interests including sexuality, erotic folklore, also origami—for which he was a pivotal figure in founding the modern international movement. In 1940, at age 23, Legman wrote \"Oragenitalism, Part I: Cunnilinctus\" under the pen name Roger-Maxe de la Glannège (an anagram of his real name). Nearly all copies were seized by the police and destroyed in a raid on Jake Brussel's shop. For a period of time, Legman was a bibliographic researcher and book scout for the Kinsey Institute.\n\nIn 1949, he published \"Love and Death\", an attack on sexual censorship, arguing that American culture was permissive of graphic violence in proportion to, and as a consequence of, its repression of the erotic. Legman published and shipped the treatise himself, although he ran afoul of the United States Post Office Department authorities, who stopped his deliveries due to the supposed \"indecent, vulgar, and obscene\" content. The book also included a chapter that attacked contemporary pre-Code comic books as harmful to children for their celebration of violence, foreshadowing the later crusade against the comic book industry dominated by Fredric Wertham.\n\n\"Love and Death\" was an outgrowth of the little magazine \"Neurotica\", edited by Jay Landesman and published in nine issues between 1948 and 1952. Legman was a regular contributor and eventually took over from Landesman as editor. Other contributors included John Clellon Holmes, Larry Rivers, Carl Solomon, Judith Malina, Allen Ginsberg, Marshall McLuhan, and Kenneth Patchen, which gave it influence disproportionate to its small circulation of a few thousand. The magazine had a few clashes with the authorities, and closed after the censors objected to an article on castration written by Legman.\n\nThe full set of \"Neurotica\" was reprinted in one volume by Hacker Art Books, New York, in 1963. \"The Horn Book : Studies in Erotic Folklore and Bibliography\" was a collection of assorted writings from the 1950s and 1960s. Legman was a prolific writer of essays, reviews, and scholarly introductions, including those for the anonymous Victorian erotic memoir \"My Secret Life\" (1966), Aleksandr Afanasyev's \"Russian Secret Tales\" (1966), and Mark Twain's \"The Mammoth Cod\" (1976). He supplemented his income at times through the sale of rare erotica.\n\nOn account of his trial for violating United States Post Office regulations in his distributing his book \"Love & Death\", Legman found it prudent to depart the United States.\n\nIn 1953 Legman left his native United States for a farm, \"La Clé des Champs\", in the village of Valbonne in the South of France, where he was able to pursue his intellectual interests with greater freedom. In 1955 he organized an exhibition of Akira Yoshizawa's origami at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.\n\nLegman spent several decades compiling specimens of bawdy humor including limericks. In 1970, his first volume of over 1,700 limericks (published in 1953 by Les Hautes Etudes, Paris) was released in the United States as \"The Limerick\". He followed this with a second volume, \"The New Limerick\" in 1977, which was reprinted as \"More Limericks\" in 1980. His magnum opus was \"Rationale of the Dirty Joke: (An Analysis of Sexual Humor)\", a tour de force of erotic folklore, succeeded by \"No Laughing Matter : Rationale of the Dirty Joke: An Analysis of Sexual Humor, 2nd Series\", for which a subscription had to be paid to support publishing, as no publisher would touch it after Grove did volume one in 1968. Near the end of his life, Legman edited \"Roll Me in Your Arms\" and \"Blow the Candle Out,\" two volumes of bawdy songs and lore collected by Vance Randolph (both 1992). Other achievements include his edition of Robert Burns' \"The Merry Muses of Caledonia\" (1965).\n\nThe title \"Peregrine Penis\" of Gershon Legman's yet-unpublished autobiography was a sobriquet bestowed on him by his girlfriend Louise \"Beka\" Doherty, on account of the fact that he \"used to travel to meet her in strange places.\" The writing of \"Peregrine Penis\", over \"six hundred pages\" in length, was continually subsidized by Larry McMurtry.\n\nOn September 5, 2016, Book One of Gershon Legman's autobiography became available as a print-on-demand, two-volume set, carefully edited by Judith Evans Legman (G. Legman's widow), under the title \"I Love You, I Really Do\". On March 8, 2017, Book Two appeared in a third volume, under the title \"Mooncalf\", which continues the story of Legman's life up to the eve of World War II.\nBook Three, \"World I Never Made\", was released in a fourth volume in August 2017. A fifth volume, \"Musick to My Sorrow\", was published in March 2018, and a sixth volume, \"Windows of Winter & Flagrant Delectations\", appeared in October 2018.\n\nLegman was in many senses a radical, but never identified with the movements of his time, decrying the sexual revolution, for example, in \"The Fake Revolt\" (1967), and leaving countless irascible \"obiter dicta\" on such topics as women's liberation, rock and roll and the psychedelic movement's use of mind-altering substances. However, he said he was the inventor of the famous phrase \"Make love, not war\", in a lecture given at the University of Ohio in 1963. He remained essentially an individualist and an idealist: \"I consider sexual love the central mystery and central reality of life\", he wrote. And \"I believe in a personal and intense style, and in making value judgements [\"sic\"]. This is unfashionable now, but is the only responsible position\". Mikita Brottman offers the consensus view of Legman as, in many ways, his own worst enemy, exacerbating his rejection by the academic community with vitriolic attacks upon it.\n\nIn Bruce Jackson's view \"Legman is the person, more than any other, who made research into erotic folklore and erotic verbal behavior academically respectable\" and who made accessible to other scholars material that scholarly journals had long been afraid to publish.\n\nGershon Legman died February 23, 1999, in his adopted home country, France, after several years of debility, and a week after suffering a massive stroke.\n\nAccording to George Chauncey's book \"Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940\", Legman was a homosexual and is credited with having invented the vibrating dildo when he was only twenty. However, Mikita Brottman holds that he was exclusively heterosexual, accounting for both the abandonment of his proposed volume on fellatio as well as, possibly and in some measure, for his contempt for Alfred Kinsey. He was married for many years to Beverley Keith (died of lung cancer, 1966), married briefly to Christine Conrad, a possibly bigamous relationship, ended either by annulment or divorce, then to Judith Evans.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6997435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6997435", "title": "Herr Kleiser", "text": "Herr Kleiser\n\nHerr Kleiser is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has appeared in \"Ultimate\" comic books. The character first appeared in \"Ultimates\" #10 (July 2003) and was created by writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch.\n\nKleiser was a high-ranking member of the alien hierarchy known as the Chitauri, and was part of a group who infiltrated Earth during World War II. Taking the form of a Nazi officer named Kleiser (by absorbing and devouring him), he and his fellow aliens contacted the Nazi party and attempted to help them win the war by offering advanced technology. The Chitauri wished to utilize the Nazis to conquer Earth and impose \"order\", erasing all individuality, which they saw as an aberration. Near the end of the war, Herr Kleiser faced Captain America, and was defeated not by brute force but by clever strategy and misdirection; Kleiser never forgot this humiliating defeat. For decades, Kleiser and the other Chitauri slowly built a new power base and secretly influenced human affairs to prepare for another takeover attempt. 60 years later, Herr Kleiser infiltrated the S.H.I.E.L.D. Psi-Division, and planted false information designed to lure the Ultimates to an island in Micronesia where they were supposed to be destroyed by a nuclear device. However, Iron Man's force field and Thor's dimension-warping hammer allowed the Ultimates to escape unharmed, although thousands of S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel were killed. Kleiser and the remainder of his troops also infiltrated the Triskelion, the headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates. He captured The Wasp and brought her to Area 51 in the desert near Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nA short time later the remnants of the Chitauri fleet came to Earth and informed Kleiser they were soon to destroy the planet; at this point it was revealed the Ultimates had survived and a large battle began. During this fight Herr Kleiser and Captain America finally engaged in personal combat, during which Kleiser demonstrated superhuman strength, great durability and near-instant healing, as well as being able to perceive General Fury while the latter was in \"light-negative\" (invisible) mode. Captain America was nearly overcome by Kleiser and briefly ended this battle by cutting the alien in half. However this did not finish him and Captain America had to have Bruce Banner intentionally traumatised so as to bring out the Hulk. Captain America then told the Hulk that Kleiser had been \"all over Betty\" and the Hulk promptly pounded Kleiser into the ground, tore him apart and ate him. The invading fleet was defeated, and Iron Man and Thor disposed of the alien's Doomsday bomb. Banner's excretions were later collected by S.H.I.E.L.D. to analyze and destroy, as Herr Kleiser was a shapeshifter and might have been able to survive even the digestive process.\n\nHerr Kleiser is a skilled fighter, able to sustain a long and brutal combat against Captain America, and then holding a resistance to various direct blows from the Incredible Hulk. He is revealed to have healing powers strong enough to cure a direct shot to the head, being cut in half and escape unharmed from a jet's explosion. He also has superhuman strength and the ability to shapeshift.\n\nHerr Kleiser appears as a minor antagonist in \"Ultimate Avengers\" and as the main antagonist in \"Ultimate Avengers 2: Rise of the Panther\" voiced by Jim Ward (who would later voice another Captain America Nazi villain, Baron Strucker). In the first film, he is present at a top secret Nazi base where the Nazi/Chitauri are perfecting a nuclear rocket to launch at America, until seemingly killed by Cap while fighting on the rocket. In the second film, Kleiser under orders from the Chitauri hierarchy, invades Wakanda to reclaim their Vibranium shipment shot down in the '40s. Kleiser was then buried in a field of the mineral by Captain America and the Black Panther, the latter whose father, King T'Chalka, was murdered by Kleiser at the beginning of the film. In the final conflict, Panther and Cap sealed Kleiser in Wakanda's vibranium deposits.\n"}

The mother to six children, it was her youngest two, Ruth (now Kramer) and Joe Rappaport, who inspired her on a cold and snowy February morning. To entertain them, she declared it to be Ice Cream For Breakfast Day. She explained, \"It was cold and snowy and the kids were complaining that it was too cold to do anything. So I just said, 'Let's have ice cream for breakfast.'\" The next year, they reminded her of the day and a tradition began. The exact year of the first ICFBD is unrecorded, but it is speculated to be 1966, when a huge blizzard hit Rochester in late January, dumping several feet of snow on Rochester and shutting down schools. When the siblings grew up, they held parties and introduced the tradition to friends while in college, and the tradition began to spread.\n\nThe holiday began to spread across the world thanks to Florence's grandchildren, who have traveled extensively. Celebrations have been recorded in Nepal, Namibia, Germany, New Zealand and Honduras. Some are small family celebrations and others are larger parties. The holiday has even been celebrated in China since 2003 and was featured in the Chinese edition of \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine and local magazines in Hangzhou, China. Ice Cream for Breakfast Day enjoys particular popularity in Israel. Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" reported on ICFBD in 2013 in Hebrew and then in 2014 in English \n\nIce Cream For Breakfast Day is officially celebrated on the first Saturday of February. The holiday is often explained very simply: \n\nFlorence Rappaport and her children never imagined how far their made-up holiday's influence would spread. \nIn recent years, several ice cream shops around the United States have started to use Ice Cream for Breakfast Day to raise money for charities (and to attract some cold weather customers).

{"id": "13685436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13685436", "title": "Income tax on gambling", "text": "Income tax on gambling\n\nRules concerning income tax and gambling vary internationally.\n\nIn Germany, wins are taxable since July 2012 by 5% of the winnings (profit).\nIf for example you placed a bet of €10 at an odd of 2.00, then your total return (not including the taxes) is €20, however after the tax deductions, your return will be only €19.50 (€10.00 x 2.00 = €20.00 - (5% *€10.00 (your total profit)) = €19.50).\n\nFor online poker, however, because of a hairy legislation, the wins are not taxable yet.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, wins (unless in the course of a trade) are not taxable and losses are not deductible.\n\nIn the United States, gambling wins are taxable.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code contains a specific provision regulating income-tax deductions of gambling losses. Under Section 165(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, losses from “wagering transactions” may be deducted to the extent of gains from gambling activities. Essentially, in order to qualify for a deduction of losses from wagering, the taxpayer can only deduct \"up to\" the amount of gains he or she accrued from wagering. In \"Commissioner v. Groetzinger\", the Supreme Court Justice Blackmun alludes to Section 165(d) which was a legislative attempt to close the door on suspected abuse of gambling loss deductions.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has ruled that a “wagering transaction” consists of three elements. First, the transaction must involve a prize. Second, the element of chance must be present. Finally, the taxpayer must give some consideration.\n\nIn \"Bathalter v. Commissioner\", a full-time horse-race gambler had gains of $91,000 and losses of $87,000. The taxpayer deducted the expenses under Section 162. The service argued that Section 165(d) precluded the taxpayer from engaging in gambling as a \"trade or business.\" The Tax Court held that the taxpayer's gambling was a business activity and allowed the deductions. In essence, the court held that Section 165(d) only applies when a taxpayer is at a loss instead of a net gain and “serves to prevent the [taxpayer] from using that loss to offset other income.” However, if the taxpayer has a net gain, as the horse-race gambler did, then the taxpayer may deduct the expenses under Section 162, and Section 165(d) does not apply.\n\nIn addition, in \"Valenti v. Commissioner\", the court reiterated that Section 165(d) applies to professional gamblers as well as recreational gamblers. The court stated, \"... it has been held both by this Court and various courts of appeals that wagering losses cannot be deducted, except to the extent of the taxpayer's gains from wagering activities, and it has been so held even where such activities were conducted as a trade or business as opposed to a hobby.\" Therefore, for example, if a recreational gambler visits a casino one Saturday and accumulates $600 of losses and $200 of gains, that recreational gambler may deduct $200 of the wagering losses (because she can only deduct an amount up to the amount of wagering gains she accrued).\n\n"}

She was the first known female tattoo artist in the United States.\n\nWagner was born in 1877, in Lyon County, Kansas, to David Van Buran Stevens and Sarah Jane McGee.\n\nWagner was an aerialist and contortionist, working in numerous traveling circuses. She met Gus Wagner—a tattoo artist who described himself as \"the most artistically marked up man in America\" while traveling with circuses and sideshows—at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (World's Fair) in 1904, where she was working as an aerialist. She exchanged a romantic date with him for a lesson in tattooing, and several years later they were married. Together they had a daughter, Lotteva, who started tattooing at the age of nine and went on to become a tattoo artist herself.\n\nAs an apprentice of her husband, Wagner learned how to give traditional \"hand-poked\" tattoos—despite the invention of the tattoo machine—and became a tattooist herself. Together, the Wagners were two of the last tattoo artists to work by hand, without the aid of modern tattoo machines. Maud Wagner was the United States' first known female tattoo artist.\n\nAfter leaving the circus, Maud and Gus Wagner traveled around the United States, working both as tattoo artists and \"tattooed attractions\" in vaudeville houses, county fairs and amusement arcades.

The estimated attendance in 2008 was 13,500. This doubled to 27,000 people in 2012.

{"id": "3334742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3334742", "title": "Pseudo-documentary", "text": "Pseudo-documentary\n\nA pseudo-documentary is a film or video production that takes the form or style of a documentary film but does not portray real events. Rather, scripted and fictional elements are used to tell the story. The pseudo-documentary, unlike the related mockumentary, is not always intended as satire or humor. It may use documentary camera techniques but with fabricated sets, actors, or situations, and it may use digital effects to alter the filmed scene or even create a wholly synthetic scene.\n\nOrson Welles gained notoriety with his radio show and hoax \"War of the Worlds\" which fooled listeners into thinking the Earth was being invaded by Martians. Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum says this is Welles' first pseudo-documentary. Pseudo-documentary elements were subsequently used in his feature films. For instance, Welles created a pseudo-documentary newsreel which appeared within his 1941 film \"Citizen Kane\", and he began his 1955 film, \"Mr. Arkadin\", with a pseudo-documentary prologue.\n\nThe film \"Mad Max 2\" first frames the story by showing a staged documentary-style sequence of images designed to inform the viewer that what follows is the aftermath of an apocalyptic global war.\n\nThe methods of pseudo-documentary have been sharply criticized in some cases, notably with the 1991 Oliver Stone film \"JFK\", which mixes fact with fiction to advance Stone's point that John F. Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. The film cuts confusingly between actual footage of alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and staged images of actor Gary Oldman who is playing Oswald. The modern sequences are badly lit and they are artificially made grainy and scratched-looking so that they appear to be 1963-era 16 mm film. Stone uses the pseudo-documentary format to influence the viewer by presenting the conspiracy theory in a scientific and authoritative manner.\n\nRelated to, and in exact opposition to pseudo-documentary, is the notion of “fake-fiction”. A fake-fiction film takes the form of a staged, fictional movie, while actually portraying real, unscripted events.\n\nThe notion of fake-fiction was coined by Pierre Bismuth to describe his 2016 film \",\" which uses documentary method to tell a real, unscripted story, but is shot and edited to appear like a fiction film. The effect of this fictional aesthetic is precisely to cancel the sense of reality, making the real events appear as if they were staged or constructed.\n\nUnlike mockumentary, fake-fiction does not focus on satire, and in distinction with docufiction, it does not re-stage fictional versions of real past events.\n\nAnother filmmaker whose work could be associated with the concept of fake-fiction is Gianfranco Rosi. For example, \"Below Sea Level\" uses the language of fiction cinema in its rendering of unscripted, documentary material. Of his own work, Rosi said, \"I don’t care if I'm making a fiction film or documentary — to me it's a film, it's a narrative thing.\"\n\nThe term found footage has sometimes been used to describe pseudo-documentaries where the plot involves the discovery of the film's footage. Found footage is originally the name of an entirely different genre, but the magazine \"Variety\", for example, used the term \"faux found-footage film\" to describe the 2012 film \"Grave Encounters 2\". The film scholar David Bordwell has criticized this recent use because of the confusion it creates, and instead prefers the term \"discovered footage\" for the narrative gimmick.\n\nPseudo-documentary forms have appeared in television advertisements and campaign advertising. The \"Revolving Door\" ad used in the US presidential campaign of 1988 to attack candidate Michael Dukakis showed scripted scenes intended to look like documentary footage of men entering and exiting a prison through a revolving door. Boston-based band the Del Fuegos appeared in a 1984 commercial for Miller beer, with scripted scenes shot in hand-held camera/pseudo-documentary style. The band was criticized for selling out and for the falseness of the commercial; founding member Warren Zanes said making the ad was a mistake, that their core audience turned away, and the larger audience gained by the exposure did not maintain interest for long.\n\nPeter Greenaway employed pseudo-documentary style in his French television production \"Death on the Seine\" in 1988. He used fabricated scenes to reconstruct a historic event that was otherwise impossible to shoot, and portrayed it as reality.\n\nReality television has been described as a form of pseudo-documentary. An early and influential example is 1992's \"The Real World\" by MTV, a scripted \"reality\" show bordering on soap opera.\n\n"}

Since its foundation, the organisation has expanded to twenty one locations across the greater Melbourne area to become one of the largest performing arts tuition providers in the state of Victoria.\n\nStage School offers several streams of training which, depending on the age of the young people, can be conducted separately or concurrently. Most streams have a hierarchical structure wherein students may be promoted to a more advanced group, based on the student's skill level and experience.\n\nIn 1995, the CPCA established four theatre ensembles with a strong musical theatre focus. These expanded to become what is now known as the Young Australian Broadway Chorus (YABC), the stream which trains students in singing, dancing and acting.\n\nThe YABC's first performance was held in 1998 at the National Theatre in St Kilda - a gala performance much simpler than the more extravagant shows that are put on in the same theatre by YABC students today.\n\nThe Victorian Youth Theatre (VYT) is the drama branch of Stage School's performing arts training activities, which originally traded in the 1980s as the Victorian Children's Theatre. While trading as the Victorian Children's Theatre, the course focused largely on improvised drama, but eventually the curriculum was expanded to include script work and acting for the camera. \n\nStage School Australia also operates as a performing arts company and have been putting on multiple stage productions annually for two decades.

It is the second sequel to \"The Bard's Tale\". It was designed by Rebecca Heineman, Bruce Schlickbernd, and Michael A. Stackpole. The game was released for the Amiga, Apple II (64k), Commodore 64 and MS-DOS.\n\nThe player characters receive a letter from a dying man who informs them that, during a celebration of your defeat of the evil wizard Mangar, his true master—the Mad God Tarjan—arrived and unleashed foul creatures which destroyed the town of Skara Brae. The box cover states it thus:\nSkara Brae is in ruins. Roscoe's Energy Emporium stands vacant. The Equipment Shoppe went under so quickly Garth was crushed. Your Bard hasn't stopped whimpering since he realized all the taverns were closed... Someone—or some thing—has sealed the city's fate with an evil so vast, so unspeakable, that a host of Paladins and an army of Archmages are out-matched. Hard times call for subtlety. Smaller is better. Sneakier is better. What the world needs now is a thief. The Thief of Fate.\n\nThe game begins in a refugee camp outside the ruined Skara Brae, which replaces the now-destroyed adventurer's guild from the previous games. Besides the city ruins, the wilderness features a temple for healing, a tavern, and a number of special locations from where the party will embark on missions to other worlds over the course of their quest.\n\nSkara Brae was scaled down considerably. The ruins are 16x16 map tiles instead of the city's 30x30 layout from \"The Bard's Tale I\", though its layout remains recognizable. In the ruins of the Review Board, an old man—the sole survivor—directs the party to first kill one Brilhasti ap Tarj, a servant of the mad god Tarjan, in the \"Mad God\" dungeon below Skara Brae, a startup quest for the characters to attain power which can be ignored if powerful characters were carried over from previous games. Next, the old man orders the party to retrieve artifacts from several other worlds and also teaches the group the chronomancer spells to be used at certain points in the wilderness to travel to these parallel dimensions and back:\n\nWith Tarjan defeated, it is revealed that the player party took the places of the deities Tarjan killed, becoming a set of new stars in the sky.\n\nThis dungeon crawl game featured several improvements over its predecessors:\n\n\nAccording to Shay Addams, \"The Bard's Tale III\" is:\n\nA 1988 review in \"Computer Gaming World\" described \"Bard's Tale III\" as an improvement over its predecessor, but \"still too heavily oriented towards mega-combat.\" The magazine in 1993 stated that \"the series redeemed itself with the third installment\", flawed though it was\", adding that \"the best parts are the quests themselves ... worth playing\". One of the chief complaints with the game is, unlike in the first two titles, where spell points (which are expended to use spells) could be recharged instantly an unlimited number of times for a fee at Roscoe's Energy Emporium, there is no such method in this title. To recharge spellpoints of a spellcaster, the player must either spend time in outdoor areas during the day, allowing spellpoints to gradually regenerate, or find and use an item called a harmonic gem, which are limited in number within the game.\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1988 in \"Dragon\" #138 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.\n\nMichael Cranford, the creator of the \"Bard's Tale\" series, was not involved in this sequel, as he had decided to leave Interplay to study philosophy and theology.\n\n\"The Bard's Tale III\" programmer Heineman has said that the original name of this game was to be \"Tales of the Unknown - Volume III: The Thief's Tale\". Heineman also once sought to continue creating new \"Bard's Tale\" games, but was unsuccessful in obtaining the rights from Electronic Arts.\n\nMichael A. Stackpole created the storyline of \"The Bard's Tale III\", and made maps for it. He has since become a successful author, and has penned many novels in the hugely popular Star Wars and BattleTech series.\n\nBruce Schlickbernd and Michael Stackpole also collaborated on Interplay's \"Wasteland\", \"\", and \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "8582797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8582797", "title": "The Crossing (video game)", "text": "The Crossing (video game)\n\nThe Crossing was set to be a first-person shooter video game by Arkane Studios, which attempted to fuse single-player and multiplayer by threading its single-player campaign through live multiplayer games.\n\nThe game was first announced on 9 January 2007, but put \"on hold\" on 15 May 2009 after the company ran into \"an unexpected financial challenge\" and decided to focus on smaller projects. \"The Crossing\" was later officially cancelled for Arkane Studios to work on \"LMNO\" with Electronic Arts and Steven Spielberg.\n\nIn October 2016, ZeniMax Media, which acquired Arkane Studios in August 2010, filed a new trademark for \"The Crossing\".\n\nThe game incorporated the idea of parallel universes, and was to be set across two vastly different renditions of modern day Paris. In one universe, which shares many aesthetic similarities to our own, Paris has descended into chaos following the collapse of government. In the other, the timeline diverged in 1307; where instead of being disbanded, the Knights Templar seize control of the French crown. The story takes the player across both universes.\n\n\"The Crossing\" was to be a first-person shooter which supported a narrative-driven single-player game, but with the player's opponents replaced by human-controlled agents via a multi-player system, an approach called \"crossplayer\" by Arkane. In this single-player mode, the single player would work through a game level amid the conflict of a team-based deathmatch game, with teams assigned to either protect or assassinate the character controlled by the single player. The game also was to include a team-based multiplayer mode called skirmish, which is also incorporated into the single-player campaign, where the main player might try to avoid the skirmish.\n\nThe idea of \"The Crossing\" was to try to find a way to fuse a narrative-driven single player game with multiplayer elements, with human-controlled players to take the place of some of the enemies in the single-player campaign. This amalgamation was dubbed \"crossplayer\" by Arkane. Raphaël Colantonio, Arkane's chief executive officer at the time, said that as a studio they wanted to try a multiplayer game, but felt the standard multiplayer approach in most games was \"pointless\" and wanted to explore a different formula.\n\nThis approach necessitated level designs that had the single player navigating through linear sections of levels until they reached a choke point where they would encounter the team-based multiplayer battles. During the player traversing linear sections, the game would have brought the multiplayer teams to spawn into or near the upcoming choke point, so that these players would always feel close to the core action of the game. According to Colantonio, this approach required them to rethink how they designed levels; they recognized that they needed to continue to drive the single player forward through the level, unable to have them stop to solve puzzles or analyze enemy movements, while also making some of the choke point areas interesting for the other players.\n\nFor the game's story and setting, Arkane wanted to create a new intellectual property (IP) for them to build on. Colantonio brought in Viktor Antonov, an artist that had been working for Valve Corporation and had helped Arkane with the Source engine during their development of \"Dark Messiah of Might and Magic\" (2006). As both Colantonio and Antonov had lived in Paris for some time in their lives, they came upon the idea of a \"dystopia-utopia\" setting in Paris, where part of the city was a \"royal upotia\" while the other half had fallen into squalor; this reflected on the different experiences that Colantonio and Antonov had from how they came to live in Paris, and recognizing that Paris itself is a \"city of contrasts\". As a backstory, they envisioned a world where scientists had developed time travel through various portals, and used it to change the past and create alternate dimensions in the present, then taking the best of technology advancements from that to improve the original reality. \"The Crossing\" would have started where an incident involving the time travel portal in the center of Paris have been misused to create the cacophony of different parts of Paris. The player discovers that Knights Templar with high-tech weapons have invaded Paris, and would be forced to find the portal to try to set things right.\n\nWith some of the gameplay and the narrative down, Arkane began talking about the game with the gaming press, including a cover story on \"Games for Windows\", generating interest in the title, but had not yet secured a publisher. Colantonio pitched the idea to the core 20 publishers at that time, but none of them expressed interest in the idea as a whole, instead talking about focusing only on parts of \"The Crossing\" such as using the narrative in another gameplay setting, or having only focus on the single-player. Colantonio stated that these publishers were also concerned about Arkane seeking to focus on the personal computer release over consoles, and the lack of plans for a PlayStation 3 port, at the time, a limitation of the Source engine having yet to be ported to that console. The publishers also expressed concern about the matchmaking capabilities of the game; Arkane brought in Max Hoberman, who developed the \"Halo 2\" matchmaking system, to try to alleviate publisher fears. A further challenge from publishers according to Colantonio was the high development costs they wanted, looking for between and , which was an expensive budget for a game at that time particularly from a studio that had yet to establish its own identity.\n\nEventually, Arkane found one unnamed publisher that was interested in the entire concept of \"The Crossing\". They spent about six months negotiating with this publisher, but Colantonio said as time progressed, the negotiations worsened, with a smaller proposed budget and requiring them to do a PlayStation 3 version. Colantonio decided after six months that they were not going to be able to achieve the vision they wanted with \"The Crossing\", and ceased negotiations with the publisher and effectively shelving game. Arkane switched over to continue contract work with Valve, and started work with Electronic Arts on a Steven Spielberg-backed game, \"LMNO\", itself which was ultimately cancelled.\n\nWhile \"The Crossing\" never came to fruition, Colantonio said that it was an important foundation of Arkane Studio as it helped with team-building, establishing a vision for their own IP, and the processes needed to carry that out, which they used in building the \"Dishonored\" series. During the 2018 QuakeCon, Arkane's lead designer Ricardo Bare stated that their future projects were looking at multiplayer functionality that they had been envisioning in \"The Crossing\" as to provide seamless multiplayer functionality alongside single-player content.\n"}

This book represents choices for the 50 worst sound films ever made, in alphabetical order. The book features a story synopsis for each film, the authors' opinion of its quality, and reprints a selection of contemporary reviews of the films.\n\nThe book intentionally excludes silent films because the authors consider them to be \"a separate and unique art form and that judging them alongside talkies would be like weighing apples together with oranges\". In compiling their list, the authors used egregious examples to represent less reputable film genres, such as blaxploitation films (\"Trouble Man\"). The book limits the foreign films considered to only those distributed in the United States, judging it unfair to evaluate local obscurities denied an international release alongside mainstream Hollywood products, while realizing that it would not only be difficult for the authors to view the films, but unlikely that any readers would ever come across them.\n\nThe Medveds later continued this theme of \"celebrating\" bad cinema with \"The Golden Turkey Awards\" which again showcased bad and obscure films, and \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame\" which examined in some detail several major Hollywood \"financial\" disasters, focusing on both the artistic treatments coupled with the technical and organizational ineptitude in the mounting of these films. It has been noted that the book marked the beginning of an explosion of \"worst in cinema\" prizes nearly resulting in \"a state of redundancy almost approaching that of ordinary prizes.\"\n\nAlthough a number of low-budget science-fiction productions are cited, the book also lists many mainstream features, including: \"Airport 1975\", \"Alakazam the Great\", \"At Long Last Love\", \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\", \"Hurry Sundown\", \"King Richard and the Crusaders\", \"Last Year at Marienbad\", \"Lost Horizon\", \"Myra Breckinridge\", \"The Omen\", \"Say One for Me\", \"Solomon and Sheba\" and an Elvis Presley vehicle, \"Spinout\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "410458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=410458", "title": "Watershed (broadcasting)", "text": "Watershed (broadcasting)\n\nIn broadcasting, the watershed or safe harbour is one or more dayparts during which it is appropriate to broadcast programming aimed towards mature or adult audiences.\n\nIn the same way that a watershed refers to the crest dividing two drainage basins, a broadcasting watershed generally serves as a dividing line in a schedule between family-oriented programs, and programs aimed at or suitable for a more adult audience, such as those containing objectionable content (including graphic violence, profane language, nudity, and sexual intercourse, or strong references to these themes without necessarily portraying them).\n\nIn some countries, watersheds are enforced by broadcasting laws. Due to cultural differences around the world, watershed times can vary; for instance, in Australia, the watershed time starts at 19:30 (7:30 p.m.), and in Italy it starts at 22:30 (10:30 p.m.). Some countries also have multiple watershed layers, where less inappropriate content than others may be allowed at an earlier time of the evening, but may still be restricted. In addition, some countries are more lenient towards subscription television and radio or pay-per-view channels than towards free-to-air channels.\n\nIn Argentina, any programmes broadcast between 06:00 or 07:00 and 22:00 or 22:30 must be suitable for all ages. There are also three other ratings, such as SAM 13, SAM 16 and SAM 18, and can only be broadcast during the broadcast time that was not covered by any programme suitable for family viewing.\n\nStarting in September 2010, it is compulsory for broadcasters to show the notices \"Comienza el horario apto para todo público\" () and \"Finaliza el horario apto para todo público\" () at 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. respectively. In addition, the notice \"Atención: Contenido no apto para niños, niñas y adolescentes\" () are shown before news broadcasts.\n\nOn Australian television, programmes are restricted to certain times based on their rating. As of December 2015, PG-rated programmes can be now shown at any time of day, M-rated programmes can be shown from 19:30, and MA15+ programmes from 20:30. As well as this, M-rated programmes can also be shown from 12:00 to 15:00 on school days.\n\nDue to complications with Australian time zones, this can vary slightly in some areas. For example, when daylight saving time is in effect in New South Wales, NSW-based stations broadcasting to the Gold Coast, Queensland would effectively push the broadcast watersheds an hour earlier, as Queensland does not observe DST; however, complaints by Gold Coast residents have forced those stations to delay prime-time programming by one hour to compensate.\n\nWith the exception of subscription narrowcast channels, anything rated R18+ must not be shown on Australian television at any time, and must be edited to fit within MA15+ or AV15+ guidelines. Even on subscription narrowcast channels, the owner of the channel must ensure that its content is restricted to access by those with appropriate disabling devices.\n\nThere is no legally binding watershed period in Austria. However, according to its regulations, the public service broadcaster's channels do not air content which might harm the physical, mental or moral development of minors before 20:15; and when fictional programmes \"not suitable for children\" or \"only for adults\" are aired, an X or O, respectively, is added to the digital on-screen graphic.\n\nThe watershed is between 21:00 (9:00 p.m.) and 06:00 (6:00 a.m.). Sexually explicit content, offensive language and other adult material is not allowed outside the watershed. Because of the size of the country, however, the same issues regarding time zones that plague the US and \"watershed\" issues impact Canada, wherein an adult-oriented program aired post-watershed in one part of the country may be received pre-watershed in other parts of the country.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, only programmes that \"can be watched by children\" can be aired until 22:00. After 22:00, adult-orientated programmes may be aired.\n\nIn Finland, all the major television companies (Yle, MTV Media, Nelonen Media, SBS Finland and Fox International) have agreed not to show 16-rated content before 21:00 and 18-rated content before 23:00. Television channels use their own discretion to decide the ratings. Before airing a programme, the channel must provide the related rating information to the governmental bureau Finnish Centre for Media Education and Audiovisual Media, which replaced the now-defunct Finnish Board of Film Classification in this capacity at the beginning of 2012.\n\nIn France, -12 rated programmes/films are not allowed before 22:00, and -16/-18 rated programmes/films are not allowed before 22:30 and 00:00\nrespectively. -18 rated programmes/films can only air via satellite and cable. The watershed for all ratings finishes at 06:00 the following morning except for -18 programmes that can't be issued after 05:00.\n\nThere is also one additional rating that is not used in films; -10. -10 rated programmes signifies content less intense than -12 rated programmes. All programmes and films must display the respective icon on-screen for the duration of the programme. Before December 2012, -10 rated programmes had to display the respective icon on-screen at the start and in regular intervals.\n\nIn Germany, the watershed is between 22:00 and 06:00 for content suitable for ages 16 and older, and between 23:00 and 06:00 for content suitable for adults (18 and older). This means that programmes marked \"Keine Jugendfreigabe\" (not approved for minors) by the ratings organization FSK may only be shown after 23:00. Blacklisted movies may not be aired at any time. For some content rated 12 and up, the watershed is between 20:00 and 06:00, but there is no general watershed for such content.\n\nIf a commercial broadcaster wants to air a programme not rated by the FSK, the programme’s watershed is rated by the FSF (Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen – Voluntary Self Regulation for TV) instead. A programme with neither an FSK nor FSF rating is not usually aired by commercial broadcasters, as the KJM (Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz – Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media) may charge a fine if it finds the content inappropriate. To avoid the original watershed for a programme or to air a blacklisted movie, commercial broadcasters can ask the FSF to tell them how to cut the movie for another rating.\n\nGreece uses a triple-tier watershed, along with a five-tier colour-coded decal scheme, displayed at the beginning and at regular intervals during all broadcasts except for news bulletins.\n\nThe colour-coded ratings are mandatorily displayed and verbally announced at the beginning of each broadcast. These provisions are enforced by the National Radio and Television Council (ESR), an independent authority, the executive members of which are appointed by the leaders of all parliamentary parties, preferably by unanimous consent and in extremis by an 80% supermajority.\n\nHungary uses a double-tier watershed.\n(On the other hand, Hungarian television prime time ends about 23:30 CET.\n\n\"For more information about the two ratings' meaning, see this article.\"\n\nIndia currently does not have a watershed. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is responsible for regulating television programming. The current law only permits material rated with a 'U' (Universal) certificate to be broadcast on television, but this law is regularly disobeyed. The government has, at times, ordered individual programmes and films to be broadcast between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. There have been several proposals in the past to introduce a watershed between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. daily, when programming rated 'A' (Adults Only) can be broadcast, but all proposals till date have been rejected by the government.\n\nIn Ireland, there is no statutory requirement for a watershed. The \"Code of Programme Standards\" of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) requires television and radio broadcasters to use at least one of three methods to advise viewers of content, namely: an explicit watershed for adult-oriented programmes; prior warnings before potentially offensive programming; and/or a descriptive classification system. A 2005 survey for the drafters of the \"Code\" found that 83% of viewers thought a watershed was a good idea; only 39% knew the pre-existing watershed was 21:00; 52% felt it should be 22:00 or 23:00. The 2007 \"Code\" specifies that broadcasters using a watershed must regularly promote it, and its start and end times, for viewers' awareness.\n\nRTÉ Television implements a watershed of 21:00, as well as an onscreen classification system. Programmes with the \"MA\" (\"mature audience\") classification are only shown after the watershed. Programmes running through the watershed are treated as pre-watershed. RTÉ's guidelines state, \"A cornerstone of our contract with television viewers is the watershed and the understanding that prior to 21.00 material broadcast should be suitable for a family audience. ... The immediately post 21.00 broadcast period should be regarded as a graduation period towards more adult material and due allowance must be made for the potential presence of children in the audience\". More nuanced limits may also be applied; for example, RTÉ cleared a trailer for horror film \"Paranormal Activity\" for broadcast after 19:00, except during the Saturday evening film which many children watch. TV3 operates what it calls \"the internationally accepted watershed\" of 21:00. Radio broadcasting does not apply a watershed.\n\nIn 2005, all television broadcasters operated a main watershed starting at 21:00. In the case of RTÉ, it ended at 06:30, while for TV3 and TG4, which then had shorter broadcast hours, it ended at nighttime closedown. RTÉ Radio did not use a watershed. TG4 claimed it had \"a number of different watersheds coming into effect throughout the day\", while all stations had a second, less formal watershed at 22:00 for \"material which is decidedly over 18\". Quinn notes that the period from 18:00 to 21:00 attracts most viewer complaints, as \"audience expectations of what should be shown often differ greatly\".\n\nThe BAI's code regarding advertising and children states, \"In general terms, programmes broadcast after 9 p.m. are not regarded as children‟s programmes. After this time, the primary responsibility for what a child is watching is seen to lie with the parents/guardians. The Code recognises, however, that children‟s viewing does not end abruptly at 9 p.m. and, therefore, the Code will offer some protection in the hour between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.\"\n\nAccording to Codice TV e minori (Code for Children and Television, 2002), all the channels must broadcast \"general audience\" programmes from 07:00 to 22:30. After 22:30, +14 programmes can be aired. +18 programmes are prohibited from television altogether, with the only exception of satellite and cable premium adult channels.\n\nDepartment of Radio, Television and Film (Mexico) regulates television programming in Mexico. Any programmes shown on Mexican television must be classified A (suitable for all ages) for broadcast between 05:00 to 20:00. Broadcast for programmes classified as B, B-15, C and/or D can be broadcast at certain times only.\n\n\n\nThe number in the age rating indicates the lowest age for which it is suitable.\n\nOn free-to-air channels (but not those on satellite), programming rated Adults Only is only allowed between 20:30 and 05:00. Adults Only programming is also allowed to air between midday and 15:00 on school days. Sports programming and news bulletins are exempt from the system altogether, but do still carry warnings before certain stories containing graphic images.\n\nPeru has adult time from 22:00 to 6:00 (next day). During the rest of the time, nevertheless, some +14 programming signs may be posted on the screen. As of 2015, there have been complaints that adult time is not enforced (either from the TV channels or the authorities) since some programs such as \"Combate\", \"Esto es Guerra\", \"Amor Amor Amor\" and \"Al fondo hay sitio\" have broadcast violence, or sexually suggestive material, during \"unrestricted\" time.\n\nIn Poland, the \"Czas chroniony\" (\"Protected time\").rules specify that programmes with a \"12\" rating or higher are not allowed to be aired during scheduling blocks intended for children, programmes with a \"16\" rating are not allowed to be aired before 20:00 on mainstream channels, and programmes with an \"18\" rating may not be aired before 23:00 on mainstream channels.\n\nOpen channel terrestrial television stations (RTP, SIC and TVI) can broadcast programmes and films rated 16 only between 22:30 and 06:00 with a permanent visual identification. There are no restrictions on pay television, although pornography may only be aired on encrypted channels.\n\nThe national broadcaster RTV Slovenija uses two watersheds: between 21:00 and 05:00 programmes rated 12+ and 15+ can be shown and between 00:00 and 05:00 18+ content can be shown. Children's programmes have to be screened until 19:00.\n\nA warning has to be broadcast before airing a programme with an age restriction. The rating symbol is shown accompanied by a voice that says: \"Opozorilo! Predvajane programske vsebine vključujejo prizore, ki so primerni samo za ...\" (The following programmes include scenes appropriate only for ...) followed by \"otroke v spremstvu in pod vodstvom staršev ali skrbnikov/otroke nad 12 letom starosti/mladoletne nad 15 letom starosti/odrasle\" (children accompanied and under guidance of parents or guardians/children older than 12/teenagers older than 15/adults).\n\nThe ratings used are:\n\nRating symbols:\n\nThe respective rating symbol has to be shown for the duration of the programme.\n\nSouth Africa takes a very hands-on approach when it comes to what children are allowed to see on television, and the parents or guardians of the child may be fined if they are caught not following the rules. The ratings used are:\n\nIn Spain, the watershed is simpler than a lot of other countries as there is only one watershed time, but there is a quadruple-tier age rating system that is used alongside it. The ratings used in Spain are \"All\", \"7\", \"12\", \"16\" and \"18\". However, only 18-rated programmes are restricted. 18-rated programmes are only allowed between 22:00 and 06:00, and are required to broadcast a warning sound before it is shown.\n\nIn 2015, the Serbian broadcasting regulator, the REM (Regulatory body for Electronic Media) introduced a two-tier watershed. The watershed is based on the new TV rating system. \n\nProgrammes marked \"16\" are only allowed to be shown between 10pm and 6am and may contain coarse language and mild references to gambling, drugs and sex.\n\nProgrammes marked \"18\" are only allowed to be shown between 12am and 6am and may contain extensive scenes of drugs and sex.\n\nSwitzerland has no watershed. However, broadcasters are required by law to avoid any confrontation of minors with unsuitable programming through the choice of transmission time.\n\nAccording to Ofcom, the watershed on free-to-air television in the UK is between 21:00 (09:00 p.m.) and 05:30 (05:30 a.m.), while premium or pay-per-view services are allowed to start the watershed at 20:00 (8:00 p.m.). Until 1 October 2011, the watershed ended at 05:30 for premium channels as it still does for the free-to-air channels. On 1 October 2011, the watershed rules for the premium channels were relaxed, now ending at 06:00. Programmes that are rated 15 cannot be shown outside this period. However, some 12-rated shows can be shown before 21:00, such as \"The Simpsons\", \"Malcolm in the Middle\", \"Doctor Who\", \"Atlantis\" and \"Futurama\". There is no watershed on PIN protected channels (such as Sky Cinema). On this type of channel, trying to view adult material before 20:00 will require a PIN.\n\nThere should be a gentle transition to adult material, and 18-rated content must not air until 22:00 (10:00pm) on most channels that are without PIN protection. However, channels that are dedicated to airing adult content such as Horror Channel may be allowed to start 18-rated content at 21:00 without PIN protection. \n\nA notable breach of the watershed was in 1976, during a live interview on Bill Grundy's \"Today\" show, when members of the Sex Pistols uttered swear words at Grundy.\n\nAdvertisements also have to comply with the same set of rules, and can be restricted when shown outside the watershed (such as those for junk food, bingo, alcohol and condoms). Advertisements that may have an adult-related context, such as bingo, are less likely to be allowed on children's-oriented channels. Some advertisements, often those for 18-rated films and video games, are not allowed before the watershed at all.\n\nAlthough ratings do not have to be displayed on-screen, the channel is legally required to broadcast a verbal advisory before shows that may be unsuitable for children. Failure to do this may result in the broadcaster being given a fine.\n\n\"See also: The Ofcom Broadcasting Code – Section 1\"\n\nBeginning in the 1975-76 television season, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) attempted to enforce a \"Family Viewing Hour\" policy, in which the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) agreed to air family-friendly programming during the first hour of primetime. In 1976, the rule was overturned as unconstitutional following a lawsuit by the Writers Guild of America. \n\nIn 1978, the Supreme Court case \"FCC v. Pacifica Foundation\" (which dealt with a complaint surrounding the broadcast of the George Carlin routine \"Filthy Words\" by WBAI radio) upheld the ability for the FCC to regulate the broadcast of \"indecent\" material on free-to-air radio and television, citing the \"uniquely pervasive presence\" of broadcasting in society, and the likelihood that children could be exposed to such content by chance. From then on, the FCC enforced a safe harbor on the broadcast of indecent material between 10:00 p.m., and 6:00 a.m. the following morning.\n\nIn 1987, the FCC introduced a stricter definition of indecency, defined as \"language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs\". The FCC also removed the previous 10:00 p.m. watershed, and stated that this prohibition would apply during any timeframe where there \"is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience\". In 1988, as directed by the United States Congress, the FCC announced that it would ban the broadcast of indecent material entirely, with no safe harbor. In 1991, the FCC's proposed 24-hour ban was struck down by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals as unconstitutional. The Telecommunications Act of 1992 re-established a safe harbor period for indecent content between midnight and 6:00 a.m. the following morning. The period was lengthened back to 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. following further D.C. Circuit rulings.\n\nSome American television scenes famous for \"pushing the envelope\" (such as limited nudity on \"NYPD Blue\") were aired in the 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. hour; however, these broadcasts were before the safe harbor in the Central and Mountain time zones, where programming scheduled for 10:00 p.m. Eastern would typically be broadcast starting at 9:00 p.m. (using a one-hour delay in Mountain Time broadcast areas). Because each U.S. time zone enters safe harbor separately (at 10:00 p.m. local time), it is possible for not all network affiliates that air an \"indecent\" program at the same moment to face the same penalties. Such was the case with CBS, whose affiliates faced a proposed fine of US$3.63 million for a repeat of the episode \"Our Sons and Daughters\" of \"Without a Trace\" in December 2004. The program was flagged for depicting an orgy involving teenagers. It was televised at 10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (within the safe harbor), but at 9:00 p.m. in Central and Mountain times (outside the safe harbor). The FCC split its fine among the 111 CBS affiliates covering these time zones. After a court settlement, the network agreed to pay US$300,000 in fines.\n\nEven though the watershed period begins during the prime time hour of 10:00 p.m., broadcast networks have since avoided indecent content as to not offend their affiliates and advertisers, and due to the constant fluctuation of indecency standards to account for changes in acceptance and FCC enforcement. In 2011 and 2012, courts overturned fines regarding a brief scene of male nudity in a 2003 \"NYPD Blue\" episode, as well as fines over fleeting expletives in a live awards show broadcast in 2002 by Fox, ruling that the FCC's basis for these fines was too vague.\n\nThe FCC's jurisdiction in regards to content only applies to terrestrial television. Cable channels may be more lenient in their content depending on their target audience and the standards of their advertisers, and premium, subscription services such as HBO and Netflix are the most.\n\nIn Venezuela, the watershed begins at 23:00 and ends at 05:00 in the following morning and is called \"Adult time\" according to Article 7 of the \"Law on Social Responsibility on Radio, Television and Electronic Media\". During this block, adult-oriented programs may be transmitted as long as they do not contain hardcore pornography, political or religious intolerance, racism or xenophobia.\n\nThis is a list of watershed times in each country, starting with the earliest and ending with the latest. This only includes the last phase of the watershed to start (for example, in Australia, MA15+ and AV15+ shows are not allowed until 20:30. The one for AV15+ shows would be the only one included in the table). Similarly, this table only includes the first phase of the watershed to end. Some countries may share the same last phase watershed time, in which case the conflicting boxes will be sorted by the end time.\n\nLegend\n\nA green box in either the start or end time means it has multiple phases of the respective event.\n\nNotes\n\n"}
