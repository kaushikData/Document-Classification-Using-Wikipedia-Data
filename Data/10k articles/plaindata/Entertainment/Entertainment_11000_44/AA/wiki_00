{"id": "846084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=846084", "title": "A Room of One's Own", "text": "A Room of One's Own\n\nA Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf, first published in September 1929. The work is based on two lectures Woolf delivered in October 1928 at Newnham College and Girton College, women's colleges at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAn important feminist text, the essay is noted in its argument for both a literal and figurative space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by men.\n\nThe essay was based on two papers Woolf read on 20 and 26 October 1928 to two Cambridge student societies, the Newnham Arts Society at Newnham College and the ODTAA Society at Girton College, respectively. Elsie Duncan-Jones, then known as Elsie Phare, was the president of the Newnham Arts Society at the time and wrote an account of the paper, \"Women and Fiction\", for the college magazine, \"Thersites\". Woolf stayed at Newnham at the invitation of Pernel Strachey, the college principal, whose family were key members of the Bloomsbury Group. At Girton she was accompanied by Vita Sackville-West. It was published in 1929 as a book with six chapters.\n\nThe title of the essay comes from Woolf's conception that \"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". The narrator of the work is referred to early on: \"Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please—it is not a matter of any importance)\". The three Marys were ladies-in-waiting to Mary, Queen of Scots; they are also characters in a 16th-century Scottish ballad, Mary Hamilton, about a lady-in-waiting who is facing execution for having had a child with the King, a child she killed.\n\nIn referencing the tale of a woman who rejected motherhood and lived outside marriage, a woman about to be hanged, the narrator identifies women writers such as herself as outsiders who exist in a potentially dangerous space. \n\nWoolf notes that women have been kept from writing because of the constraints they face and their relative poverty: \"In the first place, to have a room of her own, let alone a quiet room or a sound-proof room, was out of the question, unless her parents were exceptionally rich or very noble, even up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.\" The essay examines whether women were capable of producing, and in fact free to produce, work of the quality of William Shakespeare, addressing the limitations that past and present women writers face.\n\nWoolf's father, Sir Leslie Stephen, in line with the thinking of the era, believed that only the boys of the family should be sent to school. In delivering the lectures outlined in the essay, Woolf is speaking to women who have the opportunity to learn in a formal setting. She moves her audience to understand the importance of their education, while warning them of the precariousness of their position in society. She sums up the stark contrast between how women are idealised in fiction written by men, and how patriarchal society has treated them in real life:\n\nWomen have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time. Indeed if woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men, one would imagine her a person of the utmost importance; very various; heroic and mean; splendid and sordid; beautiful and hideous in the extreme; as great as a man, some would say greater. But this is woman in fiction. In fact, as Professor Trevelyan points out, she was locked up, beaten and flung about the room. A very queer, composite being thus emerges. Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger. Some of the most inspired words and profound thoughts in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read; scarcely spell; and was the property of her husband.\n\nIn one section Woolf invents a fictional character, Judith, Shakespeare's sister, to illustrate that a woman with Shakespeare's gifts would have been denied the opportunity to develop them. Like Woolf, who stayed at home while her brothers went off to school, Judith is trapped in the home: \"She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as agog to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school.\"\n\nWhile William learns, Judith is chastised by her parents should she happen to pick up a book, as she is inevitably abandoning some household chore to which she could be attending. Judith is betrothed, and when she does not want to marry, her father beats her, then shames her into the marriage. While William establishes himself, Judith is trapped by what is expected of women. She runs away from home to London, is harassed and laughed at when she tries to become an actor, and is finally made pregnant by an actor-manager who said he would help her. She kills herself and \"lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now stop outside the Elephant and Castle\". William lives on and establishes his legacy.\n\nIn the essay, Woolf constructs a critical and historical account of women writers thus far. Woolf examines the careers of several female authors, including Aphra Behn, Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, and George Eliot.\nIn addition to female authors, Woolf also discusses and draws inspiration from noted scholar and feminist Jane Ellen Harrison. Harrison is presented in the essay only by her initials separated by long dashes, and Woolf first introduces Harrison as \"the famous scholar, could it be J---- H---- herself?\"\n\nWoolf also discusses Rebecca West, questioning Desmond MacCarthy's (referred to as \"Z\") uncompromising dismissal of West as an \"'arrant feminist'\". Among the men attacked for their views on women, F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead (referred to as \"Lord Birkenhead\") is mentioned, although Woolf further rebukes his ideas in stating she will not \"trouble to copy out Lord Birkenhead's opinion upon the writing of women\". Birkenhead was an opponent of suffrage. The essay quotes Oscar Browning, through the words of his (possibly inaccurate) biographer H. E. Wortham, \"that the impression left on his mind, after looking over any set of examination papers, was that, irrespective of the marks he might give, the best woman was intellectually the inferior of the worst man\". In addition to these mentions, Woolf subtly refers to several of the most prominent intellectuals of the time; her hybrid name for the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge—Oxbridge—has become a well-known term, although she was not the first to use it.\n\nWoolf wrote in her diary before \"A Room of One's Own\" was published that she thought when it was published she would be \"attacked for a feminist & hinted at for a sapphist\" [sapphist means lesbian].\n\nIn one section of the book, describing the work of a fictional woman writer, Mary Carmichael, Woolf deliberately invokes lesbianism: \"Then may I tell you that the very next words I read were these – 'Chloe liked Olivia ...' Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women.\" Woolf references the obscenity trial and public uproar resulting from the publishing of Radclyffe Hall's lesbian-themed novel \"The Well of Loneliness\" (1928). Before she can discuss Chloe liking Olivia, the narrator has to be assured that Sir Chartres Biron, the magistrate of Hall's obscenity trial, is not in the audience: \"Are there no men present? Do you promise the figure of Sir Chartres Biron is not concealed? We are all women, you assure me? Then I may tell you ...\"\n\nWoolf scholar and feminist critic Jane Marcus believes Woolf was giving Radclyffe Hall and other writers a demonstration of how to discuss lesbianism discreetly enough to avoid obscenity trials; \"Woolf was offering her besieged fellow writer a lesson in how to give a lesbian talk and write a lesbian work and get away with it.\" Marcus describes the atmosphere of Woolf's arrival and presence at the women's college with her lover Vita Sackville-West as \"sapphic\". Woolf is comfortable discussing lesbianism in her talks with the women students because she feels a women's college is a safe and essential place for such discussions.\n\nAlice Walker responded to Woolf's observation that only women with 'a room of their own' are in a position to write. Woolf herself was making the point that not all women in her society had such a safe space, but Walker continues the conversation by discussing the further exclusions suffered by women of colour. \"\", Walker writes:\n\nWalker recognises that Wheatley is in a position far different from the narrator of Woolf's essay, in that she does not own herself, much less \"a room of her own\". Wheatley and other women writers exist outside of this room, outside of this space Woolf sets asides for women writers. Although she calls attention to the limits of Woolf's essay, Walker, in uniting womanist prose (women's writing) with the physical and metaphorical space of \"our mothers' gardens\", pays homage to Woolf's similar endeavour of seeking space, \"room\", for women writers.\n\nThe essay was adapted as a play by Patrick Garland, who also directed Eileen Atkins in its stage performance. A television adaptation directed by Garland was broadcast on PBS \"Masterpiece Theatre\" in 1991.\n\nThere is a feminist bookstore in Madison, Wisconsin, named A Room of One's Own, and a Canadian literary journal, \"Room of One's Own\", now \"Room\", showcasing the work of women writers and visual artists. The Smiths' song \"Shakespeare's Sister\" is named after a section of the essay. Shakespears Sister is an alternative pop group featuring Siobhan Fahey. The Two Nice Girls' third album, from 1991, was called \"Chloe Liked Olivia\". \"Chloe plus Olivia: an anthology of lesbian literature from the seventeenth century to the present\", was published in 1994 by Lillian Faderman. The women's co-working space in Singapore, \"Woolf Works\", was named after Virginia Woolf as a response to this essay. Patricia Lamkin's play \"Balancing the Moon\" (2011) was inspired by the essay.\n\n\n"}

He currently resides in Tel Aviv and is married with two daughters.\n\nCohen was born to a Sephardic Jewish family from Turkey and Egypt and raised and educated in the coastal city of Ashdod. During his military service he was an actor for the Israel Defense Forces' theatre, members of which are soldiers on active duty. Following his military service he worked as a stand up comic at the Domino Gross club in Tel Aviv, where he partnered with fellow comedian Guri Alfi to create the comedy duo of \"Assi and Guri\".\n\nFrom 1999 onward he worked as a comedian and joined the TV show \"Domino\", which aired on the commercial Channel 2 in Israel. The show, a follow-up to the highly successful \"Platfus\", was a second television production from the Domino Gross. Participants (such as Adir Miller, Rotem Aboav, Roi Bar-Natan and Guri Alfi) were comedians who appeared regularly at the club. Assi Cohen and Guri Alfi continued to tour the country as \"Assi and Guri\". They created, among others, favourite characters such as David (Cohen) and Tikva (Alfi), a disgruntled married couple, and Coco (Cohen) and Steve (Alfi), a singer and keyboard player duo singing satirical songs inspired by Mizrahi music.\n\nIn 2001, alongside his duo performances, Assi played in the TV drama \"Star Shining above the Heart\" () alongside Dana Ivgi, Irit Sheleg, and Ilana Berkowitz.\nIn 2002 he joined the show \"Rak BeYsrael\" (Channel 2) (, lit. Only in Israel) alongside Guri Alfi as side-kicks to main characters \"Limor\" (Orna Banai) and \"Shimon\" (Erez Tal). That same year, he and Guri Alfi created a comedy show called \"Shidurei Hamahapeha\" (Channel 2) (, literally \"The revolution's broadcasts\") and participated in the controversial film \"Yossi & Jagger\", which portrayed a homosexual relationship between a soldier (played by Yehuda Levi) and his commander (Ohad Knoller). He later participated in the comedy show \"We Won't Stop Laughing\" alongside Guri Alfi, Rotem Aboav, Eli Finish, and Mariano Idelman.\n\nIn 2003 he acted in the film \"Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi\" (Also: Ha-Kochavim Shel Shlomi). The same year he and Alfi broke up their comedy duo and Cohen married Lian Friedman.\n\nIn 2004 Cohen returned to television in the comedy show \"Eifo Ata Chai?!\" (, lit. Where have you been living?!) alongside Erez Tal, Shlomo Baraba, and Hadar Levi. He played several characters such as Coco the Mizrahi singer, and Himri the healer. That year he also starred in the film \"Colombian Love\" (with Mili Avital, Menashe Noi and others) as a newly married husband whose father insists he divorce his bride. Also in 2004, Cohen played alongside Dana Modan in the Israeli Emmy Award-winning television drama, \"Love Hurts\" ().\n\nIn 2005 he participated in the Steven Spielberg feature film \"Munich\", dealing with the Israeli government's secret retaliation after the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes. The film featured actors Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, and Geoffrey Rush as well as Israeli actors like Ayelet Zurer and Gila Almagor. That same year he started his participation in the Emmy Award and Golden Screen award-winning television show \"Eretz Nehederet\" (Hebrew: , lit. Wonderful Country), a satirical comedy with references to current affairs and parodies of the people involved. Among his characters on the show, Cohen impersonated Illusionist Uri Geller, Football player Avi Nimni, Right-wing politician Avigdor Lieberman, and Arab Knesset member and minister Raleb Majadele. Cohen also participated that year in a short film titled \"Halev HaRaev\" (, lit. The Hungry Heart) and hosted a show about \"What Makes an Israeli\" for Keshet's 57th Israeli Independence special, an 8-clip show portraying Israeli behaviors such as \"wiping\" humus to eat it, feeling a bread before purchasing it, drinking of \"Mud\" coffee, and others.\n\nIn 2007 he participated in the entertainment television show \"Mesudarim\" (Channel 2) (, meaning \"settled [for life]\" in Israeli slang), where four childhood friends sell their gaming startup company for USD$217 million, and have to deal with their newfound wealth. Chapter 9 of the show contained the first crossover in Israeli television, with the drama \"BeTipul\" (lit. \"In Treatment\"), which was later purchased by HBO; BeTipul's psychologist, played by Asi Dayan, is asked to analyze the group. The format of Mesudarim was purchased by Fox Entertainment Group and shown in the US as \"Loaded\".\nIn 2009 he participated in a critically acclaimed television show \"Hatufim\" (Prisoners of War). The show went to be the most successful in Israel and soon after the original script of Gideon Raff was sold to Hollywood for remake which is known as \"Homeland\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2980274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2980274", "title": "Billy Kersands", "text": "Billy Kersands\n\nBilly Kersands (c. 1842–1915) was an African-American comedian and dancer. He was the most popular black comedian of his day, best known for his work in blackface minstrelsy. In addition to his skillful acrobatics, dancing, singing, and instrument playing, Kersands was renowned for his comic routines involving his large mouth, which he could contort comically or fill with objects such as billiard balls or saucers. His stage persona was that of the dim-witted black man of the type that had been popularized in white minstrel shows. Modern commentators such as Mel Watkins cite him as one of the earliest black entertainers to have faced the dilemma of striking a balance between social satire and the reinforcement of negative stereotypes.\n\nKersands began performing with traveling minstrel troupes in the early 1860s. As black minstrelsy gained popularity, Kersands became its biggest star. In 1879, he earned about $15 a week, but by 1882, he was reportedly earning $80, only slightly less than a featured white minstrel. He was a hit with both white and black audiences, particularly in the South. Tom Fletcher wrote that \"In the South, a minstrel show without Billy Kersands is like a circus without elephants.\"\n\nOver his career, Kersands played with many of the major black minstrel troupes. He was a member of Sam Hague's Georgia Minstrels, along with Charles Hicks and Bob Height. When the company returned from an English tour in 1872, Charles Callender purchased the troupe and renamed it Callender's Georgia Minstrels. When Kersands and other popular troupe members demanded higher pay and more favorable treatment, Callender dismissed them. They quit to form their own ensemble, a move Callender characterized as theft. The company did poorly, and Kersands and most of the others returned to Callender. During his years with Callender's Georgia Minstrels, Kersands regularly featured in the military burlesques that regularly ended the first act beginning in 1875 or 1876. These sketches earned him renown for his acrobatic feats of drumming.\n\nIn 1885, Kersands began his own minstrel troupe, named Kersands' Minstrels. Charles Hicks was the manager, but he left to form his own group after little more than a year. Kersands' Minstrels was well known for its marching band, and the group led a Mardi Gras parade in 1886. Kersands offered $1000 to any rival who could outmarch them. He also continued to play engagements with other companies, including Richard and Pringle's Georgia Minstrels in 1890 as one of \"The Vestibule Car Porters and Drum Majors\".\n\nIn 1904, Kersands performed in an urban, black-produced show in the East. He only stayed for a short time, instead preferring the blackface minstrelsy he knew best. He formed another troupe and took up touring primarily in the South. Kersands answered the inevitable question of why he had not made the move to vaudeville thus: \"All of my money came from the people of the South, the white and the colored, while playing down there. Whether they meant it or not, the way I was treated by them, and still am, I feel at home. I also make a good living with no worries.\"\n\nKersands's comedy act centered on his enormous mouth, which he exuberantly contorted into countless shapes. He peppered his songs with these movements and their accompanying noises. One observer remarked, \"The slightest curl of his lip or opening of that yawning chasm termed his mouth was of itself sufficient to convulse the audience.\" He could even fit several billiard balls or a cup and saucer into his mouth and still perform a dance routine or fill the theater with boisterous laughter. Tom Fletcher wrote that while touring in England, Kersands told Queen Victoria that if his mouth was any bigger, his ears would have to be moved.\n\nThis physical feature fit well into racist white-created stereotypes of blacks having large lips and mouths. Kersands further embraced such disparaging caricatures by affecting the stage persona of a slow and ignorant Sambo. He also sang songs that reinforced these racist views. In his \"Mary's Gone with a Coon\", he sang of a black man \"lamenting\" his daughter's impending marriage to a black man: \"De chile dat I bore, should tink ob me no more / Den to run away wid a big black coon.\" His \"Old Aunt Jemima\" lent its name to the stereotyped mammy Aunt Jemima that later was developed into an iconic trademark for a brand of pancakes.\n\nDespite Kersands's reinforcement of negative black stereotypes, very few African Americans disdained his act. Part of his appeal for them lay in his mixing of elements of African American folklore into his show in a way that would appeal to his black audience but be ignored or derided by whites. \"Old Aunt Jemima\", one of his signature songs, serves as a good example. The song exists in three texts, two published 1875 and one in 1880, suggesting that Kersands made up verses as he sang. All three versions begin in a church, a locale that white minstrels tended to avoid. The 1875 texts describe charismatic black worship practices, but the 1880 edition begins with a black character fleeing a white church because they \"prayed so long\". Verses from the song soon entered the African American tradition and appeared in later collections of folklore. Other songs Kersands performed featured African American elements like talking animals and weak-versus-strong match-ups. His popularity led many theatre owners to relax rules limiting black patrons to specific sections of the playhouse.\n\nDespite weighing over 200 pounds, Kersands was also a talented dancer and acrobat. His trademark dance was Essence of Old Virginia or Virginia Essence, which he may have introduced. The dance later developed into the soft shoe. He was also known for the Buck and Wing. His dance routines helped cement such dance acts as fixtures in later vaudeville and Hollywood routines.\n\n"}

The game is a single player first-person shooter in which the player takes on the role of an Alpha Series Big Daddy with the alias Sigma, who must travel through Rapture's main security station, Minerva's Den, in order to download a copy of the city's main computer which is located within.\n\n\"Minerva's Den\" takes place in the fictional underwater city of Rapture in the year 1968, ten years after the events of \"Bioshock\". The story does not reveal where Rapture is, nor the approximate size of the city, other than that it is enormous.\n\n\"Minerva's Den\" follows a prototype Alpha Big Daddy referred to as Subject Sigma. Guided by Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum and Charles Milton Porter, the founder of Rapture Central Computing, Sigma makes his way to the Thinker, a supercomputer that maintains every automated system in the city. While developing the Thinker, Porter tried to give it a personality modeled on that of his late wife Pearl. His partner, Reed Wahl, found this to be a waste of time; he instead became obsessed with what he believed was the Thinker's ability to predict the future. To take total control of the Thinker, Wahl framed Porter for treason against Rapture's leader, Andrew Ryan, thus resulting in his arrest and disappearance. Through radio communication, Porter instructs Sigma to travel through Minerva's Den (where the Thinker is located) and retrieve its blueprints from Wahl so that he can rebuild it on the surface. As Sigma progresses, the environment becomes increasingly more threatening due to the Thinker's sophisticated defense system, as well as interference from Wahl and his private army of Splicers. Throughout all this, Sigma's real identity remains a mystery that is not touched upon until the final moments of the game. When Sigma reaches the Thinker and completes his mission, the Thinker recognizes Sigma as Charles Milton Porter, thus revealing his true identity. It is later explained by Dr. Tenenbaum that Milton's \"instructions\" throughout the duration of the game were actually from the Thinker that was imitating the voice of one of its creators. After Sigma kills Wahl, he and Tenenbaum return to the surface in a bathysphere; Tenenbaum is able to undo Sigma's programming and restore his original human body. Porter visits his wife's grave and leaves a letter in which he apologizes for trying to bring her back using the Thinker, and that he has finally decided to let her go.\n\nThe Thinker is the main computer of the city of Rapture. Known originally as Rapture Operational Data Intraparietal Network (R.O.D.I.N), it was created by Charles Milton Porter and Reed Wahl under the orders of Andrew Ryan. When the Thinker became operational, it was used to run all of Rapture's critical infrastructure and provide a system to link the city's businesses together. Over time, Porter refined the Thinker, expanding its ability to calculate and make predictions. This made it something of a popular attraction, and public tours and services were built around it. Eventually, Porter began to explore the Thinker's capabilities for replicating human feelings and thoughts, with hopes of giving his creation the personality of his deceased wife, Pearl. Wahl found this development to be a waste of time, having already exploited the Thinker to enrich himself. Convinced that Porter was treating the Thinker as a toy and wasting its potential, Wahl framed Porter for treason and persuaded Ryan to give him full control over it. During the game, the Thinker is used against Sigma by Wahl, predicting his actions and responding to them by setting traps, deploying automated defenses, and sending both Splicers and Big Daddies to intercept him.\n\nTrue to other \"Bioshock\" titles, \"Minerva's Den\" is a first person shooter. All supplies have to be collected throughout the game, limiting the amount of ammo, health, and ADAM a player can have at one time. The player also has a limited carrying capacity, meaning that only a certain number of items can be carried at one time.\n\nThe player and NPCs have the ability to slightly change the environment around then. If a wall, ceiling, or floor is hit or shot, a hole will appear in that spot.\n\nMany items and parts of the environment of the game are affected by physics. Smaller items can be kicked, thrown, and knocked over by the player and some of the NPCs (non-playable characters). Water dynamics also affects the player's movements, being that when underwater, the player will have longer steps and a slower fall time. Specific to \"Minerva's Den\" are the mechanics of the \"Gravity Well\" plasmid. It allows the player to throw an artificial black hole anywhere within a certain range, in which small items and NPCs will be sucked in until the black hole dies and expels the matter.\n\nIn \"Minerva's Den\", there are additions that differentiate it from both \"Bioshock\" and \"BioShock 2\".\n\nAs said above, the new plasmid, \"Gravity Well\", was introduced. Gravity Well allows the player to throw a black hole anywhere within a certain range. Small items and NPCs then get pulled in until the black hole expels the matter. Gravity Well does not affect the player or larger objects in the area.\n\n\"Minerva's Den\" also introduces the player to a new weapon as well, the Ion Laser. The Ion Laser shoots a continuous beam of the selected ammunition, either laser cell, thermal cell, or burst cell. The mechanics of the Ion Laser are reminiscent of the Chemical Thrower from \"BioShock\", but with a longer range.\n\nElectromagnetic locks were added to certain doors to act as a barrier for the player. The locks are impossible to open until the player obtains \"Gravity Well\", which they can use to remove the lock's power source.\n\n\n\"Minerva's Den\" was released on August 31, 2010 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was later released on PC on May 31, 2011, and Mac on March 29, 2012.\n\nWith the closure of the Games for Windows Live Marketplace in August 2013, \"BioShock 2\" was subsequently patched in October 2013 to remove Games for Windows Live in favor of Steamworks support for matchmaking. In addition, \"Minerva's Den\" was released for free for players who owned \"BioShock 2\" before the patch.\n\n\"Minerva's Den\" was praised by many outlets for its engaging narrative, and holds a Metacritic score of 82 indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". \"Minerva's Den\" is often regarded among critics as one of the best DLC expansions of all time.\n\n"}

{"id": "38133834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38133834", "title": "Defenders of Ardania", "text": "Defenders of Ardania\n\nDefenders of Ardania is a hybrid tower defense and real-time strategy video game for Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. It was developed by Most Wanted Entertainment and published by Deep Silver and Paradox Interactive. The game was released December 6, 2011 for iOS and on March 14, 2012 on all other platforms. The game's iOS release was well received by some critics and poorly received by others. A subsequent release on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 was significantly less well received.\n\n\"Defenders of Ardania\" is a tower defense game that also has offensive real-time strategy elements. As with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building several types of static tower units that fire at weak offensive units spawned by the opponent. In \"Defenders of Ardania\", however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player. The game is won if units spawned by the player get past the opponent's towers and destroy the opponent's base before the opponent's units get past the player's towers and destroy the player's base.\n\nThe game features a campaign mode with eighteen levels, pitting the player, controlling human, elven, and dwarven land and air units against a computer opponent controlling undead units. There is also a multiplayer mode that supports up to four players, either in free for all or two versus two format. In the multiplayer, players can choose from one of three factions to play as; the single player campaign's human faction, an animal-filled faction, or the undead faction.\n\n\"Defenders of Ardania\" received a mix of positive and negative reviews for the iOS but mixed to poor reviews on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.\n\nFor the iOS, 148Apps gave the game four and a half out of five stars, praising the game's visuals and level of detail, and expressing dissatisfaction only with the game's tutorial. Eric Ford of TouchArcade, another iOS reviewer, gave \"Defenders of Ardania\" four out of five stars, praising the visuals as \"beautiful\" and \"gorgeous\" and saying that the game \"is an excellent addition to the tower defense genre and is a must-try for any fan\". Ford did, however, criticize the tutorial, expressing a desire for a tutorial mission rather than instructional screens. Mat Jones of The Average Gamer gave the game a highly negative review, saying that the game was not challenging and that concepts, such as the ability during one level to attack multiple bases and change which one player's units went towards, were never explained. Jones concluded his review by saying that \"Defenders of Ardania isn’t a quality product and you probably shouldn’t spend money on it.\"\nReviews were universally less than positive on other systems. While critics praised the idea of the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying \"Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again.\" and Ray Carsillo of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" complaining of \"long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate\". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also got in the way of allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of \"PC Gamer\" praised the voiceover, calling it \"a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery\". Carsillo of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" was less kind, stating that \"your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the \"best\" of the voice actors you come across\". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that \"Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world.\" Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's \"biggest asset\", stating that \"Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.\".\n\n"}

The game features a hybrid of gameplay styles and has single-player, competitive multi-player, and co-operative multi-player modes.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Divinity:\" \"Dragon Commander\" is broken up into three phases which affect each other. The first phase has elements of a political simulation, where the player has conversations with multiple non-player characters and makes political decisions which affect the gameplay in the other two phases. In this phase, the player can research abilities, influence factions, and receive cards which can be traded in for special effects in the other two phases.\n\nThe second phase of the game is in the style of a turn-based strategy game, based on board games like Risk, and designed first as a board game while the game was still in development. In this mode, the player can use cards earned in the RPG phase to affect their own territories and units or those of their enemies. The player can also construct one building per territory, and recruit and move units. Once the units of two opposing sides meet, the player can play cards which take effect only for that battle, and can choose whether to automatically resolve the battle, or choose to fight themselves. The player can only fight in one battle per 'round' (a full set of the three phases).\n\nThe third phase of the game takes place once a battle is joined and is in the style of a real-time strategy game. The player constructs buildings and recruits units from the population pool of the region where the battle takes place. All construction and recruitment is done through units of recruits, which increase at a slow rate until the area's population is depleted. A player can increase the rate of recruitment by capturing and building more recruitment stations. Aside from the traditional point-and-click based style of control, the player can also take the form of a dragon in battle and aid their units in both offense and defense, at the cost of sacrificing some control over their units while in dragon form.\n\nThe game takes place in the distant past of the previous \"Divinity\" games. The player character is the bastard son of a recently deceased emperor. While arguing over succession rights, the emperor's children make a deal with a demon which allows them to introduce new, steampunk-styled technology to the world. Maxos, a powerful wizard who featured in \"Divinity 2\", comes to the player character as the only pure heir remaining, and asks him to enter the fight and win the war so that the demonic technology can be destroyed.\n\nThe story in the game follows this overarching plot, while from turn to turn, the player is confronted with political and personal issues from their ambassadors and generals. The ambassadors represent the non-human races, namely the Undead, the Elves, the Dwarves, the Lizardmen and the Imps. Each roughly represents a political viewpoint, and many of the political decisions are taken from modern politics. For instance, the player can decide whether or not to create a don't ask, don't tell policy in their army, and their decision will affect the relations between the player character and the various races.\n\n\"Dragon Commander\" was announced on August 11, 2011. Until that point, Larian had referred to \"Dragon Commander\" as \"Project D\", similar to the way in which \"\" was referred to as \"Project E\". \"Dragon Commander\" was presented at Gamescom in 2011 to journalists and gained attention through its novel premise often described as 'dragons with jetpacks'.\n\nCritical response to \"Dragon Commander\" has been generally positive.\nThe GameSpot review called the game a \"gem\", praising its many gameplay mechanics individually along with the visuals and audio. The Escapist awarded the game 3 stars out of 5 and criticized the strategy portion of the game as subpar, but the reviewer found the role playing gameplay and the story enjoyable and interesting.\n"}

She is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at the University of Texas–Pan American, where she teaches Creative Writing and Spanish Literature.\n\nHer first book, published in 1989, was titled \"Por recuerdos viejos, por esos recuerdos\" (For Memories of Old, for Those Memories). The book was nominated for the José Fuentes Mares Prize for Literature.\n\nHer second book, \"De cruz y media luna\", was published by Tierra de Libros in 1996. The poetry in this collection approaches love as a theme through the lens of transculturation: the Christian world and the Muslim world; the Hispanic world and the Persian world. The poems of this collection also visit the theme of maternity within the context of eroticism, sensuality, and plenitude. The poetic voice lays out a cartographic map of miscegenation for the child. This collection underwent a second edition and resulted in a edition, published by Claves Latinoamericanas in 2006, with the title: \"De cruz y media luna/From Cross and Crescent Moon\". The second edition contains some changes in relation to the first edition.\n\nHer third book, \"Y comerás del pan sentado junto al fuego\" (And You Shall Eat from the Bread While Seated by the Fire), was published by Claves Latinoamericans in 2002 and is one of the most significant within her literary works. The poems in this collection revisit the theme of love, although, this time, it appears to be within a semi-biblical context. Critical studies of the work of Ardalani revolve, generally, on the process of transculturation, as well as on the analysis of the referential language in her poetry.\n\nHer fourth book, \"Miércoles de ceniza\" (Ash Wednesday), was published by Editorial Miguel Ángel Porrúa in 2007. According to the preface: It is a long poem of 622 verses, a profound lament which gives way to pain. It may be said that it is inspired by the Bible given its length and we are sent in this direction by the theme of the work, which is defined as: the profound pain that the author feels at the sudden death of her father. Feelings and emotions overflow before the figure of the dead father translated into four secondary themes: reproach; reminiscence and ponderance; absence and delineation of the spiritual figure of the father, expressed in various stanzas, which tell of shock that the soul feels for the loss of a loved one. In 2008, it was nominated for the Carlos Pellicer Iberoamerican Prize in Poetry (\"Premio Iberoamericano de Poesía Carlos Pellicer, para obra publicada\") for published works.\n\nShe also contributes in digital means, like the literary journal \"El Collar de la Paloma\" (The Neckring of the Dove), of which she is the editor.\n\nHer work has been published in various journals and anthologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The chart was based on national singles sales charts in 16 European countries: Austria, Belgium (separately for Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\n, the European Hot 100 had accumulated 400 number one hits. The final chart was published on December 11, 2010, following the news of \"Billboard\" closing their London office and letting their UK-based staff go. The final number one single on the chart was \"Only Girl (in the World)\" by Rihanna. Currently, Nielsen SoundScan International-based Euro Digital Songs and Euro Digital Tracks are the only pan-European music charts that \"Billboard\" is publishing.\n\nThe first attempt at a Europe-wide chart was the Europarade, which was started in early 1976 by the Dutch TROS radio network. The chart initially consisted of only six countries: the Netherlands, UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain. In 1979 Italy and Denmark were added and during 1980, Austria and Switzerland were included. Ireland was added as the eleventh country in October 1983. The compilers collected the top 15 records from each country and then awarded corresponding points, depending which positions between 1 and 15 each record stood at. The \"Europarade\" was published in \"Music Week\" and the Dutch magazine \"Hitkrant\".\n\nIn March 1984, \"Music & Media\" magazine in Amsterdam started their own singles chart, \"The Eurochart Hot 100\", which they published as a Euro Tip sheet for the first two years. The chart was based on national singles sales charts in sixteen European countries: Austria, Belgium (separately for Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. This chart was accumulated by taking the chart positions in each country combined with the national sales percentage of records in that particular country.\n\nIn 1986–87, the official Eurochart also became a music TV show on Music Box with Dutch presenter . A syndicated radio show, 'The Coca-Cola Eurochart Hot 100' was also introduced on UK commercial radio and was definitely being broadcast as of January to April 1991 however, its precise start and end dates are not known. Hosted by Pat Sharp, it was broadcast on a number of stations including Radio Trent, BRMB, Viking FM and GWR FM. The Eurochart quickly gained momentum, as it started to include more countries.

In Mainland China, films are reviewed by the National Film Administration (NFA) under the Publicity Department () which dictates whether, when, and how a movie gets released. The NFA is separate from the NRTA under the State Council ().\n\nThe long history in ROC's film censorship is a prelude to that of the PRC, but the exhaustive list of films on this page is going to focus on PRC which is still a one-party state and took over the ROC in controlling mainland China after the Chinese Civil War. ROC has attempted age-based rating system as early as November 1948, become a democracy since the 1980s, and technically dropped censorship requirement in its film law in 2015, despite it still may not issue the Restricted rating occasionally, if the film elicits feelings of shame or disgust in persons over the age of 18.\n\nIn 1911, under the Qing dynasty, the Shanghai Autonomous Bureau issued the first regulation on film content, disallowing \"obscene content\". Violations of the regulation were punishable by revocation of a theater's license to screen films.\n\nUnder the Kuomintang (KMT), the government banned foreign films for promoting Christianity, cited as negativity affecting Chinese society, and for including kidnapping and love stories with \"carnal desire\". Wuxia and shenguai films were banned for promoting \"superstition and unscientific thinking\", and wuxia was felt to be spreading anarchy and instilling rebellion.\n\nIn November 1930, the Legislative Yuan promulgated a Film Censorship Law (), requiring four types of motion picture contents be edited, removed or banned:\n\nIn January 1931, the Executive Yuan formally established the Film Censorship Committee, putting the control of censorship in the hands of the central government for the first time. The committee was tasked with reviewing locally produced films and international films distributed in China. In March 1934, the government amended The Film Censorship Law, restructuring the Committee to include members from the film industry appointed by the Executive Yuan and renamed it to the Central Film Censorship Committee. The law got amended four more times before the KMT lost the civil war and fled to Taiwan in 1949. In November 1948 (), the reference to the \"Three Principles of the People\" was dropped and \"the interests of the ROC could not be offended\" was added in an amendment. Article 10 of the 1948 law also gave birth to a very early-stage motion picture rating system, using age 12 as the cutoff line for content restriction.\n\nThe ROC regained its footing in Taiwan. In 1955 (), 1956 (), and 1958 (), four more amendments to the law ensued without revising the main criteria. The law was renamed the Motion Picture Act () in November 1983, and expanded the censorship criteria to include the following:\nArticle 30 of the 1983 law lowered the age cutoff line from 12 to 6 to dictate whether the viewing should be restricted or not.\n\nKMT practiced martial law until July 1987. After lifting it, the Executive Yuan, or through its now dissolved Government Information Office (GIO), promulgated regulations to carry out the said revised law starting in 1987 () and 1988 (). The then regulations revised the motion picture rating system, classifying films into three categories (General Audience/Parental Guidance/Restricted) based on age. The categories were expanded into four (General Audience/Protected/Parental Guidance/Restricted) in 1994 ().\n\nThe film law rephrased the censorship requirement in June 2015. To control the rating system requirement from a legislative perspective, article 9 of the new Motion Picture Act (), promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, maintains that motion pictures and their advertisements shall not be screened if not granted a rating by the central competent authority which shall convene a rating commission to rate films. Members of the commission shall be representatives of government agencies, and scholars and experts having academic or practical experience in related fields. The commission's conclusions shall be made public and clear rationales for ratings given be listed. Article 10 maintains if motion pictures and their advertisements violate restrictions or prohibitions laid out in law, the central competent authority shall not grant a rating. The Ministry of Culture established by the Executive Yuan further specifies that not more than one third of the committee members can come from the Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development.\n\nThe rating system was expanded into five categories on October 16, 2015 per regulations () drawn up in accordance with the Motion Picture Act. \n\n\nDespite the rating system has been put in place, article 9 of the regulations specifically mentions the Restricted rating will not be issued, if the films elicit feelings of shame or disgust in persons over the age of 18. Article 235 of its Criminal Code also penalizes the distribution, broadcasts, sale, publicly displays of obscene video record.\n\nThe earliest predecessor to SAPPRFT was founded in June 1949. Communist Party of China (CPC) won the civil war and founded the new republic on October 1, 1949.\n\nWith the ten-year Cultural Revolution, film industry was singled out as a target for public criticism. Mao's wife Jiang Qing blacklisted 54 films.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Chinese economic reform (1978 onward), the PRC film industry has undertaken a series of decentralizing and privatizing reforms. In January 1986, SAPPRFT's predecessor is finally known as the Administrative Department of Radio, Film and Television (ADRFT) ().\n\nThe ADRFT published its departmental-level film censorship regulation one after another in 1988 (), in 1993 () and in 1997 ().\n\nThe basic principles of the 1993 document were reaffirmed in July 1996, when the State Council of the People's Republic of China promulgated Regulations on the Administration of Movies () at a higher executive level. Its article 23 & 24 gave executive authority in stipulating that the country shall adopt a film examination system: \"films that have not (been) examined and approved by the film examination organ of the administrative department of radio, film and television of the State Council may not be distributed, projected, imported or exported.\"\n\nIn March 1998, the ADRFT was renamed State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) ().\n\nIn February 2002, the State Council replaced the 1996 regulations with new ones (). Article 24 & 25 of the new regulations reiterates the censorship system and remains in effect despite what follows next.\n\nIn December 2003, SARFT also issued departmental-level regulation titled Interim Provisions on Project Initiation of Film Scripts (Abstracts) and on the Examination of Films (). This soon got updated in July 2004. Both the 1997 and 2004 regulations were later replaced by Provisions on the Archival Filing of Film Scripts (Abstracts) and the Administration of Films in June 2006 ().\n\nIn March 2013, the State Council merged SARFT with the General Administration of Press and Publication to form the SAPPRFT ().\n\nOn November 7, 2016, The 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at its 24th session passed the new PRC Film Industry Promotion Law () from a legislative point of view. The law became effective on March 1, 2017. Although the country lacks of a rating system like that of the ROC or the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system, according to an unofficial translation of the new law, article 16 stipulates that films must not contain the following content:\nArticle 20 of the law stipulates that films for which there is no release license cannot be transmitted over the Internet, telecommunications networks, or radio and television networks, or recorded as audio or video products, except for under other stipulations. If the film could make minors () and other audiences feel uncomfortable either physically or psychologically, there should be a reminder. However, in a March 2017 interview with China Central Television (CCTV), SAPPRFT's film chief Mr. Zhang Hongsen () said it was inaccurate for the media to label the guideline for minors as manual/euphemistic classification and it was a misinterpretation or over-interpretation of the new law.\nArticle 21 further stipulates that only films with the release license can be submitted for film festival or exhibition consideration. There have been circumstances where a film appears to be trimmed for commercial reasons, but on June 1, 2017, the SAPPRFT issued a notice, forbidding any spread of so-called \"complete version\", \"uncut version\", and \"deleted scenes\", etc. on any platform, including but not limited to online, mobile Internet, broadcast TV.\n\nOn June 30, 2017, the China Netcasting Services Association, an online broadcasting industry body subject to SAPPRFT and Ministry of Civil Affairs, issued a set of guidelines, signaling detailed control on all forms of audiovisual web content, including films. They explicitly prohibit the websites of the association's 600+ members, which include CCTV, Phoenix Television, Hunan Television, Dragon Television, Jiangsu Television, Zhejiang Television, Tencent, Youku, IQiyi, Sohu, etc., from displaying many things, including but not limited to the following:\n\n\n"}

The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund was heavily involved in Lee's defense. Lee was previously convicted on another obscenity charge.\n\nGordon Lee was the owner of the comic book store Legends, which was based in Rome, Georgia. Lee was convicted on February 18, 1993 of \"distributing obscene materials\" for selling the pornographic comics \"Final Taboo\" and \"Debbie Does Dallas\" to adult customers. He was fined $1,000 and sentenced to 12 months; both were suspended on payment of $250. Lee made appeals to the court, but they were denied by the Georgia Court of Appeals and Georgia Supreme Court in 1994. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund assisted with fees for the trial and the appeal.\n\nOn September 3, 1993, Lee filed suit for the return of inventory seized in conjunction with the obscenity case. The comics seizure had occurred on November 1, 1991, the day the police received a complaint about comics that were purchased at Legends. Around 300 books were taken as evidence under a search warrant, but were not returned until July 29, 1994, when the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia issued a ruling ordering the district attorney to return the inventory within ten days.\n\nLee entered the news again after the Halloween 2004 Free Comic Book Day giveaway at a street fair in Rome. Lee's shop gave away thousands of free comics on that day, but a copy of \"Alternative Comics\" #2 was unintentionally included in the giveaway.\n\n\"Alternative Comics\" #2 is an anthology containing an excerpt from the story \"The Salon\" by Nick Bertozzi. The story portrays Pablo Picasso's first meeting with the fellow cubist Georges Braque, during which Picasso is depicted as nude in a non-sexual context. (The CBLDF has made statements that the comic is historically accurate in this depiction.)\n\nThe copy of that comic that was unintentionally given away was handed to a minor, whose parent filed a complaint with the police. Upon learning of the error, Lee admitted that a mistake was made and offered to make a public apology for the first of many times. That apology was rejected, and days later, Lee was arrested. The minor in question was originally described as a nine-year-old boy, but various accounts by the District Attorney's office later stated that the comic was given either to the boy's six-year-old brother or to both boys.\n\nLee later stated \"Though I am willing to apologize for this particular art book getting in the hands that found it offensive, I will adamantly agree that the book is not 'harmful to children' or 'obscene.' In my opinion, this book is no more offensive then viewing the beautiful paintings of the Sistine Chapel or reading one of the best selling books with stories of sex, lust and nudity known as the Bible.\"\n\nDistrict Attorney Leigh Patterson charged Lee with two felony counts and five misdemeanors. The two felony charges were brought under the Distribution of Material Depicting Nudity or Sexual Conduct law, which requires materials containing nudity to be distributed in a labelled envelope. Penalties for violating this law include one to three years in prison and/or fines of up to $10,000 US. The five misdemeanors were presented under the Distribution of Material Harmful to Minors law, which makes it a misdemeanor to supply minors any material containing nudity.\n\nLee approached Comic Book Legal Defense Fund board member Peter David for help late in January 2005. The CBLDF Board of Directors voted unanimously to financially support Lee's defense, putting a defense team in place within days.\n\nIn May 2005, the CBLDF submitted four motions to dismiss the counts Lee faced, challenging the constitutionality of both laws. A hearing on those motions was held on December 1, 2005, during which all charges under the Distribution of Material Depicting Nudity or Sexual Conduct law were dropped. Two of the remaining misdemeanor charges were dropped as well, and the three remaining charges were consolidated into only two. The remaining charges were for \"distributing a book, pamphlet, magazine, and printed matter containing pictures, drawings and visual representation and images of a person a portion of the human body which depict sexually explicit nudity, sexual conduct, and sadomasochistic abuse and which is harmful to minors;\" and for knowingly furnishing and disseminating to a minor materials \"containing explicit and detailed verbal descriptions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement, sexual conduct, and sadomasochistic abuse and which taken as a whole is harmful to minors.\" The Fund maintained that the material did not meet the criteria as charged.\n\nBy November 2007, the CBLDF had spent over $80,000 on Lee's defense after taking the case in early 2005, and estimated costs reaching six figures by the end of the trial. The case has been ready for trial three times, but has been delayed each time.\n\nOn April 2, 2006, 18 hours before Lee's jury trial, the District Attorney's team informed the defense team that all charges were being dropped against Lee based on a mistake: The recipient of the comic was not the nine-year-old originally referenced in the charges; it was his six-year-old brother. The same charges were immediately re-filed, but with the child listed. The defense team expressed shock at this statement, which meant the case (and defense preparations for it) had been proceeding for 18 months under faulty charges. Also, the prosecutor's admission meant that false testimony had been presented under oath at the pre-trial hearing. Lead counsel Alan Begner protested \"How did a year and a half of statements based on one set of facts get changed at the last minute to another set of facts?\"\n\nOn May 19, 2006, a new arraignment was held, again charging the same two misdemeanors; this time both the six-year-old and nine-year-old boys were cited as victims. The CBLDF filed several procedural motions and motions to dismiss on May 30. The motions included allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in connection with what were now characterized as false allegations, as well as allegations of the District Attorney's office allowing untruthful testimony to be presented under oath, causing Lee and his defense counsel to incur unnecessary expense by requiring a change in trial date on too-short notice. Patterson said that her office had \"been honest and above board throughout this case. We forwarded new information to the defense as quickly as we got it.\"\n\nOn June 2, 2006, prosecutors filed yet another new indictment, modifying the second misdemeanor charge. This marked the third time Lee had been formally charged for this one incident. Although new indictments were issued, the first two sets of charges were never formally dropped. The CBLDF team again filed motions, this time in response to all three sets of accusations, but they were all dismissed, including those alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nThe trial was postponed again on August 15, 2007, due to the illness of presiding Judge Larry Salmon.\n\nOpening statements in the new trial began on November 5, 2007, but quickly resulted in a mistrial. Prior to the opening statements, the defense requested that the judge bar prosecutors from commenting on Lee's previous conviction in 1994. However, the prosecution noted in opening statements that Lee told deputies during the 2004 incident he had \"been through this before and beat it\". The district attorney's office planned to bring the case back to Floyd Superior Court the following year. At this point, the CBLDF had spent over $80,000 on Lee's defense.\n\nOn Friday, 18 April 2008, it was announced in author Neil Gaiman's blog that the case had been dismissed.\n\nThe charges against Lee have unnerved many shop owners who are concerned about distributing materials that could result in similar charges. One store owner in Georgia stated that \"We are a smaller community, very similar to the community that Gordon is in. We will special order [\"controversial comic Lost Girls\"] for anybody, but we will not have it out on display.\"\n\nLee entered the news for unrelated reasons when he chased two women who have since been charged with stealing two puzzles based on the movie \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" from his store. In an attempt to stop the women, Lee jumped on the hood of their car, and was thrown off, unhurt, after riding on the hood for a block. The women were later charged with shoplifting, and the driver was charged with aggravated assault.\n\nLee died on the afternoon of January 13, 2013, from complications stemming from a series of strokes. He was 54 years old.\n\n"}

Tricks can range from rolling a hat up and down the various parts of the body to throwing and catching the hat in amusing ways. Hat manipulation is often comedic in nature, and can be very entertaining. Part of the appeal of the art is in the necessary equipment; all that is needed is a good, heavy, brimmed hat, which can be found at many juggling stores. Famous manufacturers of manipulation specific hats are Nils Poll and Dubé. Hat manipulation is also frequently combined with traditional forms of juggling in order to create more varied acts.\n\nTechnically, hat manipulation is a form of object manipulation where the hat is the skill toy.\n\nThe types of tricks performed during hat manipulation fall into seven major categories.

{"id": "4137340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4137340", "title": "Interstitial art", "text": "Interstitial art\n\nInterstitial art is any work of art whose basic nature falls between, rather than within, the familiar boundaries of accepted genres or media, thus making the work difficult to categorize or describe within a single artistic discipline.\n\nThe word \"interstitial\" means \"between spaces\", and is commonly used to denote \"in-betweenness\" in several different cultural contexts. Architects refer to the leftover gaps between building walls as \"interstitial space\", being neither inside any room nor outside the building. Medical doctors have used the term for hundreds of years to refer to a space within the human body that lies in between blood vessels and organs, or in between individual cells. Television station programmers refer to any short piece of content that is neither a show nor a commercial, but is sandwiched between them, as \"an interstitial\".\n\nTake fiction as an example: If a librarian isn't sure where to shelve a book, that may be because the material is interstitial in some way, not fitting comfortably into a single, conventional literary category. For instance, when novelist Laurell K. Hamilton first began writing and publishing romances featuring vampires and fairies, bookstores faced a dilemma: How do you file these stories when you're working in a system that clearly labels one shelf for romances, a second shelf for fantasies, and a third shelf for tales of horror? There's no single, obvious answer, because such a novel is interstitial fiction, its essence residing somewhere in between the boundaries of these genres.\n\nOr consider the performance artist Laurie Anderson: She might go onstage and sing, tell a spoken-word story, project shadow puppets on a screen, and play a hacked violin whose bow is strung with audio tape. Is she a singer, a monologist, a puppeteer, or some kind of tinkering instrumentalist? Classifying such an act as interstitial performance art would be imprecise but efficient and accurate.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Delia Sherman, Ellen Kushner, Terri Windling, Heinz Insu Fenkl, Midori Snyder, Kelly Link, Gavin Grant, Gregory Frost, Theodora Goss, Veronica Schanoes, Carolyn Dunn, Colson Whitehead, and other American writers interested in fantastic literature found themselves commiserating over the common perception that the genre-oriented publishing industry found it difficult to market truly innovative fiction involving unusual, fantastical, or cross-genre elements—because the mainstream literary fiction field demanded stories based in realism, while the fantasy field demanded stories that mostly followed the standard conventions of sword and sorcery or high fantasy. Yet it seemed to the authors that some of the best literature was that which didn't quite fit tidily into either category but instead was being discussed in terms of more amorphous, \"in-between\" descriptors such as \"magic realism\", \"mythic fiction\", or \"the New Weird\". Further, the idea of interstitiality applied to other kinds of \"in-between\" fiction (unrelated to fantasy) and other \"in-between\" arts.\n\nOver a period of several years, Kushner and Sherman prompted ongoing discussion about the importance of cultivating artistic \"in-betweenness\" led to the formulation of the broad concept of interstitial art. In 2002, literary scholar Heinz Insu Fenkl founded ISIS: The Interstitial Studies Institute at the State University of New York at New Paltz, and in 2003–04, Sherman & Kushner and some of their colleagues established the Interstitial Arts Foundation, a 501c(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to developing community and support for artists, arts-industry professionals and audiences whose creative pursuits are interstitial in nature.\n\nIn 2007, the Interstitial Arts Foundation published an anthology of interstitial fiction through Small Beer Press titled \"Interfictions\". It features 19 stories from new and established writers in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, and fiction translated from Spanish, Hungarian, and French. The anthology strives to \"change your mind about what stories can and should do as they explore the imaginative space between conventional genres\".\n\nThe anthology raised several questions and started many debates on the nature of interstitiality as applied to fiction. Reviewers raised the question of how important the definition, or lack thereof, was to understanding the anthology as a whole and the stories individually. \"The 19 stories contained within \"Interfictions\" serve as examples but not as points of an argument that could lead to a listing in a Funk and Wagnalls.\"\n\nThough many of the stories are written by science fiction, fantasy, and horror writers and contain fantastic or supernatural elements, \"Interfictions\" is not a genre anthology. \"...interstitial fiction mixes and matches these precepts—ghost stories, science fiction, nursery rhymes, detective story, whatever may be handy—as part of a variegated prism to focus on the psychology of existence even while bending its collectively recognized state. ...each 'interfiction' shares this sense of disjointed narrative, but in very different ways that do not lend themselves to easy genre categorization.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "82587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82587", "title": "Jack Benny", "text": "Jack Benny\n\nJack Benny (born February 14, 1894 – December 26, 1974) was an American comedian, vaudevillian, radio, television and film actor, and violinist. Recognized as a leading 20th-century American entertainer, Benny often portrayed his character as a miser, playing his violin badly, and claiming to be 39 years of age, regardless of his actual age.\n\nBenny was known for his comic timing and the ability to cause laughter with a pregnant pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated \"Well!\" His radio and television programs, popular from 1932 until his death in 1974, were a major influence on the sitcom genre.\n\nBenny was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in nearby Waukegan, Illinois. He was the son of Jewish immigrants Meyer Kubelsky and Emma Sachs Kubelsky. Meyer was a saloon owner and later a haberdasher who had emigrated to America from Poland. Emma had emigrated from Lithuania. Benny began studying violin, an instrument that became his trademark, at the age of 6, his parents hoping for him to become a professional violinist. He loved the instrument, but hated practice. His music teacher was Otto Graham Sr., a neighbor and father of Otto Graham of NFL fame. At 14, Benny was playing in dance bands and his high school orchestra. He was a dreamer and poor at his studies, and was ultimately expelled from high school. He later did poorly in business school and at attempts to join his father's business. In 1911, he began playing the violin in local vaudeville theaters for $7.50 a week. He was joined on the circuit by Ned Miller, a young composer and singer.\n\nThat same year, Benny was playing in the same theater as the young Marx Brothers. Minnie, their mother, enjoyed Benny's violin playing and invited him to accompany her boys in their act. Benny's parents refused to let their son go on the road at 17, but it was the beginning of his long friendship with the Marx Brothers, especially Zeppo Marx.\n\nThe next year, Benny formed a vaudeville musical duo with pianist Cora Folsom Salisbury, a buxom 45-year-old divorcée who needed a partner for her act. This angered famous violinist Jan Kubelik, who feared that the young vaudevillian with a similar name would damage his reputation. Under legal pressure, Benjamin Kubelsky agreed to change his name to Ben K. Benny, sometimes spelled Bennie. When Salisbury left the act, Benny found a new pianist, Lyman Woods, and renamed the act \"From Grand Opera to Ragtime.\" They worked together for five years and slowly integrated comedy elements into the show. They reached the Palace Theater, the \"Mecca of Vaudeville,\" and did not do well. Benny left show business briefly in 1917 to join the United States Navy during World War I, and often entertained the troops with his violin playing. One evening, his violin performance was booed by the troops, so with prompting from fellow sailor and actor Pat O'Brien, he ad-libbed his way out of the jam and left them laughing. He received more comedy spots in the revues and did well, earning a reputation as a comedian and musician.\n\nShortly after the war, Benny developed a one-man act, \"Ben K. Benny: Fiddle Funology\". He then received legal pressure from Ben Bernie, a \"patter-and-fiddle\" performer, regarding his name, so he adopted the sailor's nickname of Jack. By 1921, the fiddle was more of a prop, and the low-key comedy took over.\n\nBenny had some romantic encounters, including one with dancer Mary Kelly, whose devoutly Catholic family forced her to turn down his proposal because he was Jewish. Benny was introduced to Kelly by Gracie Allen. Some years after their split, Kelly resurfaced as a dowdy fat girl and Jack gave her a part in an act of three girls: one homely, one fat, and one who couldn't sing.\n\nIn 1921, Benny accompanied Zeppo Marx to a Passover seder in Vancouver at the residence where he met 14-year-old Sadie Marks. Their first meeting did not go well when he tried to leave during Sadie's violin performance. They met again in 1926. Jack had not remembered their earlier meeting and instantly fell for her. They married the following year. She was working in the hosiery section of the Hollywood Boulevard branch of the May Company, where Benny courted her. Called on to fill in for the \"dumb girl\" part in a Benny routine, Sadie proved to be a natural comedienne. Adopting the stage name Mary Livingstone, Sadie collaborated with Benny throughout most of his career. They later adopted a daughter, Joan.\n\nIn 1929 Benny's agent, Sam Lyons, convinced Irving Thalberg, American film producer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to watch Benny at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. Benny signed a five-year contract with MGM, where his first role was in \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929\". The next movie, \"Chasing Rainbows\", did not do well, and after several months Benny was released from his contract and returned to Broadway in Earl Carroll's \"Vanities\". At first dubious about the viability of radio, Benny grew eager to break into the new medium. In 1932, after a four-week nightclub run, he was invited onto Ed Sullivan's radio program, uttering his first radio \"spiel\" \"This is Jack Benny talking. There will be a slight pause while you say, 'Who cares?'...\"\n\nBenny had been a minor vaudeville performer before becoming a national figure with \"The Jack Benny Program\", a weekly radio show that ran from 1932 to 1948 on NBC and from 1949 to 1955 on CBS. It was among the most highly rated programs during its run.\n\nBenny's long radio career began on April 6, 1932, when the NBC Commercial Program Department auditioned him for the N. W. Ayer & Son agency and their client, Canada Dry, after which Bertha Brainard, head of the division, said, \"We think Mr. Benny is excellent for radio and, while the audition was unassisted as far as orchestra was concerned, we believe he would make a great bet for an air program.\" Recalling the experience in 1956, Benny said Ed Sullivan had invited him to guest on his program (1932), and \"the agency for Canada Dry ginger ale heard me and offered me a job.\"\n\nWith Canada Dry ginger ale as a sponsor, Benny came to radio on \"The Canada Dry Program\", on May 2, 1932, on the NBC Blue Network and continuing for six months until October 26, moving to CBS on October 30. With Ted Weems leading the band, Benny stayed on CBS until January 26, 1933.\n\nArriving at NBC on March 17, Benny did \"The Chevrolet Program\" until April 1, 1934. He continued with sponsor General Tire through the end of the season. In October, 1934, General Foods, the makers of Jell-O and Grape-Nuts, became the sponsor strongly identified with Benny for 10 years. American Tobacco's Lucky Strike was his longest-lasting radio sponsor, from October 1944 through to the end of his original radio series.\n\nThe show switched networks to CBS on January 2, 1949, as part of CBS president William S. Paley's notorious \"raid\" of NBC talent in 1948–49. It stayed there for the remainder of its radio run, ending on May 22, 1955. CBS aired repeat episodes from 1956 to 1958 as \"The Best of Benny\".\n\nBenny's comic persona changed over the course of his career. At some point he developed a miserly persona. This stage character was everything that Jack Benny was not: Cheap, petty, vain, and self-congratulatory. His comic rendering of these traits was the linchpin to the success of his show. Benny set himself up as comedic foil, allowing his supporting characters to draw laughs at the expense of his own flaws. With his humanism and vulnerability in an era where few male characters were allowed such character traits, Benny made what could have been unlikable into an everyman character.\n\nBenny said: \"\"I don't care who gets the laughs on my show, as long as the show is funny\".\" Benny felt he got the credit or blame either way, not the actor saying the lines, so there was emphasis on the comedic bottom line. This attitude reached its apogee in a broadcast structured as a Hollywood bus tour of the stars' homes. Each \"stop\" on the tour was at a house belonging to one of the show's supporting cast, who would then have a scene which included jokes about the absent Benny. Not until the final moments of the program did the bus arrive at Jack Benny's house, at which point the listening audience heard Benny's only line of the episode: \"\"Driver, here's where I get off\".\" Few stars possessed the combination of daring, humility and comic timing to commit to such an extended payoff.\n\nEddie Anderson played Benny's valet and chauffeur, Rochester van Jones. Rochester's comic persona regularly got the better of his vain, skinflint boss. Rochester saw through the vanities of his boss, and knew how to jab him without going too far, often with his famous line: \"Oh, Boss, come now!\" With his mock-befuddled one-liners and sharp retorts, Rochester broke comedic racial barriers. Unlike many black supporting characters of the time, Rochester was a regular member of the fictional Benny household, and was functionally his equal. Benny wrote the character as transcending the racial stereotype of the era, and the popularity of Rochester nearly rivaled his own. A New Year's Eve episode, in particular, shows their mutual love and respect as they quietly toast one another with champagne.\n\nAfter the war, Benny made a conscious effort to remove stereotypical aspects from the Rochester character. In 1948, a 1941 script for the show was re-used, including several African-American stereotypes — for example, a reference to Rochester carrying a razor. This prompted some listeners who were unaware the script was a repeat to send in angry letters protesting the stereotypes. Thereafter, Benny insisted that his writers avoid all negative racial jokes or references.\n\nMary Livingstone (Benny's wife) was a supporting character, as his wisecracking and not-especially-deferential female friend and secretary. She was not quite his girlfriend, since Benny would often try to date movie stars, like Barbara Stanwyck, and occasionally had stage girlfriends, such as \"Gladys Zybisco\".\nDon Wilson, the rotund announcer, also appeared on the show. He also announced for Fanny Brice's hit \"Baby Snooks\".\n\nBandleader Phil Harris appeared as a jive talking, alcoholic philanderer whose repartee was profoundly risqué for its time.\n\nBoy tenor Dennis Day appeared as a sheltered, naïve youth who often got the better of his boss. This character was originated by Kenny Baker whom Day replaced. Singer Larry Stevens replaced Dennis Day from 5 November 1944 to 10 March 1946, while Day served in the Navy.\n\nMel Blanc supplied several characters' voices, including the railroad station announcer who said, \"Train leaving on track five for Anaheim, Azusa and Cu... camonga!\" This gag became well known, and was used in several Bugs Bunny cartoons which Mel Blanc also voiced. It eventually led to a statue of Benny in Cucamonga. Blanc was also featured with Benny as a Mexican character in the classic \"Si-Sy\" routine, and on radio as the sound of Benny's Maxwell automobile. He also provided the growling voice of Carmichael, Benny's pet polar bear, and later the squawking voice of Polly, Benny's pet parrot. Blanc is perhaps best remembered as Professor LeBlanc, Benny's perpetually frustrated violin teacher, who was as likely to assault his student out of insane exasperation as he was to jump out the window before he got out the door.\n\nIn the early days of the program, supporting characters were often vaudevillian ethnic stereotypes whose humor was grounded in dialects. As the years went by, the humor of these figures became character-based.\n\nThe method Benny used to bring a character into a skit by announcing his name was a well-known Benny shtick: \"\"Oh, Dennis ...\" or \"Oh, Rochester ...\" typically answered by \"Yes, Mr. Benny (Boss)?\"\"\n\nThe cast included character actors and comedians:\n\n\nMusical contributions came in 1946 from the singing quartet the Sportsmen (members: Bill Days, Max Smith, Marty Sperzel, and Gurney Bell) singing the middle Lucky Strike commercial.\n\n\"The Jack Benny Program\" evolved from a variety show blending sketch comedy and musical interludes into the situation comedy form we now recognize, crafting particular situations and scenarios from the fictionalization of Benny the radio star. Common situations included hosting parties, income tax time, nights on the town, \"backstage\" interactions between Jack and his cast at the radio studio during show rehearsals, contract negotiations, or traveling by train or plane to and from Jack's many personal appearances throughout the country (hence the \"Train leaving on track five\" gag). The writers and star would insert musical interludes from Phil Harris and Dennis Day. With Day, invariably, a brief sketch ended with Benny ordering Day to sing the song he planned for the show that week.\n\nOne popular scenario that became a tradition on \"The Jack Benny Program\" was the annual \"Christmas Shopping\" episode, in which Benny would go to a local department store to do his shopping. Each year, Benny would buy a ridiculously cheap Christmas gift for Don Wilson, from a harried store clerk played by Mel Blanc. Benny would then drive Blanc to insanity by exchanging the gift countless times throughout the episode.\n\nIn the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys shoelaces for Don, and is unable to make up his mind whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, \"Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!\" A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, \"I haven't run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor have to give me that pardon!?\" Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.\n\nIn 1936, after a few years of broadcasting from New York, Benny moved the show to Los Angeles, allowing him to bring in guests from among his show business friends, including Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, Judy Garland, Barbara Stanwyck, Bing Crosby, Burns and Allen (George Burns was Benny's closest friend), and many others. Burns, Allen and Orson Welles guest hosted several episodes in March and April 1943 when Benny was ill with pneumonia, while Ronald Colman and his wife Benita Hume appeared often in the 1940s as Benny's long-suffering neighbors.\n\nOn the broadcast of January 8, 1950, journalist Drew Pearson was the subject of a joke gone wrong. Announcer Don Wilson was supposed to say he heard that Jack bought a new suit on Drew Pearson, but said the name wrong; Don said \"Drear Pewson\". Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman. Changing his original response at the suggestion of the writers, Nelson said, \"Well, who do you think I am, Drear Pewson?\" The audience laughed for almost 30 seconds.\n\nIn the early days of radio and in the early television era, airtime was owned by the sponsor, and Benny incorporated the commercials into the body of the show. Sometimes the sponsors were the butt of jokes, though Benny did not use this device as frequently as his friend and \"rival\" Fred Allen did then, or as cast member Phil Harris later did on his successful radio sitcom. Nevertheless, for years, Benny insisted in contract negotiations that his writers pen the sponsor's commercial in the middle of the program (leaving the sponsor to provide the opening and closing spots) and the resulting ads were cleverly and wittily worked into the storyline of the show. For example, on one program, Don Wilson accidentally misread Lucky Strike's slogan (\"Be happy, go Lucky\") as \"Be Lucky, go happy\", prompting a story arc over several weeks that had Wilson unable to appear on the show due to being traumatized by the error.\n\nIn fact, the radio show was generally not announced as \"The Jack Benny Program\". Instead, the primary name of the show tied to the sponsor. Benny's first sponsor was Canada Dry Ginger Ale from 1932 to 1933. Benny's sponsors included Chevrolet from 1933 to 1934, General Tire in 1934, and Jell-O from 1934 to 1942. \"The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny\" was so successful in selling Jell-O, in fact, that General Foods could not manufacture it quickly enough when sugar shortages arose in the early years of World War II, and the company stopped advertising the popular dessert mix. General Foods switched the Benny program from Jell-O to Grape-Nuts from 1942 to 1944, and it was, naturally, \"The Grape Nuts Program Starring Jack Benny\". Benny's longest-running sponsor, was the American Tobacco Company's Lucky Strike cigarettes, from 1944 to 1955, when the show was usually announced as \"The Lucky Strike Program starring Jack Benny\".\n\nBenny was notable for employing a small group of writers, most of whom stayed with him for many years. This was in contrast to successful radio or television comedians, such as Bob Hope, who would change writers frequently. One of Benny's writers, George Balzer, noted: \"One of the nice things about writing for Jack Benny was that he never denied your existence. On the contrary, he publicized it—not just in conversations, but in interviews and on the air.\" Historical accounts (like those by longtime Benny writer Milt Josefsberg) indicate that Benny's role was essentially as head writer and director of his radio programs, though he was not credited in either capacity. In contrast to Fred Allen, who initially wrote his own radio scripts (and extensively rewrote scripts produced in later years by a writing staff), Jack Benny was often described by his writers as a consummate comedy editor rather than a writer per se. George Burns described Benny as \"the greatest editor of material in the business. He's got the knack of cutting out all the weak slush and keeping in only the strong, punchy lines.\"\n\nJack Benny has a reputation as a master of timing. Since his days in radio, he often explored the limits of timing for comedic purposes, like pausing a disproportionate amount of time before answering a question. Balzer described writing material for Benny as similar to composing music, with one element being the rhythm of delivery as equivalent to musical tempo.\n\nDuring his early radio shows, there was no recurring theme, the program instead opening each week with a different then-current popular song. Throughout the Jello and Grapenuts years, announcer Don Wilson would announce the name of the show, some of the cast, then state \"The orchestra opens the program with [name of song].\" The orchestra number would continue softly as background for Don Wilson's opening commercial.\n\nStarting in the Lucky Strike era, Benny adopted a medley of \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" and \"Love in Bloom\" as his theme music, opening every show. \"Love in Bloom\" was later the theme of his television show. His radio shows often ended with the orchestra playing \"Hooray for Hollywood\". The TV show ended with one of two bouncy instrumentals written for the show by his musical arranger and conductor, Mahlon Merrick.\n\nBenny would sometimes joke about the propriety of \"Love in Bloom\" as his theme song. On a segment often played in \"Tonight Show\" retrospectives, Benny talks with Johnny Carson about this. Benny says he has no objections to the song in and of itself, only as \"his theme.\" Proving his point, he begins reciting the lyrics slowly and deliberately: \"Can it be the \"trees.\" That fill the \"breeze\". With rare and magic perfume. Now what the hell has that got to do with \"me?\"\"\n\nIn an episode broadcast March 28, 1948, Benny borrowed neighbor Ronald Colman's Oscar, and was returning home when he was accosted by a mugger (voiced by comedian Eddie Marr). After asking for a match to light a cigarette, the mugger demands, \"Don't make a move, this is a stickup. Now, come on. Your money or your life.\" Benny paused, and the studio audience—knowing his skinflint character—laughed. The robber then repeated his demand: \"Look, bud! I said your money or your life!\" Benny snapped back, without a break, \"I'm thinking it over!\" This time, the audience laughed louder and longer than they had during the pause.\n\nThe punchline came to Benny staff writers John Tackaberry and Milt Josefsberg almost by accident. Writer George Balzer described the scene to author Jordan R. Young, for \"The Laugh Crafters\", a 1999 book of interviews with veteran radio and television comedy writers:\n\nThe actual length of the laugh the joke got was five seconds when originally delivered and seven seconds when the gag was reprised on a follow-up show. In fact, the joke is probably not so memorable for the length of the laugh it provoked, but because it became the definitive \"Jack Benny joke\"—the joke that best illustrated Benny's \"stingy man\" persona. The punchline—\"I'm thinking it over!\"—would not have worked with any other comedian than Benny.\n\nThe actual longest laugh known to collectors of \"The Jack Benny Program\" lasted in excess of 32 seconds. The International Jack Benny Fan Club reports that, at the close of the program broadcast on December 13, 1936, sponsored by Jell-O, guest Andy Devine says that it is the \"last number of the eleventh program in the new Jelly series.\" The audience, who loved any sort of accidental flub in the live program, is still laughing after 32 seconds, at which point the network cut off the program to prevent it from running overtime.\n\nAccording to Benny himself, Mary Livingstone got the biggest laugh he ever heard on the show, on the April 25, 1948, broadcast. The punchline was the result of the following exchange between Don Wilson and noted opera singer Dorothy Kirsten:\n\nAccording to Benny, the huge laugh resulted from the long buildup, and the audience's knowledge that Benny, with his pompous persona, would have to break into the conversation at some point.\n\nA nearly identical exchange occurred over a year earlier, among renowned violinist Isaac Stern, actor Ronald Colman, Jack Benny, and Mary Livingstone. The quartet's back-and-forth, which centered on Stern's recent public performance of a Mendelssohn piece, was heard on an episode first broadcast on February 16, 1947. The resulting laughter lasted some 18 seconds, after which Benny retorted, \"Mary, that's no way to talk to Mr. Stern.\"\n\nLater in life, while performing as a stand-up comedian in Las Vegas, Benny had just begun to tell an old joke about the salesman, the farmer, and the farmer's daughter: \"So the salesman and the farmer's daughter come to the front door, and the farmer opens the door.\" At this point, Sammy Davis, Jr. walks onstage behind Jack, the audience screams, and Davis proceeds to speak and sing and dance for about 25 minutes while Benny continues to stand at center stage, quietly watching the spectacle. When Davis finally walks offstage and the audience's applause dies down, Benny continues to watch Davis offstage for a few moments, then, as the audience is finally quiet, continues: \"... So the farmer said—\" And that's as far as that joke got, because the audience laughed for minutes afterward.\n\nIn 1937, Benny began his famous radio feud with rival Fred Allen. Allen kicked the feud off on his own show on his December 30, 1936 show, after child violinist Stuart Canin gave a performance of François Schubert's \"The Bee\" credibly enough that Allen wisecracked about \"a certain alleged violinist\" who should by comparison be ashamed of himself. Benny, who listened to the Allen show answered in kind at the end of his January 3, 1937 show. And the two comedians were off and running.\n\nFor a decade, the two went at it back and forth, so convincingly that fans of either show could have been forgiven for believing they had become blood enemies. In reality, the two men were close friends and mutual admirers. Benny and Allen often appeared on each other's show during the ongoing feud; numerous surviving episodes of both comedians' radio shows feature each other, in both acknowledged guest spots and occasional cameos. On one Christmas program Allen thanked Benny for sending him a Christmas tree, but then added that the tree had died. \"Well, what do you expect,\" quipped Allen, \"when the tree is in Brooklyn and the sap is in Hollywood.\"\n\nBenny, in his eventual memoir (\"Sunday Nights at Seven\") and Allen in his \"Treadmill to Oblivion\" later revealed that each comedian's writing staff often met together to plot future takes on the mock feud. If Allen zapped Benny with a satirization of Benny's show (\"The Pinch Penny Program\"), Benny shot back with a parody of Allen's \"Town Hall Tonight\" called \"\"Clown\" Hall Tonight.\" And their playful sniping (\"Benny was born ignorant, and he's been losing ground ever since\") was also advanced in the films \"Love Thy Neighbor\" and \"It's in the Bag!\".\n\nPerhaps the climax of the feud came during Fred Allen's parody of popular quiz-and-prize show \"Queen for a Day\", which was barely a year old when Allen decided to have a crack at it on \"The Fred Allen Show\"—an episode that has survived for today's listeners to appreciate. Calling the sketch \"King for a Day\", Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot. Benny answered the prize-winning question correctly and Allen crowned him \"king\" and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes. Allen proudly announced, \"Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where you will be the judge in a chicken-cleaning contest,\" to which Benny joyously declared, \"I'm \"king\" for a day!\" At this point a professional pressing-iron was wheeled on stage, to press Benny's suit properly. It didn't matter that Benny was still \"in\" the suit. Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny's suit, one item at a time, ending with his trousers, each garment's removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience. As his trousers began to come off, Benny howled, \"Allen, you haven't seen the \"end\" of me!\" At once Allen shot back, \"It won't be long \"now!\"\"\n\nThe laughter was so loud and chaotic at the chain of events that the Allen show announcer, Kenny Delmar, was cut off the air while trying to read a final commercial and the show's credits. (Allen was notorious for running overtime often enough, largely thanks to his ad-libbing talent, and he overran the clock again this time.)\n\nBenny was profoundly shaken by Allen's sudden death from a heart attack in 1956. In a statement released on the day after Allen's death, Benny said, \"People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same: You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it.\" Allen himself wrote, \"For years people have been asking me if Jack and I are friendly. I don't think that Jack Benny has an enemy in the world. ... He is my favourite comedian and I hope to be his friend until he is forty. That will be forever.\"\n\nOn the advice of MCA's Lew Wasserman, Jack Benny formed a holding company, \"Amusement Enterprises\" (a tax break major entertainers usually enjoyed in those years), which allowed him to bundle his entire program and personnel into a single commodity. The company also gave Benny the opportunity to produce and package other radio programs (including his 1947 summer replacement series starring Jack Paar), and invest in other entertainment ventures, including the production of a 1949 feature film, \"The Lucky Stiff\", starring Dorothy Lamour, and the 1948 Broadway version of Mister Roberts, starring Henry Fonda. While Benny was top of the heap on NBC, CBS czar William S. Paley cast a hungry eye upon the comedian. Paley apparently had good reason to believe Benny could be had. In the summer of 1948, he successfully negotiated a deal with Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, buying \"their\" holding company, which owned the Amos 'n' Andy radio show (and the rights to those characters), moving the entire \"package\" from NBC to CBS that fall: he then learned that NBC balked at buying a \"Jack Benny\" package deal when \"Jack Benny\" was not the star's real name. Paley reached out to Benny and offered him a deal that would allow that package-buy.\n\nBut Paley, according to CBS historian Robert Metz, also learned that Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, under the leadership of David Sarnoff, seemed at the time to think that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, according to Metz, that was foolish thinking at best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.\n\nTo sweeten the deal for a very nervous sponsor, Paley also agreed to make up the difference to American Tobacco if Benny's Hooper rating (the radio version of today's Nielsen ratings) on CBS fell to a certain level below his best NBC Hooper rating. Benny's CBS debut on January 2, 1949 bested his top NBC rating by several points while also pumping up the ratings of the show that followed, \"Amos 'n' Andy\". NBC, with its smash Sunday night lineup now broken up, offered lucrative new deals to two of those Sunday night hits, \"The Fred Allen Show\" and \"The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show\". Benny's bandleader and his singing actress wife now starred in their own hit sitcom, meaning Harris was featured on shows for two different networks.\n\nBenny and Sarnoff eventually met several years later and became good friends. Benny later observed that if he'd had this kind of relationship with Sarnoff earlier, when he was Sarnoff's number-one radio star, he never would have left NBC.\n\nAfter making his television debut in 1949 on local Los Angeles station KTTV, then a CBS affiliate, the network television version of \"The Jack Benny Program\" ran from October 28, 1950, to 1965, all but the last season on CBS. Initially scheduled as a series of five \"specials\" during the 1950–1951 season, the show appeared every six weeks for the 1951–1952 season, every four weeks for the 1952–1953 season and every three weeks in 1953–1954. For the 1953–1954 season, half the episodes were live and half were filmed during the summer, to allow Benny to continue doing his radio show. From the fall of 1954 to 1960, it appeared every other week, and from 1960 to 1965 it was seen weekly.\n\nOn March 28, 1954, Benny co-hosted \"\" with Groucho Marx and Mary Martin. In September 1954, CBS premiered Chrysler's \"Shower of Stars\" co-hosted by Jack Benny and William Lundigan. It enjoyed a successful run from 1954 until 1958. Both television shows often overlapped the radio show. In fact, the radio show alluded frequently to its television counterparts. Often as not, Benny would sign off the radio show in such circumstances with the line \"Well, good night, folks. I'll see you on television.\"\n\nWhen Benny moved to television, audiences learned that his verbal talent was matched by his controlled repertory of dead-pan facial expressions and gesture. The program was similar to the radio show (several of the radio scripts were recycled for television, as was somewhat common with other radio shows that moved to television), but with the addition of visual gags. Lucky Strike was the sponsor. Benny did his opening and closing monologues before a live audience, which he regarded as essential to timing of the material. As in other TV comedy shows, a laugh track was added to \"sweeten\" the soundtrack, as when the studio audience missed some close-up comedy because of cameras or microphones obstructing their view. Television viewers became accustomed to live without Mary Livingstone, who was afflicted by a striking case of stage fright. Livingstone appeared rarely if at all on the television show. In fact, for the last few years of the radio show, she pre-recorded her lines and Jack and Mary's daughter, Joan, stood in for the live taping, with Mary's lines later edited into the tape replacing Joan's before broadcast. Mary Livingstone finally retired from show business permanently in 1958, as her friend Gracie Allen had done.\n\nBenny's television program relied more on guest stars and less on his regulars than his radio program. In fact, the only radio cast members who appeared regularly on the television program as well were Don Wilson and Eddie Anderson. Day appeared sporadically, and Harris had left the radio program in 1952, although he did make a guest appearance on the television show (Bob Crosby, Phil's \"replacement\", frequently appeared on television through 1956). A frequent guest was the Canadian-born singer-violinist Gisele Mackenzie.\n\nAs a gag, Benny made a 1957 appearance on the then-wildly popular \"$64,000 Question\". His category of choice was \"Violins\", but after answering the first question correctly Benny opted out of continuing, leaving the show with just $64; host Hal March gave Benny the prize money out of his own pocket. March made an appearance on Benny's show the same year.\nBenny was able to attract guests who rarely, if ever, appeared on television. In 1953, both Marilyn Monroe and Humphrey Bogart made their television debuts on Benny's program. Another guest star on the Jack Benny show was Rod Serling who starred in a spoof of \"The Twilight Zone\" in which Benny goes to his own house..and finds that no one knows who he is!\n\nCanadian singer Gisele MacKenzie, who toured with Benny in the early 1950s, guest starred seven times on \"The Jack Benny Program\". Benny was so impressed with MacKenzie's talents that he served as co-executive producer and guest starred on her 1957–1958 NBC variety show, \"The Gisele MacKenzie Show\".\n\nIn 1964, Walt Disney was a guest, primarily to promote his production of \"Mary Poppins\". Benny persuaded Disney to give him over 110 free admission tickets to Disneyland for his friends and one for his wife, but later in the show Disney apparently sent his pet tiger after Benny as revenge, at which point Benny opened his umbrella and soared above the stage like Mary Poppins.\n\nIn due course the ratings game finally got to Benny, too. CBS dropped the show in 1964, citing Benny's lack of appeal to the younger demographic the network began courting, and he went to NBC, his original network, in the fall, only to be out-rated by CBS's \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" The network dropped Benny at the end of the season. He continued to make occasional specials into the 1970s, the last one airing in January 1974.\nIn his unpublished autobiography, \"I Always Had Shoes\" (portions of which were later incorporated by Jack's daughter, Joan Benny, into her memoir of her parents, \"Sunday Nights at Seven\"), Benny said that he, not NBC, made the decision to end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still very good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing, no matter what they promised), advertisers were complaining that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the \"rate race\". Thus, after some three decades on radio and television in a weekly program, Jack Benny went out on top. In fairness, Benny himself shared Fred Allen's ambivalence about television, though not quite to Allen's extent. \"By my second year in television, I saw that the camera was a man-eating monster ... It gave a performer close-up exposure that, week after week, threatened his existence as an interesting entertainer.\"\n\nIn a joint appearance with Phil Silvers on Dick Cavett's show, Benny recalled that he had advised Silvers not to appear on television. However, Silvers ignored Benny's advice and proceeded to win several Emmy awards as Sergeant Bilko on the popular series \"The Phil Silvers Show\", while Benny claimed he never won any of the television honors.\n\nBenny also acted in films, including the Academy Award-winning \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929\", \"Broadway Melody of 1936\" (as a benign nemesis for Eleanor Powell and Robert Taylor), \"George Washington Slept Here\" (1942), and notably, \"Charley's Aunt\" (1941) and \"To Be or Not to Be\" (1942). He and Livingstone also appeared in Ed Sullivan's \"Mr. Broadway\" (1933) as themselves. Benny often parodied contemporary movies and movie genres on the radio program, and the 1940 film \"Buck Benny Rides Again\" features all the main radio characters in a funny Western parody adapted from program skits. The failure of one Benny vehicle, \"The Horn Blows at Midnight\", became a running gag on his radio and television programs, although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest.\n\nBenny may have had an unbilled cameo role in \"Casablanca\", claimed by a contemporary newspaper article and advertisement and reportedly in the \"Casablanca\" press book. When asked in his column \"Movie Answer Man\", movie critic Roger Ebert first replied, \"It looks something like him. That's all I can say.\" He wrote in a later column, \"I think you're right.\"\n\nBenny also was caricatured in several Warner Brothers cartoons including \"Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur\" (1939, as Casper the Caveman), \"I Love to Singa\", \"Slap Happy Pappy\", and \"Goofy Groceries\" (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny), \"Malibu Beach Party\" (1940, as himself), and \"The Mouse that Jack Built\" (1959). The last of these is probably the most memorable: Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blanc—the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister—reprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a \"phat\"-phat-\"bang!\" away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then shakes his head, smiles wryly, and mutters, \"Imagine, me and Mary as little mice.\" Then, he glances toward the cat lying on a throw rug in a corner and sees his and Livingstone's cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat's mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.\n\nBenny made a cameo appearance in \"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\". When some of the characters are arguing at the side of the road, Benny pulls up in his car and considerately asks, \"Trouble? Having any trouble?\", to which the character played by Ethel Merman yells, \"Yes, and we don't need any help from you!\" Benny does a take with his smile slowly fading and mutters, \"Well!\", and drives off.\n\nBenny teamed with Fred Allen for the best-remembered running gag in classic radio history, in terms of character dialogue. But Benny alone sustained a classic repertoire of running gags in his own right, including his skinflint radio and television persona; regular cast members' and guest stars' reference to his \"baby blue\" eyes, always sure to elicit a self-satisfied smirk or patently false attempt at modesty from Benny; perpetually giving his age as 39; and ineptitude at violin playing, most frequently demonstrated by futile attempts to perform Rodolphe Kreutzer's Étude No. 2 in C major. In fact, Benny was a fairly good violinist who achieved the illusion of a bad one, not by deliberately playing poorly, but by striving to play pieces that were too difficult for his skill level. In one of his show's skits, Benny is a USO performer in the Pacific when playing his violin when he comes under fire; Benny still plays his violin when two Japanese surrender to him–all the other enemy soldiers committed suicide rather than endure listening to Benny's terrible music!\n\nA skit heard numerous times on radio, and seen many times on television, had Mel Blanc as a Mexican in a sombrero and serape sitting on a bench. Jack Benny sits down and begins a conversation. To each question asked by Benny, Blanc replies Sí. When Benny asks his name, Blanc replies Sy, which would prompt the exchange, Sy?, Sí. And when Benny asks where Blanc is going, Blanc replies, \"to see his sister\", Sue (Sue?, Sí.), who of course sews for a living (Sew?, Sí.).\n\nA running gag in Benny's private life concerned George Burns. To Benny's eternal frustration, he could never get Burns to laugh. Burns, on the other hand, could crack Benny up with the least effort. An example of this occurred at a party when Benny pulled out a match to light a cigar. Burns announced to all, \"Jack Benny will now perform the famous match trick!\" Benny had no idea what Burns was talking about, so he proceeded to light up. Burns observed, \"Oh, a new ending!\" and Benny collapsed in helpless laughter.\n\nBenny even had a sound-based running gag of his own: his famous basement vault alarm, allegedly installed by Spike Jones, ringing off with a shattering cacophony of whistles, sirens, bells, and blasts, before ending invariably with the sound of a foghorn. The alarm rang off even when Benny opened his safe with the correct combination. The vault also featured a guard named Ed (voiced by Joseph Kearns) who had been on post down below before, apparently, the end of the Civil War, the end of the Revolutionary War, the founding of Los Angeles, on Jack's 38th birthday, and even the beginning of humanity. In one appearance, Ed asked Benny, \"By the way, Mr. Benny ... what's it like on the outside?\" Benny responded, \"... winter is nearly here, and the leaves are falling.\" Ed responded, \"Hey, that must be exciting,\" to which Benny replied (in a stunningly risqué joke for the period), \"Oh, no—people are wearing clothes now.\" In one episode of the Benny radio show, Ed the Guard actually agreed when Jack invited him to take a break and come back to the surface world, only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation, which hadn't been around the last time he'd been to the surface, terrorized and confused him. (Poor Ed thought a crosstown bus was \"a red and yellow dragon\".) Finally, Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there. The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon \"The Mouse that Jack Built\" and an episode of \"The Lucy Show\".\n\nA separate sound gag involved a song Benny had written, \"When You Say I Beg Your Pardon, Then I'll Come Back to You\". Its inane lyrics and insipid melody guaranteed that it would never be published or recorded, but Benny continued to try to con, extort, or otherwise inveigle some of his musical guests (including The Smothers Brothers and Peter, Paul and Mary) to perform it. None ever made it all the way through.\n\nIn keeping with his \"stingy\" schtick, on one of his television specials he remarked that, to his way of looking at things, a \"special\" is when the price of coffee is marked down.\n\nAnother popular running gag concerned the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently portrayed as a bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that the sight of a glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4 am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.\n\nOne Christmas program had Crosby agonizing over what to get Remley:\n\nBenny: \"Well, why don't you get him a cordial; like a bottle of Drambuie?\"\nCrosby: \"That's a nice thought, Jack, but Drambuie's an after-dinner drink.\"\nBenny: \"So?\"\nCrosby: \"So Remley never quite makes it 'til after dinner.\"\n\nCrosby also got consistent laughs by frequently joking about his more famous brother Bing Crosby's vast wealth.\n\nStarting with the October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly announced the purchase of his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that went out of business in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car's clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.\n\nThe ongoing saga of the Maxwell was initially interrupted after just five years, when on the October 18, 1942 broadcast Jack took his car to a local junkyard and contributed it to the World War II junk salvage drive, receiving $7.50 in war stamps in exchange. However much of the radio audience may have remained unaware that the Maxwell was ever gone, because before long Jack was heard traveling around in a decrepit old car again, and by the end of the 1940s his car would once more be specifically identified as a Maxwell.\n\nWhen the \"Jack Benny Program\" began appearing on television in 1950, a 1916 Maxwell Model 25 Tourer became one of the production's standard props. Benny's Maxwell later became a 1923 Tourer. In addition to its being on the program, Benny would often make public appearances in Maxwells. He drove a Maxwell onto the stage in one of his last television specials.\n\nBy 1941, Jack Benny's Maxwell had become such a well-known aspect of popular culture that it was referenced in the Billy Mills song \"I'm in Love with the Sound Effects Man\" as heard on the June 17, 1941 \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" radio show (and later performed on a 1943 recording by Spike Jones). The automobile was also featured in the 1943 Benny film \"The Meanest Man in the World\". Benny and his archaic auto were featured in a series of television and print ads for Texaco from the 1950s through the 1970s. A series of gags were built around the premise that Benny appreciated the value of Sky Chief brand gasoline in keeping his car running smoothly, but was too cheap to buy more than one gallon at a time. In the classic cartoon \"The Mouse that Jack Built\", Jack has himself and Mary driven by Rochester in a sputtering Maxwell car.\n\nMany people believe that Benny appears behind the wheel of his Maxwell in the 1963 film \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", but in fact it was a 1932 Cadillac. The long shots for the scene were shot months before Benny was cast—with a stunt driver at the wheel—and the role was intended for Stan Laurel (which is why the character wears a derby, which Jack almost never did). When Laurel ultimately passed on appearing, Jack agreed to play it. According to the commentary on the Criterion edition of the film, his close-ups were filmed on a rear-projection stage at the Paramount studio.\n\nAfter his broadcasting career ended, Benny performed live as a stand up comedian and returned to films in 1963 with a cameo appearance in \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\".\n\nBenny made one of his final television appearances July 20, 1973 on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\"\nBenny was preparing to star in the film version of Neil Simon's \"The Sunshine Boys\" when his health failed in 1974. In fact, he prevailed upon his longtime best friend, George Burns, to take his place on a nightclub tour while preparing for the film. Burns ultimately had to replace Benny in the film as well and went on to win an Academy Award for his performance.\n\nDespite his failing health, Benny made several appearances on \"The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast\" in his final eighteen months, roasting Ronald Reagan, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and Lucille Ball, in addition to himself being roasted in February 1974. His roasting of Lucille Ball was his last public performance, and aired on February 7, 1975, several weeks after his death.\n\nIn October 1974, Benny cancelled a performance in Dallas after suffering a dizzy spell, coupled with numbness in his arms. Despite a battery of tests, Benny's ailment could not be determined. When he complained of stomach pains in early December, a first test showed nothing, but a subsequent one showed he had inoperable pancreatic cancer. Benny went into a coma at home on December 22, 1974. While in a coma, he was visited by close friends including George Burns, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Carson and John Rowles. He died on December 26, 1974 at age 80. At the funeral George Burns, Benny's best friend for more than fifty years, attempted to deliver a eulogy but broke down shortly after he began and was unable to continue. Bob Hope also delivered a eulogy in which he stated, \"For a man who was the undisputed master of comedy timing, you would have to say this is the only time when Jack Benny's timing was all wrong. He left us much too soon.\" He was interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. Benny's will arranged for a single long-stemmed red rose, to be delivered to his widow, Mary Livingstone, every day for the rest of her life. Livingstone died nine years later on June 30, 1983.\n\nIn trying to explain his successful life, Benny summed it up by stating: \"Everything good that happened to me happened by accident. I was not filled with ambition nor fired by a drive toward a clear-cut goal. I never knew exactly where I was going.\"\n\nUpon his death, his family donated to UCLA his personal, professional, and business papers, as well as a collection of his television shows. The university established the Jack Benny Award in his honor in 1977 to recognize outstanding people in the field of comedy. Johnny Carson was the first award recipient. Benny also donated a Stradivarius violin (purchased in 1957) to the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Benny had commented, \"If it isn't a $30,000 Strad, I'm out $120.\"\n\nIn 1960, Benny was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with three stars. His stars for television and motion pictures are located at 6370 and 6650 Hollywood Boulevard, respectively, and at 1505 Vine Street for radio. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1988 and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1989. He was also inducted into The Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame.\n\nBenny was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1972 in the area of The Performing Arts.\n\nWhen the price of a standard first-class U.S. postal stamp was increased to 39 cents in 2006, fans petitioned for a Jack Benny stamp to honor his stage persona's perpetual age. The U.S. Postal Service had issued a stamp depicting Jack Benny in 1991, as part of a booklet of stamps honoring comedians; however, the stamp was issued at the then-current rate of 29 cents.\n\nJack Benny Middle School in Waukegan, Illinois, is named after the famous comedian. Its motto matches his famous statement as \"Home of the '39ers\". A statue of Jack Benny with his violin now stands on Genesee Street in downtown Waukegan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "244831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244831", "title": "Joan Blondell", "text": "Joan Blondell\n\nRose Joan Blondell (August 30, 1906 – December 25, 1979) was an American actress who performed in movies and on television for half a century. She began her career in vaudeville.\n\nAfter winning a beauty pageant, Blondell embarked upon a film career. Establishing herself as a sexy, wisecracking blonde, she was a pre-Code staple of Warner Bros. pictures, and appeared in more than 100 movies and television productions. She was most active in films during the 1930s, and during this time, she co-starred with Glenda Farrell in nine films, in which the duo portrayed gold diggers. Blondell continued acting in major film roles for the rest of her life, often in small character roles or supporting television roles. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in \"The Blue Veil\" (1951).\n\nNear the end of her life, Blondell was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in John Cassavetes's \"Opening Night\" (1977). She featured in roles in two more films — \"Grease\" (1978) and \"The Champ\" (1979) — released shortly before her death from leukemia.\n\nRose Joan Blondell was born in New York to a vaudeville family, and gave her birthdate as August 30, 1909. Her father, Levi Bluestein, a vaudeville comedian, known as Ed Blondell, was born in Poland to a Jewish family in 1866. He toured for many years starring in Blondell and Fennessy's stage version of \"The Katzenjammer Kids\". Blondell's mother was Kathryn (\"Katie\") Cain, born April 13, 1884, in Brooklyn, of Irish American parents. Her younger sister, Gloria Blondell, also an actress, was briefly married to film producer Albert R. Broccoli. Blondell also had a brother, Ed Blondell, Jr. Her cradle was a property trunk as her parents moved from place to place and she made her first appearance on stage at the age of four months when she was carried on in a cradle as the daughter of Peggy Astaire in \"The Greatest Love\". Her family comprised a vaudeville troupe, the \"Bouncing Blondells\".\n\nJoan had spent a year in Honolulu (1914–15) and six years in Australia and had seen much of the world by the time her family, who had been on tour, settled in Dallas, Texas, when she was a teenager. Under the name Rosebud Blondell, she won the 1926 Miss Dallas pageant, was a finalist in an early version of the Miss Universe pageant in May 1926, and placed fourth for Miss America 1926 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in September of that same year. She attended Santa Monica High School, where she acted in school plays and worked as an editor on the yearbook staff. While there, she went by the name Rosebud Blondell. She attended what is now the University of North Texas, then a teacher's college, in Denton, where her mother was a local stage actress.\n\nAround 1927, she returned to New York, worked as a fashion model, a circus hand, a clerk in a store, joined a stock company to become an actress, and performed on Broadway. In 1930, she starred with James Cagney in \"Penny Arcade\" on Broadway. \"Penny Arcade\" lasted only three weeks, but Al Jolson saw it and bought the rights to the play for $20,000. He then sold the rights to Warner Bros. with the proviso that Blondell and Cagney be cast in the film version. Placed under contract by Warner Bros., she moved to Hollywood, where studio boss Jack L. Warner wanted her to change her name to \"Inez Holmes\", but Blondell refused. She began to appear in short subjects, and was named as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1931.\n\nBlondell was paired with James Cagney in such films as \"Sinners' Holiday\" (1930) – the film version of \"Penny Arcade\" – and \"The Public Enemy\" (1931), and was one-half of a gold-digging duo with Glenda Farrell in nine films. During the Great Depression, Blondell was one of the highest-paid individuals in the United States. Her stirring rendition of \"Remember My Forgotten Man\" in the Busby Berkeley production of \"Gold Diggers of 1933\", in which she co-starred with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, became an anthem for the frustrations of the unemployed and the government's failed economic policies. In 1937, she starred opposite Errol Flynn in \"The Perfect Specimen\". By the end of the decade, she had made nearly 50 films. She left Warner Bros. in 1939.\nIn 1943, Blondell returned to Broadway as the star of Mike Todd's short-lived production of \"The Naked Genius\", a comedy written by Gypsy Rose Lee. She was well received in her later films, despite being relegated to character and supporting roles after 1945, when she was billed below the title for the first time in 14 years in \"Adventure\", which starred Clark Gable and Greer Garson. She was also featured prominently in \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\" (1945) and \"Nightmare Alley\" (1947). In 1948, she left the screen for three years and concentrated on theatre, performing in summer stock and touring with Cole Porter's musical, \"Something for the Boys\". She later reprised her role of Aunt Sissy in the musical version of \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\" for the national tour, starred opposite Tallulah Bankhead in the play \"Crazy October\" (which closed on the road) and played the nagging mother, Mae Peterson, in the national tour of \"Bye Bye Birdie\".\n\nBlondell returned to Hollywood in 1950. Her performance in her next film, \"The Blue Veil\" (1951), earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She played supporting roles in \"The Opposite Sex\" (1956), \"Desk Set\" (1957), and \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" (1957). She received considerable acclaim for her performance as Lady Fingers in Norman Jewison's \"The Cincinnati Kid\" (1965), garnering a Golden Globe nomination and National Board of Review win for Best Supporting Actress. John Cassavetes cast her as a cynical, aging playwright in his film \"Opening Night\" (1977). Blondell was widely seen in two films released not long before her death, \"Grease\" (1978) and the remake of \"The Champ\" (1979) with Jon Voight and Rick Schroder. She also appeared in two films released after her death, \"The Glove\" (1979) and \"The Woman Inside\" (1981).\nBlondell also guest-starred in various television programs, including three 1963 episodes as the character Aunt Win in the CBS sitcom \"The Real McCoys\", starring Walter Brennan and Richard Crenna. She appeared in a 1964 episode (\"What's in the Box?\") of \"The Twilight Zone\". She guest-starred in the episode \"You're All Right, Ivy\" of Jack Palance's circus drama, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", which aired on ABC in the 1963–64 television season. Her co-stars in the segment were Joe E. Brown and Buster Keaton. In 1965, she was in the running to replace Vivian Vance as Lucille Ball's sidekick on the hit CBS television comedy series \"The Lucy Show\". Unfortunately, after filming her second guest appearance as Joan Brenner (Lucy's new friend from California), Blondell walked off the set right after the episode had completed filming when Ball humiliated her by harshly criticizing her performance in front of the studio audience and technicians.\n\nBlondell continued working on television. In 1968, she guest-starred on the CBS sitcom \"Family Affair\", starring Brian Keith. She also replaced Bea Benaderet, who was ill, for one episode on the CBS series \"Petticoat Junction\". In that installment, Blondell played FloraBelle Campbell, a lady visitor to Hooterville, who had once dated Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchanan) and Sam Drucker (Frank Cady). That same year, Blondell co-starred in all 52 episodes of the ABC Western series \"Here Come the Brides\", set in the Pacific Northwest of the 19th century. Her co-stars included singer Bobby Sherman and actor-singer David Soul. Blondell received two consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding continued performance by an actress in a dramatic series for her role as Lottie Hatfield.\n\nIn 1971, she followed Sada Thompson in the off-Broadway hit \"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds\", with a young Swoosie Kurtz playing one of daughters.\n\nIn 1972, she had an ongoing supporting role in the NBC series \"Banyon\" as Peggy Revere, who operated a secretarial school in the same building as Banyon's detective agency. This was a 1930s period action drama starring Robert Forster in the titular role. Her students worked in Banyon's office, providing fresh faces for the show weekly. The series was replaced midseason.\n\nIn 1974, Blondell played the wife of Tom D'Andrea's character in the television film, \"Bobby Parker and Company\", with Ted Bessell in the starring role as the son of Blondell and D'Andrea. Coincidentally, D'Andrea had earlier played Jim Gillis, the television husband of Blondell's younger sister, Gloria Blondell, in the NBC sitcom \"The Life of Riley\".\n\nBlondell has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the film industry. Her star is located at 6311 Hollywood Boulevard. In December 2007, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a retrospective of Blondell's films in connection with a new biography by film professor Matthew Kennedy and theatrical revival houses such as Film Forum in Manhattan have also projected many of her films recently.\n\nShe wrote a novel titled \"Center Door Fancy\" (New York: Delacorte Press, 1972), which was a thinly disguised autobiography with veiled references to June Allyson and Dick Powell.\n\nBlondell was married three times, first to cinematographer George Barnes in a private wedding ceremony on January 4, 1933, at the First Presbyterian Church in Phoenix, Arizona. They had one child — Norman Scott Barnes, who became an accomplished producer, director, and television executive — and divorced in 1936.\n\nOn September 19, 1936, she married her second husband, actor, director, and singer Dick Powell. They had a daughter, Ellen Powell, who became a studio hair stylist, and Powell adopted her son by her previous marriage under the name Norman Scott Powell. Blondell and Powell were divorced on July 14, 1944. Blondell was less than friendly with Powell's next wife, June Allyson, although the two women would later appear together in \"The Opposite Sex\" (1956).\nOn July 5, 1947, Blondell married her third husband, producer Mike Todd, whom she divorced in 1950. Her marriage to Todd was an emotional and financial disaster. She once accused him of holding her outside a hotel window by her ankles. He was also a heavy spender who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars gambling (high-stakes bridge was one of his weaknesses) and went through a controversial bankruptcy during their marriage. An often-repeated myth is that Mike Todd \"dumped\" Joan Blondell for Elizabeth Taylor, when in fact, Blondell left Todd of her own accord years before he met Taylor.\n\nBlondell was a Republican.\n\nBlondell died of leukemia in Santa Monica, California, on Christmas Day, 1979, with her children and her sister at her bedside. She is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\n\n\n"}

W. Scripps Company. The company owns (as of 2017) four television networks that each carry programming with specified formats targeted at individual demographics. \n\nOriginally, Katz sold the network to affiliated TV stations via ad split, but by October 2015, had moved to carriage fees in exchange for the network getting the ad inventory due to greater inventory with stations adding a third or fourth subchannel. Their networks used direct response advertising as a meter of viewers before switching to Neilsen rating C-3.\n\nKatz Broadcasting, LLC was founded on February 3, 2014 by Jonathan Katz, who serves as chief operating officer of Bounce TV and formerly served as an executive at the Turner Broadcasting System. The company was announced concurrently with the announced launches of its first two networks, Escape and Grit, which were both launched that April with Univision and UniMás owned-and-operated stations run by Univision Communications serving as its charter station group; both of Katz's initial networks are targeted at individual genders (with Grit aimed at men and Escape aimed at women). Besides Jonathan Katz, some of the initial investors included some Bounce investors notably Raycom Media and Al Haymon. At some point, E. W. Scripps Company also becomes an owner purchasing 5% of the company.\n\nKatz and Bounce Media share staff from the former company's launch, including Jonathan Katz (who serves as president and chief executive officer of Katz, while continuing to serve as chief operating officer) and Jeffrey Wolf (Katz's chief distribution officer and Bounce's executive vice president of network distribution). Katz and Bounce continued to share executive staff with the hiring announcement of Jim Weiss (a former executive at sports marketing agency CSE) as the former's senior vice president of corporate communications in August.\n\nOn January 18, 2015, Katz Broadcasting announced the launch of its third specialty network, Laff, a comedy-focused network that was tapped for an April 15 debut with ABC Owned Television Stations and the E. W. Scripps Company serving as its core charter affiliate groups. On March 24, 2015, Katz signed a multi-network agreement with the Meredith Corporation that would add all three Katz-owned networks to Meredith-owned stations in five markets, boosting Laff's national coverage to 50%, Escape's to 58%, and Grit's to 78% of all U.S. television markets. Escape and Grit switched from direct response advertising as a meter of viewers to Neilsen rating C-3 late 2015 with Laff expected to follow suit.\n\nOn June 15, 2016, Katz Broadcasting signed a multi-network agreement with Nexstar Broadcasting Group and operated affiliated TV station companies that would bring all three Katz-owned networks (as well as Bounce TV) to stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar in 54 markets, jumping national coverage of both Escape and Laff to 85% and Grit's coverage to 93%.\n\nOn August 1, 2017, E.W. Scripps announced the purchase of Katz and its three networks plus Bounce which Katz operates, for $292 million, acquiring the other 95% of the company. Katz will remain based out of Atlanta, Georgia as an autonomous division of Scripps. The purchase was completed on October 2, 2017.\n\n"}

Jerry's manager Marty threatens to quit unless Jerry sees a psychiatrist, Ilse Nordstrom (Zetterling), who tries to discover the source of his problem.

In his escape, he finds himself impersonating a British car salesman, trying to demonstrate a new convertible with loads of bells and whistles.

Although considered an American invention there is evidence of outdoor cinemas in Western Australia where some patrons attended in their cars as far back as 1938, and it is possible that these facilities may even predate the first American-style drive-in theatre.\n\nThe first American-style drive-in theatre to open in Australia was the Skyline in the Melbourne suburb of Burwood on 18 February 1954. It was the first of 330 drive-in theatres that would open across Australia.\n\nMany have since closed with the large amounts of land taken up by drive-ins being sold off to build houses or shopping centres, although in recent years a number of drive-in theatres have reopened or expanded the number of screens available.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Coburg Drive-in Theatre in Melbourne was expanded to three screens, as was the Dromana Drive-in Theatre. In more recent times the former Dandenong Panoramic Drive-in, in Victoria, has been reopened as the Lunar Drive-in Theatre and now has four screens making it Australia's largest drive-in theatre with the most screen choice.\n\nIn 2002 the Rodeo Drive-in at Mareeba, near Cairns, re-opened, with the Tivoli Drive-in near Ipswich re-opening in 2008.\n\nThe longest running Drive In Theatres in Western Australia that is still open today is located in Dongara. This opened in 1967 and still operates every summer, the projector has been upgraded to digital to show the latest movies.\nAlong with a few metropolitan operations, there are a number of drive-in theatres serving remote communities such as Jericho in Queensland.\n\nThe remaining drive-ins provide a glimpse of what was a very popular pastime in the 1950s and 1960s. The following is a listing of Australia's remaining open drive-in theatres. It includes portable operations in which patrons can either drive or sit down to see a movie outdoors.\n\nFollowing a visit to the United States in the early 1950s, Hoyts' southern division manager, George Griffith Jnr, believed that drive-in theatres would be successful in Australia. Hoyts and Fox however did not share Griffith's enthusiasm for the establishment of a drive-in theatre, so Griffith subsequently formed a syndicate, Auto Theatres Pty Ltd, which decided on a site in the Melbourne suburb of Burwood for Australia's first drive-in theatre. Construction proceeded through the latter half of 1953 from plans drawn up by AC Leith Bartlett & Partners in conjunction with RCA Australia. The Skyline Burwood officially opened on 18 February 1954 and proved extremely popular, with traffic jams in both directions along the Burwood Highway. Hoyts subsequently bought out Griffith and his partners.\n\nFollowing the success of the first drive-in theatre, the Skyline (Burwood), Hoyts quickly opened Skyline drive-in theatres at Preston in 1954, and Oakleigh in March 1955. The next Hoyts drive-in was constructed in Broadmeadows (1958), but then there was a break of almost 10 years until Hoyts acquired drive-ins at Coburg and Oakleigh and constructed new drive-ins in Bulleen (1965), Wantirna (1968) and Altona. In 1972 the Broadmeadows Skyline was the first of the Melbourne suburban drive-ins to close, whilst the Oakleigh site was the last drive-in operated by Hoyts in the world, when it closed in 1990.\n\nSandringham drive-in theatre (now closed) was located between Tulip and Talinga Roads in Sandringham Victoria. With the entrance being on Tulip St.\n\nToday Melburnians have 10 screens in their immediate vicinity to choose from (counting Dromana as being basically suburban Melbourne). Rural Victorians however have no drive-in theatres currently in operation.\n\nThe Skyline Drive-ins at Frenchs Forest and Dundas were Sydney's first. They opened simultaneously on Wednesday 24 October 1956, with Frenchs Forest screening 3 Ring Circus and Dundas screening The Racers. \n\nThe Skyline in Bass Hill opened in November 1956, with a 724 car capacity and until its closure in September 2007 was Australia's oldest continually operating drive-in theatre. This was followed by a Skyline in Newcastle in December 1956 at a cost of $200,000, with a capacity for 722 cars and a holding area for a further 420. The Newcastle Skyline closed in June 1985. The North Ryde Skyline, on Lane Cove Road, accommodated 620 cars and operated for 30 years from 1956.\nUntil recently the Greater Union Blacktown Drive In was one of Sydney's last remaining drive-ins, however a new seasonal facility with a blow up screen has recently started at Randwick Racecourse. Caringbah drive-in is now a shopping mall. A few small community drive-ins remain in rural NSW.\n\nQueensland had at one stage over fifty drive-ins. Now all of the suburban Brisbane drive-in theatres have closed leaving the Tivoli Drive-In in Ipswich, and the Gold Coast's Yatala as the closest drive-in theatres to Brisbane. In rural Queensland however, there are still a number of drive-in theatres operating.\n\nBrisbane's first drive-in was the Capalaba which opened in 1955. The Boondall Drive-in opened on 8 February 1956, at the time it had the largest screen in Australia. Kids were well catered for with a Merry-Go-Round, miniature Cobb & Co coach and Shetland Ponies to ride (Brisbane Telegraph, 6 Feb 1956). The site of the Boondall Drive-In has now been developed into housing.\n\nThe Burleigh Heads Drive-in was one of Queensland's first drive-ins when it opened in 1957 with a 500 car capacity. It was followed by the Starlight drive-in at Aspley, which was opened in January 1957 (at a cost of £100,000). Fourth to open, in April 1957, was Hoyts Skyline Drive-in located at Coopers Plains at a cost of £200,000. It could hold 650 cars on its 17 acres and also had a children's railway line, putt putt, badminton facilities and a dance floor.\n\nThe Starline Drive-In opened near Ipswich in the early 1960s. Other drive-ins opened in and around Brisbane in the late 1960s, early 1970s. These included the Keperra, the Western at Oxley, the Galaxy at Cannon Hill and the Redcliffe Drive-In on the city's northern outskirts.\n\nIn 2002 a small boutique drive-in was opened in Wonga (north of Gympie), with a second screen added in 2004, increasing it to a 250 car capacity. A third screen was subsequently added; however in January 2010 the drive-in closed, when its owner went into receivership. In September 2010 a new owner took over the operation of the drive-in reopening in December that year. The drive-in has recently closed.\n\n\nThe first conventional drive-in located in Western Australia was the Highway, opened in the Perth suburb of Bentley in October 1955. With a 642 car capacity, this started a boom in suburban drive-ins which saw a further eight operating by the end of the decade (the Skyline in Floreat in November 1955, Mott's in Gosnells in January 1956, the Panorama in Roleystone in March 1956, the Metro in Innaloo, the Lakeway in Swanbourne in April 1957, the Melway in Melville, the Wirrina in Morley in March 1959 and the Eastway in Belmont in July 1959), with another nine sites opening in the 1960s (including the Starline in Hilton). The growth of Perth's suburban drive-ins then slowed to only five more built during the 1970s with the last drive-in theatre, Aceway, in the suburb of Morley, constructed in 1980.\n\nIn the country areas, the first to open was the Oasis in Geraldton in 1957, and there were only three more built in the 1950s; the Mayfair in Bunbury, the Avonway in Northam and the Morcady in Wongan Hills. The boom years in the country were the sixties, which saw 61 drive-ins opened, with growth then slowing to only six more built in the seventies and one in the eighties.\n\nBy the 1990s there were only three suburban drive-ins that remained, but then the Metro (a twin screen site as of 1984) in Innaloo closed in 1993 followed by the Highway (a twin screen site as of 1986) in Bentley which closed in 1994; only the Galaxy (established 1973) in Kingsley remains open within the Perth surrounds. There are however a few drive-in theatres and car-friendly outdoor cinemas still operating in rural Western Australia. The Dongara Drive-in, built in 1966 and opened in January 1967, has been in continual operation since this time. After a storm in 2008 the screen was replaced and the original projector upgraded. In 2015 the projector was upgraded to digital. The drive-in can accommodate 200 cars, whilst it only operates in summer it is the longest continually running drive-in in Western Australia. The Koorda Community Drive-in opened in October 1965; it closed in 1983 but reopened in 1987. It has a capacity of 110 cars, has been updated to digital, and screens monthly.\n\nThe Blue-Line drive-in located in West Beach, Adelaide was the first drive-in located in South Australia, and the first to be constructed outside of Melbourne. It was opened on 28 December 1954, it was followed by the Mainline Drive-In theatre at Gepps Cross on 7 October 1955, which was Australia's first drive-in / walk-in theatre (with a capacity for 500 cars and seating for 400 patrons). It was followed by the Shandon in Seaton in early July 1956, the Hi-Line in Panorama in March 1957, and the MGM Metro at Marion in June 1957. The first country drive-in opened at Port Pirie in September 1957.\n\nFollowing the closure of the Valleyline at Modbury in May 2003 left only the Wallis Mainline Drive-in at Gepps Cross as the only remaining drive-in located in metropolitan Adelaide. In the country areas, the closing of Riverview at Murray Bridge in February 2005 (after 46 years) and the Riverland in Barmera in September 2008, only the community run facility at Coober Pedy, the Coober Pedy Open Air Outback Cinema, remains.\n\nOver the years, the list of drive-in's in metropolitan Adelaide included:\n\n\nDarwin was home to the Paspalis (Nightcliff) Drive-in Theatre, the largest privately owned drive-in located in Australia, which was opened in 1965 and closed in 1985. The Alice Springs Star line Drive-in operated from 1975 to 1990 closing when The Alice Springs Cinema opened in 1989.\n\nTasmania previously had drive-in theatres at Glenorchy and Warrane in Hobart, and in Launceston, Devonport and Burnie. The last of Tasmania's drive-in theatres at Elwick and Mowbray closed in March 1985.\n\nThe ACT had two drive-in theatres, the Starlight in Watson (opened in January 1957 and closed in 1993), which has now been redeveloped for medium-density housing, and the Sundown at Narrabundah (opened in 1968 and closed in 1984), which is now a motel and private housing village.\n\nThe ACT has a one drive-in theatre Southern Cross Drive-In, open on the 2 February 2018. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1423977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1423977", "title": "Marabou Stork Nightmares", "text": "Marabou Stork Nightmares\n\nMarabou Stork Nightmares is an experimental novel by Irvine Welsh, and his second novel. \n\nThe book's narrative is split into two styles: a conventional first person account of the past and a more surreal, stream of consciousness account of an otherworldly present. Like many of Welsh's novels, it is written in Edinburgh Scots dialect. The plot consists of the memories and hallucinations of the protagonist, Roy Strang, making him an extreme example of an unreliable narrator.\n\nRoy Strang narrates the book from an (at first) unexplained coma, which he has been in for the previous two years. His life in this state is a miserable affair, surrounded by uncaring doctors and his extremely dysfunctional family. In his fantasy life, he is an adventurer in the wilds of South Africa, where he and his loyal guide, Sandy Jamieson, hunt for the marabou stork.\n\nWhen not hallucinating, Strang tells his life story, beginning in a \"scheme\" (local authority housing) in Muirhouse, Scotland, with his violent, delusional parents, two half-brothers (one a womanizer, the other flamboyantly gay), and his promiscuous sister, all of whom he despises. The family relocates to apartheid-era South Africa when he is an adolescent, where he is repeatedly molested by his uncle. When his father is jailed for the violent assault of a taxi driver, the Strangs are forced to return to Scotland, a mere 18 months after they left.\n\nStrang grows into a violent, misogynistic thug. He maintains a full-time job in as a systems analyst for the fictional investment group, 'Scottish Spinsters' (a reference to Scottish Widows). He joins a gang of football hooligans who are attached to Hibernian F.C., the Capital City Service, and led by the fearsome Lexo. Strang enjoys his life as a \"top boy,\" feared by the entire town, until the gang kidnaps a young woman who rejected their advances and gang rapes her; Strang informs the reader that he is horrified, but too intimidated to try and stop them, and he even joins in.\n\nThe gang evades prison, but Strang is stricken with guilt and withdraws completely into depression. He briefly revives a few months later when he meets a woman and genuinely feels love for the first time. Around the same time he begins to take ecstasy, and even befriends his gay half-brother. The memory of what he has done continues to haunt him, and his depression soon completely engulfs him, taking him away from his lover and his drug-driven escapism. He attempts suicide but survives, putting him in a coma.\n\nOne day, the gang's rape victim visits him in the hospital. She tells him that she has been murdering her rapists one by one, and now she has come for him, revealing that he was by far the most brutal and that he has been trying to convince himself and the audience (the reader) of his moral cleanliness compared that of those around him. She then penectomises him and stabs him to death. In his final moments, Strang realizes that the only person he has ever really hated is himself, and makes peace with everyone he has wronged and who has wronged him.\n\nThe novel's other, more stream-of-consciousness narrative, intertwined with the story of Strang's past, takes place in the fantasy world he creates for himself in the coma. At first a bizarre but rousing adventure, it gradually becomes darker as Strang reveals the uglier parts of his life and personality, involving surreal images of brutality and sexual violence.\n\nBoyd Tonkin at \"The Observer\" praises Welsh for the power of his fiction and writes: \"Here was a voice, out of Edinburgh by way of Hades, that would never have a problem with energy, wit or compassion. Finding the right form for all this incendiary talent might prove trickier.\" Tonkin suggests that Welsh does not know what to do with his fatalism, but that the story \"gives a shockingly funny shape to that impasse\".\n\nAs in many of Welsh's novels, there are many allusions to music and underground youth culture, especially rave culture, punk rock, comic books, and football hooliganism.\n\nThere is a strong message against violence towards women from men in the book, one passage is in fact set out in a capital 'Z' which is the symbol for Zero Tolerance, a women's rights group based in Scotland.\n\nThe South African narrative is written in a \"Boys' Own\" style.\n\nThe sociopathic Francis Begbie, one of the main characters in \"Trainspotting\", makes a cameo appearance.\n"}

The service was piloted in Lisbon in 2006 and was later extended to Porto and Castelo Branco.\n\nThe commercial launch of the ADSL2+ service took place in June 2007. The satellite service began in April 2008, using the Hispasat satellite, soon followed by the FTTH service. The ADSL2+ and FTTH offers reached across Portugal and included broadband Internet services (at up to 400Mbit/s) as well as a telephone service.\n\nMEO was officially founded after the separation of PT Comunicações and PT Multimédia (later ZON Multimédia). While PT Multimédia employed coaxial cables, after separation, MEO started making use of copper cables. The television service supplied by MEO within the copper cable network is served on the ADSL line.\n\nIn May 2009 PT Comunicações announced, after Terrestrial Digital Television (TDT) transmissions had started, that the triple play service was also available with fiber optic speeds can achieve 400 Mbit/s.\n\nAnother service relies on TDT, MEO TDT, which is included in the 3G plates service that is captured through the mobile internet signals from TDT. This service included one High Definition (HD) channel and the five main Portuguese channels: RTP 1, RTP 2, SIC, TVI e ARTV. MEO TDT service also allows some of the advantages found on the ADSL and Fiber Optic service (pause, record...).\n\nIn July 2010 Portugal Telecom informed that MEO had surpassed 700 thousand clients.\n\nIn November 2011, MEO achieved one million subscriptions. In January 2014 MEO and TMN became a single brand, MEO Serviços de Comunicações e Multimédia S.A..\n\nIn 2013 MEO launched a quadruple play service called M4O that in addition to the functionalities already referred has added the mobile phone, in a converged strategic logic.

MEO ADSL integrates a router with a switch, connected to the telephone plug to decode and distribute the signal, and another for the television called MEOBox. The two MEOBox models are built by Motorola and Scientific Atlanta, with a processor, optional hard drive, HDMI slot, two SCART slots, a digital sound slot and an Ethernet slot.\n\nThe MEO Fiber Optic service uses an Optical Network Terminal, that decodes the fiber optic signal and passes it to the router.\n\nMEO offers television content transmission through four platforms: the ADSL network (IPTV), fiber optic (IPTV), satellite (DTH) and the 3G/4G network inherited from mobile communications carrier TMN, added to MEO in January 2014.\n\nMEO ADSL television service includes a basic slate of 120 TV channels. Subscribers can access more than 170 channels if purchasing the “MEO Total” bundle, which included HD channels. FTTH MEO offers bundles distinguished by the speed of data transmission. Just like MEO ADSL, the basic package includes 120 channels.\n\nWith IPTV channels can be purchased through the MEObox remote control, unlike the satellite and coax services. Another advantage is its speed of 200 milliseconds.\n\nThe IPTV network also enables the customer to play games in the MEOBox and to explore content from the internet and dozens of interactive apps. The programming schedule is available along with a “PIP” (Picture In Picture) showing other channels onscreen alongside the current selection. It is also possible to record and pause the show being live transmitted or even watching what was transmitted on the last 7 days (automatic recordings.\nIn geographies where fiber optic or ADSL networks are not available, MEO offers a television service by satellite. \nThe anywhere MEO’s TV solution is called MEO Go.\n\nMEO VideoClube is a vídeo-on-demand service that offers a catalog of thousands of Portuguese and international programs (including movies, documentaries and concerts).

LSM provides news, analysis, culture, entertainment and new experimental content, produced mainly by Latvian Television and Radio Latvia, and by the portal’s editorial personnel. The site was launched on 3 February 2013. LSM content is also available in Russian and English. News content in English was made available from 1 July 2014.\n\nA unified news portal was one of the steps planned in a much wider convergence of both public broadcasters. In 2012 Latvia’s National Electronic Media Council (NEMC) approved the concept of creating a new Latvian public service media organization.\n\nNEMC members had to decide from 3 different scenarios: \n\nNEMC chose the second proposal, and approved its realization, including a unified internet platform as a new Latvian public service media, on 7 January 2013.\n\nLSM.lv in its first year showed rapid growth. According to “Google Analytics”, the news portal reached 200 000 – 250 000 page views per month, at the end of 2013 page view statistics doubled. In the first year of activity LSM has explored the role and importance of social media in order to reach audiences and bring them to the news portal. \n\nAccording to an article, published on 3 February 2014, during first month 60% of all links to the site were from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and draugiem.lv. In fact, statistics shows decrease in audience numbers brought by social media after first month of increased interest. And as well a lack of activities on social media platforms such as Facebook. The peak of page views in November 2013 is objective possibly due to the increased interest in the site following the Zolitūde shopping centre roof collapse.\n\nIn its second year of activity the portal was ranked among the 10 most popular sites in Latvia by Reach. By February 2015 lsm.lv reached 16.92% of the audience according to “Gemius” data. That placed the unified news portal 10th – its highest ranking so far. The increase in ranking can be explained by a lessening of fragmentation of the public broadcasters presence online. \n\nUntil the end of 2014 Latvian Television and Radio Latvia operated separate domains – ltv.lv and latvijasradio.lv. In order to strengthen the position of public broadcasting of Latvia (lsm.lv) among other internet resources in Latvia, they both became sub-domains under lsm.lv.\n\n\n"}

Quite a few political themes can be found among other standard categories of Russian joke, most notably Rabinovich jokes and Radio Yerevan.\n\nIn Imperial Russia, most political jokes were of the polite variety that circulated in educated society. Few of the political jokes of the time are recorded, but some were printed in a 1904 German anthology.\n\n\nThere were also numerous politically themed Chastushki (Russian traditional song) in Imperial Russia.\n\nIn \"Pale Fire\" by Vladimir Nabokov the fictional author of the \"Foreword\" Charles Kinbote cites the following Russian joke:\n\n\nHe comments on the uncanny linguistic parallelism between the English-language \"crown-crow-cow\" and the Russian \"korona–vorona–korova\".\n\nEvery nation enjoys political jokes, but in the Soviet Union telling political jokes could be regarded as type of extreme sport: according to Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code), \"anti-Soviet propaganda\" was a potentially capital offense.\nBen Lewis claims that the political conditions in the Soviet Union were responsible for the unique humour produced there; according to him, \"Communism was a humour-producing machine. Its economic theories and system of repression created inherently amusing situations. There were jokes under fascism and the Nazis too, but those systems did not create an absurd, laugh-a-minute reality like communism.\"\n\nJokes from these times have a certain historical value, depicting the character of the epoch almost as well as long novels might.\n\n\nAccording to Marxist–Leninist theory, communism in the strict sense is the final stage of evolution of a society after it has passed through the socialism stage. The Soviet Union thus cast itself as a socialist country trying to build communism, which was supposed to be a classless society.\n\n\nSatirical verses and parodies made fun of official Soviet propaganda slogans.\n\n\nRussian:\n\n\nSome jokes allude to notions long forgotten. These relics are still funny, but may look strange.\n\n\n\nThis joke is an allusion to the consequences of the collectivization policy pursued by Joseph Stalin between 1928 and 1933.\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn's book \"Gulag Archipelago\" has a chapter entitled \"Zeks as a Nation\", which is a mock ethnographic essay intended to \"prove\" that the inhabitants of the Gulag Archipelago constitute a separate nation according to \"the only scientific definition of nation given by comrade Stalin\". As part of this research, Solzhenitsyn analyzes the humor of zeks (gulag inmates). Some examples:\n\n\nThe Armenian Radio or \"Radio Yerevan\" jokes have the format, \"ask us whatever you want, we will answer you whatever we want\". They supply snappy or ambiguous answers to questions on politics, commodities, the economy or other subjects that were taboo during the Communist era. Questions and answers from this fictitious radio station are known even outside Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJokes about Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Russian Revolution of 1917, typically made fun of characteristics popularized by propaganda: his supposed kindness, his love of children (Lenin never had children of his own), his sharing nature, his kind eyes, etc. Accordingly, in jokes Lenin is often depicted as sneaky and hypocritical. A popular joke set-up is Lenin interacting with the head of the secret police, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky, in the Smolny Institute, the seat of the revolutionary communist government in Petrograd, or with \"khodoki\", peasants who came to see Lenin.\n\n\nJokes about Stalin usually refer to his paranoia and contempt for human life. Stalin's words are typically pronounced with a heavy Georgian accent.\n\n\nJokes about Nikita Khrushchev often relate to his attempts to reform the economy, especially to introduce maize. He was even called \"kukuruznik\" ('maizeman'). Other jokes target the crop failures resulting from his mismanagement of agriculture, his innovations in urban architecture, his confrontation with the US while importing US consumer goods, his promises to build communism in 20 years, or simply his baldness and crude manners. Unlike other Soviet leaders, in jokes Khrushchev is always harmless.\n\n\nLeonid Brezhnev was depicted as dim-witted, suffering from dementia, always reading his speeches from paper, and prone to delusions of grandeur.\n\nQuite a few jokes capitalized on the cliché used in Soviet speeches of the time: \"Dear Leonid Ilyich\".\n\nDuring Brezhnev's time, the leadership of Communist Party became increasingly geriatric. By the time of his death in 1982, the median age of the Politburo was 70. Brezhnev's successor, Yuri Andropov, died in 1984. His successor, Konstantin Chernenko, died in 1985. Rabinovich said he did not have to buy tickets to the funerals, as he had a subscription to these events. As Andropov's bad health became common knowledge (he was eventually attached to a dialysis machine), several jokes made the rounds:\n\n\nMikhail Gorbachev was occasionally mocked for his poor grammar, but perestroika-era jokes usually made fun of his slogans and ineffective actions, his birth mark (\"Satan's mark\"), Raisa Gorbachev's poking her nose everywhere, and Soviet-American relations.\n\n\n\n\nTelling jokes about the KGB was considered to be like pulling the tail of a tiger.\n\nQuite a few jokes and other humour capitalized on the fact that Soviet citizens were under KGB surveillance even when abroad:\n\n\n\nSome jokes ridiculed the level of political indoctrination in the Soviet Union's education system:\n\nQuite a few jokes poke fun at the permanent shortages in various shops.\n\nA subgenre of the above-mentioned type of joke targets long sign-up queues for certain commodities, with wait times that could be counted in years rather than weeks or months.\n\n\nMany draw parallels between Vladimir Putin and Joseph Stalin: his opponents do it accusingly, while neo-Stalinists proudly. Many jokes about past Soviet leaders are retold about Putin:\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on the DC Comics character Superman and serves as a homage sequel to the motion pictures \"Superman\" (1978) and \"Superman II\" (1980), while ignoring the events of \"Superman III\" (1983) and \"\" (1987), including its spin-off \"Supergirl\" (1984). The film stars Brandon Routh as Clark Kent/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, with James Marsden, Frank Langella, and Parker Posey. The film tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five-year absence. He finds that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme that will destroy Superman and the world.\n\nAfter a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect \"Superman\" on screen following the critical failure and box office disappointment of \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\", Warner Bros. hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop \"Superman Returns\" in July 2004. The majority of principal photography took place at Fox Studios Australia, Sydney, while the visual effects sequences were created by a number of studios, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Rhythm & Hues, Framestore, Rising Sun Pictures, and The Orphanage; filming ended in November 2005.\n\nUpon release, \"Superman Returns\" received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its visual effects, story, musical score, the performances and style. However, it received criticism focusing on its runtime and lack of action sequences. While it was a box office success, Warner Bros. was disappointed with the worldwide box office return. A sequel was planned for a summer 2009 release, but the project was later canceled. The \"Superman\" film series was completely rebooted in 2013 with the film \"Man of Steel\", directed by Zack Snyder and starring Henry Cavill as Superman.\n\nFor the previous five years, Superman has mysteriously abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey into outer space to investigate what astronomers believed to be an intact Krypton. In his absence, journalist and past love Lois Lane wrote a scathing article \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\", winning her the Pulitzer Prize. Lois is engaged to Richard White, the nephew of \"Daily Planet\" editor-in-chief Perry White, and with whom she shares a young asthmatic son, Jason. Notorious criminal mastermind Lex Luthor secured an early release from prison due to Superman not appearing as a prosecution witness during Luthor's fifth appeal trial. By seducing an old heiress, Luthor is able to inherit her fortune, giving him resources for his next scheme.\n\nSuperman returns to Earth, crash landing at the Kent farm, just as he did as a child. He reveals to his adoptive mother Martha Kent that he left hoping to find his homeworld, and expresses his dismay at being the only one of his kind remaining. Upon returning to Metropolis in his human identity of Clark Kent, he is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance.\n\nWhen a mysterious nationwide power outage causes catastrophic failures during a space shuttle launch, Clark realizes he must reemerge as Superman. Saving the shuttle and its ferry jet in highly public fashion causes a resurgence of media attention regarding Superman's return. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the Fortress of Solitude.\n\nLuthor sends his moll, Kitty, to distract Superman, allowing him to steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum. Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the hypocenter to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor plans to use the Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress of Solitude to create a massive new continent which would swallow some of the current landmasses bordering the Atlantic. The world will then be forced to use his new land. Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the new land growth by launching it into the sea.\nLois manages to use a fax machine on board the yacht to send their location to the Daily Planet headquarters, where it catches the attention of Clark and Richard. Upon discovering her attempt at subversion, one of Luthor's henchmen attacks Lois, causing Jason's powers to emerge as he crushes the henchman with a piano – revealing that the (no longer asthmatic) Jason is Superman's son. Realizing this fact, Luthor and his thugs escape by helicopter as the earthquake effects from the growing landmass span back to Metropolis. While Superman works to contain the damage in the city, Richard reaches the yacht by way of a floatplane and releases Lois and Jason from their locked room. The three become trapped when the yacht is split in two by the growing rock formations, knocking Lois unconscious and sinking the yacht. Superman rescues them and gets them to the safety of Richard's plane.\n\nSuperman pursues Luthor, who has made his way to the growing land mass. The kryptonite shell surrounding the crystal has caused the new rock formations to be infused with kryptonite, making the land itself toxic to Superman. Luthor's thugs brutalize Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall into the ocean, presumably to die.\n\nRegaining consciousness in the escaping floatplane, Lois learns that Superman has gone to confront Luthor. Knowing of the kryptonite danger, Lois convinces Richard to double back to help him. Jason spots the Man of Steel in the water and Lois and Richard get him into the plane, where Lois removes the shard. Recovering, Superman flies high into the atmosphere to regain his strength by exposure to sunlight. Using his heat vision, he then tunnels deep under the new land mass and, using the last of his strength, is able to fly it off into space before it absorbs more land.\n\nEscaping with Luthor in the helicopter, a disillusioned Kitty discards the remaining crystals and the two eventually end up on a deserted island when they run out of fuel. Complications from kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove more fragments from his skin, they cannot revive him. Lois visits him in the hospital and whispers into his ear while glancing at Jason. Soon after, hospital staff discovers his room empty. No longer feeling alone in the universe, Superman visits his newly revealed son in the boy's room and repeats to Jason the words of his own father as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled \"Why the World Needs Superman\". Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies off into space, where he gazes down at the world.\n\n\nMarlon Brando appears posthumously as Jor-El, Superman's biological father. Brando, who died in 2004, reprises his role from the 1978 film through the use of previous footage combined with computer-generated imagery. This required negotiations with Brando's estate for permission to have his footage used. Singer explained, \"We had access to all of the Brando footage that was shot. There was unused footage that had Brando reciting poems, trailing off subject and swearing like a sailor.\" Tristan Lake Leabu stars as Jason White, the son of Lois Lane and Superman. The question of whether Superman or Richard is Jason's father is initially unclear. He suffers from asthma and other ailments, but it is later revealed that he is the son of Superman, when he displays superhuman strength and discomfort around Kryptonite.\n\nPeta Wilson appears as NASA spokeswoman Bobbie-Faye. Jack Larson, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen in the 1950s television series \"Adventures of Superman\", makes a cameo appearance as a bartender. Noel Neill—who portrayed Lois Lane in the television series and the film serials \"Superman\" (1948) and \"Atom Man vs. Superman\" (1950)—appears as Luthor's elderly wife Gertrude Vanderworth. Richard Branson cameos as the engineer aboard the space shuttle. Another of Luthor's henchmen (Riley) is played by former Australian Rugby League player Ian Roberts.\n\nDirector and producer Bryan Singer conceived the storyline of \"Superman returning to Earth after a five-year absence\" during the filming of \"X2\" (2003). He presented the idea to Lauren Shuler Donner and her husband Richard Donner, director of \"Superman\" (1978). Donner greeted Singer's idea with positive feedback. In March 2004, Warner Bros. was commencing pre-production on \"Superman: Flyby\", which had a target theatrical release date of June 2006. McG was signed to direct with a script by J. J. Abrams, but dropped out in June 2004. That same month, Singer was approached by Warner Bros. to pitch his idea for \"Superman Returns\", as he was preparing to leave for Hawaii on a short vacation with his \"X2\" writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. While in Hawaii, Singer, Dougherty and Harris began to outline the film treatment. In July 2004, Singer signed on to direct and develop \"Superman Returns\".\n\nAlthough he was not a comic book fan, Singer was most impressed with Donner's 1978 film, citing it as an influence of his, Dougherty and Harris's writing. With Singer's hiring, he dropped out of \"\" (2006) and also had the \"Logan's Run\" remake pushed back. \"Superman Returns\" was financed 50/50 between Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, and pre-production began in November 2004. By February 2005, Dougherty and Harris had written six drafts of the script. Early versions of the script contained references to the September 11 attacks before they were removed.\n\nWarner Bros. considered shooting \"Superman Returns\" at Warner Roadshow Studios in the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. After filming, this could have been used as an attraction for the adjoining Warner Bros. Movie World theme park, but the idea was scrapped for being too expensive. Set construction started in January 2005 at Fox Studios Australia for the film's 60 setpieces, while the start date was pushed back for two weeks. In an attempt to avoid public attention, \"Superman Returns\" carried the fake working title of \"Red Sun\" during filming. Starting in late March 2005, principal photography lasted until November. Filming of \"Superman Returns\" in New South Wales constituted hiring thousands of local workers, generating over $100 million into the local economy. 80% of filming took place at Fox Studios Australia, occupying all nine sound stages. Scenes set in Smallville were shot at Tamworth, while the Australian Museum doubled for the Metropolis Museum of Natural History.\n\n\"Superman Returns\" was shot using Panavision's Genesis digital camera. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters for the design of the \"Daily Planet\". ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences, but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor. A total of 1,400 visual effects shots were created. The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer-generated imagery was used as it would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots. A second unit crew traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. The scenes of Metropolis was actually a modified version of the skyline of Manhattan. Using footage from the original \"Superman\" (1978) film as a reference point, Marlon Brando was re-created by Rhythm & Hues using CGI. The opening credits for \"Superman Returns\" are presented in an intended recreation of the style used for \"Superman\", again to the accompaniment of John Williams's theme music.\n\nSinger hired regular collaborator John Ottman as editor and film score composer months before the script was written. Ottman said in past interviews that John Williams, who composed the 1978 film, had influenced his decision to become a musician. He was both cautious and enthusiastic to work on \"Superman Returns\". \"Bryan [Singer] said he wouldn't even greenlight the movie if he couldn't use the John Williams music.\" Ottman continued, \"it was important for me to preserve the Williams theme right down to every single note for the opening titles.\" Ottman referred to his work on \"Superman Returns\" as a homage to, not a ripoff of, Williams.\n\nOriginally budgeted at $184.5 million, Warner Bros. placed the final production cost at $223 million, coming down to $204 million after factoring in tax rebates and incentives. Taking into account the development costs since the early 1990s, total expenditure is estimated to be around $263 million, with up to a further $100 million spent on worldwide marketing.\n\nWarner Bros. promoted \"Superman Returns\" at 2005 San Diego Comic-Con International. Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris came up with the idea of publishing a prequel limited series, spanning four comic book issues. The stories were written by Jimmy Palmiotti, Marc Andreyko, and Justin Gray, with artwork by Karl Kerschl and Matt Haley. During production, a series of \"video diaries\" on the Internet were released at BlueTights.net, showing behind-the-scenes work being done. After 27 installments, the video diaries stopped for a while shortly before the teaser trailer debuted on November 17, 2005. The main theatrical trailer premiered online on May 2, 2006. The trailer appeared in theaters on May 5, with prints of \"\", while the international trailer came with \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"\". DC Comics published a comics adaptation by artist Matt Haley and writer Martin Pasko, Marv Wolfman wrote a novelization, and Electronic Arts developed a video game based on both the movie and the comics.\n\nThe estimated cost of marketing \"Superman Returns\" in the United States was $45.5 million, the second-highest of the year behind Disney's $53.5 million campaign for \"Cars\". Warner Bros. made tie-in deals with General Mills, Burger King, Duracell, Pepsi, Doritos, Papa John's Pizza, 7-Eleven and Colgate. The film was also advertised with Red Bull Racing Formula One cars at the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix. David Coulthard managed to get the team's first top three finish that day; on the podium, he wore a Superman cape in celebration of his achievement. NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Jeff Gordon also sported the \"Man of Steel\" look by promoting the movie on his #24 Chevrolet Monte Carlo in the 2006 Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway. Troy Bayliss appeared in promotional \"Superman\" leathers and sported a cape on the podium following a win and a 2nd place at the 2006 Brands Hatch Superbike World Championship round on his way to winning that year's championship. The National Geographic Channel released \"The Science of Superman\" on June 29, 2006: a television special that studied popular science analogies with the Superman mythos. Singer admitted at 2006 Comic-Con International that he was dissatisfied with the marketing and promotion. \"A lot of people did their job, and a lot didn't\".\n\nBryan Singer convinced Warner Bros. not to experiment with test screenings. In addition, Singer removed 15 minutes of footage from \"Superman Returns\" after showing it to some of his \"trusted associates\". The final theatrical time length ran at 154 minutes. Warner Bros. originally slated the movie for release on Friday, June 30, but moved it up to Wednesday, June 28. \"Superman Returns\" was released on June 28, 2006 in the United States and Canada in 4,065 theaters. The film ranked at the top in its opening weekend, grossing $52.5 million.\n\n\"Superman Returns: An IMAX 3D Experience\" was released simultaneously in 111 IMAX-format theatres worldwide, which included 20 minutes of converted 3D film material. It was the first Hollywood full-length live-action film to be released in this combined format. One of the key scenes Singer took out was \"the Return to Krypton sequence\". Ten million dollars was spent on this sequence alone, but it was deleted. Singer noted that it could not be released as part of a DVD featurette because it was converted to IMAX 3D. He hoped it could have appeared in an IMAX reissue. The film's second-week gross rapidly declined from the first week, due to the presence of \"\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\". \"Superman Returns\" went on to gross $200,081,192 in North America and $191 million internationally, earning $391,081,192 worldwide. Domestically, the film was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2006. In worldwide totals, \"Superman Returns\" was ninth-highest.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"Superman Returns\" has an approval rating of 75% based on 260 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Bryan Singer's reverent and visually decadent adaptation gives the Man of Steel welcome emotional complexity. The result: a satisfying stick-to-your-ribs adaptation.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 72 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRichard Corliss of \"Time\" praised \"Superman Returns\", calling it one of the best superhero films. He was mostly impressed with Singer's direction and the storyline. Joe Morgenstern from \"The Wall Street Journal\" also gave a positive review, but observed Routh's and Bosworth's acting was \"somewhat dead or super average. Nothing special.\" Morgenstern believed Lex Luthor's characterization was \"well written by the writers and well played by Kevin Spacey\". He also praised Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography and Guy Hendrix Dyas's production design.\n\nPeter Travers, writing in \"Rolling Stone\", felt the film \"perfectly updates Superman for the modern audience\". J. Hoberman of \"The Village Voice\" called it \"surprisingly well made. It's a summer blockbuster filled with mythology and sensitivity.\" James Berardinelli reacted positively to the movie, comparing it favorably with Richard Donner's 1978 film. He felt Spacey was better than Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, describing him as \"more cruel and less flippant\" than Hackman. \"There are no miscasts to be found in the supporting cast, either,\" Berardinelli said. \"\"Superman Returns\" is near the top, if not at the top of the superhero movie pile. It offers nearly everything: romance, action, humor, and plenty of goose bumps.\"\n\nHowever, Roger Ebert argued the film was a \"glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects sequences seem dutiful instead of exhilarating.\" He also felt that \"Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman\", surmising that he \"may have been cast because he looks a little like Reeve\". Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series along the lines of \"Batman Begins\". He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not \"match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film\".\n\nOn May 3, 2009, almost three years after the debut of \"Superman Returns\", the Academy Award-winning filmmaker and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino declared his appreciation for Bryan Singer's directorial work on \"Superman Returns\" and that he would write a 20-page review about \"Superman Returns\".\n\nOn January 9, 2012, more than five years after the movie was released, the independent film community daily news site IndieWire released a two-part video essay that probes the melancholic nature of \"Superman Returns\". Produced by Matt Zoller Seitz and Ken Cancelosi, the critique was inspired by a review that Seitz wrote for the \"New York Press\" in 2006, in which he stated that \"From the moment its hero returns to the sky to rescue Lois Lane from a plummeting jet, \"Superman Returns\" flirts with greatness.\"\n\nIn 2013, Singer stated that \"Superman Returns\" was made for \"Perhaps more of a female audience. It wasn't what it needed to be, I guess.\" Singer stated that he would have cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with \"the jet disaster sequence or something. I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don't know what would have helped. Probably nothing. If I could go again, I would do an origin. I would reboot it.\"\n\n\"Empire\" ranked the movie 496 on its \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" list, stating, \"It may have been a slighter return than some people had hoped for, but Singer's vision of the \"Man of Steel\" is an heroic effort. Plenty of spectacle and a lot of heart helps Kal-El soar.\"\n\n\"Superman Returns\" was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects, but lost to \"\". The film was successful at the 33rd Saturn Awards, winning Best Fantasy Film, and categories for Direction (Bryan Singer), Best Actor (Brandon Routh), Writing (Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) and Music (John Ottman). Kate Bosworth, Tristan Lake Leabu, James Marsden, Parker Posey, and the visual effects department were nominated for categories. However, Bosworth was also nominated a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.\n\n\"Superman Returns\" debuted on DVD on November 28, 2006 in two versions, one with a single disc, and a double-disc edition which featured over three hours of behind-the-scenes features. That same day, a 14-disc DVD box set titled \"Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition\" was released, containing special editions of all five \"Superman\" films, as well as the documentary \"\". It debuted at the top spot of the DVD charts, and also generated $13 million in rentals during its first week.\nThe film was also released in both high-definition formats, HD DVD, which featured both standard and high definitions on the same disc, and Blu-ray. It was the best-selling title on both formats in 2006, and was among the best-sellers of both formats of 2007.\n\nIn February 2006, four months before the release of \"Superman Returns\", Warner Bros. announced a mid-2009 theatrical release date for a sequel, with Bryan Singer reprising his directing duties. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Sam Huntington, Frank Langella, and Tristan Lake Leabu were to reprise their roles. Due to his commitment, Singer dropped out of directing a remake of \"Logan's Run\" and an adaptation of \"The Mayor of Castro Street\". Writer Michael Dougherty wanted the sequel to be \"action packed\", featuring \"other Kryptonians\" with Brainiac and Bizarro also considered for primary villains. The \"New Krypton\" landmass floating in space at the end of \"Superman Returns\" would have served as a plot device. Although \"Superman Returns\" received mostly positive reviews, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures were disappointed by the film's box office return. Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that \"Superman Returns\" was a very successful film, but that it \"should have done $500 million worldwide. We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd.\" Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints, saying, \"That movie made $400 million! I don’t know what constitutes under-performing these days...\" $175 million was the maximum budget Warner Bros. was projecting for the sequel, as \"Superman Returns\" cost $204 million.\n\nFilming for the \"Superman Returns\" sequel was to start in mid-2007, before Singer halted development in favor of \"Valkyrie\". Filming was then pushed to March 2008, but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to 2010. Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March 2008, saying that the film was in early development. Routh expected filming to begin in early 2009. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, expected Routh to reprise the title role from \"Superman Returns\" before his contract for a sequel expired in 2009. However, with Warner Bros. deciding to reboot the film series, Singer dropped out in favor of directing \"Jack the Giant Slayer\". In August 2008, Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected, \"\"Superman Returns\" didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had \"Superman\" worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all.\"\n\nA reboot of the \"Superman film series\" titled \"Man of Steel\" was ultimately released on June 14, 2013, directed by Zack Snyder and with Henry Cavill starring as Superman. This would become the first film in the DC Extended Universe.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27420933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27420933", "title": "Switchboard of Miami", "text": "Switchboard of Miami\n\nSwitchboard of Miami, Inc., commonly referred to as Switchboard, was a private, nonprofit and registered 501(c)(3) organization located in Miami, Florida, United States that provides Miami-Dade County with comprehensive telephone counseling and referral services to thousands of social service programs. Crisis hotlines managed by the organization are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The organization also offers counseling services and prevention programs, such as initiatives aimed at assisting high-risk youth and their families through partnerships with local schools. Since 1968, these services have been offered to the community at no charge. Callers can seek advice confidentially, as no information is needed by the company in order to receive the services.\n\nThe organization maintains a HELPline Services Department that is certified by the American Association of Suicidology, licensed by the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and accredited by the Alliance of Information and Referral Systems.\n\nSwitchboard is partnered with other organizations to receive additional funding and pool resources, including the United Way of Miami, Miami-Dade County and The Children's Trust. Switchboard answers the 2-1-1 hotline in Miami, which is funded by The Children's Trust to help children and families seek information on issues related to school, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, teen pregnancy and more. Switchboard is also one of many partners working with the United Way through Operation Helping Hands to provide aid for earthquake victims in Haiti and Chile.\n\nThe organization has been involved in many campaigns throughout Miami, working with other community partners on projects such as attracting Creole-speaking volunteers that can answer calls made by those who would like to know more about the disaster in Haiti and those who were directly affected by the disaster.\n\nEvery year more than 168,000 people call the HELPline, which is accessed at (305)358-HELP (4357). Services offered by Switchboard are available in English, Spanish and Creole, making it the only trilingual call center in the United States. The call center acts as the backup for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for the entire United States in Spanish and for the Southeastern United States in English.\n\nIn addition to the 2-1-1 hotline and the 358-HELP line, the organization maintains ten other service hotlines designed to target specific needs in the community.\n\n\nSwitchboard has earned exposure on many news outlets in Miami including television stations such as WFOR 4, WTVJ 6 and WPLG 10., as well as printed media such as The Miami Herald and the Miami New Times. This press coverage often leads to stronger partnerships, such as the Care Force initiative created by WPLG 10, which connected philanthropic individuals in the community to stories they would see in a segment during WPLG's news broadcasts. The partnership allowed viewers to access a helpline answered by Switchboard, providing help in order to fill the needs of those featured in the segment.\n\nIn 1968, Switchboard of Miami began as a hotline created by three volunteers to help connect college students to resources that would assist them in finding affordable housing options in Miami-Dade County. Soon after, as the Republican National Convention was taking place in Miami during the time, city officials reached out to the volunteers to ask for their help in maintaining order. The Vietnam War was part of the public agenda, and millions of residents were furious about how it affected their lives. The volunteers agreed to help, and were soon inundated with calls regarding issues far more complex than housing troubles.\n\nShortly thereafter, the volunteers incorporated to become Switchboard of Miami, Inc. and expanded their hotline services, clinical services and assistance to the community. A full company timeline can be found below.\n\n\nSwitchboard of Miami's vision is \"to be the premier organization that provides and connects people with the human services they need.\"\n\nThe mission statement reads \"Switchboard of Miami connects all people in need with community resources, provides counseling and empowers individuals 24/7 with just one call.\"\n\nAlthough Switchboard has been in business for over 40 years, there are people in Miami who are not aware of the organization's existence. They lack the visibility that an organization with such a long history might be expected to have. Many believe the 2-1-1 hotline is answered by The Children's Trust and associate the line with the company, even though Switchboard answers the line and provides the services for it. While thousands of people rely on Switchboard's services and may even have been helped by the organization in the past, they are sometimes unable to associate the organization's brand with its services.\n\nAs the means by which people seek out and gather information changes, it is possible that telephone hotlines such as the HELPline managed by Switchboard will need to change quickly and adapt to meet people's needs in the coming years. People are becoming less reliant on personal communication for information and instead turn to new forms of information search such as the Internet, database systems and social networking sites.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5350475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5350475", "title": "The Da Vinci Code in the Philippines", "text": "The Da Vinci Code in the Philippines\n\n\"The Da Vinci Code\" is a 2006 American mystery-thriller film directed by Ron Howard. The screenplay was written by Akiva Goldsman and based on Dan Brown's worldwide bestselling 2003 novel, \"The Da Vinci Code\". It was produced by Howard with John Calley and Brian Grazer and released by Columbia Pictures in the United States on May 19, 2006.\n\nDue to controversial and inaccurate historical interpretations and perceived anti-Catholic elements, the film proved highly controversial in the Philippines, a highly religious country in Southeast Asia in which Catholicism is widely practised. Many organisations protested and organised boycotts against the showing of \"The Da Vinci Code\" in the Philippines, and the film was banned from being shown in the Philippine capital of Manila.\n\nThe Philippine Alliance Against Pornography (PAAP) appealed to Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to stop the showing of \"The Da Vinci Code\" in the Philippines. They branded the film as \"the most pornographic and blasphemous film in history\" and also requested the help of Pope Benedict XVI, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and other religious groups to stop the showing of the film. In addition, they compared Dan Brown to Adolf Hitler. \n\nHowever, Cecille Guidote Alvarez, Philippine Presidential Adviser on Culture and the Arts, said Malacañang will not interfere in controversy about the film and leaves the decision to the Movie and Television Classification Board's (MTRCB) rating. Eventually, MTRCB decided to give \"The Da Vinci Code\" an R-18 rating (restricted to those under 18 years of age) despite PAAP's opposition for showing it.\n\nJaro Archbishop Angel Lagdameo, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), expressed through a pastoral letter that even though \"The Da Vinci Code\" is a work of fiction, it \"shapes the imagination, stirs emotions and forms mental associations\" and added that \"Brown has created the impression that his fiction is historical fact.\" Before the pastoral letter was written, Lipa Archdiocese Archbishop Ramon Arguelles, CBCP senior member, wrote Consoliza Laguardia, chairperson of the Movie and Television Classification Board (MTRCB), and requested her to prohibit the film's showing in the Philippines, where the majority are Christians, because of its \"sacrilegious\" and \"blasphemous\" nature. \n\nGaudencio Cardinal Rosales, archbishop of Manila, said that the film is a \"vicious attack on the divinity of Jesus Christ\". He also added that \"not since the time of the Presbyter Arius was there an attack on the divinity of Jesus Christ, which was as vicious and as momentarily profitable as this venture of Dan Brown and Sony Film Productions.\" Although, the CBCP and Cardinal Rosales didn't categorically demand for a ban of the film, they have issued guidelines for Filipino Catholics on watching the film. \n\nJust like MTRCB's rating, Fr. Mario Sobrejuanite, vice chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines-Catholic Initiative for Enlightened Movie Appreciation (CBCP-Cinema), rated \"The Da Vinci Code\" as R-18 and stated that the film is something that Catholics should not be afraid of. However, the CBCP-Cinema rated the moral assessment on the film as \"disturbing.\"\n\nThe Moro Islamic Liberation Front Deputy Chairman Khaled Musa appealed to the MTRCB to ban the film, arguing that the film is blasphemous not only to Catholics but also to Muslims because Jesus Christ is considered one of the Prophets of Islam. Musa recalled Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy with regards to this film and further explained that freedom of expression should not \"invade\" freedom of religion.\n\nThe City Councilors of Manila passed a resolution to ban the film, labeling it as \"offensive and contrary to established religious beliefs which cannot take precedence over the right of the persons involved in the film to freedom of expression.\" The Councilors who concur to the resolution cited the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines stating that showing a film which offends a religion is a crime, while Councilors who opposed the resolution stated that the film is only fiction and for entertainment. It was stated that cinema owners not heeding to the ban would face a one-year jail term and a Php 5,000 fine and those persons selling DVD or VCD copies of the film could be fined Php 3,000 and jailed for up to six months. It was not banned in any of the other cities in Metro Manila, making the film easily accessible to citizens living in the capital.\n\nThe SM Supermalls, the largest chain of shopping malls in the Philippines, prohibited the showing of \"The Da Vinci Code\" in all of their movie theaters throughout the country. This decision is in line with their policy for not showing films that were rated by MTRCB as R-18.\n\nAlthough, \"The Da Vinci Code\" was banned in the City of Manila and all SM Malls, it was still shown in other cinemas all over the Philippines. Robinsons Malls Movieworld, Gaisano Cinemas, Ayala Malls Cinemas, Glorietta Cinemas are a few of the cinema companies that showed the film.\n\nDespite \"The Da Vinci Code's\" R-18 rating by the MTRCB, Filipino Congressman Bienvenido Abante Jr. rallied to abolish the MTRCB for allowing the film to be shown. Abante, who is also the president of the Metropolitan Baptist Church of the Philippines and called the film as demonic and diabolical, filed House Bill 3269 that seek to abolish the television and film board.\n\nIn Cebu City, city moralist Rene Josef Bullecer said that the law that created the MTRCB does not allow the showing of the movie. \n"}
{"id": "442991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=442991", "title": "The Painted Bird", "text": "The Painted Bird\n\nThe Painted Bird is a 1965 novel by Jerzy Kosiński which describes World War II as seen by a boy, considered a \"Gypsy or Jewish stray,\" wandering about small villages scattered around an unspecified country in Eastern Europe. The story was originally introduced by Kosiński as autobiographical. It was only upon its publication by Houghton Mifflin that he quietly refrained from making such claims any further. Assumed by reviewers to be a memoir of a Jewish survivor and witness to the Holocaust telling the supposed true story of his search for the deported family, the book received enthusiastic reviews. However, within two decades it was discovered that the story was not only fictional, but also plagiarized from popular books written in the Polish language, largely unknown to English readers.\n\nIt is almost certain that Kosiński did not write the novel himself since his command of English was too limited around the time the novel was written. In a series of articles in newspapers and books which followed, it was revealed that Kosiński engaged in wilful deception in order to corroborate the claim of being separated from his family, and that he did not share any of the boy's experiences. Unlike the main character of the novel, Kosiński spent the times of war hidden by a Polish Catholic family who confirmed that his living conditions were excellent; he even had a female servant to look after his needs.\n\nThe book describes the wandering boy's encounters with peasants engaged in all forms of sexual and social deviance such as incest, bestiality and rape, and in other forms of extreme violence exciting lust. The book title was drawn from an incident in the story. The boy, while in the company of a professional bird catcher, observes how the man took one of his captured birds and painted it several colors. Then he released the bird to fly in search of a flock of its kin, but when the painted bird came upon the flock, they saw it as an intruder and viciously attacked the bird until it fell from the sky.\n\n\"The Painted Bird\" is told from the perspective of a young boy during World War II. He is a Jewish stray struggling to live during this chaotic period, although Kosiński's narrator denies being Jewish. The story begins by introducing the war and linking it with the boy. The young boy's parents are hiding from the Germans, and he lives in a village with an elderly woman. When the woman dies, he is left to care for himself. From here, he journeys to another village where local townspeople turn him over to the Germans. He escapes and travels to another village, where he sees Jews and Gypsies headed to concentration camps. It is here that Kosiński adds some social commentary, describing the boy's belief that to have fair hair and blue eyes is to be favored by God. Kosiński sums up a Bosch-like world of harrowing excess where senseless violence and untempered hatred are the norm. The boy travels from village to village in Eastern Europe. Throughout the rest of the book, the boy endures various kinds of violence and cruelty. He wanders alone from one village to another, sometimes hounded and tortured, only rarely sheltered and cared for. He becomes an altar boy, and he is exposed to father-daughter incest. After being thrown into a manure pit, he becomes mute. Only at the end of the novel does he become reunited with his parents and regain his speech.\n\nIn his 1965 editorial review Elie Wiesel wrote that the book was \"one of the best... Written with deep sincerity and sensitivity,\" a review written in \"The New York Times\" Book Review and quoted by the book's publisher. Richard Kluger, reviewing it for \"Harper's Magazine\", wrote: \"Extraordinary... literally staggering ... one of the most powerful books I have ever read.\" And Jonathan Yardley, reviewing it for \"The Miami Herald\", wrote: \"Of all the remarkable fiction that emerged from World War II, nothing stands higher than Jerzy Kosiński's \"The Painted Bird\". A magnificent work of art, and a celebration of the individual will. No one who reads it will forget it; no one who reads it will be unmoved by it. \"The Painted Bird\" enriches our literature and our lives\". According to Norman Finkelstein, Cynthia Ozick said \"that she 'immediately' recognized Kosiński's authenticity as 'a Jewish survivor and witness to the Holocaust.'\" \"Time\" magazine included the novel in its \"Time 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\", accentuating the alleged atrocities perceived by the protagonist.\n\nReviewing James Park Sloan's biography of Kosiński for \"The New York Times Book Review\", Louis Begley wrote: \"Perhaps the most surprising element of this aspect of Kosiński's mystifications is that he obtained from his mother, who was still alive in Poland – the father had died by the time \"The Painted Bird\" was published – a letter corroborating the claim that he had been separated from his family during the war.\"\n\nNorman Finkelstein, former professor of political science at DePaul University, wrote in \"The Holocaust Industry\": \"Long after Kosiński was exposed as a consummate literary hoaxer, Wiesel continued to heap encomiums on his 'remarkable body of work.'\" Finkelstein wrote that Kosiński's book \"depicts the Polish peasants he lived with as virulently anti-Semitic\" even though they were fully aware of his Jewishness and \"the dire consequences they themselves faced if caught.\"\n\nThe book's reception in Poland was far from uniform. The Polish literary critic and University of Warsaw professor, Paweł Dudziak, noted that the \"Painted Bird\" is a \"great, if controversial\" piece. He stressed that since the book is surreal – a fictional tale – and does not present, or claim to present – real world events, accusations of anti-Polish sentiment are nothing but a misunderstanding of the book by those who take it too literally. Meanwhile, Polish literary historian Prof. Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska from Lublin University wrote that \"The Painted Bird\" published in 1965, includes long excerpts lifted verbatim from a book published in the Second Polish Republic by the Polish-Jewish ethnographer Henryk Biegeleisen.\n\nAccording to Eliot Weinberger, contemporary American writer, essayist, editor, and translator, Kosiński was not the author of the book. Weinberger alleged in his collection \"Karmic Traces\" that Kosiński had very little fluent knowledge of English at the time of its writing.\n\nM. A. Orthofer addressed Weinberger's assertion by saying:\n\"Kosinski was, in many respects, a fake – possibly near as genuine a one as Weinberger could want. (One aspect of the best fakes is the lingering doubt that, possibly, there is some authenticity behind them – as is the case with Kosinski.) Kosinski famously liked to pretend he was someone he wasn't (as do many of the characters in his books), he occasionally published under a pseudonym, and, apparently, he plagiarized and forged left and right.\" \n\nIn June 1982, a \"Village Voice\" article accused Kosiński of plagiarism, claiming much of his work was derivative of Polish sources unfamiliar to English readers. (\"Being There\", for example, bears a strong resemblance to \"Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy\" – \"The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma\", a 1932 Polish bestseller by Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz). The article also claimed that Kosiński's books had actually been ghost-written by his \"assistant editors,\" pointing to striking stylistic differences among Kosiński's novels. The New York poet, publisher and translator George Reavey claimed to have written \"The Painted Bird.\" However, in the opinion of Kosiński's American biographer James Sloan, Reavey was simply embittered by his own lack of literary success. Regardless, Reavey's assertions were ignored by the press.\n\nThe \"Village Voice\" article presented a different picture of Kosiński's life during the Holocaust – a view which was later supported by Joanna Siedlecka, a Polish biographer, and Sloan. The article revealed that \"The Painted Bird,\" assumed by reviewers to be semi-autobiographical, was a work of fiction. The article maintained that rather than wandering the Polish countryside, Kosiński had spent the war years in hiding with a Polish Catholic family who saved his life from the Germans (incidentally - a German officer is one of a few positive characters in the novel -\nagainst the background of savage villagers) and had never been mistreated in any way.\n\nTerence Blacker, an English publisher of Kosiński's books and an author of children's books and mysteries for adults, wrote in response to the article's accusations in 2002:\n\nThe significant point about Jerzy Kosinski was that ... his books ... had a vision and a voice consistent with one another and with the man himself. The problem was perhaps that he was a successful, worldly author who played polo, moved in fashionable circles and even appeared as an actor in Warren Beatty's \"Reds\". He seemed to have had an adventurous and rather kinky sexuality which, to many, made him all the more suspect.\n\nD. G. Myers responded to Blacker's assertions in his review of \"Jerzy Kosiński: A Biography\" by James Park Sloan:\n\nThis theory explains much: the reckless driving, the abuse of small dogs, the thirst for fame, the fabrication of personal experience, the secretiveness about how he wrote, the denial of his Jewish identity. 'There was a hollow space at the center of Kosiński that had resulted from denying his past,' Sloan writes, 'and his whole life had become a race to fill in that hollow space before it caused him to implode, collapsing inward upon himself like a burnt-out star.' On this theory, Kosiński emerges as a classic borderline personality, frantically defending himself against… all-out psychosis.\n\nThe journalist John Corry, being himself a controversial author, wrote a 6,000-word feature article in \"The New York Times\" trying to defend Kosiński, which appeared on the front page of the \"Arts and Leisure\" section in November 1982. Among other things, Corry alleged that reports claiming that \"Kosiński was a plagiarist in the pay of the C.I.A. were the product of a Polish Communist disinformation campaign.\"\n\nThe book was published and marketed as a fictional work although it was generally assumed that it was based on the author's experiences during World War II. Only later did it become clear to most reviewers that Kosiński was neither the boy in the story nor did he share any of the boy's experiences, as revealed in a series of articles in newspapers and books. The depicted events are now widely known to be fictional. D. G. Myers, Associate Professor of English at Texas A&M University, reviewing a biography of Kosiński noted that initially the author had passed off \"The Painted Bird\" as the true story of his own life during the Holocaust: \"Long before writing it he regaled friends and dinner parties with macabre tales of a childhood spent in hiding among the Polish peasantry. Among those who were fascinated was Dorothy de Santillana, a senior editor at Houghton Mifflin, to whom Kosiński confided that he had a manuscript based on his experiences.\" According to James Park Sloan, by the time the book was going into publication, Kosiński refrained from making further claims of the book being autobiographical – in a letter to de Santillana and in a subsequent author's note to the book itself. Kosiński nonetheless continued to assert that characterizing the novel as autobiographical \"may be convenient for classification, but is not easily justified\" (the same language he used in his author's note and his pre-publication correspondence with de Santillana) in later interviews during his life.\n\n\n"}
