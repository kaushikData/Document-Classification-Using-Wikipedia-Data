The antimasque is a spectacle of disorder which usually starts or precedes the masque itself and was played by professional actors while members of the court primarily performed the roles of the masque. It is characterized by impropriety and is transformed by the masque into goodness, propriety, and order, typically by the King's presence alone. It was also contrasted with the masque by the use of the lower class as characters. This then was supposed to harmonize with the king and the higher class.\nIn later years, the antimasque developed into a farce or pantomime. The concept of the antemasque, or anti-masque, was conceived by Ben Jonson. Masques originally usually had one antemasque before the main masque, but later it became common to have several antemasques preceding the main masque.\n"}

Audio signals have frequencies in the audio frequency range of roughly 20 to 20,000 Hz (the limits of human hearing). Audio signals may be synthesized directly, or may originate at a transducer such as a microphone, musical instrument pickup, phonograph cartridge, or tape head. Loudspeakers or headphones convert an electrical audio signal into sound.\n\nDigital audio systems represent audio signals in a variety of digital formats.\n\nAn audio channel or audio track is an audio signal communications channel in a storage device or mixing console, used in operations such as multi-track recording and sound reinforcement.\n\nSignal flow is the path an audio signal will take from source to the speaker or recording device. Signal flow may be short and simple as in a home audio system or long and convoluted in a recording studio and larger sound reinforcement system as the signal may pass through many sections of a large console, external audio equipment, and even different rooms.\n\nAudio signals may be characterized by parameters such as their bandwidth, nominal level, power level in decibels (dB), and voltage level. The relation between power and voltage is determined by the impedance of the signal path, which may be single-ended or balanced.\n\nAudio signals have somewhat standardized levels depending on application. Outputs of professional mixing consoles are most commonly at line level. Consumer audio equipment will also output at a lower line level. Microphones generally output at an even lower level, commonly referred to a \"mic level\".\n\nThe digital form of an audio signal is used in audio plug-ins and digital audio workstation (DAW) software. The digital information passing through the DAW (i.e. from an audio track through a plug-in and out a hardware output) is an audio signal.\n\nA digital audio signal being sent through wire can use several formats including optical (ADAT, TDIF), coaxial (S/PDIF), XLR (AES/EBU), and Ethernet.\n"}

{"id": "904840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904840", "title": "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II", "text": "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II\n\nBaldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II is a 2004 action role-playing/hack and slash video game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Developed by Black Isle Studios, the game was published by Interplay Entertainment, and distributed by Vivendi Universal Games in North America and Avalon Interactive in Europe. It is the sequel to the 2001 game \"\".\n\nThe game is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", and the gameplay is based on the rules of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" 3rd Edition, which were released in 2000. \"Dark Alliance II\" is a direct sequel to the original \"Dark Alliance\" game, with the story following five adventurers attempting to save Baldur's Gate from a growing evil, and ascertain the fate of the protagonists from the first game.\n\n\"Dark Alliance II\" was well received on both platforms, although many critics felt it was not much of an advancement on the first game. A sequel was planned, but was cancelled early in development due to legal problems and the closure of Black Isle Studios after Interplay went bankrupt. The use of the Dark Alliance game engine also led to a lawsuit filed by the engine's creators, Snowblind Studios, against publishers Interplay, which alleged the engine had been used in the game without Snowblind's permission.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II\" is a real-time hack and slash/action role-playing game presented in a 3D perspective, with a rotatable isometric three-quarter top-down view.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, character stats are preset, with the player able to choose from five race/class combinations; a human barbarian (Dorn Redbear), a drow monk (Vhaidra Uoswiir), a moon-elf necromancer (Ysuran Auondril), a dwarven rogue (Borador Goldhand) or a human cleric (Allessia Faithhammer). The player can customize their character's stats through gaining experience points from defeating enemies. Every time the character increases in level, points are awarded corresponding to that level; i.e. if a character increases to level twelve, the player will gain twelve experience points to spend on the character's spells and feats. For every four levels which the character increases, the player is given one ability point to spend on one of the six core attributes (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma).\n\nEach of the five characters have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. Dorn is a Barbarian, and his feats tend to focus on increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, such as the ability to wield two-handed weapons in each hand. Vhaidra relies on unarmed combat, so her feats tend to focus on increasing her speed and combos, as well as granting her close-range abilities, such as pushing enemies away from her. As Ysuran is a necromancer, his feats tend to focus on increasing the power of his magic and granting him new spells, such as the ability to use shadow magic. Borador tends more towards archery, but is also capable of melee combat. His spells tend to focus on allowing him to use a shield offensively, and granting him the ability to set traps for enemies and disarm traps intended for the player. Allessia is a cleric and has access to many healing and defensive spells. She can also use melee combat. Later in the game she gains the ability to reanimate the dead, and have them fight alongside her.\n\nGameplay is semi-linear; most of the main quests can be performed in different orders, but only from within a group of given quests. For example, in Act I, the player can choose to tackle a series of kidnappings or investigate a spate of murders, but no other main quests are made available until both quests are complete. There are also optional side-quests, which do not have to be completed immediately. There are more NPCs than in the first game, and the player can interact with many of them. Depending on which character the player is using, these NPCs may or may not provide information and assistance. Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location throughout the game, a shop in Baldur's Gate, although the stock changes at the commencement of each act, with the weapons increasing in expense and power. The HUD features the option to use either a transparent map that covers most of the screen, or a mini-map, with the player also given the option to turn the map off entirely.\n\nThe game also features cooperative gameplay with another player. Both players share the same screen, and are thus limited in how far they can move away from one another. In co-op mode, both players get 50% of the experience for each kill, no matter which player makes the kill. Additionally, unlike in the original game, all treasure is shared 50/50 between both players, irrespective of which player collects it.\n\nA new feature in \"Dark Alliance II\" gives players the ability to create custom weapons and armor. Players can improve items by using runestones and gems. To increase the strength of an item, at least one runestone must be used. Gems are optional, although adding gems increases the strength further and enhances certain of the items' attributes. The player cannot place more gems on an item than runestones; if the player wishes to place four gems, they must have a minimum of four runestones attached. Each item can have two different types of gem attached at any one time, in addition to the required runestones. There are several different kinds of gem and each has a different effect on different types of item. For example, a pearl attached to a piece of armor gives +1 additional treasure drop, attached to a weapon gives +1 \"Improved Critical\", and attached to a trinket gives +1 Wisdom.\n\nThe game contains four difficulty levels; \"Easy\", \"Normal\", \"Hard\" and \"Extreme\". Extreme is unlocked once the player has completed any of the other three levels. Extreme mode takes the form of a New Game Plus, and can only be played by importing a saved character from another game. The game also contains two secret characters; Drizzt Do'Urden and Artemis Entreri. Drizzt becomes available to use in the main game upon beating any difficulty level. Artemis is unlocked upon defeating Extreme.\n\nWhile the original game focused on three areas in the Sword Coast and Western Heartlands regions of the Faerûnian continent, the second game is predominately based in and around the city of Baldur's Gate itself.\n\nThe game features five main playable characters; Dorn Redbear, Ysuran Aundril, Borador Goldhand, Vhaidra Uoswiir and Allessia Faithhammer, each of whom has come to Baldur's Gate for different reasons. Dorn seeks fame and glory. Vhaidra has come looking for vengeance against those who have attempted to destroy her family. Ysuran is suffering from amnesia and has come in the hope of finding clues to his past. Borador comes for wealth, in order to release his clan from its debt to the drow. Allessia comes to spread the word of Helm and advance to become a high-ranking priest.\n\nThe game begins by revealing the fate of the three protagonists from the first game; after jumping through the portal at the top of the Onyx Tower, Vahn, Kromlech and Adrianna are taken prisoner by the vampire Mordoc SeLanmere.\n\nMeanwhile, outside Baldur's Gate, fate brings Dorn, Vhaidra, Ysuran, Borador and Allessia together. Upon meeting on the Trade Way, they learn that since the collapse of Xantam's Guild, the route has become increasingly dangerous due to the rise of the Red Fang Marauders, a goblin army who prey on travelers. After infiltrating a nearby Marauders cave, and freeing the caravan guard Randalla, the heroes head to Wayfork Village, a nearby fiefdom. There, they rescue the village from the Marauders and kill their hobgoblin leader, Harnak.\n\nUpon entering Baldur's Gate, to assist them in earning some money, Randalla hires them to investigate a series of murders in the city. At Bloodmire Manor, they learn that Luvia Bloodmire has been combining the body parts of various creatures in an attempt to make a new species, and has been giving her creations to Lady Aragozia Firewind. Her first creation, Argesh, has set up the Hands of Glory, a thieves' guild faction of the Marauders. The heroes kill Argesh, crippling the Hands of Glory, and infiltrate the main base of the Marauders. There, they defeat but do not kill the Red Queen, leader of the Marauders. They follow her to Lady Arogazia's manor, and learn that Arogazia is actually a member of the Zhentarim, a criminal network intent on ruling Faerûn. She has been using the Marauders in an effort to bring back the Onyx Tower. Along with her associate Kharne (a former member of Xantham's Guild, who was presumed killed in the first game), Arogazia escapes from the heroes, transforming into a Fire Dragon, Aizagora. Impressed with their efforts, Jherek, a member of the Harpers, approaches the heroes and requests they retrieve four elemental objects. At the same time, the Zhentarim are also trying to attain the objects in an effort to reactivate the Onyx Tower. During their journey, the heroes encounter Sleyvas, the humanoid lizard who betrayed the protagonists at the end of \"Dark Alliance\". He too is working for the Zhentarim, although the heroes kill him. Having successfully found the four objects for Jherek, each of the heroes then pursues their own personal quest.\n\nAfter killing the dragon Baragoth, the druid inside Dorn is awakened. Ysuran realizes his horrific past and his hate crimes against humans, determining that he will not worry about the past, but instead build a good name for himself in the future. Borador frees Gandam's Hold and reclaims the Goblinbreaker name for his clan, who begin working on new forges to free themselves from their debt to fey folk. Vhaidra travels to Cloud Peaks and gets her revenge on a murderous black elf who assisted in the fall of her family's house. Allessia frees the Church of Helm in Baldur's Gate from Goreth Vileback, a cleric of Cyric.\n\nAfter the five return to town, Jherek enlists them once again, for a journey to each of the Elemental Planes to activate the Elemental Foundations using the four objects they recovered earlier. In each plane, they are attacked by the Zhentarim, who are in control of the Foundations. Two of the Zhentarim who attack them are Luvia Bloodmire and Aizagora, but both are defeated. However, upon returning from the final plane and speaking to Jherek, they are all shocked when they are approached by Kharne. He tells them the Zhentarim no longer wish to reactivate the Onyx Tower, and that the Harpers and the Zhentarim have a common enemy; Mordoc SeLanmere. Mordoc believes he can use the Tower to bring about the downfall of Baldur's Gate, which will please his \"allies in the east.\" His steward, Xanhast, interrogates Vahn, Adrianna and Kromlech, finding they know little of the larger scheme playing out. However, Kharne, Jherek and the five adventurers storm Mordoc's Keep of Pale Night. They rescue the trio of adventurers, forcing Mordoc to speed up his plans, and relocate the Onyx Tower into Baldur's Gate ahead of schedule.\n\nNow called Mordoc's Gate, the entire population of the city are turned into zombies. The five adventurers attack the Tower and kill Xanhast, finally attacking Mordoc in the Elemental Plane of Shadows. After killing him, they destroy the Onyx Heart, supposedly destroying the Tower forever. This releases the citizens from their zombification, and led by Randalla, they gather to thank the heroes for saving the city. Meanwhile, in a room with an Ancient Egyptian \"milieu\", a servant tells a stone sarcophagus that Mordoc has failed and Baldur's Gate still stands. The sarcophagus says that Mordoc's failure will not interrupt \"my sacred mission,\" and orders his servant to prepare the army and ready his sun barge. As with the first game, \"Dark Alliance II\" ends on a cliffhanger.\n\n\"Dark Alliance II\" was first mentioned as early as April 17, 2001, when Interplay Entertainment confirmed that if the first game was successful, a sequel would enter development immediately. However, the game was not officially announced until March 24, 2003, when Interplay revealed they were working on a sequel for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The only information available at the time was that the game would introduce item crafting, have five playable characters and was slated for a simultaneous PlayStation/Xbox release in the winter of 2003. On May 6, IGN published an interview with Kevin Osburn, head of the development team at Black Isle Studios and the game's producer. Osburn revealed the developers had taken on-board criticisms of the first game, and addressed those problems in the sequel, as well as making everything bigger, with more enemies, characters, weapons, locations and quests.\n\nAt E3 in May 2003, Interplay showcased the Xbox version of the game, revealing three of the new characters: a human barbarian, a moon-elf necromancer and a drow monk. Interplay stated that if the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions sold well, they would consider porting the game to GameCube. In July, demos for both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were released. All five characters were available for play, and their character-specific sidequests were finalized. Weapon creation was also showcased, as was co-op mode. The game was set for an October release. Both IGN and GameSpot were impressed with the demo, although both expressed some concern that the graphics were essentially the same as the first game. At the 2003 Gen Con in July, Interplay revealed the game was 90% complete and on schedule for an October release.\n\nHowever, on September 29, Interplay announced it had canceled its distribution deal with Vivendi Universal Games, due to alleged breaches of the working agreement and failure of payment. Herve Caen, CEO of Interplay, stated\n\nIn October, EB Games and GameStop websites changed the release dates for the game to January 2004. Interplay initially denied the delay, stating it was still aiming for a fourth quarter release, and would distribute the game themselves if need be. On November 6, Interplay announced it had resolved its legal dispute with Vivendi, and had returned to their prior distribution agreement. On November 12, they officially confirmed that \"Dark Alliance II\" would be delayed until early 2004.\n\nOn December 8, reports surfaced that Interplay had shut down Black Isle Studios, although Interplay itself made no formal statement. On December 16, IGN reported that Black Isle Studios had definitely been closed, and now existed only as a brand under the Interplay label. They reported that when Black Isle's director had quit, the studio was placed under the management of Digital Mayhem, but with the agreement that Interplay would adopt a more hands-off approach. By this stage, Black Isle had already begun work on \"Dark Alliance III\". However, the title was cancelled after Interplay failed to retain the license to use the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" label from Wizards of the Coast, so Black Isle shifted focus to \"Fallout 3\". They handed in a 95% complete demo, including all game functionality. The next day, however, Interplay, who were several million dollars in debt, with just over $1 million in the bank, began to fire people from Digital Mayhem. Two weeks later, all but two members of the \"Fallout\" team were fired. This effectively meant Black Isle Studios no longer existed as anything other than a brand. Apparently, staff were told by Interplay that \"we will continue to produce titles. If we feel that a title is worth of the Black Isle Studios' name then it will be released under that brand.\"\n\nHowever, on December 18, Interplay denied shutting the studio, claiming \"Black Isle Studios remains open with projects pending, the status of \"Fallout 3\" is under review, and \"Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel\" will ship on January 13.\" However, the very next day, December 19, an anonymous former Black Isle employee confirmed to IGN that the studio had been closed, and that although \"Dark Alliance II\" would still be released, \"Fallout 3\" and \"Dark Alliance III\" had been officially cancelled.\n\nOn January 5, 2004 Interplay announced that \"Dark Alliance II\" was complete and would be released for both PlayStation and Xbox on January 20. Interplay published the game, with Vivendi distributing in North America, and Avalon Interactive distributing in Europe.\n\nIn November 2003, Snowblind Studios, developers of the original \"Dark Alliance\" and creators of the Dark Alliance engine, filed a lawsuit against Interplay. Snowblind alleged that Interplay had used the game engine in several games without their permission and withheld royalties due from the sale of those games. These games were the GameCube version of the first \"Dark Alliance\" game, which was developed by High Voltage Software, \"Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel\", and \"Dark Alliance II\". The lawsuit was settled on April 19, 2005, and determined that while Interplay could continue to publish materials already using the Dark Alliance engine, they could not use the engine in any future projects. The lawsuit also saw Interplay transfer the \"Baldur's Gate\" trademark to Atari and temporarily transfer the \"Dark Alliance\" trademark to Snowblind; \"Interplay hereby grants to Snowblind a security interest in the \"Dark Alliance\" Trademark to secure the investment and expected return of Snowblind and its licensees in the event of bankruptcy of Interplay.\"\n\nA soundtrack for \"Dark Alliance II\" was never released. However, in September 2013, composer Craig Stuart Garfinkle did release an album called \"Songs of the Dragon, V2\" featuring primarily music from the game.\n\n\"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II\" received \"generally favorable reviews,\" with the PlayStation 2 version holding an aggregate score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on forty-four reviews, and the Xbox version 77 out of 100, based on forty-four reviews.\n\n\"Game Informer\"s Andrew Reiner scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.5 out of 10, calling it \"role-playing bliss.\" He praised the range of characters, missions and weaponry, the item customization, the non-linear structure and the range of environments. Comparing the game to the original, he called it \"a much deeper play with a higher level of interaction.\"\n\nIGN's Ed Lewis scored the game 8.4 out of 10, writing \"Black Isle Studios have made an appropriate continuation of the story, but don't create enough changes that some may feel a sequel deserves.\" He was critical of the similarity of the gameplay to the first game; \"there is still all of the dungeon crawling action that has worked well in the past and still works here, but there's still not enough that's new to truly keep pushing the genre forward. There could be more weapons and more characters, but the real issue is that the world is still a fairly linear adventure with a steady pace towards the end.\"\n\nGameSpot's Ryan Davis scored the game 8 out of 10, writing \"Though not as impressive as the original game, \"Dark Alliance II\" will surely satisfy players looking for a well-crafted, accessible action RPG experience.\" He praised the range of missions, and the ability to craft new weaponry, but was critical of the graphics, which he felt hadn't really advanced from the first game. He concluded \"\"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance\" was an RPG for people who didn't like RPGs, and its sequel does a fine job of maintaining that design philosophy.\"\n\nEurogamer's Ronan Jennings scored the Xbox version 7 out of 10, writing \"in terms of progression, the only real difference between this and \"Dark Alliance\" is that the first game felt like it had better structure to it. In fact, \"DAII\" feels more like an expansion pack in that regard, with players sometimes given the option to complete quests in any order they choose [...] It's hard not to be disappointed in \"Dark Alliance II\". However, it's equally hard to criticise such a polished effort. On the one hand, it offers more of the great hack and slash gameplay that no one has emulated properly since the first \"Dark Alliance\". On the other hand, the magic of the original has definitely been diluted, where it really should have been enhanced.\"\n\nGameSpy's Raymond Padulla scored the PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5. He praised the differentiation in the fighting style of the playable characters, writing, \"the additional variety in \"Dark Alliance II\" is one of the few cases where more translates to better.\" However, he felt that when compared with the original game, \"while it is superior in a few ways, it's inferior in others.\" He was critical of the graphics, writing \"there are a smattering of areas and effects that are cooler than the original, but for the most part the visuals look dated and uncreative [...] That isn't to say that the graphics are offensive, but compared to the original -- whose graphics were a strong point -- it's definitely a step down.\" He concluded \"I was convinced that more of a great thing would be an even greater thing. I thought Black Isle would do as fine a job with the series as Snowblind did. I was wrong on both counts. While \"Dark Alliance II\" is a good game, it has barely progressed the series.\" Writing later in 2004, Allen Raucsh said much the same; \"Black Isle Studios took over the development chores on this edition, and essentially delivered the same game again. Unfortunately, gamers had moved on [...] In short, while \"Dark Alliance II\" was by no means a bad game, it badly needed updating before it could become relevant again.\".\n\nIn 2015, Ian Williams of \"Paste\" rated the game #7 on his list of \"The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames\". He commented: \"The console market wanted in on the fun after so many years of rad \"D&D\" RPGs being on PC either exclusively or first. And that's how a loud, brash, fun as heck hack and slash RPG series set in the Forgotten Realms was born. It's way more \"Diablo\" than \"Baldur's Gate\", despite the name. That means, aside from the style of play, you can't design your characters from scratch. But the playable characters offer a wide variety of playstyles, while the customization as you level means that you can fine tune as you go. Topping it off is a co-op mode which is so much fun that even Drizzt showing up can't ruin.\"\n"}

{"id": "39026706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39026706", "title": "Blurred Lines", "text": "Blurred Lines\n\n\"Blurred Lines\" is a single written and performed by American recording artists Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams. Produced by Pharrell, it serves as the lead single from Thicke's album of the same name. It was released on March 26, 2013 through Pharrell's label Star Trak Recordings. Recorded in 2012, the song's percussion ideas were primarily inspired by the Marvin Gaye song \"Got to Give It Up\", and apart from T.I.'s rap, was entirely the work of Williams. However, Thicke clearly laid claim to writing credits on the track according to a Reuters article. The song became the subject of a bitter legal dispute with the family of Gaye and Bridgeport Music as to whether the song infringed copyrights to \"Got to Give It Up\". Thicke and Williams were found liable for copyright infringement by a federal jury in March 2015, and Gaye was awarded posthumous songwriting credit based on the royalties pledged to his estate.\n\nThe song's music video was released in two versions, with one featuring models Emily Ratajkowski, Jessi M'Bengue, and Elle Evans being topless, while the other censored nudity. The uncut version of the video was at one time removed from YouTube for violating the site's terms of service regarding nudity; it was later restored, but with an age restriction. The song's lyrics and music video have proven controversial with some groups, with claims that it is misogynistic and promotes date rape. This has led to the song being banned at some students' unions in universities and other institutions in the United Kingdom and prompted a rebuttal from Thicke.\n\n\"Blurred Lines\" peaked at number one in at least 25 countries and became the number one song of 2013 in several of them. It became Thicke's first, T.I.'s fourth, and Pharrell's third number-one single in the US, where it was also the longest running number one single of 2013. The song subsequently became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of 14.8 million, simultaneously breaking the record for the largest radio audience in history. The single was nominated for two Grammys at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. The song has been parodied and covered numerous times.\n\n\"Blurred Lines\" was produced by Thicke and Pharrell with an intention of creating a sound similar to Marvin Gaye's \"Got to Give It Up\" (1977). The song was completed in less than an hour. In an interview with \"GQ's\" Stelios Phili, Thicke explained:\n\nIn a separate interview, Thicke clarified the meaning of the song's title, saying it referred to \"the good-girl/bad-girl thing and what's appropriate\".\n\nThicke and manager Jordan Feldstein decided the song would not have much impact through radio and would need an innovative approach to become a hit. Feldstein told HitQuarters: \"We had an artist that had never had a hit on radio. It was a non-traditional song; it didn't sound like a Timbaland or Benny Blanco record. So we had to approach the market in an interesting way.\" Feldstein came up with the idea of creating a video designed to go viral and brought in experienced music video director Diane Martel to shoot it. Its controversial nature was designed to attract attention with Feldstein saying: \"I knew it would get it banned quickly ... Getting something banned actually helps you.\"\n\nThe music video, directed by Diane Martel, was released on March 20, 2013. The video features Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell casually standing in front of light-pink backdrop as they flirt with models (Emily Ratajkowski, Elle Evans and Jessi M'Bengue) who pose and dance. At various points, the hashtag \"#THICKE\" flashes, whilst towards the end, \"ROBIN THICKE HAS A BIG DICK\" is spelled out in silver balloons. In the unrated version of the video, the models wear just thongs. In the edited version, they are scantily clad and the hashtag \"#BLURREDLINES\" is seen at various points. This is the second time that director Diane Martel and Pharrell join together for a music video project involving two differently rated versions. The 2001 video for the N.E.R.D single \"Lapdance\" also featured models in two variant editions, one of which, like \"Blurred Lines\", is a topless version. The video was filmed at Mack Sennett Studios in Silver Lake.\n\nAfter being on the site for just under one week, the unrated version of the video was removed from YouTube on March 30, 2013, citing violations of the site's terms of service that restricts the uploading of videos containing nudity, particularly if used in a sexual context. However it was later restored on July 12, 2013. The unrated video remains available on Vevo, while the edited version is available on both Vevo and YouTube. The unrated version of \"Blurred Lines\" generated more than 1 million views in the days following its release on Vevo. As of February 2018, the unrated version of \"Blurred Lines\" is available on YouTube and has gathered more than 55 million views.\n\n During a Q&A for \"Grantland\" Diane Martel explained that her desire was \"to make videos that sell records\" and \"not to make videos that express my own obsessions, but to make videos that move units.\" Martel at first turned down the offer to direct the video after being told there could be no nudity but agreed to direct when it was decided to shoot two versions. The video was shot as a white cyclorama. Martel favorably referred to the large hashtags that flash throughout the video as \"awkward\" and noted she enjoyed their obstructive quality. The fashion in which the women in the video are dressed was in part inspired by the work of photographer Helmut Newton. When asked about what references she drew from for the video, Martel cited the ballets of George Balanchine as performed by the New York City Ballet, noting their minimalism, as well as the work of Richard Avedon. The manner in which Martel directed the action and interaction of those in the video was intended to convey playfulness while also presenting the women \"in the power position.\" Martel also sought out intentionally \"gross\" and \"oversized\" props to utilize in the video.\n\nCritical reactions to \"Blurred Lines\" were mostly positive. \"The Michigan Daily\"'s Jackson Howard graded it an \"A\" and praised it as \"one of Pharrell's best beats in years ... by the time the multilayered and carnal harmonies of the chorus come in, the song is completely on fire.\" Writing for \"Billboard\", Chris Payne compared it with Justin Timberlake's \"Suit & Tie\" and called it a \"bubbly bit of disco-shuffling R&B\", while also noting its racy content. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner, who gave the song three out of five stars, was more wary of the single and remarked: \"It's a subject that when in the right hands can be smooth and soulful, but in the wrong, crass and chauvinistic ... you need the right balance of charm and swagger to pull it off.\" \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked \"Blurred Lines\" at number four to find the best music of 2013, tied with Kanye West's \"New Slaves\".\n\nOn the other hand, Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" named the song \"The Worst Song of This or Any Other Year.\"\n\nMusic fans voted \"Blurred Lines\" second in a 2014 \"Time Out Sydney\" poll of the worst songs ever recorded.\n\n\"Blurred Lines\" peaked at number one in 25 countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Republic of Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Poland, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, becoming Thicke's highest charting song in all of these countries. In Australia, the song was certified quadruple platinum for shipments of 280,000 and triple platinum in New Zealand for sales of 45,000. \"Blurred Lines\" peaked within the top five of 14 countries including France and Switzerland. The song is currently the longest-running number-one single of 2013 in Australia and New Zealand, having topped the ARIA Singles Chart for eight consecutive weeks in Australia, and the RIANZ Singles Chart for 11 non-consecutive weeks in New Zealand. For the Latin American market, a version featuring Colombian rapper J Balvin was released on Spanish-language radio stations. This version peaked at number 7 in Colombia.\n\nIn the United States, the song debuted at number 94 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the following week the song rose to number 89, then to number 70, then to number 54. The single's progress appeared to stabilize in middle of the U.S. charts when, in mid-May, Robin Thicke and Pharrell performed it live on NBC's \"The Voice\". Immediately afterwards the song flew up to number 12 on the Hot 100. Not long thereafter it peaked at number one, becoming Thicke's highest peaking song on the chart in his recording history. It also became Thicke's first chart entry since \"Sex Therapy\" and his second top 20 ever, after \"Lost Without U\". The track is also Pharrell's third Billboard Hot 100 number one single and T.I.'s fourth. As of June 12, 2013, \"Blurred Lines\" has sold 1 million copies in the United States since its release, becoming Thicke's first single to do so. As of the chart issue dated September 7, 2013, the song is the longest-running number-one single of 2013 with 12 weeks at the top. The song is also the first to claim the top \"Digital Gainer\", top \"Airplay Gainer\" and the top \"Streaming Gainer\" simultaneously, and to be awarded the top \"Airplay Gainer\" for 9 (and afterwards 10) weeks. As of August 8, it also broke the record for the all-time highest number of radio impressions during a single week in the US, with 219.8 million impressions (which it later extended to 228.9 million impressions the week after), surpassing the eight-year-old record of 212.2 million impressions, set by Mariah Carey's \"We Belong Together\", and is the first song to have four or more weeks of downloads of over 400,000 in the US. On week ending September 14, 2013 it was knocked off number one by Katy Perry with her single \"Roar\". Blurred Lines was also the No. 1 song of the year on iHeart Radio's Top 100 Countdown for 2013. It became the best-selling song of 2013 in the US, selling 6,498,000 downloads in 2013. By April 2014, the single had reached its 7 million mark in sales, taking 56 weeks to reach this mark.\n\nIn Canada, the song reached number one for 13 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one single of 2013. Since the launch of the Canadian Hot 100 in 2007, the song has become third with most weeks at number one, tying \"Apologize\" by Timbaland featuring OneRepublic, and just behind \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars and \"I Gotta Feeling\" by The Black Eyed Peas, with 15 and 16 weeks on top of the charts respectively. It was Canada's best-selling song of 2013 with 692,000 copies sold (706,000 for all versions combined).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on June 2, 2013 ― for the week ending date June 8, 2013 ― selling 190,000 copies in its first week and becoming Britain's fastest-selling single of the year, though it was later passed by Avicii's \"Wake Me Up\" on July 21, 2013. \"Blurred Lines\" then remained at number one the following week, selling even more than it did in its first with 199,000 copies sold. On its fifth week in the charts, the single dropped a place to number two although it shifted a further 100,000 copies, having the fastest one-week sales at number two of 2013 so far. After a two-week break from the top spot, the song returned to number one on July 14, 2013 ― for the week ending date July 20, 2013 ― to claim its fifth week at the top, becoming the first song to spend two weeks off the top-spot before reclaiming the position, since Rihanna's single \"We Found Love\" in 2011. \"Blurred Lines\" was confirmed to have sold 1 million copies on its 50th day of release, becoming Pharrell's second song in only a month to achieve that feat in Britain (the other being Daft Punk collaboration \"Get Lucky\"). According to the Official Charts Company, the single became Britain's best-selling single of 2013 with sales of 1,472,681 copies.\n\nOn April 21, 2014, it was announced that \"Blurred Lines\" was the most downloaded song of all time in the UK, with digital sales of more than 1.54 million, a total since surpassed by Pharrell Williams' own single \"Happy\". Its current UK sales stand at 1,630,000.\n\nOn July 28, 2013, \"Blurred Lines\" broke the record for radio audience previously held by Mariah Carey's \"We Belong Together\" in 2005. A press release from Interscope said as of the last week in July 2013, the track reached more than 242.65 million listeners.\n\n\"Blurred Lines\" is Thicke's most successful song, being his first to reach number one on the Hot 100 (he previously peaked at number 14 in 2007 with \"Lost Without U\"). It also marks Pharrell's third Hot 100 number one, after \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" with Snoop Dogg in 2004 and \"Money Maker\" with Ludacris in 2006, and T.I.'s fourth Hot 100 number one after \"My Love\" with Justin Timberlake in 2006, and his own singles \"Whatever You Like\" and \"Live Your Life\" in 2008.\n\nIn the United States, the song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for twelve consecutive weeks, becoming the longest running number one single of 2013 and of the 2010s decade, surpassing Rihanna's \"We Found Love\" (2011), but was later replaced by Mark Ronsons \"Uptown Funk\" in 2015. This feat also gave him the eighth lead male solo artist in \"Billboard\" history to rack ten or more weeks at the number one spot for a single. It sold over 5 million copies in just 22 weeks in the US, and 6 million in 29 weeks, faster than any other song in digital history.\n\nAccording to the IFPI, by the end of 2013, the song had sold 14.8 million copies, becoming the best selling song of the year worldwide.\n\nAs of August 2016, it is currently the seventh best-selling digital single of all time. It was the second best-selling song of 2013 in the US and the best-selling song of 2013 in the UK.\n\nCritics such as Tricia Romano of \"The Daily Beast\" wrote that the song and the music video trivialize sexual consent. She asserts that many fans were uncomfortable with both the song and the video. Her article quoted many critics who believe that the song promotes rape culture because the title \"Blurred Lines\" and lyrics like \"I know you want it\" encourage the idea \"no doesn't always mean no\" and that some women who are raped are asking for it. Criticism was also leveled at the song's video, which has been labelled \"eye-poppingly misogynist\". In the United Kingdom, more than 20 universities banned the song from use at student events. At the University of Edinburgh, students' association officials stated that the song violates its policy against \"rape culture and lad banter\" and promotes an unhealthy attitude towards sex and consent. It was also banned at other British institutions, including Plymouth University, Leeds University, University of Derby, Queen Mary University of London, Kingston University, University of Bolton, Queen's University Belfast, University of Birmingham, University of East Anglia, University of the West of Scotland, and a number of Oxford and Durham colleges. Students at the University of Exeter voted for a condemnation of the lyrics to be issued by the Students' Guild.\nIn Marshfield, Wisconsin, Lisa Joling, head coach of the Marshfield High School dance team, was fired in August 2013, three days after a halftime performance by her dance class to the song.\n\nJennifer Lai of \"Slate\", while noting that the video \"undoubtedly objectifies women\", countered criticism that the song itself connotes rape by citing lyrics such as \"go ahead/get at me\" and \"So I'm just watchin' and waitin'/ for you to salute the truly pimpin'\", among others, in which Robin and T.I. invite the woman's own sexual agency and are \"putting the ball in her court\". Lai also states:\n\nThicke, noting that all three male singers are married and have children, said that the Diane Martel-directed video was tongue-in-cheek. When defending the song on NBC's \"The Today Show\", the 36-year-old singer explained that encouraging conversation about the song's content was his intention, saying \"It's actually a feminist movement within itself. It's saying that women and men are equals as animals and as power\". After its banning at University College London, Thicke declared the song was about his wife, and that after 20 years together, he indeed knew she wanted it from him. In 2013 and 2014, Thicke and his wife Paula Patton's separation and divorce were covered extensively by the tabloid press including Thicke's efforts to reconcile with Patton.\n\nDuring an interview with NPR, \"Blurred Lines\" producer and co-writer Pharrell defended the song, highlighting the lyric \"that man is not your maker\", saying, \"I don't know anything that could be more clear about our position in the song\" and \"... if you're looking at the lyrics, the power is right there in the woman's hand. That man—me as a human being, me as a man, I'm not your maker, I can't tell you what to do.\" Pharrell reiterated and expounded on his defense during an interview with Pitchfork Media, in response to the idea of the song being \"sexually predatory\", saying:\n\nIn a Q&A for Grantland.com, video director Diane Martel had this to say about the music video:\n\nThicke at first appears to contradict his claims that the song is about women empowerment in an interview given to \"GQ\" in May 2013, stating:\n\nWhen asked about this, Diane Martel denied that there was any such intention calling the idea that it was ever discussed and Thicke's \"GQ\" statement \"crazy\". Thicke later clarified his comment during an interview for \"Oprah's Next Chapter\", describing it as a \"bad joke\", noting that the \"GQ\" interview that was published did not mention that he had been joking back and forth with the interviewer and doing an impersonation of Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy character while making the remark, thus not providing the facetious context.\n\nIn an interview for CBC Radio's \"Q\", Thicke dismissed the idea that the song is about a man forcing himself sexually onto a woman as \"an impossible reality\". Thicke continues, \"For them to take that lyric [\"I know you want it\"] and not take the lyrics \"that man is not your maker, you're an animal\", and we're equals, and all of the other lyrics that are in the song and only to take \"I know you want it\" from a guy like Ron Burgundy who's standing there going, [does impression of Ron Burgundy] 'I know you want it, baby'. It's a joke. If they can't get the joke, I feel bad for them, but I'm not going to change the joke.\"\n\nIn the interview, Thicke noted that part of video director Diane Martel's intention was to generate attention, but Thicke defended the song, saying: \"The song and the video are two completely different things. The song has nothing to do with belittling a woman or misogyny or anything. Obviously, when a guy's standing there fully clothed and the girls are naked, I totally welcome the conversation of what does this video say about men and women, but the song itself, the title, 'Blurred Lines', is about men and woman are equals.\"\n\nIn August 2013, Thicke, Williams, and Harris (T.I.) sued the family of Marvin Gaye and Bridgeport Music for a declaratory judgment that \"Blurred Lines\" did not infringe copyrights of the defendants. Gaye's family accused the song's authors of copying the \"feel\" and \"sound\" of \"Got to Give It Up\" (the song that Thicke personally claimed was an influence on \"Blurred Lines\"), while Bridgeport claimed that the song illegally sampled Funkadelic's song \"Sexy Ways\". The litigation over the songs drew comparisons to that of the 1970s case between George Harrison and Bright Tunes Music over the song \"My Sweet Lord\", which a judge ruled had similarly plagiarized the earlier \"He's So Fine\" by The Chiffons; Harrison later bought the rights to \"He's So Fine\". Ultimately, Thicke and Williams (but not T.I.) were found to have infringed the Gaye estate's copyright, and in 2018 the Ninth Circuit affirmed liability for millions of dollars in damages.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Gaye's family was accused of making an invalid copyright claim since only expressions, not individual ideas can be protected. Pharrell Williams responded to the lawsuit by calling the two songs \"completely different\", further stating: \"Just simply go to the piano and play the two. One's minor and one's major. And not even in the same key.\" In an interview, Questlove also echoed Williams' statement, saying:\n\nIn September 2014, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" released files relating to a deposition from the case. Within the deposition Thicke stated that, he was \"high on Vicodin and alcohol when [he] showed up at the studio\", and that as a result, \"Pharrell had the beat and he wrote almost every single part of the song\". Within Williams' respective deposition file, the producer noted that he was \"in the driver's seat\" during the song's creation and agreed that Thicke, in past interviews, \"embellished\" his contributions to the songwriting process.\n\nOn October 30, 2014, United States District Court for the Central District of California Judge John A. Kronstadt ruled the Gaye family's lawsuit against Thicke and Williams could proceed, stating the plaintiffs \"have made a sufficient showing that elements of 'Blurred Lines' may be substantially similar to protected, original elements of 'Got to Give It Up'.\" The trial began on February 10, 2015. Williams and Thicke filed a successful \"motion in limine\" to prevent a recording of \"Got to Give it Up\" from being played during the trial. The motion was granted because the family's copyright covered the sheet music and not necessarily other musical elements from Gaye's recording of the song. Judge Kronstad remarked: \"I don't expect Marvin Gaye's voice to be part of this case.\"\n\nOn March 10, 2015, a jury found Thicke and Williams, but not T.I., liable for copyright infringement. The unanimous jury awarded Gaye's family 7.4 million in damages for copyright infringement. The response among some observers regarding the decision was that it was incorrect; bassist and entertainment law attorney Joe Escalante stated that the jury's verdict \"must have been based on emotions because it is not based on any notions of what is protectable under copyright law today.\" Singer-songwriter Keith Urban said: \"My initial reaction from it, I was shocked, honestly. Seems more like a sound and a feel and a style and a genre and an era, none of which can be copyrighted.\" Comedian and music parody artist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (who made a parody of the song with his 2014 \"Word Crimes\") described the ruling as \"a raw deal\", calling the song \"Marvin Gaye pastiche.\" Songwriter Burt Bacharach commented that \"bad decisions were made\" and that \"the current situation was messy\". The verdict was also questioned by recording artists and musicians John Legend, Nile Rodgers, and Bill Withers. Classical music critic Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times pointed out that many classical composers used material from previous composers saying that \"John Williams all but lifted the core idea of his Star Wars soundtrack score from the Scherzo of Erich Korngold's Symphony in F-sharp Major, written 25 years earlier.\" However, Motown legend Smokey Robinson stated that it was a mistake to use the same melody, and that he thought it was \"absolutely a rip off.\" \n\nIn August 2016, Thicke, Williams, and T.I. appealed the judgment to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Later that same month, more than 200 musicians – including among others Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, John Oates of Hall & Oates, R. Kelly, Hans Zimmer, Jennifer Hudson as well as members of Train, Linkin Park, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Black Crowes, Fall Out Boy, The Go-Go's and Tears for Fears – filed an \"amicus curiae\" brief, authored by attorney Ed McPherson, in support of the appeal, stating that \"the verdict in this case threatens to punish songwriters for creating new music that is inspired by prior works.\" In March 2018, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's finding of infringement against Pharell Williams and Thicke.\n\nOn May 14, 2013, Thicke performed the song for the first time live on NBC's \"The Voice\" alongside Pharrell and T.I. The website of \"Rap-Up\" magazine described Thicke as looking \"dapper\" in \"black suit\", and that the trio were joined on stage by \"sexy ladies during the steamy set\". Thicke also performed the song on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on May 16 with Pharrell and three models doing backup. Thicke performed the song live at the finale of \"Germany's Next Topmodel, Cycle 8\" on May 30, 2013, at SAP Arena in Mannheim. The performance featured the top 20 contestants of the cycle who danced to the song on chairs. The four finalists walked the runway during the performance, as well as performing a burlesque-like dance on different items of furniture.\nOn June 7, 2013, Thicke performed the song alongside Pharrell on the British television chat show \"The Graham Norton Show\". He also performed the song (with recorded T.I. and Pharrell backing vocals) on \"The Voice Australia\" season 2 finale on June 17, 2013. Thicke performed the song on the 2013 BET Awards on June 30, 2013. Thicke also performed the track solo on British morning TV show \"Lorraine\" and BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge on July 8, 2013, as well as \"This Morning\" on July 10, 2013. Thicke also performed the song complete with dancers in studio on \"The Howard Stern Show\" on Sirius XM Radio July 29, 2013. He also performed the song on \"The Colbert Report\" on August 6, 2013. On September 20, he performed Blurred Lines at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival. On November 10, Thicke performed the song with Iggy Azalea at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards. In December, he performed the song at Jingle Ball 2013 concerts. In May 2014, Williams performed the song as part of a medley at the iHeartRadio Awards where he received the iHeartRadio Innovator Award. In May 2017, He performed the song at 4th Indonesian Choice Awards.\n\nThicke performed Blurred Lines as a duet with Miley Cyrus at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, medleyed with Cyrus' \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Give It 2 U\", featuring 2 Chainz. The performance began with Cyrus performing \"We Can't Stop\" in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a small skin-colored two-piece outfit. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. The performance drew extensive reactions and became the most tweeted about event in history, with Twitter users generating 360,000 tweets about the event per minute; breaking the previous record held by Beyoncé's Super Bowl XLVII halftime show performance six months earlier.\n\nAn ad was created for Radio Shack to market the Beats Pill, a small stereo, that showed Thicke, Pharrell, and the models repeating the look of the (clothed) music video, but with the models holding up the Beats Pill.\n\nA cover featuring Thicke himself with classroom instruments was performed by Jimmy Fallon and The Roots, with Black Thought filling in for T.I.'s verse.\n\nOn June 12, 2013 episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", in which Thicke and Pharrell were both guests, they aired a parody version of the \"Blurred Lines\" video in which host Jimmy Kimmel and his sidekick Guillermo attempt to join Thicke, Pharrell, and the dancers but keep getting rebuffed. The parody video was also placed on YouTube, and received over 2 million views in less than a month.\n\nOn June 30, 2013 Remy Munasifi released a parody on his GoRemy YouTube channel entitled \"Blurred Lines: The Anthony Weiner version\" mocking Anthony Weiner's entry into the 2013 New York City mayoral elections.\n\nOn July 30, 2013 A gender swapped parody video was created for the \"Nikki and Sara Live\" show airing during the season two premiere, featuring the hostesses of the show being increasingly weirded out by naked male dancers and the unusual barnyard theme.\n\nOn August 2, 2013 Bart Baker released a parody of \"Blurred Lines\" on his YouTube channel.

The video received over 290,000 views in its first weekend on YouTube before being temporarily removed due to sexual content. It was subsequently reinstated a couple of days later, with YouTube owner Google admitting it 'made a mistake'.\n\nOn September 11, 2013, the drag queen group DWV (Detox, Willam Belli, and Vicky Vox), released a parody called \"Blurred Bynes.\" The song is about Amanda Bynes and her behavior in the previous months.\n\nOn September 26, 2013, Yuko Oshima and Haruna Kojima of Japanese idol group AKB48 were featured in a parody video, together with Thicke and some of the original video's members to raise the profile of AKB48 in America while raising Thicke's profile in Japan.\n\nOn November 5, 2013, Dave Callan, as part of his review of Just Dance 2014 on the ABC show Good Game performed a parody of the music video in response to the incorrect choreography of the song in the game.\n\nOn December 19, 2013, the Canadian sketch comedy group Royal Canadian Air Farce released a parody of the music video called \"Rob Ford's Blurred Lines\" highlighting the recent admissions by Toronto mayor Rob Ford of public drunkenness and using crack cocaine.\n\nIn their reunion show transmitted on 26 May 2014, the cast of Goodness Gracious Me Special 2014 performed a parody of the song and video entitled \"No Blurred Lines\". The video begins with the three male leads being shown under on-screen labels of \"#Thicke\", \"#Thicker\" and \"#Thickest\" ('thick' being British slang for 'stupid'). The lyrics make fun of the stereotype of the rowdy male Asian-Indian teenage boy. As pointed to by its title, the lyrics also mock and refute the sexist attitudes of the original song.\n\nRucka Rucka Ali has created his own parody, entitled \"Obama Been Watching\" which satirizes, among other things, the NSA and Edward Snowden.\n\nOn July 15, 2014, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic released a parody of the song entitled \"Word Crimes\" from his album \"Mandatory Fun\".

{"id": "703734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=703734", "title": "Caveman", "text": "Caveman\n\nA caveman is a stock character representative of primitive man in the Paleolithic. The popularisation of the type dates to the early 20th century, when Neanderthal Man was influentially described as \"simian\" or ape-like by Marcellin Boule and Arthur Keith.\n\nWhile knowledge of human evolution in the Pleistocene has become much more detailed, the stock character has persisted, even though it anachronistically conflates characteristics of archaic humans and early modern humans.\n\nThe term \"caveman\" has its taxonomical equivalent in the now-obsolete \"Homo troglodytes\" (\"cave-dwelling man\", Linnaeus 1758).\n\nCavemen are typically portrayed as wearing shaggy animal hides, and capable of cave painting like behaviorally modern humans of the last glacial period. Anachronistically, they are simultaneously shown armed with rocks or cattle bone clubs, unintelligent, and aggressive. Popular culture also frequently represents cavemen as living with or alongside dinosaurs, even though non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years before the emergence of the \"Homo sapiens\" species.\n\nThe image of them living in caves arises from the fact that caves are where the preponderance of artifacts have been found from European Stone Age cultures, although this most likely reflects the degree of preservation that caves provide over the millennia rather than an indication of their typical form of shelter. Until the last glacial period, most hominins did not live in caves, being nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes living in a variety of temporary structures, such as tents and wooden huts (e.g. at Ohalo). Their societies were similar to those of many modern day indigenous peoples. A few genuine cave dwellings did exist, however, such as at Mount Carmel in Israel.\n\nStereotypical cavemen have traditionally been depicted wearing smock-like garments made of animal skin and held up by a shoulder strap on one side, and carrying large clubs approximately conical in shape. They often have grunt-like names, such as Ugg and Zog.\n\nCaveman-like heraldic \"wild men\" were found in European and African iconography for hundreds of years. During the Middle Ages, these creatures were generally depicted in art and literature as bearded and covered in hair, and often wielding clubs and dwelling in caves. While wild men were always depicted as living outside of civilization, there was an ongoing debate as to whether they were human or animal.\n\nIn Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\" (1912), ape-men are depicted in a fight with modern humans. Edgar Rice Burroughs adapted this idea for \"The Land That Time Forgot\" (1918). A genre of caveman movies emerged, typified by D. W. Griffith's \"Man's Genesis\" (1912); they inspired Charles Chaplin's satiric take, in \"His Prehistoric Past\" (1914) as well as \"Brute Force\" (1914), \"The Cave Man\" (1912), and later \"Cave Man\" (1934). From the descriptions, Griffith's characters cannot talk, and use sticks and stones for weapons, while the hero of \"Cave Man\" is a Tarzanesque figure who fights dinosaurs.\n\nD. W. Griffith's \"Brute Force\", a silent film released in 1914, represents one of the earliest portrayals of cavemen and dinosaurs together; more recent examples include the comic strip \"B.C.\" and the television series \"The Flintstones\".\n\nThe anachronistic combination of cavemen with dinosaurs itself became a humorous stereotype.\nThe comic strips \"B.C.\", \"Alley Oop\", the Spanish comic franchise \"Mortadelo y Filemón\", and occasionally \"The Far Side\" and \"Gogs\" portray \"cavemen\" with dinosaurs. Gary Larson, in his \"The Prehistory of the Far Side\", stated he once felt that he needed to confess his cartooning sins in this regard: \"O Father, I Have Portrayed Primitive Man and Dinosaurs In The Same Cartoon\".\nThe animated series \"The Flintstones\", a spoof on family sitcoms, portrays the Flintstones even using dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals as tools, household appliances, vehicles, and construction machines.\n\nStereotypical cavemen are also often featured in advertising, including advertisements for Minute Maid. \nIn early 2004, GEICO launched a series of television commercials and attempts at viral marketing, collectively known as the GEICO Cavemen advertising campaign, where GEICO announcers are repeatedly denounced by modern cavemen for perpetuating a stereotype of unintelligent, backward cavemen. The GEICO advertisements spawned a short-lived TV series called \"Cavemen\".\n\n"}

Among these ships was the \"Rouse Simmons\", a Christmas tree ship which sank in Lake Michigan in 1912. Christmas tree shipping continued to occur in Chicago into the 1930s. Ships laden with Christmas gifts for distribution were also referred to as \"Christmas ships\" in the early twentieth century, even inspiring a popular World War I-era song, \"Hurrah! Hurrah for the Christmas Ship\".\n\nSeattle, Washington held its first Christmas ship parade in 1941, but without any lights on the boats due to blackout regulations during World War II. From 1949 to 1993, Seattle's Christmas ship festival was led by the Seattle Department of Parks. Since 1994, it has been led by Argosy Cruises, and sails multiple times daily during December. A lead boat travels to waterfront destinations on Lake Washington and in Puget Sound, and a choral group on the boat sings a program of Christmas carols to the audience on shore. Private boats decorated for the season may follow the lead boat.\n\nPortland, Oregon has hosted a Christmas ships festival since 1954 on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. The boat parades occur most nights for several weeks in December.\n\nNewport Beach, California hosts the Newport Beach Christmas boat parade. Other cities which host Christmas ships festivals include Philadelphia, San Diego, Daytona Beach, Florida, Delray Beach, Florida, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Yorktown, Virginia, Biloxi, Mississippi, Gulf Shores, Alabama, St. Helens, Oregon, and Port Moody, British Columbia.

{"id": "884659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=884659", "title": "Club Kids", "text": "Club Kids\n\nThe Club Kids was a group of young New York City dance club personalities led by Michael Alig and James St. James in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group was notable for its members' flamboyant behavior and outrageous costumes. In 1988, writer Michael Musto wrote about the Club Kids' \"cult of crazy fashion and petulance\": \"They ... are terminally superficial, have dubious aesthetic values, and are master manipulators, exploiters, and, thank God, partiers.\"\n\nThe group was also recognized as an artistic and fashion-conscious youth culture. They were a definitive force in New York City's underground club culture at the time. Several Club Kids have made long-lasting contributions to mainstream art and fashion. According to former Club Kid \"Walt Paper\" Cassidy, \"The nightclub for me was like a laboratory, a place where you were encouraged and rewarded for experimentation.\" However, Alig and numerous followers began heavy drug use. He began adding drug dealers to the Club Kids roster and Peter Gatien's payroll, and increasing numbers of Club Kids became addicted to drugs.\n\nThe group, which Alig estimates included up to \"750 in the early 90s at different levels\", comprised (among others), its creators – Michael Alig; \"Jenny Jewels\" and Michael Tronn, who helped organize the early \"Outlaw Parties\"; and Alig's mentor/friend/rival James St. James (born James Clark). Others were the following:\n\nAlig moved to NYC from his hometown—South Bend, Indiana—in 1984 and began hosting small events. In 1987, he supplanted Andy Warhol as a leading New York partier; in an\" Interview Magazine \"article, Alig said: \"We were all going to become Warhol Superstars and move into The Factory. The funny thing was that everybody had the same idea: not to dress up but to make fun of people who dressed up. We changed our names like they did, and we dressed up in outrageously crazy outfits in order to be a satire of them—only we ended up becoming what we were satirizing.\"\n\nThe Club Kids' aesthetic emphasized outrageousness, \"fabulousness\", and sex. Gender was fluid, and everything was DIY. In Musto's words: \"It was a statement of individuality and sexuality which ran the gamut, and it was a form of tapping into an inner fabulousness within themselves and bringing it out.\"\n\nAs the group's influence grew, they spread from the back rooms of lesser-known clubs to venues such as Area, Rudolf Piper's iconic Danceteria, and the Palladium. From there, Alig and his gang went on to virtually run Peter Gatien's club network, including the notorious Club USA, Palladium, Tunnel, and The Limelight, a large Chelsea club in a deconsecrated church. To draw crowds into these venues, Alig and the Club Kids began holding guerilla-style \"outlaw parties\", where, fully costumed and ready to party, they would hijack locations like Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, ATM vestibules, the old High Line tracks before their conversion to a park, and the New York City Subway blasting music from a boombox and dancing until the police cleared them out. Alig even \"threw a party in a cardboard shantytown rented from its homeless inhabitants\", whom he paid with cash and crack cocaine. He ensured that such events always happened in the vicinity of an actual club to which the group could decamp. At the height of their cultural popularity, the Club Kids toured the United States (throwing parties, \"certifying\" those clubs for inclusion in the Club Kids network, and recruiting new members), and appeared on several talk shows, including \"Geraldo\", \"The Joan Rivers Show\", and the \"Phil Donahue Show\".\n\nThe beginning of the movement's decline was marked by an event on Sunday, March 17, 1996, when Alig and his roommate Robert \"Freeze\" Riggs killed former Limelight employee and reputed drug dealer Andre \"Angel\" Melendez. After nine months, Alig and Riggs were arrested. The group dissipated in the mid-1990s after Mayor Rudy Giuliani's \"Quality of Life\" crackdown on Manhattan's nightclubs.\n\nBooks:\n\nFilms:\n\nMusic:\n\nGreg Tanoose wrote and produced the song \"What's In\" with Michael Alig and DJ Keoki. The song is the most recent and modern Club Kid single. It features founder Michael Alig on vocals.\n\n\nTelevision:\nMelendez's murder case has also been featured on the TV series:\n\nTheatre:\n\n\n\n"}

Measuring 228.6 cm × 172.7 cm (90 in × 68 in), \"Still Life with Lemons\" represented a take on still life from the Cubist perspective, with Lichtenstein using many favorite Cubist motifs: \"...pitcher, bowl of fruit, and faux wood grain - with some of his own, such as sections of the primary colors red, yellow, and blue, portions of an entablature, and a pattern of diagonal stripes.\" The work has an element of three-dimensionality due to its overlapping planes and reflection, although this still life series was meant to look flat.

{"id": "5705815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5705815", "title": "Elastolin", "text": "Elastolin\n\nElastolin is a trademark used by the German company O&M Hausser (O&M Haußer) for the toy soldiers and other types of figures it manufactured from composite material and later from plastic. The Hausser firm was founded in 1904 by Christian Hausser and his sons Otto and Max. The factory was situated in Ludwigsburg near Stuttgart.\n\nElastolin composition figures were manufactured in 40mm (also known as 4-cm), 65mm (6.5-cm), 70mm (7-cm), and 105mm (10.5 cm) scales. Since 70-mm is approximately 3-inches, a 70-mm figure is approximately 1/24 scale. The Elastolin catalogs of the 1930s describe the 7-cm figures as being \"normal size\" (\"normalgrosse\") and the 4-cm figures as \"Miniatur-Soldaten\". The catalog numbers for the 4-cm figures began with the preface M so the catalog number for a 4-cm marching \"Heer Trommler\" (Army snare drummer) was M 47/1.\n\nProduction of all figures (and all other toys) ended after the German economy was put on a \"total war\" footing in 1943.\n\nThe \"Heer\", all wearing correct the World War II German uniform, was represented by parade ground figures that included marching officers, marching infantry men, marching flag-carriers, marching musicians, a marching \"panzer\" man in his distinctive black uniform, marching \"Gebirgsjager\" (\"mountain troops\"), marching musicians, and cavalry and musicians mounted on horses. The parade ground figures had troops for a guard mounting that included officers standing at attention, enlisted personnel standing at attention or at \"present arms\", standing flag-carriers, a \"panzer\" man saluting, standing musicians, and sentry boxes as well as standing cavalry and standing cavalry musicians.\n\nThere was a figure of a drill instructor and three figures of new recruits in fatigue uniform doing training exercises.\n\n\"Heer\" combat troops included \"Infanterie\" (series 500/- and 600/-) (riflemen, grenade throwers and machine gun teams), \"Kavallerie\" (series 400/-), \"Artillerie\" [series 664/-] (crewmen for the tinplate artillery pieces), \"Nachrichtentruppe\" (\"communications troops\") [series 659/-] which included World War I-vintage message dog- and carrier-pigeon-wranglers, \"Pioniere\" (\"combat engineer and construction troops\") [series 662/-] and \"Krad-Schutzen\" (\"motorcycle troops\") [series 990/-] on individual two-passenger motorcycles and three-passenger sidecar models.\n\nPoison gas had been used by both sides on the Western Front during World War I, and so there was a \"Gasalarmschlager\" (\"gas alarm striker\") [584] and several \"Infanterie\" figures wearing gas masks.\n\nThe \"Verwundete und Sanitatspersonal\" (series 656) included doctors and nurses to treat the assortment of wounded soldiers that the medic figures brought back from the battlefield. Series 656 also included a \"Toter Soldat\" (\"dead soldier\") [652/15].\n\n\"Lagerleben\" (\"camp life\") [series 550/-] was represented by soldiers washing, cleaning, eating or simply lying around and their tents. There was also figure 550/36/50, a unit clerk who came ready to work with his own table, bench and typewriter.\n\nThe \"Kriegsmarine\" was represented by a \"personality\" figure of \"Großadmiral\" Erich Raeder saluting, marching officers carrying swords, sailors carrying rifles, marching fanfare trumpeters (\"Fanfarenblaser\") and flag-carriers (\"Fahnentrager\") and a short set of combat figures. There are two basic sets of marching figures -— one set wears the blue winter uniform and the other wears the white summer uniform. Complete sets of marching musicians were produced for both of the seasonal colors. There are also marching sailors wearing white shirts and blue trousers. The set of \"Kriegsmarine\" combat figures includes standing, kneeling and prone riflemen, a charging rifleman, a charging officer, a rifleman swinging his rifle like a club, and a grenade thrower. All Elastolin \"Kriegsmarine\" figures of the III. Reich era (1933–1945) are cataloged in series 14/-- (The catalog number for a marching \"Kriegsmarine Trommler\" [snare drummer] was 14/47/1, with 14 indicating the branch of service; the second number, 47, indicated that the figure was a marching musician, and the final number, 1, indicated that the musician was a \"Trommler\").\n\nThe \"Luftwaffe\" was represented on the parade ground by several different \"personality\" figures of \"Reichsmarschall\" Hermann Göring, and two series of marching figures: \"Flieger\" (\"fliers\") [series 26/-] with yellow \"waffenfarbe\" (\"arm of service color\") and \"Flak\" (\"anti-aircraft troops) [series 28/-] with red \"waffenfarbe.\" Both branches were represented by several types of marching officers, marching enlisted personnel with rifles (some wearing the soft field cap, others wearing the iconic \"stahlhelm\" helmet), marching flag-carriers, and complete sets of marching and standing musicians. \"Fliegers\" and \"Flak\" alike were also represented by standing (non-marching) officers and enlisted men.\n\nThe marching \"Fliegers\" also included an aircrewman wearing a beige \"flight suit\" instead of the blue \"Luftwaffe\" uniform.\n\nThe \"Luftwaffe\" also had combat troops. There were 28/664 series \"Flak-Artillerie\" crews and 28/590 \"Flak-Krad-Schutzen\" figures. These figures were the same as their \"Heer\" counterparts but with the distinctive blue-gray uniform of the \"Luftwaffe\". Elastolin solf them sold for the same price as their \"Heer\" counterparts, but modern auction catalogs usually list them at higher prices and modern day collectors must therefore take care that any 28/664 and 28/590 figures they buy are not post-war repaints of the regular 664 and 590 figures.\n\nThe paramilitary units include the SA (\"Sturm Abteilung\"), the SS, the LSSAH (\"Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\" = Hitler's elite SS bodyguard unit), the RAD (\"Reichsarbeitsdienst\" = German Labor Service), NSDAP (the Nazi party), Hitler Youth (\"Hitler Jugend\"), \"Jungvolk\" (pre-teen counterpart of the Hitler Youth), BdM (female counterpart of the Hitler Youth), \"Marinesturm\" (Marine-SA; a specialized sub-unit of the SA), and several others.\n\nAll the paramilitary organizations were represented by marching figures. There were complete marching bands of SA, SS and RAD musicians; also a complete band of standing (non-marching) SA musicians that included a \"kesselpauker\" (kettle drummer). The \"Jungfolk\" were represented by marching drummers, flautists and \"fanfarenblaser\".\n\nThere were SA, SS, LSSAH, RAD, Hitler Youth, \"Jungvolk\", BdM and NSFK marching figures carrying either the German national flag or the flag of their individual organization.\n\nThe SA had been the largest and most visible of the Nazi paramilitary organizations in the 1920s and on into the 1930s, and so it is not surprising that Elastolin made many types of SA figures. There SA figures in several types of uniforms—the basic \"brown shirt,\" another uniform with a brown jacket, and a winter uniform. The SA marchers included men carrying packs, and men with slung rifles. The parade figures also included an SA medic and an SA nurse—quick \"first aid\" (at the least) was often important during the \"Kampfzeit\" (\"time of battle/struggle\") before Hitler was appointed chancellor!\n\nThere were also figures on horseback, and a small group of mounted SA musicians.\n\nStepping outside the parade ground, there was an extensive line of SA \"Lagerleben\" figures and others representing a unit undergoing field training.\n\nThe first \"personality figures\" Hausser producer were Kaiser Wilhelm II and soon after \"Feldmarschall\" von Hindenburg during World War I.\n\nThe \"personality figures\" include Hitler, von Hindenburg, Ludendorff, Göring, Hess, Goebbels, von Schirach, \"Großadmiral\" Raeder, and \"Generalfeldmarschall\" von Mackensen in Hussar uniform. There are also two personality figures of Mussolini and one of Franco. A personality figure of SA leader Ernst Röhm was dropped from the line after he was executed during the so-called \"Night of the Long Knives\" (a purge of the socialist wing of the Nazi party) in 1934. The figure of General von Blomberg became a generic General figure after he was forced to retire in 1938.\n\nHitler was represented by several uniformed figures; one was a walking figure of Hitler reviewing troops or perhaps a Nazi unit with his right arm up in his unique bent-arm salute. There was also a seated Hitler to ride in one of Elastolin's magnificent staff cars (German children knew the Führer always sat up front next to the driver and \"never\" in the back seat). There was also an early figure of Hitler in civilian attire.\n\nGöring's high profile in the German leadership was reflected by the fact that he too was represented by figures showing him in SA, NSFK and Luftwaffe uniform. There was a walking figure (26/21) of Goring reviewing troops, and as Goring was promoted to \"Generalfeldmarschall\" and then to the unique rank of \"Reichsmarschall\" a figure was produced that showed \"the Iron Man\" holding an appropriately large \"marschall's\" baton.\n\nPremium grade figures of Hitler, Göring, Hindenburg, Mussolini and Franco were made with headless composition bodies that were then fitted with special-made porcelain heads that captured their facial features and expressions with exceptional clarity. These command premium prices from collectors.\n\nMussolini was available as a walking figure (25/21N) and sitting astride a horse (25/496N). \"Generalfeldmarshall und Reichspresident\" von Hindenburg was still in the catalog for several years after his death in 1934 and was available in uniform (649), in civilian attire (648), and in uniform astride a horse.\n\nAll of the Nazi leaders (Hitler, Röhm, Heß, Göring, Goebbels and von Schirach) were represented by at least one figure with a movable right arm that could be raised and positioned in the \"German greeting\" (aka the \"Heil Hitler!\" salute). The figures of Mussolini and Franco also had arms could also positioned in the Fascist-style salute (In contrast, \"Wehrmacht\" figures saluted/\"greeted\" each other with the traditional right-hand-touching-cap/helmet salute).\n\nThe foreign (\"Ausländer\") armed services were also well represented. These include English, American, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, Ethiopian, French, Swiss, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, (British) Indian, Chinese and Japanese.\n\nThe French forces include the French Army (marching and combat figures), marching French sailors, marching French colonial forces (\"French\" and \"native\"), and a short line of the elite \"chasseurs alpins\" (mountain troops). The Belgians were represented by infantry—marching figures and combat figures; there was also a short line of figures wearing the distinctive green beret of the Ardennes Rifle Corps.\n\nThe Italians were represented by marching infantry and several combat figures; there were also marching officers and men of the elite \"bersaglieri\" rifle units with their broad-brimmed hats and black cockerel feathers. Italian figures in tropical uniforms, and (black) African colonial soldiers were produced in small numbers.\n\nGuards Regiments in colourful dress uniforms were produced of Great Britain's Grenadier Guards and Denmark's Royal Life Guards.\n\nHausser-Elastolin made most of its foreign figures by adding a head with the correct helmet to a headless conventional body and then painting the figure accordingly. That is why English, American and French soldiers are armed with German-style \"potato masher\" hand grenades rather than the Allied \"pineapple\" hand grenade, and why they carry a standard German gas mask canister. However, there are also some foreign figures that were made from special castings—those of Belgian and French soldiers wearing long greatcoats being the best example.\n\nSeveral other European nations took note of the greater protection afforded by the German \"stahlhelm\" design and used it for their own forces. This made it possible for Elastolin to create figures representing some foreign armies simply by painting standard German figures with German heads in the color(s) of a foreign uniform. Therefore, it is helpful to have a good reference book such as Andrew Mollo's \"The Armed Forces of World War II\" to correctly identify them—particularly when distinguishing between German, Hungarian and Swiss personnel.\n\nThe Hausser-Elastolin line of the 1930s was not limited to the military and paramilitary units of the time. There was also an extensive line of cowboys and Indians (the cowboys sometimes known as \"trappers\" in Germany), a shorter line of medieval knights and foot soldiers (\"Ritterfiguren\"), and a short line of Prussian and Austrian figures from the 18th-century wars of Frederick the Great (\"Friedrich der Grosse\") that included personality figures of \"der alte Fritz\" (0/7/20) and two of his generals—Seydlitz (0/7/21) and Ziethen (0/7/22). The figure of a Prussian drummer with a black (African) face (figure 0/7/47/1M) is correct; there was an African drummer in the Prussian army at that time, however such a figure should be checked carefully with a \"black light\" to make sure that it is not a post-war repaint.\n\nThere was an extensive lines of wild animals (\"menagerie-und-jagdtiere\") and farm animals (\"haustiere\"), and also a line of more than 30 civilian figures for use with electric trains (\"Eisenbahn-Figuren\"). The latter included DRB (\"Deutsche Reichsbahn\" = German Railway) workers, station workers such as luggage carriers, and passengers; they were produced primarily in 7-cm (\"Normalgroße\") although some were also available in 5-cm and 3-cm sizes.\n\nHausser produced log cabin forts for the cowboys, castles/fortresses for the knights, houses and barns for the farmers and their animals, zoo enclosures for the wild animals, and an assortment of trench pieces and bunkers (\"Schutzengraben aus Holz\") that allowed piece-by-piece purchase and assembly of multi-line trench systems for the soldiers. These included artillery emplacements, command bunkers, a field kitchen and a first aid station.\n\nThere was an equally extensive line of tin plate military wagons (including a field kitchen and a field bakery), trucks, half-tracks, searchlights and artillery pieces. Some of the 1920s vintage models were rather generic in design, but some of the later models were accurate scale models of their real-life counterparts—the 721-1/2 \"leichtes Inf.-Geschutz\" (\"light infantry cannon\"), 726 \"schweres Langrohrgeschutz\" (\"heavy long-barreled cannon\"), 710 \"Schwere Feldhaubitze\" (\"heavy field howitzer\") and the 744 \"Panzer-Spahwagen\" (\"armored scout wagen\" = armored car) in particular.\n\nElastolin added play action value to these toys in several ways. Several of the motor vehicles had battery-powered electric motors that propelled them across the tin plate battlefield with functional electric headlights lighting the way; the truck-mounted and stationary search lights were also functional. The \"Nachrichtentruppe\" figure series included \"radio groups\" equipped with batteries that allowed messages to be sent and received in Morse code. Three of the \"Infanterie\" riflemen (54/624, 54/626 and 54/628) contained a cap-firing device that—when tripped—would, in theory, send a puff of smoke out the barrel of their (oversize) rifles. Many of the tin plate artillery pieces not only fired caps but projectiles as well—which, in theory were fired only at enemy soldiers and never at family pets or one's younger siblings!\n\nEnterprising young generals with the financial resources to do so could also provide their forces with engineer units using two types of man-powered water craft for crossing water obstacles, and with either a pontoon bridge or a conventional girder bridge so that horses and motor vehicles could cross as well.\n\nLimited production of composition figures resumed several years after the end of World War II in 1945 subject to the strict terms of \"de-Nazification.\" Post-war production included the politically inoffensive Swiss figures with their black German-style helmets and black ankle boots, and a new line of American army figures wearing the dark olive uniform and \"steel pot\" style helmet of the WWII-era US Army.\n\nFigures representing the post-war \"Bundeswehr\" and Austrian armies went into production after \nWest Germany and Austria were again allowed to form military forces.\n\nHausser continued to use the brand name \"Elastolin\" when it began production of figures in a hard polystyrene plastic in 1955 (production of figures in the older sawdust-based composition material continued). In the years that followed the company produced Roman soldiers, Huns, Vikings, Normans, \"Landsknechts\" and 17th-century Turks. Hausser-Elastolin also manufactured personality figures of Prince Valiant and at least one or two other characters from the popular comic strip and feature film.\n\nSome of the old figure lines -- Medieval figures, \"Trappers\" (cowboys), American Indians and de-Nazified figures of World War-II era German soldiers—were also manufactured in plastic. Hausser had exclusive rights to produce figures for the works of Karl May, a German author whose tales of the American \"Wild West\" captured the imaginations of several generations of German boys, and so there are plastic figures representing several of May's best-known characters.\n\nAlong with these figures came an impressive new line of catapults, siege towers, a battering ram, camp fences, and early artillery pieces.\n\nCollectors recognize several distinct production series (or types) of these plastic figures. The early lines were sold fully painted as with the older composition figures, a later line was sold unpainted. Plastic figures cannot be correctly identified or appraised in terms of value without reference to the color of the plastic. Beyond that, the rarity (and value) of some figures is also determined by the color of their clothing; some colors are rarer than others.\n\nThe 1980 catalog includes Romans, Vikings, Huns, Normans/Medieval figures (including Prince Valiant and Sir Gawain), \"Landsknechts\", Turks, American Indians, cowboys, US cavalry, Karl May characters, Arabs, US War of Independence figures (US regulars and militia, English and German), Prussian soldiers, Union and Confederate soldiers from the American Civil War, contemporary Swiss and Austrian soldiers, de-Nazified World War-II era German soldiers, and two figures representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nThe cowboys included two masked outlaws and several men wearing buckskin rather than cloth. The line also included the unfortunate prisoner tied to a tree.\n\nIn addition to all the fighting men where were also some civilians—a blacksmith and several helpers with a forge and well from the Middle Ages, and a few Caucasian women and children from the American \"Wild West\" as the counterparts for the American Indian women and children. Each of the Revolutionary War forces could call on the services of a woman holding a cup in one hand a larger container in the other—presumably both held water. \nHistorical personality figurers in 1980 included Götz von Berlichingen, Georg von Frundsberg and Friedrich der Große. One of the several Revolutionary War figures was certainly intended to be George Washington, but the catalog did not identify him as such.\n\nWheeled vehicles included a four-horse Roman chariot, a \"Kampfwagen\" (battle wagen) of the European late-Middle Ages, an American stage coach drawn by two horses, and an American covered wagen (also drawn by two horses)\n\nHausser stopped manufacturing figures from composite materials in 1969. Production of plastic figures continued through 1982. The company filed for bankruptcy in June 1983 and ceased production by the end of the year.\n\nMany of the Hausser moulds were purchased by the Preiser company and are currently being reproduced in plastic.\n\nWorms [GERMANY], 1997 [auction catalog]\n\n"}

{"id": "10487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10487", "title": "Evil Dead II", "text": "Evil Dead II\n\nEvil Dead II (also known in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi, and a parody sequel to the 1981 horror film \"The Evil Dead\". The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.\n\nFilming took place in Michigan and North Carolina in 1986, and the film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987. It was a minor box office success, achieving just under $6 million. It garnered positive reviews in which critics praised Raimi's direction and Campbell's performance. Like the original, \"Evil Dead II\" has accumulated a cult following. The film was followed by a third installment, \"Army of Darkness\", in 1992 and a television series, \"Ash vs Evil Dead\", in 2015.\n\nThe movie opens with a brief (and altered/reimagined/truncated) recap of the first movie. Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Book of the Dead, \"Necronomicon Ex-Mortis\", which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force (also known as the Kandarian Demon) that kills and later possesses Linda, turning her into a \"deadite\". Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel and bury her near the cabin.\n\nAt dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. Ash briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the force is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash attempts to flee the area, but finds that the bridge leading to the cabin has been destroyed. The spirit chases Ash back to the cabin where Linda's revived head attacks him, biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless deadite Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Then Ash's possessed right hand tries to kill him, and Ash is forced to sever his hand with his chainsaw. Ash then attempts to shoot the severed hand hiding in the wall of the cabin. The hand mocks him and ultimately gets away. \n\nMeanwhile, Knowby's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the \"Necronomicon\" in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of locals Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane by the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life with objects in the room laughing hysterically at him.\n\nThe four new arrivals meet Ash at the cabin and listen to a recording of Knowby detailing how his wife Henrietta was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, forcing him to kill her. They find Mrs. Knowby, now a deadite, in the cabin's root cellar, and it attacks and possesses Ed; Ash dismembers him with an axe. Bobby Joe tries to escape but is attacked by the demon trees and dragged to her death. Annie translates two of the pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, holding them at gunpoint to force them to go look for Bobby Joe. Ash is possessed once again and turns on his remaining companions, incapacitating Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake (mistaking him for the possessed Ash) and drags him to the cellar door, where he is killed by Henrietta in a gory bloodbath. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self when he sees his girlfriend Linda's necklace.\n\nAsh, with Annie's help, modifies the chainsaw and attaches it to his stump, where his right hand had been. Ash eventually finds the missing pages of the \"Necronomicon\" and kills Henrietta, who has turned into a long-necked monster. After Ash kills Henrietta, the woods begin to unleash destruction on the house. Annie reveals that she has only read the first half of the incantation. The spirit of the woods attacks the house as Annie starts to read the second half. As she reads it, she is interrupted as she turns around, revealing that Ash's possessed hand has stabbed her in the back with the Kandarrian dagger. She falls to the floor as Ash is attacked by the spirit of the woods. When all hope is lost, Annie completes the incantation. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex/portal which not only draws in the demon, but nearby trees, Ash's Oldsmobile Delta 88, and Ash himself. Annie dies just as she finishes the incantation.\n\nAsh and his Oldsmobile land in the year 1300 AD. He is then confronted by a group of knights who initially mistake him for a deadite, but they are quickly distracted when a real one shows up. Ash blasts the harpy-like deadite with his shotgun and is hailed as a hero who has come to save the realm, at which point he breaks down and screams in anguish.\n\n\nThe concept of a sequel to \"The Evil Dead\" was discussed during location shooting on the first film. Raimi wanted to toss his hero, Ash, through a time portal, back into the Middle Ages. That notion eventually led to the third installment, \"Army of Darkness\".\n\nAfter the release of \"The Evil Dead\", Raimi moved on to \"Crimewave\", a cross between a crime film and a comedy produced by Raimi and Joel and Ethan Coen. Irvin Shapiro, a publicist who was primarily responsible for the mainstream release of \"The Evil Dead\", suggested that they next work on an \"Evil Dead\" sequel. Raimi scoffed at the idea, expecting \"Crimewave\" to be a hit, but Shapiro put out ads announcing the sequel regardless.\n\nAfter \"Crimewave\" was released to little audience or critical reaction, Raimi and Tapert, knowing that another flop would further stall their already lagging careers, took Shapiro up on his offer. Around the same time, they met Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis, the owner of production and distribution company DEG. He had asked Raimi if he would direct a theatrical adaptation of the Stephen King (written under his Richard Bachman pseudonym) novel \"Thinner\". Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis continued to be interested in the young filmmaker.\n\nThe \"Thinner\" adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King's successful horror fiction. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, \"Maximum Overdrive\", based on his short story \"Trucks.\" He had dinner with a crew member who had been interviewed about the \"Evil Dead\" sequel, and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at Cannes, called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film.\n\nThough initially skeptical, De Laurentiis agreed after being presented with the extremely high Italian revenue for the first film. Although Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, they were allotted only $3.6 million. As such, the planned medieval storyline had to be scrapped.\n\nThough they had only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of \"Crimewave\". Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the Super 8 mm films they had produced during their childhood in Michigan. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that \"Evil Dead II\" should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film's characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.\n\nSpiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors Frances McDormand, Kathy Bates, and Holly Hunter (Hunter was the primary inspiration for the Bobby Jo character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, \"Crimewave\" and Josh Becker's \"Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except\", the script took a long time to finish.\n\nAmong the film's many inspirations include The Three Stooges and other slapstick comedy films; Ash's fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager, entitled \"Attack of the Helping Hand\", which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising Hamburger Helper. The \"laughing room\" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a Popeye-esque laugh. Spiegel's humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes; for instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is \"A Farewell to Arms\".\n\nWhile Raimi and Campbell have stated that \"Evil Dead 2\" was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first movie and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of \"The Evil Dead\" yet remains intact in \"Evil Dead 2\". The corpses of Ash’s friends from the first movie are absent, and they are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film.\n\nWith the script completed, and a production company secured, principal photography began. The production commenced in Wadesboro, North Carolina, not far from De Laurentiis' offices in Wilmington. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. Steven Spielberg had previously filmed \"The Color Purple\" in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for \"Evil Dead II\". Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, which is where the interior cabin set was located.\n\nThe film's production was not nearly as chaotic or strange as the original film's production, largely because of Raimi, Tapert and Campbell's additional film making experience. However, there are nevertheless numerous stories about the strange happenings on the set. For instance, the rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed \"Señor Cojones\" by the crew (\"cojones\" is Spanish slang for \"testicles\").\n\nEven so, there were hardships, mostly involving Ted Raimi's costume. Ted, director Sam's younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a fake Shemp, but in \"Evil Dead II\" he gets the larger role of the historian's demonically-possessed wife, Henrietta. Raimi was forced to wear a full-body, latex costume, crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a \"cellar\", or on one day, both. Raimi became extremely overheated, to the point that his costume was literally filled with liters of sweat; special effects artist Gregory Nicotero describes pouring the fluid into several Dixie cups so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume's ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie's head.\n\nThe crew sneaked various in-jokes into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of Freddy Krueger (the primary antagonist of Wes Craven's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series of slasher films) which hangs in the cabin's basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by Heather Langenkamp), dozes off watching the original \"Evil Dead\" on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn \"The Hills Have Eyes\" poster seen in the original \"Evil Dead\" film, which was itself a reference to a torn \"Jaws\" poster in \"The Hills Have Eyes\".\n\nAt the film's wrap party, the crew held a talent contest, where Raimi and Campbell sang The Byrds' \"Eight Miles High\", with Nicotero on guitar.\n\n\"Evil Dead II\" opened on March 13, 1987 to a weekend gross of $807,260. At this time, it was only in 310 theatres, resulting in its smaller gross. However, after spending a little over a month in theatres, the film ultimately grossed $5,923,044 domestically.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports that 98% of 53 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 8/10. The site's consensus reads: \"\"Evil Dead 2\"s increased special effects and slapstick-gore makes it as good – if not better – than the original.\" On the similar website Metacritic, it holds a score of 69 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". \"Empire\" magazine praised the film, saying \"the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book\" and confirms that \"Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods\". Caryn James of \"The New York Times\" called it \"genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi's talent and developing skill.\" Leonard Maltin originally rated the film with two stars, but later increased the rating to three stars.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"a fairly sophisticated satire, that makes you want to get up and shuffle.\" He praised the film's sense of surrealism, comedic timing, and \"grubby, low-budget intensity.\" Ebert states that \"if you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at \"Evil Dead 2\".\" Richard Harrington of the \"Washington Post\" wrapped up his review stating that \"the acting is straight out of '50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?\" Conversely, Pat Graham of \"Chicago Reader\" disliked the mix of horror and comedy, writing in his review that \"The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi's aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort I'd say he's overshot the mark.\"\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the film #19 on their list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films\".\n\n\"Sight and Sound\" ranked it #34 on their 50 Funniest Films of All Time list. In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine included \"Evil Dead II\" on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\", ranked #49.\n\nJ.C. Maçek III of \"PopMatters\" wrote, \"Equal parts remake and sequel, the second film brought back Bruce Campbell as Ash and was every bit as gory and horrific as the first film with more tree rape and dismemberment and blood splatters than ever. On the other hand, \"Evil Dead II\" is also an absolutely hilarious and uproarious intentional comedy.\"\n\nIn 2016, James Charisma of \"Playboy\" ranked the film #12 on a list of \"15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals\".\n\nThe film was released on VHS by Anchor Bay Entertainment on February 17, 1998. In a similar fashion to the first \"Evil Dead\" film and \"Army of Darkness\", there have been numerous DVD releases of \"Evil Dead II\". The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay on August 29, 2000 in the form of a Limited Edition Tin, and was re-released by Anchor Bay on September 27, 2005, designed to look like the \"Necronomicon\". On October 2, 2007, the film was released on Blu-ray, and on November 15, 2011, it was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment in the form of a 25th Anniversary Edition. On September 13, 2016, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by Lionsgate.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in the UK in 2003 as part of a region 2 \"Evil Dead\" trilogy box set. In 2013, the trilogy saw another UK release on Blu-ray, released by StudioCanal. A 25th Anniversary Wood Edition was released in Germany by StudioCanal in 2007. The film was released on Blu-ray in Australia in 2014 alongside \"The Evil Dead\", \"Army of Darkness\", and the 2013 reboot, as part of an \"Evil Dead\" Anthology box set. The film has been released together with the first \"Evil Dead\" film by Green Nara Media in South Korea in region A.\n\nIt has also been announced that a 4k Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the film is in the works and set to release on December 11, 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Noah Wardrip-Fruin, a major benefit for establishing the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UCSC is its proximity to Silicon Valley, where many game companies are located. In 2011, UCSC was listed 7th on Princeton Review's list of top graduate game design programs.\n\nMost of the research done by the Expressive Intelligence Studio is done through major research projects, and focuses primarily on video game AI. PhD students in the program work closely with the advisors on these projects, which have a wide range of topics. Some of these topics include automated support for game generation, automatic generation of autonomous character conversations, story management, and authoring tools for interactive storytelling. This type of research in the field of game design is only being done in a small number of other institutions, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Southern California, and Georgia Institute of Technology. According to Mateas, however, the program at the University of California, Santa Cruz Expressive Intelligence Studio strikes a balance between technology and design.\n\nThe studio has released several playable games based on research ideas, including Prom Week, the only university-produced finalist in the 2012 Independent Games Festival.\n\nThe EISbot software (short for Expressive Intelligence Studio Bot) is an example for a human-level artificial intelligence which can play Starcraft. It was developed in 2010 for the Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE). The AIIDE Starcraft AI Competition is about a game playing agent, who has to win against a human player. EISbot was realized as an agent architecture, which contains submodules for reactive planning, machine learning and case-based reasoning. The reactive planner is the core of EISbot and was realized with A Behavior Language (ABL), which is an action language similar to STRIPS. The behaviors are planned with so called managers who are responsible for subgoals like production, income, tactics and scouting behavior.\n\n\n"}

Its greenhouse contains over 1,200 plant species including orchids, ferns, and cacti.\n\nThe gardens were originally established near the city's East park in 1933 as part of the celebration of the coronation of Emperor Hirohito. This small zoo and botanical garden included about 500 animals and 100 species of plants. The zoo was closed to the public on 20 May 1944 due to the deteriorating state of World War II for the country. Large animals were subsequently euthanized.

{"id": "2243617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2243617", "title": "Hot Coffee mod", "text": "Hot Coffee mod\n\nHot Coffee is a normally inaccessible mini-game in the 2004 video game \"\", developed by Rockstar North. Public awareness of the existence of the mini-game arrived with the release of the \"Hot Coffee\" mod, created for the Microsoft Windows port of \"GTA: San Andreas\" in 2005. This mod enables access to the mini-game.\n\nThe mini-game portrays animated sexual intercourse between the main character, Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, and his chosen in-game girlfriend. The name of the mod is derived from the girlfriend's offer for the main character to come into her home for \"coffee\", a euphemism for sex.\n\nAlthough the \"Hot Coffee\" mini-game was completely disabled and its existence was only highlighted after the mod's release for the PC version on June 9, 2005, the assets for the mini-game were also discovered in both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game, and people found ways to enable the mini-game via console video game hacking tools. By the middle of July 2005, the mini-game's discovery attracted considerable controversy from lawmakers and politicians, prompting the game to be re-assessed with an \"Adults Only (AO)\" rating by the U.S. Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), and refused classification in Australia, resulting in its removal from sale.\n\nAn updated version of \"San Andreas\" has since been released with the mini-game removed completely, allowing the game to regain its original rating. A patch for the original version of the game, Cold Coffee, was designed to counter edit the script and disable the mini-game and crash the game if one attempts to access it.\n\nThroughout the game, Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, the game's protagonist, may date up to six girlfriends, carrying out various \"date missions\" in order to improve his relationship with a particular woman. Once CJ has become particularly close to a girlfriend, or if he has collected all oysters in the game, his girlfriend may end a successful date by inviting him into her house for \"coffee,\" from which CJ may choose to accept or decline. Improving relationships with girlfriends through successful dates and other related activities will eventually reward CJ with new items, such as vehicles and special wardrobes, along with pre-existing gameplay benefits (e.g. dating a nurse grants CJ with free visits to the hospital without losing his weapons after dying).\n\nIn the unmodified version of \"\", players see an exterior view of the girlfriend's house while muffled voices of CJ and his girlfriend engaging in sexual intercourse are heard. However, the \"Hot Coffee\" mod replaces this with a minigame which allows the player to actually enter the girlfriend's bedroom and control Carl's actions during sex, with the same controls as dancing.\n\nRockstar Games, the publisher of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, initially denied allegations that the mini-game was \"hidden\" in the video game, stating that the \"Hot Coffee\" modification (which they claim violated the game's End User License Agreement) is the result of \"hackers\" making \"significant technical modifications to and reverse engineering\" the game's code. However, this claim was undermined when a user known as gothi from the website PS2 Save Tools released the \"GTA:SA Censor Remover\" tool for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions in June 2005, which allowed the minigame to be accessed on consoles. These new methods of accessing \"Hot Coffee\" demonstrated that the controversial content was, indeed, built into the console versions as well.\n\nThe PC mod itself is only an edited copy of the main game script file (\"main.scm\") with a single bit changed. The mod was also made possible on the console versions by changing the bit inside a user's saved game file or by using a third-party modding device. Take-Two has stated that the mod constitutes a violation of the End User License Agreement, even though modification of the main.scm file is common within the mod community.\n\nHowever, the oral sex animations are clearly visible in the background during one scene of the mission \"Cleaning the Hood\", even in the re-released game. This may explain why the minigame was not simply removed when the decision was made to cut it from the game; its assets were already in use elsewhere.\n\nThe revelation of the mini-game sparked a fair amount of controversy around \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", with some politicians firing harsh words at both the game's developer and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), the organization which establishes content ratings for video games in North America. It also rekindled the debate over the influence of video games in general with new protests against several other games such as \"Killer7\", \"The Sims 2\", and \"Bully\".\n\nJack Thompson was one of the first to criticize the game for its hidden content, believing violent media is one of the main causes of violent crime in America. Thompson lashed out against Rockstar Games on several occasions for previous games they have developed.\n\nU.S. Senator Hillary Clinton suggested that new regulations be put on video games sales. The ESRB conducted an investigation that ultimately changed the game's rating from Mature to Adults Only 18+. Also, Congress passed a resolution to have the Federal Trade Commission investigate whether Rockstar intentionally undermined the ESRB by having the content in the game.\n\nIn New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.\n\nA protest group known as the Peaceholics organized a protest on August 4, 2005 at Rockstar's headquarters. The group demonstrated against \"San Andreas\" as well as the game \"Bully\", the latter due to fears that the content could inspire children to become bullies themselves.\n\nOn July 8, 2005, the ESRB announced that it was aware of and opening an investigation into the circumstances surrounding 'Hot Coffee.' The investigation examined \"whether the mod unlocks preexisting code...or is actually a purely third-party creation.\"\n\nOn July 20, 2005, the ESRB announced that it was changing the rating of \"GTA:SA\" from \"Mature\" (M) to \"Adults Only\" (AO), making this the first and only \"Grand Theft Auto\" game to receive an AO Rating. Rockstar stated that it would discontinue manufacturing the current version of the game, and produce a new version that would not include the content that is unlocked by the Hot Coffee mod. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Rockstar released this \"clean\" version with the \"Hot Coffee\" scenes removed (\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" 1.01), allowing the rating of the game to be reverted to its original \"Mature\" rating.\n\nOn July 29, 2005, as a result of the newly discovered scenes, the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) revoked the game's \"MA15+\" classification (the highest rating then available for computer games in Australia) and changed the game's rating to \"Refused Classification\" (RC), which officially banned the original version from being sold in the country. The patched version was given an \"MA15+\" classification on September 12, 2005.\n\nOn August 10, 2005, Rockstar Games officially released a patch for \"San Andreas\". The patch fixed many performance issues and bugs. However, the patch also disabled the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" scenes, even if the \"Hot Coffee\" mod was re-installed.\n\nThere was little reaction in Europe. The game was already rated \"18+\" by PEGI prior to the release of the mod. Furthermore, PEGI ratings are enforced by law in many European nations, making it a criminal offense to sell 18+ games to minors. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC similarly gave the game an \"18\" rating (as of 2012, the BBFC no longer classifies video games, and PEGI was adopted instead).\n\nThe day after the rating change, several North American chain stores, and IEMA retailers, which accounted for every major retailer in the United States and approximately 85% of the game's market in the country, removed the PC and console versions of the game from their store shelves, re-stickered the box with the new rating, or returning it to Take-Two Interactive. These included major chains such as GameStop, Sears, Hudson's Bay Company, Zellers, Hollywood Video, Blockbuster, Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, and Electronics Boutique. Rockstar gave some retailers ESRB \"Adults Only\" rating stickers to put on their copies of \"GTA:SA\", should they decide to keep selling the original product.\n\neBay removed copies of \"GTA:SA\" that had been reported by the eBay community. eBay claimed that \"GTA:SA\" violated the terms of the eBay seller policy and could not be sold unless it was located in the \"Everything Else > Mature Audiences\" section. This section requires a credit card to validate the age of the eBay user. \n\nOn August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public. Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.\n\nVersion 2.0 of \"GTA:SA\", which omitted the sexual mini-game content, was designed by Rockstar to crash if the game data files were modified. This made it necessary for players to use a previous version if they wished to install multiplayer game modifications such as \"San Andreas Multiplayer\" or \"Multi Theft Auto\" and other game modifications that include new scripts or vehicles. Certain pirated or illegally distributed versions of the original game may also be made available on the Internet or from illegal retail outlets. Downgraders are also available to unpatch and revert the game version and support the Hot Coffee mini-game again.\n\nThis limitation later was overcome by two members of the unofficial \"Grand Theft Auto\" modding community, who discovered a method of creating modifications which would work with version 2.0. Users of version 2.0 might still need to use previous versions or use a downgrade in order to install a mod not created with the new method.\n\nIn December 2005, Senators Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, which called for a federal mandate enforcement of the ESRB ratings system in order to protect children from inappropriate content.\n\nOn January 27, 2006, the city of Los Angeles filed a lawsuit against Take-Two Interactive, the game's publisher, accusing the company of failing to disclose the game's sexual content.\n\nOn June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.\n\nIn 2006 attorneys brought several class actions alleging Take-Two committed consumer fraud. In December 2007, a settlement of the litigation was reached. In 2008, Ted Frank filed an objection to the settlement on the grounds that the settlement sought $1 million for attorneys' fees, but the total payout to class members was less than $27,000. A court hearing was already scheduled on June 25, 2008. Frank previously told GamePolitics that the lawsuits were meritless and extortionate.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Take-Two will pay a $873,000 cy-près award to the National Parent-Teacher Association and the ESRB.\n\nAs of June 25, 2008, fewer than 2,700 claimants responded to the settlement, for which the plaintiff's attorneys expressed disappointment. Frank expressed that this was further proof that the case had no merit.\n\nAs of September 1, 2009, Take Two agreed to settle a securities class action suit related to the controversy over the game and over backdating allegations for just over $20 million.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "68485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68485", "title": "Jurassic Park (film)", "text": "Jurassic Park (film)\n\nJurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen. The first installment in the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise, it is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton and a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica, where billionaire philanthropist John Hammond and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. When industrial sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities and security precautions, a small group of visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, struggle to survive and escape the perilous island.\n\nBefore Crichton's novel was published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. With the backing of Universal Studios, Spielberg acquired the rights for $1.5 million before its publication in 1990; Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii between August and November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed \"Schindler's List\".\n\nThe dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. Following an extensive $65 million marketing campaign, which included licensing deals with 100 companies, \"Jurassic Park\" premiered on June 9, 1993 at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C., and was released on June 11 in the United States. It went on to gross over $914 million worldwide in its original theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1993 and the highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record held until the release of \"Titanic\" (1997). It was well received by critics, who praised its special effects, John Williams' musical score, and Spielberg's direction. Following its 3D re-release in 2013 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, \"Jurassic Park\" became the seventeenth film in history to surpass $1 billion in ticket sales.\n\nThe film won more than twenty awards, including three Academy Awards for its technical achievements in visual effects and sound design. \"Jurassic Park\" is considered a landmark in the development of computer-generated imagery and animatronic visual effects, and was followed by four commercially successful sequels, \"\" (1997), \"Jurassic Park III\" (2001), \"Jurassic World\" (2015) and \"\" (2018), with a fifth and final sequel, currently titled \"Jurassic World 3\", scheduled for a 2021 release.\n\nIndustrialist John Hammond and his bioengineering company, InGen, have created a theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on Isla Nublar, a Costa Rican island. After one of the dinosaur handlers is killed by a \"Velociraptor\", the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the certification inspections, Gennaro invites mathematician and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live \"Brachiosaurus\".\n\nAt the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA from frogs was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' genome. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying that it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby \"Velociraptor\" and visits the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering in general.\n\nThe group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick \"Triceratops\". It is cut short as a tropical storm approaches Isla Nublar. Most of the park employees leave for the mainland on a boat while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles, except Sattler, who stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the \"Triceratops\".\n\nJurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as a shaving cream bottle. The power goes out, and the tour vehicles become stuck because of it. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the park's \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" to escape and attack the group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the \"Tyrannosaurus\" injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a \"Dilophosaurus\".\n\nSattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors, but they only find Malcolm, just before the \"Tyrannosaurus\" returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.\n\nUnable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the \"Velociraptors\". Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.\n\nAfter encountering a \"Brachiosaurus\" and narrowly escaping the \"Tyrannosaurus\" during a \"Gallimimus\" stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim (who was injured while scaling one of the fences) and Lex inside. Tim and Lex are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen, but the children escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the \"Tyrannosaurus\" suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and all of the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.\n\nMichael Crichton originally conceived a screenplay about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel \"Jurassic Park\". Even before publication, Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989, while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series \"ER\". Spielberg determined that what really fascinated him was that \"Jurassic Park\" was \"a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind\", going beyond a simple monster movie.\n\nBefore the book was published, Crichton demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. Warner Bros. and Tim Burton, Columbia Pictures and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante bid for the rights, but Universal Studios eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg. After completing \"Hook\", Spielberg wanted to film \"Schindler's List\". Music Corporation of America (then Universal Pictures's parent company) president Sid Sheinberg gave a green light to the film on the condition that Spielberg made \"Jurassic Park\" first. The director later declared that by choosing a creature-driven thriller, \"I was really just trying to make a good sequel to \"Jaws\", on land.\"\n\nTo create the dinosaurs, Spielberg at first thought of hiring Bob Gurr, who designed a giant mechanical King Kong for Universal Studios Hollywood's King Kong Encounter. Upon considering that the life-sized dinosaurs would be too expensive and not all convincing, Spielberg instead sought the best effects supervisors in Hollywood. Brought in were Stan Winston to create the animatronic dinosaurs, Phil Tippett to create go motion dinosaurs for long shots credited as Dinosaur Supervisor, Michael Lantieri to supervise the on-set effects, and Dennis Muren of Industrial Light & Magic to do the digital compositing. Paleontologist Jack Horner supervised the designs, to help fulfill Spielberg's desire to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. This led to the entry of certain concepts about dinosaurs, such as the theory that dinosaurs evolved into birds and had very little in common with lizards. One of the first consequences was the removal of the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early animatics, as Horner complained it was implausible. Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding latex skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion animatics of both the raptors in the kitchen and the \"Tyrannosaurus\" attacking the car. But despite go motion's attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a live-action feature film. Muren declared to Spielberg that he thought the dinosaurs could be built through computer-generated imagery, and the director asked him to prove it. ILM animators Mark Dippé and Steve Williams developed a computer-generated walk cycle for the \"T. rex\" skeleton, and were approved to do more. When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the \"T. rex\" chasing a herd of \"Gallimimus\", Spielberg said, \"You're out of a job,\" to which Tippett replied, \"Don't you mean extinct?\" Spielberg later injected this exchange into the script, as a conversation between Malcolm and Grant. Although no go motion was used, Tippett and his animators were still used by the production to supervise dinosaur movement. Tippett acted as a consultant regarding dinosaur anatomy, and his stop motion animators were re-trained as computer animators. The animatics made by Tippett's team were also used along with the storyboards as a reference for what would be shot during the action sequences. ILM's artists were sent to private tours to the local animal park so they could study large animals — rhinos, elephants, alligators, and giraffes — up close, and also received mime classes for understanding movements.\n\nUniversal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel, which he had finished by the time Spielberg was filming \"Hook\". Crichton noted that because the book was \"fairly long\" his script only had about 10 to 20 percent of the novel's content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons, and despite the gory descriptions, the violence was toned down. Malia Scotch Marmo began a script rewrite in October 1991 over a five-month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant.\n\nAs Spielberg wanted another writer to rework the script, Universal president Casey Silver recommended him David Koepp, co-writer of \"Death Becomes Her\". Koepp started afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel. While Koepp tried to avoid excessive character detail \"because whenever they started talking about their personal lives, you couldn't care less\", he tried to flesh out the characters and make for a more colorful cast, with moments such as Malcolm flirting with Sattler leading to Grant's jealousy. Some characterizations were changed from the novel. Hammond went from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, because Spielberg identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship. He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged eleven and interested in computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and interested in sports. Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with the younger Joseph Mazzello, and it also allowed him to introduce the sub-plot of Lex's adolescent crush on Grant. Koepp changed Grant's relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more character development.\n\nTwo scenes from the book were ultimately excised, with Spielberg removing the opening sequence with \"Procompsognathus\" attacking a young child as he previously found it too horrific, and Koepp cutting for budgetary reasons the \"T. rex\" chasing Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon. Both parts eventually saw inclusion in the film sequels. Spielberg suggested the addition of the scene where the \"T. rex\" pursues a jeep, which at first would only have the characters driving away after listening to the dinosaur's footsteps.\n\nWilliam Hurt was initially offered the role of Alan Grant, but turned it down without reading the script. Harrison Ford was also offered the role of Grant. Sam Neill was ultimately cast as Grant three or four weeks before filming began. Neill said that \"it all happened real quick. I hadn't read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn't heard anything about it, and in a matter of weeks I'm working with Spielberg.\" Janet Hirshenson, the film's casting director, felt that Jeff Goldblum would be the right choice to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel. Jim Carrey also auditioned for the role. According to Hirshenson, Carrey \"was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all loved the idea of Jeff.\"\n\nCameron Thor had previously worked with Spielberg on \"Hook\", and initially auditioned for the role of Malcolm, before trying out for the role of Dodgson. Thor said about casting, \"It just said 'shaving-cream can' in the script, so I spent endless time in a drug store to find the most photogenic. I went with Barbasol, which ended up in the movie. I was so broke that I took the can home after the audition to use it.\" Laura Dern was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Ellie Sattler though she was not the only actress offered the part. Robin Wright turned down the role. Spielberg chose to cast Wayne Knight after seeing his acting performance in \"Basic Instinct\", saying, \"I waited for the credits to roll and wrote his name down\".\n\nAriana Richards said, \"I was called into a casting office, and they just wanted me to scream. I heard later on that Steven had watched a few girls on tape that day, and I was the only one who ended up waking his sleeping wife off the couch, and she came running through the hallway to see if the kids were all right.\" Christina Ricci was one such girl who auditioned for the role. Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in \"Hook\", but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film.\n\nAfter 25 months of pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. While Costa Rica was considered as a location given it is the story's setting, Spielberg's concerns on infrastructure and accessibility made him choose a place where he had already worked before. The three-week shoot involved various daytime exteriors for Isla Nublar's forests. On September 11, Hurricane Iniki passed directly over Kauai, which caused the crew to lose a day of shooting. Several of the storm scenes from the movie are actual footage shot during the hurricane. The scheduled shoot of the \"Gallimimus\" chase was moved to Kualoa Ranch on the island of Oahu and one of the beginning scenes had to be created by digitally animating a still shot of scenery. The opening scene was shot in Haiku, on the island of Maui, with additional scenes being filmed on the \"forbidden island\" of Niihau. The exterior of the Visitor Center was a large façade constructed on the grounds of the Valley House Plantation Estate in Kauai. Samuel L. Jackson was to film a lengthy death scene in which his character would be chased and killed by raptors, but the set was destroyed by Hurricane Iniki.\n\nBy mid-September, the crew moved back to California, to shoot the raptors in the kitchen at Stage 24 of the Universal studio lot. Given the kitchen set was filled with reflective surfaces, cinematographer Dean Cundey had to carefully plan the illumination while also using black cloths to hide the light reflections. The crew also shot on Stage 23 for the scenes involving the power supply, before going on location to Red Rock Canyon for the Montana dig scenes. The crew returned to Universal to shoot Grant's rescue of Tim, using a fifty-foot prop with hydraulic wheels for the car fall, and the \"Brachiosaurus\" encounter. The crew filmed scenes for the Park's labs and control room, which used animations for the computers lent from Silicon Graphics and Apple. While Crichton's book features Toyota cars in Jurassic Park, Spielberg got a deal with the Ford Motor Company, who provided seven Ford Explorers. The Explorers were modified by ILM's crew and veteran customizer George Barris to create the illusion that they were autonomous cars by hiding the driver in the car's trunk. Barris also customized the Jeep Wranglers featured in the production.\n\nOver 15% of the film was shot in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic both at and Amber Museum and Mount Isabela de Torres. The crew moved to Warner Bros. Studios' Stage 16 to shoot the \"T. rex\" attack on the LSX powered SUVs. Shooting proved frustrating because of water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur, which caused the animatronic \"T. rex\" to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water. This forced Stan Winston's crew to dry the model with shammys between takes. On the set, Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum's suggestion, as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script, where like Gennaro, Malcolm would get scared and run away. The ripples in the glass of water caused by the \"T. rex\"s footsteps were inspired by Spielberg listening to Earth, Wind and Fire in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put a glass of water on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor plucked the strings to achieve the effect. Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the \"Dilophosaurus\" on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center. Spielberg changed the climax to bring back the \"T. rex\", abandoning the original ending in which Grant uses a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws. The scene which already had the juxtaposition of live dinosaurs in a museum filled with fossils, while also destroying the bones, now also had an ending where the \"T. rex\" saved the protagonists, and afterwards did what Spielberg described as a \"King Kong roar\" while an ironic banner reading \"When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\" flew. The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30, and within days, editor Michael Kahn had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming \"Schindler's List\".\n\nDespite the title of the film's referencing the Jurassic period, \"Brachiosaurus\" and \"Dilophosaurus\" are the only dinosaurs featured that actually lived during that time; the other species featured did not exist until the Cretaceous period. This is acknowledged in the film during a scene where Dr. Grant describes the ferocity of the \"Velociraptor\" to a young boy, saying: \"Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period...\"\n\nSpecial effects work continued on the film, with Tippett's unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices: models which fed information into the computers to allow themselves to animate the characters like stop motion puppets. In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and \"Gallimimus\". As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards' stunt double. Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour. Rendering the dinosaurs often took two to four hours per frame, and rendering the \"T. rex\" in the rain even took six hours per frame. Spielberg monitored their progress from Poland during the filming of \"Schindler's List\", having teleconferences four times a week with ILM's crew. The director described working simultaneously in two vastly different productions as \"a bipolar experience\", where he used \"every ounce of intuition on \"Schindler's List\" and every ounce of craft in \"Jurassic Park\"\".\n\nAlong with the digital effects, Spielberg wanted the film to be the first with digital sound. He funded the creation of DTS, which would allow audiences to \"really hear the movie the way it was intended to be heard\". The sound effects crew, supervised by George Lucas, were finished by the end of April. Sound designer Gary Rydstrom considered it a fun process, given the film had all kinds of noise – animal sounds, rain, gunshots, car crashes – and at times no music. During the process, Spielberg would take the weekends to fly from Poland to Paris, where he would meet Rydstrom to see the sound progress. \"Jurassic Park\" was finally completed on May 28, 1993.\n\nComposer John Williams began scoring the film at the end of February, and it was recorded a month later. John Neufeld and Alexander Courage provided the score's orchestrations. Similar to another Spielberg film he scored, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", Williams felt he needed to write \"pieces that would convey a sense of 'awe' and fascination\" given it dealt with the \"overwhelming happiness and excitement\" that would emerge from seeing live dinosaurs. In turn more suspenseful scenes such as the \"Tyrannosaurus\" attack earned frightening themes. The first soundtrack album was released on May 25, 1993. For the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, a new soundtrack was issued for digital download on April 9, 2013, including four bonus tracks personally selected by Williams.\n\nUniversal took the lengthy pre-production to carefully plan the \"Jurassic Park\" marketing campaign, which cost $65 million and had deals with 100 companies to market 1,000 products. These included three \"Jurassic Park\" video games by Sega and Ocean Software, a toy line by Kenner that was distributed by Hasbro, McDonald's \"Dino-Sized meals\", and a novelization aimed at young children.\n\nThe film's trailers only gave fleeting glimpses of the dinosaurs, a tactic journalist Josh Horowitz described as \"that old Spielberg axiom of never revealing too much\" when Spielberg and director Michael Bay did the same for their production of \"Transformers\" in 2007. The film was marketed with the tagline \"An Adventure 65 Million Years In The Making.\" This was a joke Spielberg made on set about the genuine, thousands of years old mosquito in amber used for Hammond's walking stick.\n\nThe film premiered at the Uptown Theater on June 9, 1993, in Washington, D.C., in support of two children's charities. Two days later it opened nationwide, in 2,404 theater locations and an estimated 3,400 screens. Internationally it was equally wide at 3,400 prints. Following the film's release, a traveling exhibition called \"The Dinosaurs of Jurassic Park\" began, showcasing dinosaur skeletons and film props.\n\n\"Jurassic Park\" was broadcast on television for the first time on May 7, 1995, following the April 26 airing of \"The Making of Jurassic Park\". Some 68.12 million people tuned in to watch, garnering NBC a 36 percent share of all available viewers that night. \"Jurassic Park\" was the highest-rated theatrical film broadcast on television by any network since the April 1987 airing of \"Trading Places\". In June–July 1995 the film was aired a number of times on the TNT network.\n\nIn anticipation of the Blu-ray release, \"Jurassic Park\" had a digital print released in UK cinemas on September 23, 2011. It wound up grossing £245,422 ($786,021) from 276 theaters, finishing at eleventh on the weekend box office.\n\nTwo years later, on the 20th anniversary of \"Jurassic Park,\" a 3D version of the film was released in cinemas. Spielberg declared that he had produced the film with a sort of \"subconscious 3D\", as scenes feature animals walking toward the cameras and some effects of foreground and background overlay. In 2011, he stated in an interview that \"Jurassic Park\" was the only of his works he had considered for a conversion, and once he saw the 3D version of \"Titanic\" in 2012, he liked the new look of the film so much that he hired the same retrofitting company, Stereo D. Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński supervised the nine-month process closely in-between the production of \"Lincoln\". Stereo D executive Aaron Parry declared that the conversion was an evolution of what the company had done with \"Titanic\", \"being able to capitalize on everything we learned with Jim on \"Titanic\" and take it into a different genre and movie, and one with so many technical achievements.\" The studio had the help of ILM, which contributed some elements and updated effects shots for a better visual enhancement. It opened in the United States and seven other territories on April 5, 2013, with other countries receiving the re-release in the following six months.\n\nThe film made its VHS and LaserDisc debut on October 4, 1994. With 17 million units sold in both formats, \"Jurassic Park\" is the fifth best-selling VHS tape ever.\n\n\"Jurassic Park\" was first released on Collector's Edition DVD on October 10, 2000, in both a widescreen and fullscreen, and in a box set along with sequel \"\" and both movies' soundtrack albums. It ended as the 13th best-selling DVD of 2000 counting both versions, finishing the year with 910,000 units sold. Following the release of \"Jurassic Park III\", a new box set with all films called \"Jurassic Park Trilogy\" was released on December 11, 2001; it was re-released on VHS and DVD as part of its 15th anniversary on October 8, 2004. It was repackaged as \"Jurassic Park Adventure Pack\" on November 29, 2005.\n\nThe trilogy was released on Blu-ray on October 25, 2011, debuting at fifth on the Blu-ray charts, and being nominated as the best release of the year by both the Las Vegas Film Critics Society and the Saturn Awards. In 2012, \"Jurassic Park\" was among twenty-five films chosen by Universal for a box set that celebrated the studio's 100th anniversary, while also receiving a standalone 100th anniversary Blu-ray featuring an augmented reality cover. The following year, the 20th anniversary 3D conversion was issued on Blu-ray 3D.\n\nOn June 1, 2016, \"Jurassic Park\", along with its sequels \"The Lost World\" and \"Jurassic Park III\", were added to the Netflix streaming service.\n\nThe film, alongside \"The Lost World\", \"Jurassic Park III\" and \"Jurassic World\", was released as a box set for 4K UHD Blu-Ray on May 22, 2018, as part of the original film's 25th anniversary.\n\n\"Jurassic Park\" became the highest-grossing film released worldwide up to that time. Following $3.1 million from midnight screenings on June 10, the film earned $47 million in its first weekend, with the $50.1 million total breaking the opening weekend record set by \"Batman Returns\" the year before. By the end of its first week, \"Jurassic Park\" had grossed $81.7 million, and stayed at number one for three weeks. It eventually grossed $357 million in the U.S. and Canada. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 86.2 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. The film also did very well in international markets, breaking opening records in the United Kingdom, Japan, India, South Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan, ultimately earning $914 million worldwide, with Spielberg reportedly making over $250 million from the film. It surpassed Spielberg's own \"E.T. the Extraterrestrial\" as the highest-grossing film ever worldwide, and became second to \"E.T.\" in North America earnings. \"Jurassic Park\"s record was only surpassed in 1998 by \"Titanic\", the first film to gross over $1 billion.\n\nThe 3D re-release of \"Jurassic Park\" opened at fourth place in North America, with $18.6 million from 2,771 locations. IMAX showings accounted for over $6 million, with the 32 percent being the highest IMAX share ever for a nationwide release. The international release had its most successful weekend in the last week of August, when it managed to climb to the top of the overseas box office with a $28.8 million debut in China. The reissue earned $45,385,935 in North America and $44,500,000 internationally , leading to a lifetime gross of $402,453,882 in North America and $628,723,171 overseas, totaling up to a worldwide gross of $1,029,939,903, making \"Jurassic Park\" the 17th film to surpass the $1 billion mark. It was the only Universal Pictures film to surpass the $1 billion mark until 2015, when the studio got three such films, \"Furious 7\", \"Minions\", and the fourth installment of the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise, \"Jurassic World\". It currently ranks as the 29th highest-grossing film of all time in North America (unadjusted for inflation), the highest-grossing film of 1993 and the twenty-eighth highest-grossing film of all time.\n\nHigh praise was given to the film's visual effects, musical score, and Spielberg's direction, although there was some criticism leveled at the script and departures from the book. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 91%, based on 122 reviews, with a rating average score of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Jurassic Park\" is a spectacle of special effects and life-like animatronics, with some of Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since \"Jaws\".\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents...[but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away.\" In \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers described the film as \"colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen.\" Roger Ebert noted, \"The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values.\" Henry Sheehan argued, \"The complaints over \"Jurassic Park\"'s lack of story and character sound a little off the point,\" pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. \"Empire\" magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as \"quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time.\"\n\nIn March 1994, \"Jurassic Park\" won all three Academy Awards for which it was nominated: Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects (at the same ceremony, Spielberg, editor Michael Kahn, and composer John Williams won Academy Awards for \"Schindler's List\"). The film won honors outside the U.S. including the 1994 BAFTA for Best Special Effects, as well as the Award for the Public's Favorite Film. It won the 1994 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and the 1993 Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, Best Writing for Crichton and Koepp and Best Special Effects. The film won the 1993 People's Choice Awards for Favorite All-Around Motion Picture. Young Artist Awards were given to Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, with the film winning an Outstanding Action/Adventure Family Motion Picture award. In 2001, the American Film Institute ranked \"Jurassic Park\" as the 35th most thrilling film of American cinema. The film has been included in the book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", film lists by \"Empire\" magazine, and \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn the years following its release, \"Jurassic Park\" has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals as one of the greatest movies of the action and thriller genres. The American Film Institute named \"Jurassic Park\" the 35th-most thrilling film of all time on June 13, 2001. The Chicago Film Critics Association also ranked \"Jurassic Park\" as the 55th-scariest movie of all time, and in 2005, Bravo chose the scene in which Lex and Tim are stalked by two raptors in the kitchen as the 95th-scariest movie moment ever. On \"Empire\" magazine's 15th anniversary in 2004, it judged \"Jurassic Park\" the sixth-most influential film in the magazine's lifetime. \"Empire\" called the first encounter with a \"Brachiosaurus\" the 28th-most magical moment in cinema. In 2008, an \"Empire\" poll of readers, filmmakers, and critics also rated it one of the 500 greatest films of all time. On \"Film Review\"s 55th anniversary in 2005, it declared the film to be one of the five most important in the magazine's lifetime. In 2006, IGN ranked \"Jurassic Park\" as the 19th-greatest film franchise ever. In a 2010 poll, the readers of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated it the greatest summer movie of the previous 20 years. The popularity of the movie caused the management of the National Basketball Association expansion franchise founded in Toronto in 1995 to adopt the nickname Raptors. The film is seen as giving rise to the \"Jurassic park\" generation, to young people inspired to become paleontologists and to a surge in discoveries about dinosaurs in real life.\n\n\"Jurassic Park's\" biggest impact on subsequent films was a result of its computer-generated visual effects. Film historian Tom Shone commented on the film's innovation and influence, saying that \"In its way, \"Jurassic Park\" heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927.\" Many filmmakers saw \"Jurassic Park\"s effects as a realization that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible. ILM owner George Lucas, realizing the success of creating realistic live dinosaurs by his own company, started to make the \"Star Wars\" prequels; Stanley Kubrick decided to invest in pet project \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", to which he would later bring Spielberg to direct; and Peter Jackson began to re-explore his childhood love of fantasy films, a path that led him to \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"King Kong\". \"Jurassic Park\" has also inspired films and documentaries with dinosaurs such as the American adaptation of \"Godzilla\", \"Dinosaur from the Deep\", \"Carnosaur\" (in which Laura Dern's mother Diane Ladd starred), \"Dinosaur Island\" and \"Walking with Dinosaurs\". Stan Winston, enthusiastic about the new technology pioneered by the film, joined with IBM and director James Cameron to form a new special effects company, Digital Domain.\n\nAfter the enormous success of the film, Spielberg asked Crichton to write a sequel novel, leading to the 1995 book \"The Lost World\". This, in turn, was adapted as the film \"\". Released on May 23, 1997, it was directed by Spielberg and written by David Koepp. Another film, \"Jurassic Park III\", was released on July 18, 2001, under the direction of Joe Johnston, with Spielberg as executive producer, featuring an original script that incorporated ultimate unused elements from Crichton's original \"Jurassic Park\". A fourth installment, \"Jurassic World\", was released in theaters on June 12, 2015. Spielberg again produced, with Colin Trevorrow directing a script written by himself and Derek Connolly. \"\" is the next film in the franchise, and was released in June 2018.\n\nThe story of the film was also continued in auxiliary media, at times even unattached to the film sequels themselves. These included a series of \"Jurassic Park\" comic books written by Steve Englehart for Topps Comics, and video games such as Ocean Software's \"\" (1994), Vivendi's \"\" (2003) and Telltale Games' \"\" (2011).\n\nAll of the Universal Parks & Resorts include a \"Jurassic Park\"-themed ride. The first was at Universal Studios Hollywood on June 15, 1996, built after six years of development at a cost of $110 million. Said attraction was replicated on Universal Studios Japan in 2001. Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, has an entire section of the park dedicated to \"Jurassic Park\" that includes the main ride, christened \"Jurassic Park River Adventure\", and many smaller rides and attractions based on the series. In Universal Studios Singapore, opened in 2010, the Themed Zone named The Lost World consists mostly of \"Jurassic Park\" rides, such as the roller coaster Canopy Flyer and the river rapids Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12150642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12150642", "title": "Lledo", "text": "Lledo\n\nLledo was a brand of die cast toys, founded in 1982 by Matchbox co-founder Jack Odell and Burt Russell (Co-founder 2007). The factory produced diecast vehicles in Enfield, England from 1983 to 1999. Models were later made in China. Lledo was a reversal of Odell's own surname, a mnemonic device from war days in the African desert so as not to forget his wireless call sign (About Lledo 2005-2011; Force 1988).\n\nLledo set out to specialize in replicating early Matchbox series styles, particularly the Models of Yesteryear range. Odell and Russell bought machinery from the Universal company, which had purchased the Matchbox plant and shipped it to Macau. The tooling they purchased was re-shipped back to Enfield, England where in April 1983 the new Days Gone range was launched. The name is a nice continuation of Matchbox's nostalgic \"Yesteryear\" theme.\n\nThe first Lledo models appeared on the market in early 1983. These were a horse-drawn tram, a horse-drawn milk float, a horse-drawn delivery van, a stagecoach-like omnibus, and a horse-drawn fire engine (Force 1988, pp. 9–12, 128). One of the more popular models was the Ford Model T van introduced later in the year.\n\nThe promotional market became Lledo's bread and butter, and the aim was to provide variations to be offered for different businesses. Of the hundreds of Lledo variations appearing in the first six years of production, all were based on only thirty basic castings (Johnson 1998, 115).\n\nThe Model T, especially, became the basis for a series of limited edition models for gifts and promotions. Different from the original Matchbox Models of Yesteryear line, there were only a selection of basic castings which were commonly produced in limited edition promotion runs of 500 or 1000 models. For example, the basic Model T delivery van was produced in more than 170 different liveries (Force 1988, pp. 13–21). Meanwhile, the horse-drawn vehicles were produced less and less, the last one appearing in 1984 (Force 1988, pp. 128–129). The London Double Decker bus was a popular promotional; it appeared in many forms like \"Vimto-Keeps you Fit\", \"Madame Tassaud's Wax Museum\", or the \"Boys Brigade\" model whose intent was to raise funds to provide safe drinking water for third world countries (Rixon 2005, p. 57). Another promotional example was the VW Transporter van which appeared in Pepsi, 7 Up and Bosch spark plugs liveries, amongst many others (Johnson 1998, p. 116). \n\nTo distinguish promos from traditional \"Days Gone\" series models, model baseplates were differentiated. Either \"Days Gone\" or \"Lledo Promotional Model\" began to appear on the chassis, according to need.(Force 1988, p. 129). Most models were produced by Lledo, but several 'Code Two' models were manufactured and sold to second parties for label and logo application previously agreed to by Lledo (Force 1988, p. 129).\n\nSome Lledos were sold in the U.S. under the Hartoys name, headquartered in Florida, and mainly selling a series of trucks to be sold in supermarkets and drug stores. One of these Hartoys lines was called the \"Fantastic Set o' Wheels\". Perhaps because of the diecast expense, these did not last long and did not become popular, despite fine craftsmanship and notable brand liveries. By the early 1990s, Hartoys was using Chinese diecasters to continue to make quality models, now called the \"American Highway Legends\" (AHL). One example was the 1939 International A&P truck. Other Lledos were marketed in the Netherlands under the Edocar name.\n\nIn 1993, Lledo partnered with Kellogg's cereals in the U.K. to produce a set of four land speed record cars (Haas 2011). Called \"Land Speed Legends\", the vehicles included the 1935 Sir Malcolm Campbell-Railton Blue Bird (the first car to break 300 miles per hour); the Railton Mobil Special driven by John Cobb; Craig Breedlove's second Spirit of America, and Richard Noble's Thrust 2 which held the Land Speed Record from 1983 to 1997.\n\nThese models were a big departure from the multiple-livery classic vehicle fare that Lledo normally made - they were entirely new castings and were not subsequently reproduced in any other promotional form (Rixon 2005, p. 57). The models were in varied scales from 1:80 to 1:100 (the real cars were very large). The promotion packed all four models together and included a foldout poster of specifications and land speed record events (Haas 2011). Though Lledo also made a fifth land speed record car replica of the record-breaking Thrust SSC piloted by Andy Green, the company did not often return to such deviations from its 'liveried classics' format.\n\nLledo launched the Vanguards range in 1996, which specialized in replica classic British cars, and later, other European vehicles. The first model was the fourth update of the Ford Anglia (1959-1968) (Anglia Models 2002-2012). With Hillmans, Jowetts, Wolseleys, Rovers, Triumphs, Vauxhalls, Austins, Morrises and Jaguars, many traditional British marques were represented and the line grew to more than 40 different vehicles.\n\nThe Vanguard line, often called the \"Fifties and Sixties Classic Collection\" was notable for keen attention to detail. For example, the handsome Sunbeam Alpine Mark II featured accurate decals for logos and scripts on the body of the car, chrome petrol cap, door handles, and trunk hinges. Body colored rims with whitewall tires added to the sophistication of the finished model. Rear view mirror and accurate windshield wipers were also offered. Like many Lledo models, the Alpine came with rear view mirrors separate that could then be affixed to the car. To put the car back in the box one had to remove the mirrors - so a word of advice - don't glue them on the car (Rixon 2005, p. 81).\n\nBritish trucks were also produced in this line including Ford Transit vans and Ford Thames Trader truck, Commer dropside, Morris commercial van, Dennis F8 fire engine, Bedford S Type trucks, Land Rover LWB and Defender and Karrier boxback, among others. Later, the Volkswagen Transporter van was included in many different liveries - for example in bright yellow with the Bosch Auto Electrical logo. Vanguards were a departure from earlier Lledos, as they were produced in a consistent 1:43 scale.\n\nAlthough shipping high volumes of product, the company could not compete against low cost producers from Hong Kong and China who also entered the special promotions market with high quality products. As a result, Lledo went bankrupt in 1999, and the naming rights and model range were bought by Corgi which continued producing Lledo models in China until 2005, when the remaining models were merged into the Corgi Classics range.\n\nJack Odell died on 8 July 2007 at the age of 87 (Co-founder 2007). His venerable Lledo range was among the last (if not \"the\" last) mass production diecast manufacturer to make its products in the British Isles (or the last within Europe for that matter).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13148453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13148453", "title": "MTV Generation", "text": "MTV Generation\n\nThe MTV Generation refers to the adolescents and young adults of the 1980s and early 1990s, a time when many were influenced by MTV television channel, which launched in 1981. The term is often used synonymously with Generation X.\n\nThe origin of the phrase has been attributed to the MTV Network itself \"to describe the teenagers that dominate their ratings\".\n\nThe phrase came into general use more than two years after the cable network's 1981 debut. One observer notes that \"By 1984, MTV was reaching 1.2 percent of the daily television audience, and more than a quarter of daily teen viewers. Children of the eighties would henceforth be known as 'the MTV Generation.'\" As early as its October 13, 1984 issue, \"Billboard\" Magazine was using the term in reference to musical preferences. The phrase was later expanded to include the purchasing choices of a generation of consumers, with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency describing the demographic in a 1985 presentation entitled \"The New American Consumers\", with one business columnist noting that \"We baby boomers are raising what J. Walter calls the MTV Generation and these 12 to 19 year olds are unbelievably affluent...\" Bret Easton Ellis was called the \"voice of the MTV generation\" as early as 1985, after the publication of his first novel, \"Less Than Zero\".\n\nMTV broadcast a documentary titled \"MTV Generation\" in 1991. Reviewing it, the \"New York Times\" described the group as \"young adults struggling to establish a cultural niche for themselves, something that will distinguish them from the hippies and baby boomers and yuppies of times past.\" The documentary depicts the MTV Generation as characterised by cynicism, uncertainty, and an ability to process information quickly, and focusing on diversions and retro interests.\n\n\"Much has been written about the so-called \"baby buster\" generation—the fairly anonymous group of 20ish young adults struggling to separate themselves from the shadow of the baby boomers ... The group's newest moniker, \"the MTV generation,\" might be the most accurate description yet. For while much has been made about the generation's lack of a single unifying theme or experience, its members seem to have one thing in common: music videos.\"\n\nIn 1991, author Douglas Coupland said of the label: \"MTV would like to have us believe that everyone in their 20s is the MTV Generation. That's like going through life with a big product placement tattooed on your head, as if they're the only cultural influence on the entire planet.\" Coupland also said MTV had a mostly positive and profound impact on his generation. In 1991 he stated, \"I was in Europe last summer and MTV is everywhere. It's in the bars, in the homes, in the coffee shops. I didn't realize how completely global it was and what it has done to homogenize youth culture.\"\n\nIn 2005, MTV began honoring prominent actors of the generation with the MTV Generation Award.

Skill of riding horse was the absolute prerequirement to participate in Ma’jonga or hunting deer event which was organized by king. To the common people, Ma’jonga was the moment where they could show their hunting skill and could raise their lower status to higher status as well. \nMa’jonga competition was usually arranged by a king for his family pleasure. It was arranged in the yard inside the jungle. Deer from jungle were driven into the yard for being hunted by hunters. While the king and noblemen were watching from a tower.\nHunters were riding their horses and holding \"tado\", a wooden stick with lasso in its tip for catching deer. Tough chasing after deer requires a lot of shrewdness, more a hunter became shrewd both riding and catching dee, more the respects he got.\n\nActually riding horse tradition can be found in every village or town in Sulawesi.

Every episode is a spoof of a classic movie where the video is the original (although edited to fit the show's half-hour format) but all the dialogue is overdubbed with humorous dialogue written and voiced by the L.A. Connection, in a manner similar to Woody Allen's feature-length film \"What's Up, Tiger Lily?\". During one season, 26 half-hour episodes were produced. Before producing the series, the L.A. Connection did live comedy dubbing of films at the Ken Theater in San Diego and the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nThe original run was syndicated to local stations by Four Star Television during the 1985-1986 television season; it was later seen in reruns on Nick at Nite from 1987 to 1989.

{"id": "334279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334279", "title": "Major film studio", "text": "Major film studio\n\nA major film studio is a production and distribution company that releases a substantial number of films annually and consistently commands a significant share of box office revenue in a given market. In the American and international markets, the major film studios, often simply known as the majors, are commonly regarded as the six diversified media conglomerates whose various film production and distribution subsidiaries collectively command approximately 80–85% of U.S. box office revenue. The term may also be applied more specifically to the primary motion picture business subsidiary of each respective conglomerate.\n\nThe \"Big Six\" majors are all film studios active since Hollywood's Golden Age. Three of them – Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and 20th Century Fox – were members of the \"Big Five\", but the other three – Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and Walt Disney Studios – did not gain their market shares until much later. The former two were part of the \"Little Three\" in the next tier down, and the latter one was an independent production company during the Golden Age. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and RKO were the other two Golden Age \"Big Five\" majors, that exist today only as a mini-major and a small independent company. United Artists was a distribution company for several independent producers during the Golden Age, later began producing films, grew to major status, then merged with MGM.\n\nWhile the main studios of the Big Six are located within of each other, Disney is the only one that has been owned by the same conglomerate since its founding and is also the sole member whose parent entity is still located near Los Angeles on Disney's studio lot and in the same building, where as the five others were previously owned by many different companies years ago and now report to conglomerates that are respectively located elsewhere in Boston (Paramount), Dallas (Warner Bros.), New York City (Fox), Philadelphia (Universal), and Tokyo (Columbia); moreover, Disney and Columbia are the only ones whose parent companies are still headquartered near the Pacific Ocean. Paramount is the only one still based \"in\" Hollywood with Columbia being in Culver City and Fox in Century City; furthermore, Paramount, Columbia, and Fox are the only ones still located within and near the Los Angeles city limits. Both Disney and Warner Bros. are located in Burbank and Universal is in the unincorporated area of Universal City.\n\nMost of today's Big Six also control subsidiaries with their own distribution networks that concentrate on arthouse pictures (e.g. Fox Searchlight Pictures) or genre films (e.g. Sony's Screen Gems); several of these specialty units were shut down or sold off between 2008 and 2010. The six major studios are contrasted with smaller production and/or distribution companies, which are known as independents or \"indies\". The leading independent producer/distributors such as Lionsgate, and STX Entertainment are sometimes referred to as \"mini-majors\". From 1998 through 2005, DreamWorks SKG commanded a large enough market share to arguably qualify it as a seventh major, despite its relatively small output. In 2006, DreamWorks was acquired by Viacom, Paramount's corporate parent. In late 2008, DreamWorks once again became an independent production company; its films were distributed by Disney's Touchstone Pictures until 2016, at which point distribution switched to Universal.\n\nThe Big Six major studios are today primarily backers and distributors of films whose actual production is largely handled by independent companies – either long-running entities or ones created for and dedicated to the making of a specific film. The specialty divisions often simply acquire distribution rights to pictures in which the studio has had no prior involvement. While the majors still do a modicum of true production, their activities are focused more in the areas of development, financing, marketing, and merchandising. Those business functions are still usually performed in or near Los Angeles, even though the runaway production phenomenon means that most films are now mostly or completely shot on location at places outside Los Angeles.\n\nSince the dawn of filmmaking, the U.S. major film studios have dominated both American cinema and the global film industry. U.S. studios have benefited from a strong first-mover advantage in that they were the first to industrialize filmmaking and master the art of mass-producing and distributing high-quality films with broad cross-cultural appeal. Today, the Big Six majors routinely distribute hundreds of films every year into all significant international markets (that is, where discretionary income is high enough for consumers to afford to watch films). It is very rare, if not impossible, for a film to reach a broad international audience on multiple continents and in multiple languages without being picked up by one of the majors for distribution.\n\n Disney 21.78%; UTV Communications: 0.04% \"(Prev. totals: 2016 - 26.1%; 2015 - 20.7%; 2014 - 14.9%; 2013 - 15.9%; 2012 - 14.7%; 2011-12.2%; 2010—14.3%; 2009—11.9%; 2008—11.4%; 2007—15.3%; 2006—16.7%; 2005—14.6%; 2004—16.5%)\"\n\nPast majors include:\n\nMini-major studios (or \"mini-majors\") are the larger film production companies that are smaller than the major studios and attempt to compete directly with them.\n\nRoadside Attractions, partly owned by Lionsgate, had an additional 0.34% market share.\n\nPast mini-majors include:\n\nLions Gate Entertainment, which moved in 2006 from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Santa Monica, California, was the most successful North American movie studio based outside the Los Angeles metropolitan area before its relocation. Now known as Lionsgate, it was founded in 1997 by financier Frank Giustra. (The company is unrelated to Lion's Gate Films, the Los Angeles–based production company run by filmmaker Robert Altman in the 1970s.) In 2003, the company doubled in size with the acquisition of Artisan Entertainment. In January 2012, Lionsgate acquired Summit Entertainment, which was the highest-grossing mini-major the previous three years. Summit was founded as an independent overseas sales company in 1991, moved into production in the mid-1990s, and was reconstituted as a full-fledged studio in 2006. Lionsgate also owns a minority stake in the independent distribution company Roadside Attractions.\n\nLionsgate is apparently on the cusp of becoming a major studio with the parent's purchase of Summit Entertainment as well as its controlling share of Roadside Attractions (43%) and Pantelion Films (as specialty units). With its top five box office showing it was declared a new major studio by \"Variety\"; however, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" does not yet recognize the company as a major.\n\nThe Weinstein Company was founded in late 2005 by brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein after their departure from Miramax Films, which they had founded in 1979. In 1993, they sold control of Miramax to the Walt Disney Company, continuing to run the studio in quasi-independent fashion under the Disney umbrella. When the Weinsteins left Disney, they retained the right to the Dimension Films brand, which is used by The Weinstein Company (as it was by Miramax) for genre films. After the success of \"1408\", released in June 2007, the studio went two years without a hit. It experienced several high-level executive defections in 2008, and announced major layoffs that November. The Weinsteins have a long-standing relationship with Quentin Tarantino—all of the feature films he has directed through 2009 have been distributed either by Miramax, when it was led by the brothers, or The Weinstein Company. The successful release of his \"Inglourious Basterds\" in August 2009 was seen as a \"turnaround\" for the studio.\n\nMGM, after decades as a major studio, continues to distribute motion pictures and television content as a minor, privately held media company. In April 2005, it was purchased from Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation by a consortium including Sony, cable company Comcast (who now owns Universal Pictures), Providence Equity Partners, and three other private investment firms. MGM has a deal with 20th Century Fox for the distribution of home video and overseas theatrical product. MGM is also once again the sole owner of United Artists, after Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner sold back their minority stakes. Via its original 1981 merger with UA, MGM controls the rights to the James Bond franchise. Columbia co-distributed the first two Bond films starring Daniel Craig after the 2005 purchase. After a third Bond film with Craig was put on hold when MGM slipped into deep financial trouble, Sony reached an agreement with MGM in April 2011 to distribute \"Skyfall\". Sony's distribution rights to the franchise expired in late 2015 with the release of \"Spectre\". In 2017, MGM and Eon offered a one-film contract to co-finance and distribute the upcoming 25th film worldwide, which was reported on 25 May 2018 to have been won by Universal Pictures.\n\nDreamWorks was founded in 1994 by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen. Once again independent with the founding of a new company after two-and-a-half years under the Viacom/Paramount corporate umbrella, it is backed by India's Reliance ADA Group. DreamWorks is not a full-service studio—it produces and finances films, but as it did for most of its first era as an independent, it arranges distribution through the majors. In February 2009, after dropping out of a deal with Universal, DreamWorks struck such a deal with Disney, though Paramount was releasing the DreamWorks pictures developed there through mid-2011. The first independent DreamWorks film to be released under the new deal, via Touchstone, was \"I Am Number Four\" in February 2011. Katzenberg, who was completely divested from the new DreamWorks, ran DreamWorks Animation as a totally separate business. The company maintained distribution deals with DreamWorks Pictures, Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. On August 22, 2016, Universal Studios' parent company NBCUniversal acquired DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion, thereby granting Universal ownership access to every DreamWorks Animation product and distribution rights for future movies. As part of the agreement, Katzenberg relinquished control of DreamWorks Animation to Illumination Entertainment's CEO Chris Meledandri while heading as new chairman of DreamWorks New Media. \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\", which is scheduled to be released on March 1, 2019, will be the first DreamWorks Animation movie to be distributed by Universal Studios.\n\nIn 2010, Summit led with $519.9 million in grosses and a 5.0% market share. Lionsgate was close behind with $513.9 million in grosses, good for a 4.9% share. They were far ahead of the other mini-majors, none of which reached $100 million in grosses or a 1% share. In 2009, Summit's mini-major-leading figures were $480.4 million in grosses and a 4.5% market share. Lionsgate's $401.5 million in grosses gave it a 3.8% share. Two other companies commanded market shares greater than 1%: Weinstein/Dimension (2.0%) and Overture Films (1.5%). In 2008, Lionsgate topped the mini-majors with $441.5 million in grosses, a 4.5% market share. Three other companies had over $100 million in box office grosses: Summit (2.4% market share), MGM/UA (1.7% market share), and Overture (1.1% market share).\n\nIn 2007, Lionsgate and MGM/UA were virtually tied for the position of most successful mini-major in terms of market share, each with 3.8%. No other independent studio had even a 1% market share. In 2006, Lionsgate had a 3.6% market share, The Weinstein Company had a 2.5% market share, and MGM/UA had a 1.8% market share. In 2005, the still independent DreamWorks SKG had 5.7% and Lionsgate had 3.2%. Of MGM/UA's four significant money-earners during 2005, it released three before its acquisition by the Sony-led consortium; MGM/UA's total market share for the year was 2.1%. The Weinstein Company, in its first three months of operation, gained 0.5% of the year's total market share. In 2004, DreamWorks SKG had 10.0% (more than the Paramount Motion Pictures Group), Newmarket had 4.3% (due almost entirely to \"The Passion of the Christ\"), Lionsgate had 3.2%, and MGM/UA had 2.1%.\n\n\"'Instant major' is a newly coined term for a film company that seemingly overnight has approached the status of major\" \nIn 1967, three \"instant majors\" studios popped up, two of which were partnered with a Television network theatrical film unit with most lasting until 1973:\n\n\nIn 1909, Thomas Edison, who had been fighting in the courts for years for control of fundamental motion picture patents, won a major decision. This led to the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company, widely known as the Trust. Comprising the nine largest U.S. film companies, it was \"designed to eliminate not only independent film producers but also the country's 10,000 independent [distribution] exchanges and exhibitors.\" Though its many members did not consolidate their filmmaking operations, the New York–based Trust was arguably the first major North American movie conglomerate. The independents' fight against the Trust was led by Carl Laemmle, whose Chicago-based Laemmle Film Service, serving the Midwest and Canada, was the largest distribution exchange in North America. Laemmle's efforts were rewarded in 1912 when the U.S. government ruled that the Trust was a \"corrupt and unlawful association\" and must be dissolved. On June 8, 1912, Laemmle organized the merger of his production division, IMP (Independent Motion Picture Company), with several other filmmaking companies, creating the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in New York City. By the end of the year, Universal was making movies at two Los Angeles facilities: the former Nestor Film studio in Hollywood, and another studio in Edendale. The first Hollywood major was in business.\n\nIn 1916, a second powerful Hollywood studio was established when Adolph Zukor merged his Famous Players Film Company movie production house with the Jesse L. Lasky Company to form Famous Players-Lasky. The combined studio acquired Paramount Pictures as a distribution arm and eventually adopted its name. That same year, William Fox relocated his Fox Film Corporation from Fort Lee, New Jersey to Hollywood and began expanding. In 1918, four brothers—Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner—founded the first Warner Brothers Studio on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. On April 4, 1923, the Warner Brothers incorporated their fledgling movie company as \"Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc.\"\n\nThe Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America and the Independent Producers' Association declared war in 1925 on what they termed a common enemy — the \"film trust\" of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount, and First National, which they claimed dominated the industry by not only producing and distributing motion pictures, but by entering into exhibition as well. On October 6, 1927, Warner Bros. released \"The Jazz Singer\", starring Al Jolson, and a whole new era began, with \"pictures that talked,\" bringing the Studio to the forefront of the film industry. \"The Jazz Singer\" played to standing-room-only crowds throughout the country and earned a special Academy Award for Technical Achievement. Fox, in the forefront of sound film along with Warners, was also acquiring a sizable circuit of movie theaters to exhibit its product.\n\nBetween late 1928, when RCA's David Sarnoff engineered the creation of the RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) studio, and the end of 1949, when Paramount divested its theater chain—roughly the period considered Hollywood's Golden Age—there were eight Hollywood studios commonly regarded as the \"majors\". Of these eight, the so-called Big Five were integrated conglomerates, combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: Loew's/MGM, Paramount, Fox (which became 20th Century-Fox after a 1935 merger), Warner Bros., and RKO. The remaining majors were sometimes referred to as the \"Little Three\" or \"major minor\" studios. Two—Universal and Columbia (founded in 1924)—were organized similarly to the Big Five, except for the fact that they never owned more than small theater circuits (a consistently reliable source of profits). The third of the lesser majors, United Artists (founded in 1919), owned a few theaters and had access to production facilities owned by its principals, but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films. During the 1930s, the eight majors averaged a total of 358 feature film releases a year; in the 1940s, the four largest companies shifted more of their resources toward high-budget productions and away from B movies, bringing the yearly average down to 288 for the decade.\n\nAmong the significant characteristics of the Golden Age was the stability of the Hollywood majors, their hierarchy, and their near-complete domination of the box office. At the midpoint of the Golden Age, 1939, the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22% (MGM) to 9% (RKO); each of the Little Three had around a 7% share. In sum, the eight majors controlled 95% of the market and all the smaller companies combined had a total of 5%. Ten years later, the picture was largely the same: the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22% (MGM) to 9% (RKO); the Little Three had shares ranging from 8% (Columbia) to 4% (United Artists). In sum, the eight majors controlled 96% of the market and all the smaller companies combined had a total of 4%.\n\nThe end of the Golden Age had been signaled by the majors' loss of a federal antitrust case that led to the divestiture of the Big Five's theater chains. Though this had virtually no immediate effect on the eight majors' box-office domination, it somewhat leveled the playing field between the Big Five and the Little Three. In November 1951, Decca Records purchased 28% of Universal; early the following year, the studio became the first of the classic Hollywood majors to be taken over by an outside corporation, as Decca acquired majority ownership. The 1950s saw two substantial shifts in the hierarchy of the majors: RKO, perennially the weakest of the Big Five, declined rapidly under the mismanagement of Howard Hughes, who had purchased a controlling interest in the studio in 1948. By the time Hughes sold it to the General Tire and Rubber Company in 1955, the studio was a major by outdated reputation alone. In 1957, virtually all RKO movie operations ceased and the studio was dissolved in 1959. (Revived on a small scale in 1981, it was eventually spun off and now operates as a minor independent company.) In contrast, there was United Artists, which had long operated under the financing-distribution model the other majors were now progressively shifting toward. Under Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin, who began managing the company in 1951, UA became consistently profitable. By 1956—when it released one of the biggest blockbusters of the decade, \"Around the World in 80 Days\"—it commanded a 10% market share. By the middle of the next decade, it had reached 16% and was the second-most profitable studio in Hollywood. Despite RKO's collapse, the majors still averaged a total yearly release slate of 253 feature films during the decade.\n\nThe 1960s were marked by a spate of corporate takeovers. MCA Inc., under Lew Wasserman, acquired Universal in 1962; Gulf+Western took over Paramount in 1966; and the Transamerica Corporation purchased United Artists in 1967. Warner Bros. underwent large-scale reorganization twice in two years: a 1967 merger with the Seven Arts company preceded a 1969 purchase by Kinney National, under Stephen J. Ross. MGM, in the process of a slow decline, changed ownership twice in the same span as well, winding up in the hands of financier Kirk Kerkorian. The majors almost entirely abandoned low-budget production during this era, bringing the annual average of features released down to 160. The decade also saw an old name in the industry secure a position as a leading player. In 1923, Walt Disney had founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio with his brother Roy and animator Ub Iwerks. Over the following three decades Disney became a powerful independent focusing on animation and, from the late 1940s, an increasing number of live-action movies. In 1954, the company—now Walt Disney Productions—established Buena Vista Film Distribution to handle its own product, which had been distributed for years by various majors, primarily United Artists and then RKO. (Disney's 1937 \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", released by RKO, was the second biggest hit of the 1930s.) In its first year, Buena Vista had a major success with \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", the third biggest movie of 1954. In 1964, Buena Vista had its first blockbuster, \"Mary Poppins\", Hollywood's biggest hit in half a decade. The company achieved a 9% market share that year, more than Fox and Warner Bros. Though over the next two decades, Disney/Buena Vista's share of the box-office would again hit similar marks, its relatively small output and exclusive focus on family movies meant that it was not generally considered a major.\n\nThe early 1970s were difficult years for \"all\" the majors. Movie attendance, which had been declining steadily since the Golden Age, hit an all-time low in 1971. In 1973, MGM president James T. Aubrey Jr. drastically downsized the studio, slashing its production schedule and eliminating its distribution arm (UA would distribute the studio's films for the remainder of the decade). From fifteen releases in 1973, the next year MGM was down to five; its average for the rest of the 1970s would be even lower. Like RKO in its last days under Hughes, MGM remained a major in terms of brand reputation, but little more. MGM, however, was not the only studio to trim its release line. By the mid-1970s, the industry had rebounded and a significant philosophical shift was in progress. As the majors focused increasingly on the development of the next hoped-for blockbuster and began routinely opening each new movie in many hundreds of theaters (an approach called \"saturation booking\"), their collective yearly release average fell to 81 films during 1975–84. The classic set of majors was shaken further in late 1980, when the disastrously expensive flop of \"Heaven's Gate\" effectively ruined United Artists. The studio was sold the following year to Kerkorian, who merged it with MGM. After a brief resurgence, the combined studio again declined. From the mid-1980s on, MGM/UA has been at best a \"mini-major\", to use the present-day term.\n\nMeanwhile, a new member was finally admitted to the club of major studios and two significant contenders emerged. With the establishment of its Touchstone Pictures brand and increasing attention to the adult market in the mid-1980s, Disney/Buena Vista secured acknowledgment as a full-fledged major. Film historian Joel Finler identifies 1986 as the breakthrough year, when Disney rose to third place in market share and remained consistently competitive for a leading position thereafter. The two contenders were both newly formed companies. In 1978, Krim, Benjamin, and three other studio executives departed UA to found Orion Pictures as a joint venture with Warner Bros. It was announced optimistically as the \"first major new film company in 50 years\". Tri-Star Pictures was created in 1982 as a joint venture of Columbia Pictures (then owned by the Coca-Cola Company), HBO (then owned by Time Inc.), and CBS. In 1985, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation acquired 20th Century-Fox, the last of the five relatively healthy Golden Age majors to remain independent throughout the entire Golden Age and after.\n\nIn 1986, the combined share of the six classic majors—at that point Paramount, Warner Bros., Columbia, Universal, Fox, and MGM/UA—fell to 64%, the lowest since the beginning of the Golden Age. Disney was in third place, behind only Paramount and Warner Bros.. Even including it as a seventh major and adding its 10% share, the majors' control of the North American market was at a historic ebb. Orion, now completely independent of Warner Bros., and Tri-Star were well positioned as mini-majors, each with North American market shares of around 6% and regarded by industry observers as \"fully competitive with the majors\". Smaller independents garnered 13%—more than any studio aside from Paramount. In 1964, by comparison, all of the companies beside the then seven majors and Disney had combined for a grand total of 1%. In the first edition of Finler's \"The Hollywood Story\" (1988), he wrote, \"It will be interesting to see whether the old-established studios will be able to bounce back in the future, as they have done so many times before, or whether the newest developments really do reflect a fundamental change in the US movie industry for the first times since the 20s.\"\n\nWith the exception of MGM/UA—whose position was effectively filled by Disney—the old-established studios \"did\" bounce back. The purchase of 20th Century Fox by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation presaged a new round of corporate acquisitions. Between 1989 and 1994, Paramount, Warner Bros., Columbia, and Universal all changed ownership in a series of conglomerate purchases and mergers that brought them new financial and marketing muscle. Paramount's parent company Gulf+Western was renamed Paramount Communications in 1989 and was merged with Viacom five years later. Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. to give birth to the conglomerate Time Warner. Coca-Cola sold Columbia to Japanese electronics firm Sony also in 1989. And Universal's parent MCA was purchased by Matsushita. By the early 1990s, both Tri-Star and Orion were essentially out of business: the former consolidated into Columbia, the latter bankrupt and sold to MGM. The most important contenders to emerge during the 1990s, New Line Cinema, Miramax, and DreamWorks SKG, were likewise sooner or later brought into the majors' fold, though DreamWorks and Miramax are now independent again.\n\nThe development of in-house pseudo-indie subsidiaries by the conglomerates—sparked by the 1992 establishment of Sony Pictures Classics and the success of \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), Miramax's first project under Disney ownership—significantly undermined the position of the true independents. The majors' release schedule rebounded: the six primary studio subsidiaries alone put out a total of 124 films during 2006; the three largest secondary subsidiaries (New Line, Fox Searchlight, and Focus Features) accounted for another 30. Box-office domination was fully restored: in 2006, the six major movie conglomerates combined for 89.8% of the North American market; Lionsgate and Weinstein were almost exactly half as successful as their 1986 mini-major counterparts, sharing 6.1%; MGM came in at 1.8%; and all of the remaining independent companies split a pool totaling 2.3%.\n\nOnly one of the major studios changed corporate hands during the first decade of the 2000s, though it did so three times: Universal was acquired by Vivendi in 2000, then by General Electric four years later, and finally by Comcast in 2011. More developments took place among the majors' subsidiaries. The very successful animation production house Pixar, whose films were distributed by Buena Vista, was acquired by Disney in 2006. In 2008, New Line Cinema lost its independent status within Time Warner and became a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Time Warner also announced that it would be shutting down its two specialty units, Warner Independent and Picturehouse. In 2008 as well, Paramount Vantage's production, marketing, and distribution departments were folded into the parent studio, though it retained the brand for release purposes. Universal sold off its genre specialty division, Rogue Pictures, to Relativity Media in 2009. Disney closed down Miramax's operations in January 2010, and sold off the unit and its library that July to an investor group led by Ronald N. Tutor of the Tutor Perini construction firm and Tom Barrack of the Colony Capital private equity firm.\n\nSince June 2018, Warner Bros. is owned by AT&T after it completed it acquisition of Time Warner renaming it WarnerMedia.\n\nThe eight major film studios of the Golden Age have gone through the following significant ownership changes (\"independent\" meaning customarily identified as the primary commercial entity in its corporate structure; \"purchased\" meaning acquired anything from majority to total ownership):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}
{"id": "353081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=353081", "title": "Max Payne (video game)", "text": "Max Payne (video game)\n\nMax Payne is a third-person shooter video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Gathering of Developers in July 2001 for Microsoft Windows. Ports created later in the year for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and the Game Boy Advance were published by Rockstar Games. A Mac OS port was published on 16 July 2002 by MacSoft in North America and Feral Interactive in the rest of the world. There were plans for a Dreamcast version of \"Max Payne\", but they were canceled due to the discontinuation of the console. The game was re-released on 27 April 2009 as a downloadable game in the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360. The game was also re-released in 2012 as a downloadable game in the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 under the PS2 classics banner, iOS, Android, and in April 2016 for the PlayStation 4 as a PS2 emulated downloadable game in the PlayStation Store.\n\nThe game centers on former NYPD detective Max Payne, who attempts to solve the horrific murder of his wife and daughter, in connection to a crime case involving a designer drug named \"Valkyr\" and while doing so, is entangled in a larger and complex conspiracy, involving the U.S. military. It features a gritty neo-noir style and uses graphic novel panels (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game, as it draws inspiration from hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many allusions to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnarök, and several of the names used in the game are those of the Norse gods and mythos. The gameplay is heavily influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was one of the first games to feature the bullet time effect popularized by \"The Matrix\".\n\n\"Max Payne\" received very positive reviews and was praised for its exciting gunplay and use of noir storytelling devices. The game won a large number of accolades, including the BAFTA Award. , the \"Max Payne\" series has sold over 7.5 million copies. It also inspired a feature film with the same title.\n\n\"Max Payne\" is a third-person shooter in which the player assumes the role of its titular character, Max Payne. Almost all the gameplay involves bullet time-based gun-fights. Levels are generally straightforward, occasionally incorporating platforming and puzzle-solving elements. The game's storyline is advanced by the player following Max's internal monologue as the character determines what his next steps should be. Several of the game's levels involve Payne's surrealistic nightmares and drug-related hallucinations.\n\nInitially, the player's weapon is a semi-automatic pistol. As the game progresses, other weapons become accessible, including melee and hand-thrown weapons. Some weapons can be dual wielded. Max regains health by taking painkillers, which can be found throughout the levels. The game's AI is dependent on pre-scripted commands: most of the behavior exhibited by enemies (such as taking cover, retreating from the player, or throwing grenades) is pre-scripted.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Max Payne\" revolves around bullet time, a form of slow motion — when triggered, the passage of time is slowed down to such extent that the movements of bullets can be seen by the naked eye and enables Max to perform special moves. Although Payne's movement is also slowed, the player is still able to position the aiming reticle and react in real time, providing an advantage over enemies. Occasionally, when the last character of an enemy group is killed, the viewpoint switches to a third-person view circling a falling body. Likewise, the camera may follow the path of a bullet fired from a sniper rifle.\n\nThe \"Dead on Arrival\" game mode limits the player to only seven saves per chapter, and the \"New York Minute\" mode forces the player to complete each chapter within the allotted time, which is replenished by killing enemies. Upon completing the game on \"Dead on Arrival\", the player unlocks \"The Last Challenge\" (\"End Combat\" or \"Final Battle\" in the different versions), featuring a fight in perpetual bullet time against the \"Killer Suit\" hitmen.\n\nThe story is told \"in medias res\" and consists of three volumes: \"The American Dream\", \"A Cold Day in Hell\", and \"A Bit Closer to Heaven\". The game begins in January 2001, as New York City finishes experiencing the worst blizzard in its history. The intro sequence shows Max Payne (James McCaffrey), a renegade DEA agent and former NYPD officer, standing at the top of a skyscraper building as police units arrive. He experiences a flashback from three years ago. Back in August 1998, Max returned home in New Jersey to find that a trio of apparent junkies had broken into his house while high on a new designer drug called Valkyr. Max rushed to aid his family, but was too late: his wife (Haviland Morris) and their newborn daughter had already been brutally murdered, much to his devastation. After their funeral, Payne transferred to the DEA.\n\nTwo and a half years later, Max is employed as an undercover operative inside the Punchinello Mafia family responsible for the trafficking of Valkyr. His DEA colleague B.B. gives Max a message asking him to meet Alex Balder (Chris Phillips), his handler and best friend, in a subway station at Roscoe Street. Max's arrival at the subway results in a shoot-out after he encounters mobsters working for Jack Lupino, a Mafia underboss in the Punchinello crime family, attempting a bank robbery by breaking through from the station. Working his way back to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is killed by an unknown assassin. Payne becomes the prime suspect in Alex's murder, because he is still undercover to the media and the fact that he fled the crime scene. Additionally, the Mafia find out that he is a cop and want him dead.\n\nWhile searching for Lupino in businesses owned by him, Max busts a Valkyr drug deal and discovers that the Russian mobster Vladimir Lem is engaged in a fierce turf war against Punchinello's men. While searching, Max gets a phone call from a man named Alfred Woden, stating that the police have been tipped off as to his location, and he escapes. Max eventually finds Vinnie Gognitti, Lupino's right-hand man; he wounds and chases Gognitti through the city and learns the location of Lupino's hideout, a nightclub named Ragna Rock. After gunning down the insane Lupino, Payne meets Mona Sax (Julia Murney), a contract assassin, who pours him a drink which turns out to be laced with a sedative. In this state Max is found by the Mafia and is dragged away to be tortured.\n\nMax manages to escape from the Mafia-owned slaughterhouse and enters a brief alliance with Lem. He agrees to kill one of Vladimir's traitors, Boris Dime, and his men aboard the cargo ship \"Charon\" at the Brooklyn waterfront. The ship is carrying a shipment of high-powered firearms belonging to the Russian mob, which Max keeps in exchange for the favor. After surviving a bomb ambush at the Mafia restaurant Casa di Angelo, Max uses the Russian weapons to storm the residence of Don Angelo Punchinello. There he finds the body of Lisa Punchinello, Mona's sister, and discovers that the Don is only a puppet in the Valkyr market when the mafioso is killed in front of Payne by agents of Nicole Horne (Jane Gennaro), the ruthless CEO of the Aesir Corporation. Horne injects Max with an overdose of Valkyr and leaves him for dead, as he experiences a drug-induced nightmare and suffers internal torment from his feelings of guilt for not being able to save his family.\n\nAfter surviving the overdose and awakening, Payne pursues his only lead to a steel foundry located over a hidden underground military research complex. Inside he discovers that Valkyr is the result of the Valhalla Project, an early 1990s U.S. military attempt to improve soldiers' stamina and morale following earlier Ladder experiments; the project was sharply halted due to poor results, but was later secretly restarted by Horne through Aesir. He discovers that his wife accidentally found out about the project, and Horne let loose the crazed Valkyr test subjects into his house. Aesir initiates \"Operation Dead Eyes\" to get rid of evidence and witnesses, including their own scientists. Max escapes the bunker at the last moment just as it self-destructs.\n\nMax gets a call from B.B., who arranges a meeting at an underground parking lot. At this point, Max has already figured out that it was B.B. who shot Alex and framed him for his murder. The meeting turns out to be an ambush, and a running gun-fight commences as Max chases B.B. through the garage. After killing the traitor, Max gets another phone call from Woden asking him to come to the Asgard Building. Alfred reveals himself to be part of a powerful secret society called the Inner Circle, which has strong ties to the U.S. government. The Inner Circle members inform Max about Horne's identity but cannot pursue her themselves because \"their hands are tied\". They ask Max to kill Horne in exchange for dropping any criminal charges against him. Suddenly, Asgard is overrun by Aesir gunmen who kill everyone in the meeting room except for Max, who escapes, and Woden, who pretends to be shot. Max has to fight his way out of the building.\n\nMax arrives at the main office of Aesir Corporation and makes his way through the high-tech security building while avoiding strafing runs by a minigun-armed helicopter. Along the way he runs into Mona again in an elevator, but Horne's men shoot her in the head after she refuses to shoot Max; her body vanishes when Max goes back to the elevator. At the top Max confronts Horne, who escapes to the roof and boards the helicopter. Max shoots the guy wires of the building's antenna, which snaps off and crashes into the helicopter, killing Horne. The game's storyline arrives at the point where it first started: the NYPD ESU arrives at the scene, arresting Max and leading him out of the Aesir building, where he sees Woden. Knowing that Woden will ensure his safe passage through the judicial system, Max smiles.\n\n\nMax Payne (voiced by James McCaffrey) is a fugitive DEA agent and former NYPD detective whose wife Michelle and newborn daughter were killed in connection with the Valkyr drug case. Max then goes undercover in the mob, and eventually becomes a one-man-army vigilante waging a personal war on crime. Max ends up killing hundreds of gangsters and conspiracy enforcers while on the run from the police determined on stopping his vendetta against all those responsible for his family's death. He uses metaphors and wordplay to describe the world around him within his inner monologues, which often contradict his external responses to characters he speaks with. The game presents the story as retold by Max from his point of view.\n\n\nMona Sax (voiced by Julia Murney): The twin sister of Lisa Punchinello and a contract killer, Mona is the femme fatale of the game. She has a grudge against her sister Lisa's abusive husband, Mafia boss Angelo Punchinello, whom she desires to kill. After Punchinello is killed, she sides with Nicole Horne who hires her to kill Max. Finding herself unable to do so, she is shot in the head by Horne's henchman and collapses into an elevator.\n\nRemedy Entertainment developed an idea of a \"third-person action game\" in late 1996, after completing \"Death Rally\" (their first game), inspired first by \"Loaded\" and then by the success of \"Tomb Raider\" (although determined to avoid its \"horrid camera system\"). According to the game's story and script writer Sam Lake, for him \"the starting point was this archetype of the private eye, the hard-boiled cop\" that would be used in a game with a \"deeper, more psychological\" story. A game prototype and design document of the project, with the working titles \"Dark Justice\" and \"Max Heat\" (a wordplay on this is a TV show called \"Dick Justice\" and a porn film \"Max Heat\", both featured in \"Max Payne 2\"), were soon created and shown to 3D Realms, who signed a development deal and production began. In 1999 the designers traveled from Finland to New York to research the city, accompanied by two ex-NYPD bodyguards, to get ideas for environments and take thousands of photographs for mapping.\n\nFor cutscenes, the developers found comic panels (with voice-overs) to be more effective and less costly to use than fully animated cinematics, noting that comic panels forced the player to interpret each panel for themselves and \"the nuances are there in the head of the reader [...] it would be much harder to reach that level with in-game or even pre-rendered cinematics.\" They also found it easier to reorganize the comic panels if the plot needed to be changed while developing the game. The in-game engine is used for some cutscenes involving action sequences. The music for the game was composed by Kärtsy Hatakka.\n\nRemedy used their own game engine, which they dubbed MaxFX (or MAX-FX, in development since early 1997). The only games that used this engine were \"Max Payne\" and its , while a MaxFX level editor was also included in the release. MAX-FX was licensed to Futuremark, who used it for their \"3DMark\" benchmark series with the last one being \"3DMark2001 Second Edition\".\n\nThe first trailer showcasing an early version of the game's story and gameplay was shown at 1998 E3, attracting great interest due to its innovative content and effects (especially the MaxFX's 3D particle-based system for smoke and muzzle flashes), although 3D Realms producers later claimed they deliberately avoided overhyping the game. \"Max Payne\" was originally scheduled to be released in the summer of 1999; however, it was repeatedly delayed and got heavily revamped in 2000. In particular, the game's graphics were improved to feature much more realistic textures and lighting, while the multiplayer mode was dropped. The game was eventually released for Windows on 23 July 2001.\n\nAs a result of the inevitable comparisons to \"The Matrix\", the designers have included several homages to the film in order to capitalize on the hype: for instance, the detonation of the subway tunnel door to gain access to the bank vault is similar to the cartwheeling elevator door in the movie, while the introduction \"Nothing to Lose\" level is similar to the lobby shootout scene in the film. Futuremark, which licensed the MAX-FX graphics for their \"3DMark\" benchmark series, included a \"Matrix\"-like lobby shootout as a game test in the 2001 edition.\n\nThe GBA version of the game was developed in 2003 by Möbius Entertainment (later Rockstar Leeds). Since it was developed on a far less powerful platform, this version differs greatly from the PC versions and its Xbox and PlayStation 2 ports: instead of a 3D shooter, the game is based on sprite graphics and is shown from an isometric perspective. However, the other gameplay features have remained very similar to the original, including the use of polygonal graphics for the characters. The story also remained the same as in PC and console versions, though some levels from the original are omitted, and the game still features many of the original's graphic novel sections, complete with some of the voice-overs.\n\nOn 6 April 2012, Max Payne was announced for Android and iOS, titled as \"Max Payne Mobile\" a port of the PC version of the original \"Max Payne\". The game was released for iOS on 13 April 2012, while the Android version was delayed until 14 June 2012. No major changes were made to the game apart from the HD overhaul. A new version 1.3 was released on 18 March 2013 that fixes a bug that prevents users from accessing their cloud saves.\n\nIn its debut month, sales of \"Max Payne\" reached roughly 82,000 copies. In the United States, \"May Payne\"s computer and PlayStation 2 versions respectively sold 430,000 copies ($2.6 million in revenue) and 1.6 million copies ($56 million in revenue) by 2006. According to \"Edge\" and \"Next Generation\", this made \"Max Payne\" the country's 33rd highest-selling computer game released between 2000 and 2006, and the 26th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between those dates. The Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) awarded \"Max Payne\"s computer version a \"Silver\" sales award, and its PlayStation 2 version a \"Gold\" award, indicating respective sales of at least 100,000 and 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game ulimately totaled four million sales.\n\n\"Max Payne\" was released to very positive reviews. AllGame praised the game's atmosphere, level and sound design while noting that the \"story is, at times, predictable and full of clichés\" and that \"Unlike \"Half-Life\", where the action is integrated perfectly with its simplistic, yet appropriate story, Max Payne frequently yanks you out of the game and forces you to look at a badly-drawn in-game \"graphic novel\" and listen to mediocre dialogue.\" The review also noted a lack of replay value or multiplayer modes.\n\nThe game won many annual awards for the year 2001, including Best PC Game by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts; Golden Joystick Award by Dennis Publishing; Visitors Award Best PC Game at the European Computer Trade Show; Best Game of 2001, Best Graphics in a PC Game, and Best PC Action Game by \"The Electric Playground\"; Readers Choice Best Game and Best PC Game by \"Pelit\"; Computer Game of the Year by \"The Augusta Chronicle\"; Best PC Game of 2001 by Amazon.com; PC Game of the Year by Shacknews and by GameZone; The Best of 2001 - PC and Editor's Choice by Game Revolution; Reader's Choice Game, Best Single Player Action Game, and Best Xbox Game by GameSpot; Readers' Choice Game of the Year, Best Storyline, Best Graphics and Best of Use of Sound, and Best Adventure Game (Xbox) and Editor's Choice by IGN; Gamers Choice Award (Xbox) by Games Domain; Best Gimmick by GameSpy (runner-up in the Best Ingame Cinematics and Best Movie Trailer categories); and Editor's Choice and Best Innovation Destined for Overuse by \"Computer Gaming World\". The staff of IGN wrote: \"This game garnered so many votes from the readers that we almost decided to create a new Best Max Payne Game of 2001 category.\" The site also called it the 96th best PlayStation 2 game. They claimed that gamers thought of \"Max Payne\" instead of \"The Matrix\" when they thought of bullet time. \"PC Gamer US\" presented \"Max Payne\" with its 2001 \"Best Action Game\" and \"Best Graphics\" awards, and the editors summarized the game as \"spine-chilling, exhilarating, and surreal\".\n\nCommon criticism usually centered on \"Max Payne\"s lack of replay value, as there is no multiplayer mode, and the linear story mode due to the level design and pre-scripted enemy behavior that provides 10–15 hours of gameplay. While the graphics were generally praised for high-resolution textures, the character models lacked animated facial expressions (IGN criticized the titular character's \"grimace on his face that makes him look constipated\").\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version suffered from reduced detail and occasional slowdowns, as the game stressed the limits of the console's power. In addition, the levels were broken up into smaller parts so it would not tax the PlayStation 2's 32 MB of RAM, which according to IGN caused \"heavy disruption to the flow and tension of the story\". Otherwise it was a faithful port that retained all of the content from the PC original. GameSpot awarded it an 8.0/10.0, compared to the 9.2 ratings awarded to the PC and Xbox versions), saying \"If you can't play this intense, original action game on any platform except the PS2, then that's where you should play it--but only by default\".\n\nAn early version of \"Max Payne\" was also a runner-up for the Best of Show award at the E3 in 1998. The finished game received several Game of the Month-type awards in various video game outlets (and a Seal of Excellence at Adrenaline Vault), and was included in the 2005 list of 50 best games of all time, as well as in the 2011 list of 100 top PC games of all time. In 2007, bit-tech included the game and its sequel on the list of the top five most moddable games. It received two awards from Eurogamer, Best Game Cinematography Award and Best Game Character Award of 2001.\n\n\"Max Payne Mobile\" received mixed to positive reviews. Some praised the HD graphics overhaul, although pointed out the game's age and the issues with the touchscreen controls.\n\nA sequel, \"\", was released in 2003. The third game, \"Max Payne 3\" developed by Rockstar Games, was released in 2012. \"Max Payne\", a film loosely based on the video game, was released in 2008, starring Mark Wahlberg as Max and Mila Kunis as Mona.\n\n"}

{"id": "2322223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322223", "title": "Pierce the Ploughman's Crede", "text": "Pierce the Ploughman's Crede\n\nPierce the Ploughman's Crede is a medieval alliterative poem of 855 lines, lampooning the four orders of friars.\n\nSurviving in two complete 14th-century manuscripts and two early printed editions, the \"Crede\" can be dated on internal evidence to the short period between 1393 and 1400. The two manuscripts both include \"Piers Plowman\", and in the first, the \"Crede\" serves as an introduction to a C-text version of \"Piers Plowman\". Additionally, BL MS Harley 78 contains a fragment of the \"Crede\" copied c. 1460–70.\n\nThe \"Crede\" was first printed in London by Reyner Wolfe, and then reprinted for inclusion with Owen Rogers's 1561 reprint of Robert Crowley's 1550 edition of \"Piers Plowman\". The \"Crede\" was not printed again until Thomas Bensley's edition in 1814, based on that of 1553, and Thomas Wright's of 1832. The 1553 and 1561 editions were altered to include more anticlericalism and to attack an \"abbot\" where the original text had \"bishop\". This latter revision is a conservative one, undoubtedly motivated by the security of attacking a defunct institution following the Dissolution of the Monasteries rather than an aspect of Catholicism which survived in the Church of England. Nearly all modern critics have agreed that several lines about transubstantiation were removed. This excision was covered with a (perhaps interpolated) passage not found in any of the manuscripts.\n\nThe poem exists in several modern editions: Thomas Wright and Walter Skeat produced independent versions in the 19th century; more recently, James Dean has edited the text for TEAMs, and Helen Barr has produced an annotated edition in \"The Piers Plowman Tradition\" (London: J.M. Dent, 1993) ().\n\nSome scholars believe it is very likely that the author of the \"Crede\" may also be responsible for the anti-fraternal \"Plowman's Tale\", also known as the \"Complaint of the Ploughman\". Both texts were probably composed at about the same time, with \"The Plowman's Tale\" being the later and drawing extensively on the \"Crede\". The author/speaker of \"The Plowman's Tale\" mentions that he will not deal with friars, since he has already dealt with them \"before, / In a makynge of a 'Crede'...\" W. W. Skeat believed that \"The Plowman's Tale\" and the \"Crede\" were definitely by the same person, although they differ in style. Others reject this thesis, suggesting that the author of \"The Plowman's Tale\" makes the extra-textual reference to a creed to enhance his own authority.\n\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the \"Crede\" was usually attributed to Chaucer. The editor of the 1606 edition of \"The Plowman's Tale\", possibly Anthony Wotton, explains his speculations with this gloss: \"A Creede: Some thinke hee means the questions of Jack-vpland, or perhaps Pierce Ploughmans Creede. For Chaucer speakes this in the person of the Pellican, not in his owne person.\" This statement is ambivalent, suggesting that Chaucer could fictionally (\"in the person of the Pellican\") claim authorship for another text that he may not have actually written (i.e., the \"Crede\"), or Chaucer might be referring to one of his own writings (i.e., \"Jack Upland\"). Since \"Jack Upland\" was definitely (and wrongly) attributed to Chaucer in the 16th century, it is likely that the editor is introducing the possibility of a fictive authorship claim to deal with the possibility that \"The Plowman's Tale\" refers to the \"Crede\". In this way the editor may have thought that if \"Jack Upland\" is signified by the \"crede\" reference in \"The Plowman's Tale\", then \"Chaucer\" is speaking; if the \"Crede\" is signified, then it is the \"Pellican, not [Chaucer's] own person.\"\n\nThe \"Crede\" might also have been attributed to \"Robert Langland\" (i.e., William Langland) because of its inclusion in the 1561 edition of \"Piers Plowman\", although this edition dropped the preface by Robert Crowley that names Langland. One reader of the 1561 \"Piers Plowman\" (which appends the \"Crede\") made notes (dated 1577) in his copy that quote John Bale's attribution of \"Piers Plowman\" to Langland (\"ex primis J. Wiclevi discipulis unum\") in Bale's \"Index...Scriptorum\". Because of differences in language and his belief that Chaucer lived later than Langland, the reader concludes that the \"Crede\" alone (and not \"Piers Plowman\") is Chaucer's.\n\nLike much political or religious poetry of the Alliterative Revival (i.e., \"Piers Plowman\", \"Mum and the Sothsegger\"), the poem takes the form of a quest for knowledge. It is narrated by a layman who has memorised nearly all of the rudimentary texts demanded by the Fourth Lateran Council. He can read, and is able to recite the Ave Maria and Pater Noster proficiently: yet he does not know the Creed. He seeks help from the friars, first turning to the Franciscans, then the Dominicans, followed by the Austin friars and the Carmelites. But rather than learning anything of value, all he hears are imprecations. Each order savagely attacks one of its rival groups of mendicants: the Franciscans denounce the Carmelites; the Carmelites denounce the Dominicans; the Dominicans denounce the Augustines; the Augustines complete this carousel of invective by denouncing the Franciscans. The entire poem seems like an uproarious inversion of cantos xi and xii of Dante's \"Paradiso\": just as Dante has the Dominican Aquinas and the Franciscan Bonaventure lauding one another's orders, so the \"Crede\"-poet makes the mendicants exchange abuse.\n\nBut all is not entirely lost. As he returns home, the narrator encounters a poor Plowman, dressed in rags and so emaciated that \"men myyte reken ich a ryb\" (432). Although starving, the Plowman freely offers the narrator what food he does have. When the narrator tells him of his experiences with the friars, the Plowman launches into a blistering diatribe on the four orders. Recognising the wisdom of the Plowman's words, the narrator asks him whether he can teach him the Creed. He is glad to do so: the poem ends with the Plowman's recital of the elusive text.\n\nTwo features make the \"Crede\" particularly worthy of note. Firstly, it is the earliest text to imitate William Langland's \"Piers Plowman\", to which it refers explicitly. The selfless Plowman is of course directly drawn from the earlier work. Perhaps written within eight years of the C-text of \"Piers Plowman\", the \"Crede\" thus testifies to the appeal of Langland's more subversive, anticlerical sentiments among some of his early readers. Of course, the \"Crede\"-poet only uses \"Piers Plowman\" as a launch-pad for his own views. The \"Crede\" is markedly more confident than Langland in its opposition to the clergy. The fact that it abandons Langland's dream-vision framework is suggestive of this, as if the lay perfection that the Plowman represents has become more achievable in reality. \"The Crede\" conflates Piers (here, \"Peres\") with the author/dreamer of \"Piers Plowman\", thus collapsing that poem's many voices into a single, collective voice of the ideal community. This misprision was a common aspect of Piers Plowman's dissemination. The character of Piers thus escapes from the confines of William Langland's vision and takes on a life, an authority, and an authorial career of his own. As in \"The Plowman's Tale\" and \"The Prayer and Complaint of the Plowman\", true religion is the virtue of the poor. The Piers of the \"Crede\" is simply a plowman without the Christological aspect of Piers in Langland's poem.\n\nA second, related point of interest is that the \"Crede\" is a Lollard production that acknowledges the influence of Walter Map's Latin, anti-monastic \"Goliardic\" satires, such as \"The Apocalypse of Bishop Golias\" and \"The Confession of Golias.\" The author of the \"Crede\" claims that these works tarnished the monastic orders and brought on the mendicant orders, or else Satan himself founded them. With clear Lollard sympathies, the \"Crede\" praises John Wycliffe and as well as Walter Brut who is mentioned in relation to his heresy trial. (There were several trials for Brut, a Welsh Lollard, from 1391–1393.)\n\nThe \"Crede\"'s content wholly conforms to Lollard views of the friars. Most of the charges against the friars are familiar from other works such as \"Jack Upland\", the \"Vae Octuplex\" or Wyclif's \"Trialogus\", and most are ultimately derived from William of Saint-Amour's \"De Periculis Novissimorum Temporum\" (1256). As in all Wycliffite satire, the friars are lecherous, covetous, greedy, vengeful, demanding extravagant donations for even the most elementary services. They seek out only the fattest corpses to bury, and live in ostentatious houses that are more like palaces than places of worship. They are the children of Lucifer rather than Saint Dominic or St Francis, and follow in the footsteps of Cain, the first treacherous \"frater\". But the fact that the poem's main approach is dramatic rather than didactic or polemic, and its frequent passages of striking physical description, elevate it beyond the vast bulk of antifraternal writing. Elizabeth Salter's charge of empty 'sensationalism' seems highly unjust. The poem's vicious and unremitting attacks are impressively constructed, and even entertaining in their lacerating cynicism. Plus, as von Nolcken and Barr have shown, there is a remarkable subtlety to the poem, as it draws on even the most purely philosophical aspects of Wyclif's system. The opposition between the friars and Piers is finely crafted. While the friars squabble and bicker with one another, the true (i.e., Lollard) Christians form a single unity; at the end of the poem, in the words of Barr, 'the voices of Peres, narrator and poet all merge' into a single 'I':\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "809210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=809210", "title": "Roller derby", "text": "Roller derby\n\nRoller derby is a contact sport played by two teams of five members roller skating counter-clockwise around a track. Roller derby is played by approximately 1,250 amateur leagues worldwide, mostly inside the United States.\n\nGame play consists of a series of short match-ups (jams) in which both teams designate a jammer (who wears a star on the helmet). The jammer scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. The teams attempt to hinder the opposing jammer while assisting their own jammer—in effect, playing both offense and defense simultaneously.\n\nWhile the sport has its origins in the banked-track roller-skating marathons of the 1930s, Leo Seltzer and Damon Runyon are credited with evolving the sport to its competitive form. Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of sports entertainment, where theatrical elements overshadowed athleticism. Gratuitous showmanship largely ended with the sport's grassroots revival in the first decade of the 21st century. Although roller derby retains some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms, it has abandoned scripted bouts with predetermined winners.\n\nModern roller derby is an international sport, mostly played by amateurs. Most teams are all-female teams, but there is a growing number of male, unisex, and junior roller derby teams. It was under consideration as a roller sport for the 2020 Summer Olympics. FIRS, recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the official international governing body of roller sports, released its first set of Roller Derby Rules for the World Roller Games that took place September 2017 in Nanjing, China. Most modern leagues (and their back-office volunteers) share a strong \"do-it-yourself\" ethic that combines athleticism with the styles of punk and camp. , the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) had 423 full member leagues and 46 apprentice leagues.\n\nContemporary roller derby has a basic set of rules, with variations reflecting the interests of a governing body's member leagues. The summary below is based on the rules of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA). In March 2010, Derby News Network claimed that more than 98% of roller derby competitions were conducted under WFTDA rules. For example, members of the United Kingdom Roller Derby Association are required to play by WFTDA rules, while members of the former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association were encouraged to join the WFTDA.\n\nRoller derby is played in two periods of 30 minutes. Two teams of up to 15 players each field up to five members for episodes called \"jams.\" Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely. Each team designates a scoring player (the \"jammer\"); the other four members are \"blockers.\" One blocker can be designated as a \"pivot\"—a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play. The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.\n\nDuring each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another \"trip\" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any member of the opposing team. The rules describe an \"earned\" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that opponent and a point for each opponent not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack and the opposing jammer too, it is a five-point scoring trip, commonly called a \"grand slam.\"\n\nEach team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.\n\nPlay begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the \"jammer line\" and the \"pivot line\" 30 feet in front. The jammers start behind the jammer line. Jams begin on a single short whistle blast, upon which both jammers and blockers may begin engaging immediately.\nThe pack is the largest single group of blockers containing members of both teams skating in proximity, arranged such that each player is within 10 feet of the next. Blockers must maintain the pack, but can skate freely within 20 feet behind and ahead of it, an area known as the \"engagement zone.\"\n\nThe first jammer to break through the pack earns the status of \"lead jammer.\" A designated referee blows the whistle twice, and skates near, and points at, the lead jammer. Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost. The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips. If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes. If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam. If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.\n\nA skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds. The blocker must be upright, skating counterclockwise, in bounds, and within the engagement zone. Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh, and blocking from behind.\n\nReferees penalize rules violations. A player receiving a penalty is removed from play to sit in a penalty box for 30 seconds of jam time. If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends. The penalized player's team plays short-handed, as in ice hockey.\n\nHowever, the \"power jam\", derived from hockey's \"power play\", does not cover any short-handed situation but only the case where the jammer is penalized. In this case, that team cannot score. While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.\n\nIt would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box. A player \"fouls out\" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.\n\nPlayers skate on four-wheeled (\"quad\") roller skates, and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid inline skates for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.\n\nOffense and defense are played simultaneously, a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics. For example, blockers may create a large hole for their jammer to pass through and score, but this same maneuver might also allow the opposing team's jammer to score.\n\nStrategies (high-level plans toward achieving the game's goal, which is to outscore the opposition) include the following:\n\nTactics (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:\n\n\nWFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees and many non-skating officials (NSOs). Referees skate on the inside of the track; in flat-track derby, some also skate on the outside of the track. They call penalties, award points, and ensure safe game play. Referees must wear skates and typically wear white and black stripes. NSOs take up a range of positions inside and outside the track, start and time the jams, record and display scores and penalties communicated by referees, record the number of each skater on track for a given jam, and time and record skaters in the penalty box. Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.\n\n The growing popularity of roller skating in the United States led to the formation of organized multi-day endurance races for cash prizes, as early as the mid-1880s. Speed and endurance races continued to be held on both flat and banked tracks in the century's first three decades and spectators enjoyed the spills and falls of the skaters. The term \"derby\" was used to refer to such races by 1922.\n\nThe endurance races began to transform into the contemporary form of the sport in the mid-1930s, when promoter Leo Seltzer created the Transcontinental Roller Derby, a month-long simulation of a road race between two-person teams of professional skaters. The spectacle became a popular touring exhibition. In the late 1930s, sportswriter Damon Runyon persuaded Seltzer to change the Roller Derby rules to increase skater contact. By 1939, after experimenting with different team and scoring arrangements, Seltzer's created a touring company of four pairs of teams (always billed as the local \"home\" team versus either New York or Chicago), with two five-person teams on the track at once, scoring points when its members lapped opponents.\n\nOn November 29, 1948, before television viewership was widespread, \"Roller Derby\" debuted on New York television. The broadcasts increased spectator turnout for live matches. For the 1949–1950 season, Seltzer formed the National Roller Derby League (NRDL), comprising six teams. NRDL season playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for a week. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the sport was broadcast on several networks, but attendance declined. Jerry Seltzer (Leo's son), the \"Roller Derby\" \"commissioner\", hoped to use television to expand the live spectator base. He adapted the sport for television by developing scripted story lines and rules designed to improve television appeal, but derby's popularity declined.\n\n1989 saw the debut of \"RollerGames,\" an even more theatrical variant of roller derby for national audiences. It used a figure-8 track and rules adapted for this track. Bill Griffiths, Sr. served as commissioner while his son, Bill Griffiths, Jr., managed the L.A. T-Birds, who (according to the storyline) were seeking revenge on the Violators (led by Skull) for cheating in the Commissioner's Cup. The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez). It ran one season, because some of its syndicators went bankrupt.\n\nIn 1999, TNN (now Spike TV) debuted \"RollerJam,\" which used the classic rules and banked oval track, but allowed inline skates (although some skaters wore traditional quad skates). Jerry Seltzer was commissioner for this version.\n\nRoller derby began its modern revival in Austin, Texas in the early 2000s as an all-female, woman-organized amateur sport. By August 2006, there were over 135 similar leagues. Leagues outside the U.S. also began forming in 2006, and international competition soon followed. There are over 2,000 amateur leagues worldwide in countries including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, New Zealand, Germany, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Israel, Singapore, Dubai, and Egypt. In many international leagues, gear and equipment must be imported. Roller derby's contemporary resurgence has been regarded as an aspect of globalization which demonstrates \"the speed with which pop culture is now transported by highly mobile expatriates and social media, while also highlighting the changing role of women in many societies.\"\n\nMany roller derby leagues are amateur, self-organized and all-female and were formed in a do-it-yourself spirit by relatively new enthusiasts. In many leagues (especially in the U.S.), a punk aesthetic and/or third-wave feminist ethic is prominent. Members of fledgling leagues often practice and strategize together, regardless of team affiliation, between bouts. Most compete on flat tracks, though several leagues skate on banked tracks, with more in the planning stages.\n\nEach league typically features local teams in public bouts that are popular with a diverse fan base. Some venues host audiences ranging up to 7,000. Successful local leagues have formed traveling teams comprising the league's best players to compete with comparable teams from other cities and regions. In February 2012, the International Olympic Committee considered roller derby, among eight sports, for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2009, the feature film \"Whip It\" was based on roller derby and introduced viewers to its rules and culture. The WFTDA encouraged leagues to coordinate with promotions during the film's release to increase awareness of the leagues. Corporate advertising has used roller derby themes in television commercials for insurance, a breakfast cereal, and an over-the-counter analgesic.\n\nMost players in roller leagues skate under pseudonyms, also called \"derby names\" or \"skater names.\" These typically use word play with satirical, mock-violent or sexual puns, alliteration, and allusions to pop culture. Referees use derby names as well, often shown on the backs of their striped uniforms. Some players claim their names represent alter egos that they adopt while skating.\n\nWhether a team should skate under real names or derby names is sometimes debated. Some derby names are obscene, and this attracts controversy among other skaters.\n\nCopying of derby names has attracted legal and sociological analysis as an example of indigenous development of property rights. New players are encouraged to check derby names against an international roster to ensure they are not already in use.\n\nThe names of roller derby events are also sardonic and convoluted—for example, Night of the Rolling Dead (Night of the Living Dead), Knocktoberfest (Oktoberfest), Spanksgiving (Thanksgiving), Seasons Beatings (Seasons Greetings), Grandma Got Run Over By a Rollergirl (Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer), Cinco de May-hem (Cinco de Mayo), and War of the Wheels (War of the Worlds).\n\nRoller derby is a contact sport, and injuries can occur. Superficial injuries include torn eyelashes and \"fishnet burn\", a stippled effect of falling while wearing fishnet hose. However, torn ligaments, broken bones, and concussions also occur.\n\nSome leagues prominently display their injuries, to embellish the image of violence or machismo. However, some skaters say the sport is reasonably safe if skaters take precautions. The rules require appropriate medical professionals on-site at every bout, even if not required by laws or arena regulations. The WFTDA offers insurance for leagues in the United States with legal liability and accident coverage, but it recommends that skaters also carry their own primary medical insurance.\n\nAlthough the early 2000s revival of roller derby was initially all-female, some leagues later introduced all-male teams and unisex games; there were over 140 junior roller derby programs in the United States, and many more around the world.\n\nRoller derby bouts are now streamed online, and there is archived video of past bouts and tournaments. The WFTDA offers live streaming video of its tournaments at codice_1. Derby News Network (codice_2) offered live streaming video and archived video including events outside the WFTDA.\n\nFiveOnFive magazine covers roller derby and diverse aspects such as business, training, junior roller derby, and nutrition.\n\nThe largest governing body for the sport is the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), with 397 full member leagues and 48 apprentice leagues. WFTDA membership is a major goal of aspiring leagues. Other associations support either coed or men-only derby; the largest organization supporting male roller derby is the Men's Roller Derby Association (MRDA). Within the United States, the Junior Roller Derby Association governs play by those under 18. It modifies the WFTDA rules for minors, such as prohibiting hitting and accelerating into a block. Some U.S. leagues decline affiliation with a national organization because they prefer local governance.\n\nUSA Roller Sports (USARS) is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as the National Governing Body of competitive roller sports in the United States, including speed, figure, hockey, roller derby and slalom. WFTDA and USARS maintain a reciprocity agreement for insurance purposes.\n\nOutside the United States, many roller derby leagues enjoy support from their national skate federations, such as Skate Australia, the British Roller Sports Federation, and Roller Sports Canada. In Europe, roller derby was recognized as a sport in Paris in 2010 by the Federation Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS), which reports directly to the International Olympic Committee. As of 2017, FIRS has been accepted as the international rule set by the International Olympic Committee. Teams competed under the FIRS rules at The World Roller Games 2017 in Nanjing, China. The former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association worked with the American federation.\n\nSince 2006, the WFTDA has sponsored an annual championship. In 2008, it took the current \"Big 5\" format: four regional playoffs and a final championship tournament. The WFTDA also recognizes eligible tournaments hosted by member leagues. Internationally, the first Roller Derby World Cup took place in Toronto, Canada, in December 2011. The second World Cup took place in Dallas, Texas, in December 2014.\nSince 2012, USARS has held an annual Roller Derby National Championship. In 2017, FIRS and the USOC recognized USARS to participate in the Nanjing games.\n\nZaina Arafat asserts in \"Virginia Quarterly Review\" that roller derby defies heteronormativity and patriarchal standards. In Egypt, Arafat says, there are expectations that a woman will not show visible scars, will have an unblemished body for her husband, and will refrain from activities that may damage her body. She says roller derby in Egypt is subversive, as it acts as an indirect political statement.\n\nCarly Giesler states that skaters enact sexualities that create or reclaim an identity, and their role parodies \"hegemonic scripts of sexuality\" through the use of costumes, derby names and personas. Roller derby acts as a unique stage for female athletes, letting them rebut constraints society places on women and female athletes. Giesler argues that female sports objectifies them for the male gaze, but roller derby turns this on its head by disregarding gender roles and norms.\n\n\n"}

Frog\n\nThe series takes its comedy from a combination of wordplay (particularly puns and homophones), physical humor, situational irony, breaking of the fourth wall, and numerous pop culture references (especially to \"Gundam\", \"Kamen Rider\", \"Super Sentai\", \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Dragon Ball\", \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" and many others, although when broadcast and published in the United States, they make references that American audiences would be familiar with like \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Men in Black\"). Various anime, games, manga, and other aspects of pop culture are parodied/referenced throughout the series as a bonus to older viewers. Both the manga and the anime are laden with pop-culture references, and even in the same story the references often vary wildly. The anime does not explicitly refer to Evangelion or other animations to which Bandai does not hold the copyrights, but only recreates the \"feel\" of famous scenes from these anime. The anime is much more detailed and direct in its Gundam references, however, since its animation studio, Sunrise, is a subsidiary of Bandai who does hold the rights to the Gundam franchise. \n\nThe main plot of the story focuses on the steadily deteriorating conditions of the Keroro Platoon, a group of five, frog-like aliens from Planet Keron of the Gamma Planetary System. The platoon’s mission is to invade and conquer Earth (known to the aliens as “Pekopon”), but fail miserably at each attempt. Sergeant Keroro (or Keroro Gunso) although being the leader of the platoon, is childish, incompetent, and would rather spend his time indulging in his hobby of making plastic Gundam models than take over Earth. Aside from Keroro, there are four other members of the Keroro Platoon: adorable but violent Private Second Class Tamama; bellicose yet tenderhearted Coporal Giroro; intelligent but mischievous Sergeant Major Kururu; and disciplined but traumatized Lance Corporal Dororo.\n\nThe largest obstacle in the way of their mission is the Hinata Family, who must take care of the Keroro Platoon due to the Keron Army deserting the latter on Earth. Keroro is kept busy with manual labor and constant abuse, primarily from the family daughter, Natsumi. Each member of the platoon finds himself in the care of a human: Giroro's human is Natsumi Hinata, whom he falls in love with; Keroro's human is Fuyuki Hinata, who considers the Sergeant his only true friend; Kululu's human is Mutsumi Saburo, who discovered him; Dororo's human is Koyuki, a fellow ninja; and Tamama's human is his equal in bipolar insanity, Momoka Nishizawa. All are tied to the Hinatas in some way throughout the events in the anime and manga.\n\n\"Sgt. Frog\" is published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten, serialized in the magazine \"Shōnen Ace\", and was published in English by Tokyopop. The manga began its monthly run in the weekly shōnen magazine, \"Shōnen Ace\". The manga, first aimed at the older audience (teens/adults) from the first to the seventh volume, was toned down after the anime adaption started (since the TV series was a family show). However, the manga still maintains suggestive comedy that only the more mature audiences understand in present volumes. Tokyopop initially held the American rights to the \"Sgt. Frog\" manga until 2011 when the company ceased operations. By the time their publication ended, they had published 21 volumes. Their release of the manga have censored nipples drawn in some scenes, in order to get away from the OT (Older teen) rating and maintaining its Teen rating. Viz Media relicensed the manga for digital release on December 16, 2014.\n\nThe anime series started airing on TV Tokyo in 2004 and ended in 2011. The anime is produced by Sunrise, and has been aired on Animax, TV Tokyo, and TXN. Seven seasons have been created during its seven-year run. Unlike the manga which is aimed at older audiences, the anime adaptation has been toned down to a level suitable for family audiences. ADV had previously announced they had acquired exclusive rights to an English dub of \"Sgt. Frog\" (for $408,000). However, on July 4, 2008, it was announced that rights to the English release were transferred to Funimation Entertainment.\n\nThe anime ran almost year-round, which each season beginning in the first week of April and ending on the last week of March. The first season aired on Saturdays, but the show was moved to Fridays for the second and third seasons. The show returned to Saturdays for seasons four, five and six, and the final season aired on Sundays.\n\nADV Films had originally added a brief teaser page to their website, announcing their licensing of the anime. The site turned to static before playing a short clip of Keroro dancing to \"Afro Gunso,\" then leaving the message \"hacked by the frog.\" This was followed by a press release from ADV on November 20, 2006, stating that they had licensed all Sgt. Frog properties (except the manga, which was already licensed by Tokyopop) for the US. It was once confirmed that the anime dub would be released on DVD in the United States in February 2007. However, ADV Films had never confirmed a release date. ADV announced at Comic-Con International 2007 that the US release date had been delayed because of TV negotiations but would not comment on which networks they were talking to. In a DVD included with the December issue of Newtype USA was an English-language trailer for Sgt. Frog released by ADV, with voices for Keroro (said to be voiced by Vic Mignogna), Natsumi, Fuyuki, Aki, and the narrator. ADV was 90% done on getting a deal with the show, though they created a separate team to work specifically on it that included people from Summit Entertainment (the company that worked with 4Kids Entertainment during the time they had Pokémon). They had dubbed three episodes, but they were dubbed three times because ADV created three different pilot-packages for television to see which one worked the best. They made an otaku/fan pilot, a mass-market pilot, and a kids' pilot. They received positive responses from three different networks. Cartoon Network liked the mass-market pilot, while Nickelodeon liked the kids' pilot. Nickelodeon told them that they would air the show if ADV got the merchandising rights. However, as of July 4, 2008, the English license for the first 51 episodes of the Sgt. Frog anime was transferred to Funimation Entertainment through a deal with Sojitz.\n\nFunimation released a dubbed version of episode 12B as a test on YouTube to be reviewed by the viewers. Many instances of regional name changes were observed; Natsumi is renamed Natalie, and Giroro's cat was renamed \"Mr. Furbottom,\" (despite being female). Additionally, the word Pekopon was changed to Planet Wuss, Pekoponians were referred to as Wussians, and Keron changed to Frogulon. The frogs' names remained the same as the Japanese version, though shortened by one syllable (e.g. Keroro changed to Kero, Tamama to Tama). The test episode had mixed reviews by fans involving the voice acting, jokes, and name changes.\n\nAt Otakon 2009, the first five episodes of \"Sgt. Frog\" were screened, where the original versions of the various names that were changed were used. The voice actor for Sergeant Keroro in the test video, Chris Cason, was swapped out for Sergeant Major Kululu's test actor, Todd Haberkorn. Kululu was changed to Chuck Huber, and the narrator also appears to have been changed. FUNimation stated at their panel that they were going to keep the anime as similar as possible to its Japanese counterpart, and claimed to only change references from Japanese pop culture (save for those Americans were already familiar with) to references from American pop culture. Those present at the showing seemed to enjoy the changes, and the reception of the official dub was very positive. On February 19, 2011, Funimation announced at Katsucon that they had licensed more episodes of Sgt. Frog.\n\nAccording to Funimation, as of February 2013, \"Sgt. Frog\" is \"now on hiatus\".\n\nOn July 31, 2009, Funimation added the first 4 dubbed episodes of the series to their online video portal. After a considerable delay following between the release of the first dubbed episodes, Funimation began making dubbed episodes other than the first 4 available on the portal. Currently, the first 51 subtitled episodes are available on the Funimation video portal and Hulu. The 51 dubbed episodes later expired, although they were all later placed back on the portal and on Hulu. The show is rated TV-PG on the DVDs and on Hulu. Unlike the other versions released outside Japan, the US version remains uncut.\n\nThe episode distribution scheme has been slightly changed from the Japanese Region 2 release. Although the first 51 episodes are known as \"Season 1\" in Japan, Funimation has divided the episodes into a \"Season 1\" and a \"Season 2\". The Season 1 Part 1 DVD set was released September 22, 2009. It contains episodes 1 through 13, Season 1 Part 2 was released on November 24, 2009, and contains episodes 14 through 26. Season 2 Part 1 was released on January 26, 2010, containing episodes 27-39. In addition, Season 2 Part 2 was released on March 30, 2010 containing episodes 40-51. The first two boxsets were re-released into one Season 1 set on March 29, 2011. The complete Season 2 set followed up on April 26, 2011. Season 3 Part 1 was released to DVD by Funimation beginning on July 26, 2011, containing episodes 52-65. Season 3 Part 2 was released to DVD on August 16, 2011 containing episodes 66-78. A complete Season 3 boxset containing episodes 52-78 was released on November 13, 2012. On all of the box sets, it states, \"from the creators of the Gundam series\". This is relatively incorrect because Sunrise did not create the Gundam series, they produced it, so it should say \"from the studio that brought you Gundam\". The creator of Gundam is Yoshiyuki Tomino.\n\nAll three seasons were available on Netflix streaming as of December 2011; however, the first two seasons, and the first half of the third, were removed without warning in January 2013, before the series was completely removed in April of the same year.\n\nOn January 7, 2014 it was announced that a new Flash anime television series entitled \"Keroro\" would premiere on Animax on March 22 of that year. Haruki Kasugamori is the director of the series at Sunrise and the animation studio Gathering is providing assistance with the animation. The series airs during the programming block, Keroro Hour, which airs both the series and reruns of Sgt. Frog. The series features new character designs and includes the characters, New Keroro, Tomosu Hinohara, and Myō Kaneami, all of which were originally manga-only characters. The opening to the series is \"Keroro☆Popstar\" (ケロロ☆ポップスター), performed by Mayumi Gojo. The flash anime ended on September 6 of the same year, with a total of 23 episodes.\n\nFive full-length theatrical movies that were directed by Junichi Sato and produced by Sunrise were released:\n\n\nAn exclusive feature only available for limited time at specific Planetariums was released after the end of the show.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the video games were only released in Japan, but there were others released in Korea.\n\nIn 2005, the manga received the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga.\n\n"}

This is said to eliminate the need for lifeguards or other supervision, as there is little risk of drowning.\n\nTypically there are ground nozzles that spray water upwards out of the splash pad's raindeck. There may also be other water features such as a rainbow (semicircular pipe shower), or mushroom- or tree-shaped showers. Some splash pads feature movable nozzles similar to those found on fire trucks to allow users to spray others. The showers and ground nozzles are often controlled by a hand activated-motion sensor, to run for limited time.\n\nTypically the water is either freshwater, or recycled and treated water, that is typically treated to at least the same level of quality as swimming pool water standards. These splash pads are often surfaced in textured non-slip concrete or in crumb rubber.\n\nA typical definition was laid out by a 1986 Heath Act in British Columbia which stated that a spray pool is \"an artificially constructed depression or basin for use by children, into which potable water is sprayed but not allowed to accumulate in the bottom.\"\n\nSimilarly, the city of Norfolk, Virginia, specifically defines a spray pool as \"any shallow manmade structure constructed from materials other than natural earth or soil used for spraying humans with water and which has a drainage area designated to remove the water from the shower or spray nozzles at a rate sufficient to prevent the impounding of water.\"\n\nSplash fountains, unlike splash pads, encourage use from people of all ages. These fountains are usually designed to be both visually appealing (from a distance) and also interactive. As such, they are designed to allow easy access, often at ground level. They tend to feature nonslip surfaces, and have no standing water, to eliminate possible drowning hazards, so that no lifeguards are required. Multiple fountains may start and stop in unison or according to a pattern for artistic effect. While they may be placed in public parks like children's splash pads, splash fountains are also likely to be placed in public squares or at urban beaches.\n\nPopular in summertime and especially prevalent in urban areas, the spray pool offers an alternative to the practice of opening fire hydrants so that children can play and cool off in the water - a practice which is illegal and has been cited as dangerous in that it lowers the water pressure in a given area and makes firefighting more difficult. A spray pool does not need to be staffed by qualified lifeguards.\n\nDepending upon the strength and arc of the flow, the force of the spray can be relatively strong (especially close to the point where the water emerges) or may have more resemblance to rainfall or even a fine mist. Many splash pads have some features such as fine mist, that are designed to be moderate enough for children. Other splash fountains are designed for adults, e.g. for joggers or concert goers to cool off in.\n\nThe area beneath a spray pool typically has drain openings so that the water it produces will not flood the surrounding landscape. In some instances, the water collected in these drains is recycled back into the spray mechanism, thereby conserving water. Alternatively, the water emanating from the spray nozzles may be continually drawn from a fresh water supply.\n\nHydraulophones are the world's first musical instrument that makes music from vibrations in water. By pressing on jets of water laid out to a musical scale, hydraulophones make a unique sound. Hydraulophones have been installed in water parks, museums, and science centres around the world, including the Legoland California Resort, Chicago Children's Museum, and the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto.\n\nThe splash fountain at Dundas Square in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the water is heated by solar energy captured by the special dark-colored granite slabs.\n\nPlacement and management of spray pools varies according to the municipality in which they are located.

{"id": "22392114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22392114", "title": "Virtual military", "text": "Virtual military\n\nA Virtual Military Organization (VMO) is a dedicated hobby organization that uses simulation to model the operations of a military. Virtual Military Organizations (VMOs) generally have a presence on the internet, similar to real military organizations. Most VMOs simulate military operations to varying degrees. A newer variant of Virtual Military is the MilSim unit. MilSim units differ from Virtual Military by placing emphasis on the simulation of military tactics in their chosen gaming platform, whereas traditionally, VMOs have placed emphasis on simulating the bigger picture, including a full military career path, logistics systems, coordinated movement of equipment around the world, and prolonged military operations. Although VMOs may appear to be a type of gaming clan, a key difference is that a gaming clan's primary purpose is to be an \"organized group of players that regularly play together.\" VMOs are essentially role-playing environments within which an individual can immerse themselves. \"Realism\" groups are semantically similar; however, their primary focus is usually on following real-life procedures as much as possible. Therefore, tactical realism and MilSim are almost synonymous in the gaming world. A Google search for 'Virtual Military' reveals quite a few VMOs that go to varying degrees of depth to pursue their goal.\n\nEach VMO has their own mission. Some VMOs will simulate an individual military unit, others an entire branch of the military, and yet others attempt to simulate Joint Operations with multiple branches. Most VMOs offer a rank system that provides a career path within the organization. VMOs will often offer a variety of training, in order to allow new members to familiarize themselves with the organization's doctrine.\nEach VMO chooses to either follow an immersive style, a realistic style, or a combination of both. Immersion as it relates to this topic is the pursuit of a \"feeling\" of complete saturation in a military operation, whereas realism is the rigid following of real-world rules, tactics, and customs of a real-life counterpart. For some people, realism is in fact immersive, so there is an element of crossover between the two terms. While most VMOs will incorporate a rank structure, some extend that to incorporate features such as Military Logistics systems, economics models, awards and medals, and custom debriefing reports.\n\nWhile each has its benefits and followers, a mix between the two seems to be the most popular option.\n\nSome VMOs can be creative by making their own custom paint schemes, medals and award ribbons, rank insignia, weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and bases (Air bases mostly developed for Flight Simulator X).\n\nSome groups form a historical, political, economic, or persistent battle image or reputation over time. They support various causes and styles of law and order, or internal hierarchy structures. Some groups might form specific government types, ranging from Communism to Fascism, Democracy to Monarchy, and so on. At times, there are even Anarchist rebel groups, or militias that form. Groups might grow to form into completely custom government entities or structures, and on into resembling small nations, with their own flags and codes of honor.\n\nAs of 2017, popular games used by the VMO community include \"Arma 3\", \"\", and \"Squad\" for land-based simulation, and \"Microsoft Flight Simulator\", \"Falcon BMS\", and \"Digital Combat Simulator\" for aviation simulation. A few units play games such as \"Call of Duty\" or \"Battlefield\", but mostly those are casual clans, although some attempt to play tactically.\n\nIt has been reported that Virtual Military groups which originated within the flight simulation genre are once thought to not be as active as previously.\n\nAs with all types of organizations, the VMO community has seen splits, merges, and closures over time. At the same time, fresh blood has been injected with new VMOs opening. This constant activity promotes knowledge transfer between groups, and subsequently most VMOs have now standardized their business model to the point there are very few differences between each of them. Very few have unique characteristics. New groups often appear to start out using the business model of the successful VMOs.\n\nSome of the more unique characteristics of VMOs include:\n\n\nSuccessful groups include more than one of the above characteristics into their missions. This creates a rich environment that deepens the immersion for players. According to BJ Fogg's behavior model, motivation is closely linked to actions and triggers. In order to successfully create a lasting future for VMOs, it is therefore paramount that groups include triggers and actions that enhance the player's motivation. Since a VMO is essentially an abstraction of a game, group leaders should also consider learning about gamification in order to create a lasting bond between the player and the group.\n\n\n"}
