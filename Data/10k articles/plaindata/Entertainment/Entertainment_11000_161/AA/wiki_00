In 1840 the pair were wed and developed their performances together. \n\nOtto and Allissa were amidst a time when the circuses were pushing the boundaries of performance. The London Vauxhall Gardens boasted balloon ascents from 1830 to 1840. These kinds of feats were pressuring those within the circuses and traveling show environments to explore new and exciting ways to bring the audiences back to the round. Side shows provided the audiences with curious fascination or “human oddities” dwarves, giants, bearded ladies, Siamese twins and other unusual acts of which included contortionists and strongmen.\n\nOne of Allissa's and Otto's acts was titled \"The Russian Doll\", a performance in which Otto presented a life scaled, three tiered Russian doll on stage and juggled the set to have finally revealed his wife contorted within the smallest of the dolls.\nAfter the success of this performance the pair were keen to develop their skills further. Amongst the Mander and Mitchenson archives; according to the Globe and Traveller evening newspaper an article was found, stating that in 1843 Otto and Allissa had devised a performance titled \"The Tin Canister Extravaganza\" in which Allissa would contort into a tin can whilst Otto would continue the performance by sealing the can with a lead solder provided by a Mr. Bryan Donking of the Donking Hall and Gamble Cannery in Bermondsey, South-East London. A terrible accident regarding a sharp implement used to break the lead seal left Allissa stuck within the canister.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22366161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22366161", "title": "Assassin's Creed II", "text": "Assassin's Creed II\n\nAssassin's Creed II is a 2009 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the second major installment in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series, a sequel to 2007's \"Assassin's Creed\", and the first chapter in the \"Ezio trilogy\". The game was first released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2009, and was later made available on Microsoft Windows in March 2010 and OS X in October 2010. Several minor game related features could be redeemed on Uplay and three downloadable expansion packs were released on Xbox Live.\n\nThe plot is set in a fictional history setting and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Knights Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The main narrative takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy during the 15th and early 16th century. Players can explore Florence, Venice, Tuscany and Forlì as they guide Ezio on a quest for vengeance against those responsible for betraying his family. The primary focus is to utilize the player's combat and stealth abilities, as Desmond begins to uncover the mysteries left behind by an ancient race known as the First Civilization in the hope of ending the conflict between the Assassins and Templars.\n\nUsing a newly updated Anvil game engine, \"Assassin's Creed II\" began development shortly after the release of \"Assassin's Creed\". The game received critical acclaim from video game publications, with praise directed towards its Renaissance setting, narrative, characters, map design and visuals, as well as improvements from its predecessor. It was the biggest selling game of 2009–2010 and has sold more than 9 million copies. It is considered to be one of the best games ever made, and it popularized the \"Assassin's Creed\" franchise. The PC version was met with some criticism in relation to the digital rights management system and, thus had the always-online DRM permanently removed. The game spawned a follow-up, \"\" and its direct sequel, \"\". Remastered versions of all three games were released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on November 15, 2016 as part of \"The Ezio Collection\".\n\nPlayers directly control the on-screen character through a third-person perspective and can control the camera, allowing for a 360° view of their surroundings. The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions of late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Monteriggioni, Forlì, San Gimignano, Rome (The Vatican only) and the Tuscan countryside. The Animus 2.0, a new version of the machine of the same name present in \"Assassin's Creed\", provides in-game context for changes and additions to several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters and services that the player encounters. The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the character to recover only from minor injuries. More grievous injuries require visiting a street-side doctor or use of medicine (which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies).\n\nThe player may now swim in water, and Eagle Vision—the ability to identify specific people and landmarks—can now be used in third-person view and while moving. A young Leonardo da Vinci is present in the game, aiding the player by creating new weapons from translated \"Codex pages\" that Altaïr, the original game's main character, left behind for future Assassins' analysis and insight. Within the game, the player will be able to use Leonardo's flying machine (based on real-life plans by Leonardo) during one mission. The player also has the ability to control a carriage in one level, and can row gondolas, as well as ride horses at any point in the game where they are readily available between towns and cities. The setting of the various places the player may go to have been made more detailed and in-depth; civilians sometimes cough or sneeze. Additionally, the player can hire different groups of NPCs, such as mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves; these groups can be used to fight, distract, or lure guards, respectively. A day and night cycle has been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time, in addition to setting missions and events at certain times of the day.\n\nThere are many ways to interact with NPCs. Money thrown to the ground, or a corpse carried and then deposited on the ground, may also serve as a distraction for both guards and peasants. There are also several different types of enemies, some more agile or stronger than others, and some of which will actively search hiding places where Ezio was last seen.\n\nThe combat system is more complex than that of its predecessor, with the ability to disarm opponents using counter-attacks while unarmed. If the player steals an enemy's weapon, it is possible to follow up with an attack that instantly kills the enemy. Da Vinci provides the player with specialized weaponry, such as the dual hidden blades, poison blade and the miniature wheellock firearm, which are all based on schematics found in Altaïr's Codex pages. Generic swords, cutlasses, maces, axes and daggers can all be purchased from vendors in each city. The player can also pick up any weapon on the ground or use improvised weapons, such as brooms or halves of a spear. These weapons are used just like normal blunt weapons. In addition, players are able to purchase artwork for their villa, obtain new armor as the game progresses, and even dye Ezio's clothing with a number of different colors. Other equipment includes larger pouches to carry more throwing knives and medicine. Six additional weapons can be unlocked by connecting a PSP with \"\" to the PS3.\n\nThe Auditore family's countryside villa, located in Monteriggioni, acts as Ezio's headquarters: the surrounding property can be upgraded, drawing income for the player's use. There are several outlets for using currency, with vendors selling items such as medicine, poison, weapons, repairs, upgrades, paintings, and clothing dyes. When these shops are renovated, Ezio receives discounts at the shops on the goods they sell. Purchasing weaponry, armour sets and artwork also contributes to increasing the villa's overall worth, in turn generating more income for Monteriggioni.\n\nThere is now a broader array of methods for hiding or blending in the area. One can dive underwater to break guards' line of sight, and blending may be performed with any group of people, rather than only a specific type (as in the first \"Assassin's Creed\"). The game features a notoriety system, with guards more alert to Ezio's presence depending on his behavior, location, and current mission. This infamy can be reduced through bribery, removing wanted posters, or assassinating corrupt officials.\n\nThe missions in the game now have an expanded variety, with different structuring. For example, a mission may have the objective to escort someone, but may change to a chase and assassination. Investigation is less explicit, and instead missions may follow people and/or a narrative. There are roughly 200 missions in the game; about half are part of the main storyline, while the rest are side quests which need not be completed in order to finish the game's main storyline. Cities also contain hidden locations such as catacombs and caves (the design of which have been compared by the developers to the \"Prince of Persia\" series, where the objective is to navigate the area). Exploring these locations eventually rewards the player with an Assassin's Seal; the collection of all six Seals allows the player to unlock the Armor of Altaïr, in a concealed section of the Villa.\n\nLike \"Assassin's Creed\", characters based on historical figures are present in the game, including Leonardo da Vinci, Niccolò Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza, Bartolomeo d'Alviano, the Medici family, the Pazzi family, the Barbarigo family and Pope Alexander VI.\n\nLocations in the game include the Tuscany region (Florence, Monteriggioni and San Gimignano), the Apennine Mountains, the Romagna region (Forlì), Venice and Rome. Specific landmarks include St Mark's Basilica, the Grand Canal, the Little Canal, the Rialto Bridge, Santa Maria del Fiore, the Sistine Chapel, Santa Croce, Palazzo Vecchio, Ponte Vecchio, and Santa Maria Novella.\n\nAfter the events of \"Assassin's Creed\", test subject Desmond Miles is rescued from confinement by undercover Assassin Lucy Stillman and taken to a remote safe house, where he meets her team, consisting of historian and analyst Shaun Hastings and technician Rebecca Crane. Using design plans stolen by Lucy, they have constructed their own version of the Animus, dubbed \"Baby\", which they intend to use to train Desmond as an Assassin through the so-called \"Bleeding Effect\", which allows the user to learn all their ancestor's skills instantly. Desmond is assigned to investigate the memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze, starting with his birth to a wealthy Florentine family in the late 15th century.\nThe story then skips forward several years, with Ezio growing into a charismatic but reckless young man in the time of the Renaissance. After his father and brothers are hanged after being framed for treason by a corrupt magistrate, Ezio kills him and flees to his ancestral home of Monteriggioni with his mother and sister. There, his uncle Mario explains that both he and his late father served an ancient order known as the Assassins, and agrees to train Ezio in stealth and combat. With his new abilities, Ezio embarks on a quest to kill the men responsible for arranging his father's death, including politicians, bankers, mercenaries, and merchants aligned to the Pazzi and Barbarigo families. The search takes him to cities such as Florence, San Gimignano, Forlì, and Venice. During his journey, Ezio also makes a number of new allies, including philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli and inventor Leonardo da Vinci, the latter of whom provides him with new equipment based on information left by Altair's Codex. While in Venice, he learns the identity of the Templar grandmaster known as \"the Spaniard\": Rodrigo Borgia, who has been planning to secure all of Italy for the Order by unifying the most influential families behind his leadership. Dressed as a soldier, he confronts Rodrigo while helping him transport an Apple of Eden to Rome. Armed with the papal staff—which turns out to be a Piece of Eden—Rodrigo reveals his intention to unlock the \"Vault\", a chamber he believes to contain a power greater than any the world has ever known. He manages to escape, leaving the Apple in Ezio's possession. As a reward for service, Mario has him formally inducted into the Assassins.\n\nAround this time, Desmond uncovers a random memory left over from his time at Abstergo, in which Altair is shown impregnating Maria Thorpe, a Templar he encountered in the previous game. He also finds a series of glyphs similar to the drawings he found in his cell, which, when deciphered, reveal a vision of two human slaves stealing an Apple. The video ends with the ASCII codes (in binary) for \"EDEN\" (01000101 01000100 01000101 01001110). The team theorizes that the two humans may be Adam and Eve, the first man and woman.\n\nWith several sections of memory too corrupted to access (later made available as DLC Sequences), the team sends Desmond to the final memory, set in 1499. With Rodrigo now secure in his position as Pope Alexander VI, Ezio infiltrates Vatican City during Mass and beats him in a fistfight. Rather than kill his nemesis, he lets him live with the knowledge that he has failed. Combining the Apple and Staff, he opens the entrance to the vault. Inside, he is contacted by a strange woman named Minerva. Aware that Desmond is listening, she explains how her people, the \"First Civilization\", created humanity to serve them, but were subsequently destroyed by an unknown catastrophe. The survivors joined forces with their former servants, building a network of vaults to both preserve their technology and culture and serve as a preventative measure against a future disaster. Before vanishing, she tells Desmond that only he has the power to fulfill this \"prophecy\", leaving both him and Ezio confused as to what she means.\n\nShortly thereafter, Abstergo agents led by Vidic enter the hideout, forcing the team to abandon everything except the Animus. As they head to a new location, Lucy informs Desmond that the Assassins have detected strange occurrences in the Earth's magnetic field; a solar flare scheduled to pass the planet in a few months would likely trigger the same event that ended the First Civilization. Desmond prepares to reenter the Animus, beginning the story of \"\".\n\nUbisoft's Yves Guillemot officially confirmed that \"Assassin's Creed II\" was in development on November 26, 2008, during the company's financial performance report. This was followed by Michael Pachter speculating in GameTrailers' \"Bonus Round\" that game would change its setting to the events of the French Revolution, which turned out to be false.\n\nA promotional video was released by Ubisoft on April 6 showing a skull, some hidden blade designs, and Leonardo's flying machine on a scroll.\nOn April 16, \"Game Informer\" released details of the game, including pictures of Ezio, a new teaser trailer was released, and the game was \"officially\" announced by Ubisoft.\n\nIn an interview, in May 2009, Sebastien Puel stated that the development team working on \"Assassin's Creed II\" had increased to 450 members, and the development team's size had tripled since the first game.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, Ubisoft released a new four-minute cinematic \"Assassin's Creed II\" trailer at E3. On June 2, 2009, Ubisoft revealed the first live gameplay demo, lasting 6 minutes, at the Sony Press Conference. GameTrailers features an exclusive developer walkthrough from E3 2009. In an interview with GameTrailers Ubisoft Montreal creative director Patrice Desilets stated Desmond would be doing more than walking around and discovering clues.\n\nIt was announced at the \"Assassin's Creed\" panel at Comic Con 2009 that a mini-series of three episodes, \"\", would be released showing the events leading up to the game and the history of Ezio and his father Giovanni.\n\nIt was also revealed that the humorist Danny Wallace would be voicing a new character in \"Assassin's Creed II\": Shaun Hastings, a sarcastic historian assisting Desmond. The character's face would also be modeled after him. Actress Kristen Bell returned for the character of Lucy Stillman.\n\nThe game was originally due to be released at the same time on all three platforms, but Ubisoft announced on September 24, 2009 that the PC version would be delayed to the first quarter of 2010 in order to have \"a bit more time for the dev team to deliver the best quality game.\"\n\nOn December 1, 2009, Ubisoft announced the first of several downloadable content (DLC) expansions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of \"Assassin's Creed II\". The first, titled \"The Battle of Forlì\", continues the story of Caterina Sforza, and was released on January 28, 2010. It also includes a special memory that allows users to pilot Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine over Forlì. The second expansion, titled \"Bonfire of the Vanities\", concerns the mass burning of sinful objects in Florence and was released on February 18, 2010. These were both initially planned to be included as part of the main game, but were later cut due to time constraints; this issue was written into the game's story as the Animus corrupting several memory sequences. Both the retail and digital releases of the Deluxe PC version include these DLC packages as part of the main storyline.\n\nUbisoft's Uplay system enables further in-game enhancements which can be redeemed by points that are given when playing the game. The available awards are an \"Assassin's Creed II\" theme or wallpaper for PC and PlayStation 3, 5 additional throwing knives, Altaïr outfit and the Uplay exclusive Auditore Family Crypt map.\n\nThe two downloadable content packs feature the corrupted memory sequences, which Rebecca is able to repair with a computer patch. Sequence 12, \"Forlì Under Attack\" (released as \"The Battle of Forlì\") is set in 1488, just after Ezio has recovered the Apple of Eden. Machiavelli, Mario Auditore, Ezio and da Vinci meet to discuss what to do to protect the Apple, and it is decided that it will be sent to Romagna, to be defended by Caterina Sforza. When Ezio arrives however, he finds that the city is under attack from the Orsi Brothers, who have been hired by Borgia to take a map featuring the locations of the Codex pages, made by Sforza's late husband. In an attempt to force Sforza to hand over the map, the brothers kidnap her children. Ezio leaves the Apple in Sforza's protection; he rescues her children and kills one Orsi brother. When he returns, he discovers that Checco, the other brother, used the distraction to steal the Apple. Ezio gives chase, and kills Checco. As he stands over Checco's body, Checco stabs Ezio. Ezio falls to the floor bleeding, and before he passes out, he sees a man missing a finger and wearing monastic robes take the Apple.\n\nEzio wakes up with Sforza at his side. He sets out to reclaim the Apple, and Sforza gives him the map of the Codex page locations. He travels to a monastery in the wetlands, where he is sent to Forlì's monastery. He attempts to speak to the abbot, but the abbot recognizes him as the Assassin who killed Stefano de Bagnone (one of the Pazzi conspirators) and flees. When Ezio catches him, the abbot names the monk who stole the Apple as Girolamo Savonarola.\n\nThe Pack also includes a bonus memory in which Ezio can pilot Leonardo's Flying Machine over the Forlì area. Unlike regular memories, the player is able to play this memory an unlimited number of times.\n\nSequence 13 begins in 1497, two years prior to Sequence 14 and nine years after Sequence 12, after the events of . Ezio has tracked Savonarola to Florence, where the player can now explore the southern district of the city. After meeting with Machiavelli, Ezio devises that bringing unrest to the city will force Savonarola to come out and settle the unrest. In order to bring about this unrest, Ezio assassinates nine of Savonarola's lieutenants who preach within the city. The people become angry and a mob forms outside the plaza, where Savonarola preaches to the mob to disperse. He exposes the Apple to bewitch the mob, but Ezio quickly throws a knife at the Piece of Eden and Savonarola drops it. The mob proceeds to take the monk away, but a Templar courier quickly rushes in to retrieve the Apple; Ezio rushes after the guard and reclaims it. Afterward, the mob takes Savonarola to the Piazza della Signoria to burn him at the stake, but Ezio, believing no one deserves such a painful fate, jumps onto a wooden platform, leaps at Savanarola, and stabs the monk with his hidden blade to spare him the pain. Ezio stands before the confused crowd and declares that all should follow their own path, as he was taught by his mentors.\n\nThese three dungeons, platforming puzzles, similar to the game's Assassin's Tombs but without special rewards other than treasure, were originally included in the \"Assassin's Creed II: Black Edition\" (European and Australian release), with one included in the \"White Edition\" and two in the North American \"Master Assassin's Edition\". Ubisoft subsequently offered them as DLC via PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. They have since been included in \"Assassin's Creed II: Deluxe Edition\" and \"Game of the Year Edition\".\n\nThis costume (dye) is unlocked by entering a code obtained after buying the \"Assassin's Creed II\" 3D mobile game from the Verizon App Store. Also this bonus skin is included in the \"Game of the Year Edition\", \"The Complete Edition\" and \"Digital Deluxe Edition\".\n\nThe score to \"Assassin's Creed II\" was composed by Jesper Kyd. It was recorded at Capitol Records with a 35-piece string ensemble and 13-person choir, with featured vocals by Melissa Kaplan. A soundtrack was released via download on November 16, 2009. 14 tracks of the soundtrack were also released on the game disc available with the special pre-order Black edition of \"Assassin's Creed II\".\n\nIn the marketing, \"Genesis\" by Justice was used in the \"Visions of Venice\" trailer.\n\nOn October 20, 2009, Ubisoft announced a series of short films, to be broadcast via YouTube, that would provide additional back story and the introduction of some of the characters found in the game. The shorts, collectively called \"\", came in three parts and were developed by Ubisoft's Hybride Technologies, who previously worked on the films \"300\" and \"Sin City\". The series focused on Ezio's father, Giovanni Auditore, and contained live-action and computer-generated imagery. The first of the films was released on October 27, 2009, with the remaining two released on November 13, 2009.\n\nOn November 12, 2009, Ubisoft released \"Assassin's Creed II\" themed virtual items on PlayStation Home to promote the release of the game, as well as the game \"\" for PSP. \"Assassin's Creed II\" virtual items and an Ezio costume were also released on the Xbox Live Marketplace for the Xbox 360's avatars. On November 19, 2009, more \"Assassin's Creed II\" virtual items were released in PlayStation Home, along with a costume for Ezio, which was released on November 26, 2009, in which the player could obtain and roam PlayStation Home in it. On December 3, 2009, more 15th century Italian renaissance themed items were released in Home.\nEzio's \"Purple Assassin\" costume is available to download on \"LittleBigPlanet\", as of December 8, 2009, on the PlayStation Network.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed II\" is the first game to be linked to Ubisoft's Uplay feature. Progression through the game allows Uplay members to acquire points that can be redeemed for bonuses for use in the game, including a new crypt to explore and an Altaïr costume.\n\nA novel based on the game, \"Assassin's Creed: Renaissance\" (by Oliver Bowden), was published by Penguin Books in November 2009.\n\nThere are several different limited editions of \"Assassin's Creed II\". The \"Black Edition\" contains an Ezio figurine garbed in a black outfit and was released in Europe and Australia. Included also are three bonus areas and missions, an art book, a DVD with part of the game's soundtrack, one premium PS3/Xbox 360 theme, behind the scenes videos, and 2 desktop wallpapers. The \"White Edition\" contains one bonus area/mission and an Ezio figurine in his white outfit. The \"Master Assassin's Edition\" is the North American limited edition, which contains an Ezio figurine, two bonus areas, an art book and a Blu-ray with music and behind the scenes videos.\n\nAfter much complaining from \"Assassin's Creed II\" fans that they were unable to complete the game due to the need to complete the three Templar Lairs (only available on the \"White\" or \"Black Editions\") to earn 100% synchronisation, Ubisoft released \"Assassin's Creed II: The Complete Edition\". Included in the package are download codes for the two DLCs, \"Battle of Forlì\" and \"Bonfire of the Vanities\" and the three Templar Lairs. Later \"Assassin's Creed II: The Game of the Year Edition\" was released, containing the extra content incorporated on the game disc. Both versions also have the Bonus Skin, however, it needs to be unlocked through the game code.\n\nEventually \"Assassin's Creed II: Digital Deluxe Edition\" was also released, containing the three bonus areas & missions and the downloadable content \"Battle of Forlì\" and \"Bonfire of the Vanities\". This Edition, however, is only available via Digital Download. Assassin's Creed II: Digital Deluxe Edition as of now is available only on the PlayStation 3 through PSN and PC through Steam. It also has the Bonus Dye for Ezio's outfit, albeit it is unlocked from the very beginning of the game and available for free at Monteriggioni.\n\nThe PC version of the Retail Edition or the Digital Deluxe Edition now requires a one-time online activation, after which the game, its activation key, and the Uplay Account will be bound together and the game can be played offline, even with the Uplay Launcher forced to run in Offline Mode in the Settings Menu. Even in Offline mode, users can log in into Uplay, provided they have already logged in online with a legitimate e-mail account when they started using the software for the first time.\n\nUsers already owning the Retail Edition through Steam can upgrade to the Deluxe Edition.\n\nUpon release, \"Assassin's Creed II\" received critical acclaim. Review aggregator site Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of 91 and the Xbox 360 version a 90, making it the highest-rated game in the franchise on the site.\n\nIn an exclusive review by \"Official Xbox Magazine\", \"Assassin's Creed II\" scored 9/10. Its second review was a perfect score from the \"Official PlayStation Magazine US\", while the \"Official PlayStation Magazine UK\" scored the game a 9/10.\n\nGerman magazine \"Computer Bild Spiele\" reported that the game's publishers offered to provide a pre-release copy of the game if the magazine would guarantee a review score of \"very good\". The magazine rejected the request and instead opted to delay their review.\n\nGameSpot which reviewed the PC version of the game, said despite the game being \"fun and beautiful\" it was hard to justify the higher price point. It was also mentioned that the game was hindered by Ubisoft's DRM and the game \"deserved better. For that matter, PC gamers deserved better too.\"\n\nAccording to pre-official sales estimates, Ubisoft announced that \"Assassin's Creed II\" sold 1.6 million copies worldwide during its first week of sale, representing a 32 percent increase over the first week retail performance of the original \"Assassin's Creed\". As of February 10, 2010, the game has sold 9 million copies.\n\nAt the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, \"Assassin's Creed II\" was named Best Action Adventure Game, and IGN named it as the Action Game of the Year for Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Game of the Year. Game Informer also named it as Xbox 360 Game of the Year. It also received Game of the Year from \"GamePro\", Eurogamer and \"The New York Times\". \"Assassin's Creed II\" has been nominated for the \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Visual Engineering\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Story\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction\", \"Adventure Game of the Year\" and \"Overall Game of the Year\" Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. The game was also nominated for several Game Developers Choice Awards including \"Best Game Design\", \"Best Visual Art\", \"Best Technology\", and \"Game of the Year\".\n\nThe game is included in the 2010 book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\". In December 2015, \"Game Informer\" ranked the game as the second best game in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series to date.\n\nThe PC version of the game utilizes Ubisoft's Uplay platform, which includes a digital rights management (DRM) system that initially required all users to remain connected to the Internet while playing. In the initial retail version, any progress made subsequent to the last checkpoint was lost if the Internet connection was severed. Ubisoft stated that if the disconnection was temporary, the game would pause. In addition, the company argued that there were numerous checkpoints spread throughout \"Assassin's Creed II\". The company was also criticized by overseas members of the U.S. Armed Forces, who could not play the game while in locations with sporadic and expensive connections. Ubisoft has since published a patch to finally remove the DRM: the PC version of the Retail Edition or the Digital Deluxe Edition now requires a one-time online activation, after which the game, its activation key, and the Uplay Account will be bound together and the game can be played offline, even with the Uplay Launcher logged in offline. The game can then be activated many times on the existing or new machine and still be played offline.\n\nShortly after the release of the Windows version, Ubisoft claimed that a cracked version of the game had not been created, and was confirmed by at least one website. During the following weekend, the DRM servers for \"Silent Hunter 5\" and \"Assassin's Creed II\" were, according to Ubisoft, affected by a denial-of-service attack. Ubisoft later stated that \"95 per cent of players were not affected, but a small group of players attempting to open a game session did receive denial of service errors.\" A server emulator to overcome the DRM has been developed. A cracked dynamic-link library bypassing the connection requirement entirely was released in late April.\n\nFollowing the series of server outages, Ubisoft offered owners of the Windows version all DLC from the \"Assassin's Creed II Black Edition\" (despite already having the Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities DLC incorporated into the story mode from the beginning by default), or a free copy of \"Heroes Over Europe\", \"Tom Clancy's EndWar\", \"Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X\", or \"Prince of Persia\" (2008).\n\nThe DRM was modified in December 2010. By that time the game no longer required a constant Internet connection while playing. Instead, the player had to be connected to the Internet every time the game was launched. In 2012, Ubisoft announced that they would patch the game to remove internet access as a requirement to play, and would not require internet access for DRM henceforth. It worked on the PC version. The PC version of the Retail Edition or the Digital Deluxe Edition now requires a one-time online activation, after which the game, its activation key, and the Uplay Account will be bound together and the game can be played offline, even with the Uplay Launcher forced to run in Offline Mode in the Settings Menu . The game can then be activated infinitely on the existing or a new machine if the game is ever reinstalled for some reason, and it can still be played offline. The same rule for Assassin's Creed II on PC now applies to any Ubisoft game on the PC that once required a persistent online connection. However none of these changes affected the Mac OS X version of the game which still requires a constant Internet connection and players still lose progress if the Internet connection is disrupted.\n\nDiscussions about details of \"Assassin's Creed III\" were already present before the release of \"Assassin's Creed II\", with the game staff's notion of possibly having a female descendant in England during World War II. However, co-writer Corey May has stated that the series will never take place during that period, as a major goal was to take players to settings normally unvisited in games. Ubisoft's Philippe Bergeron stated that potential settings could include England in the Middle Ages, during the era of King Arthur, and feudal Japan, the latter of which had been a \"personal favorite\" of many in the staff. However, on March 1, 2012, the setting for \"Assassin's Creed III\" was revealed to be colonial Boston during the American Revolution, starring a Native American protagonist named . This game was released at the end of October 2012.\n\nTwo \"Assassin's Creed\" games were released concurrently with \"Assassin's Creed II\": \"\" and \"\". \"Discovery\" is set during the missing chapters in \"II\" and features Ezio Auditore. A direct sequel, \"\" was released on November 16, 2010 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, continuing directly after the events of \"Assassin's Creed II\". The game once again featured Ezio Auditore da Firenze as the primary protagonist, and included a new online multiplayer mode. The game takes place primarily in Rome, the seat of power for the Borgia family and the Knights Templar. The game's primary antagonist is Cesare Borgia, Rodrigo Borgia's son.\n"}

(see B.Rust: Music Hall On Record, Gramophone 1979 p. 282 et seq.) Over 500 recordings sold in their thousands long after his early death in 1915.\n\nBorn in Melbourne, Williams tried a number of jobs before embarking on an entertainment career which led him to come to England in 1899. He became a popular entertainer in the music halls singing what were known as chorus-songs – he also appeared in pantomime.\n\nIt was in 1906 that Williams made his first recordings and from that date he recorded prolifically on cylinder and disc.\n\nIn 1910, he returned for an extended tour of his native Australia where he was greeted with wild enthusiasm. Returning to England later in that year, he continued his business relationship with songwriter Fred Godfrey. The two had what might be described as a \"song factory\" and worked in partnership (although it is believed that Godfrey did all of the song writing).\n\nThe year 1912 seemed to be the zenith of Williams' career – he appeared in the first Royal Command Performance of that year and achieved glowing reviews in the national press. Sadly this fame was not to last as Williams became ill in late 1914 and died in Hove near Brighton in March 1915, the proximate cause being \"septic prostatitis\" and consequent complications after an operation for that condition, but rumoured ultimately to be connected with \"previous social excesses.\" (Myerscough, book to CD set, 2001)\nHe is buried in Mill Lane Cemetery, Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, England.

{"id": "4491395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4491395", "title": "Bratpack (comics)", "text": "Bratpack (comics)\n\nBrat Pack is the title of a comic book limited series by Rick Veitch (self-published under the company name King Hell Press). It is a dark satire on superhero sidekicks, influenced partly by the fans' decision to kill off Batman's sidekick Jason Todd, but also built on other long-standing rumors and undercurrents in the history of the superhero genre, prominently commercialism, homosexuality, pedophilia, violence, and the fascist tendencies inherent in superheroes.\n\n\"Brat Pack\" was released as a limited series in 1990–1991.\n\nThe series opens with the villainous Dr Blasphemy calling in to a radio show, where local residents of Slumburg, Pennsylvania (the setting of the story) are venting about their dislike for the teenage super-hero/sidekick Chippy. The pink leather clad sidekick of the gay super-hero Midnight Mink is widely reviled, which leads to Dr Blasphemy challenging the host of the radio program to hold a call-in radio poll. The goal being that, if more people vote for Chippy and his fellow super-hero sidekicks to die, Dr Blasphemy will carry out the will of the people and murder them. Most of the general public, thinking the caller claiming to the villain, call in to vote for the murder of the sidekicks. Once the poll closes, Dr Blasphemy thanks the callers and announces he will carry out their will that evening. \n\nWhile Blasphemy is holding court on the radiowaves, Chippy is meeting with a local priest where he talks about the cruelty of adult heroes he and his friends sidekick for. Leaving the confessional chamber, a young altar boy named Tony notices the teen hero leave and realizes that his priest knows the heroes. Father Berkeley ignores Tony's request to meet Chippy, stating that being a teenage sidekick is a taxing job. \n\nThat evening, Chippy meets up with his fellow sidekicks (Kid Viscious, Luna, and Wild Boy); all of which bully and take turns causing physical harm to the young hero out of a belief of him being a sissy. However, their tormenting of Chippy is interrupted by the arrival of Dr Blasphemy. As he taunts the heroes, there is a sudden explosion, killing three of the heroes and horribly disfiguring Chippy (protected by an accelerated healing power given to him by Midnight Mink). Horribly maimed, Chippy opts to go into hiding as he proclaims himself free from Midnight Mink and the life of a sidekick. \n\nMidnight Mink, the racist Judge Jury, the misandrist Moon Mistress, and the drug addict King Rad meet to discuss the deaths of their sidekicks. The four heroes (known collectively as Black October) have merchandised themselves out to various corporations for vulgar profit; however their contracts state they must have teen sidekicks. They confront Father Berkeley, ordering him to procure four youths from the local community for the four to take on as the new Chippy, Luna, Kid Viscious, and Wild Boy. After they leave, Tony appears having heard everything and offers himself up to become the new Chippy. \n\nThe series then focuses on the new Luna, Wild Boy, and Kid Viscious as well as Tony's transition into becoming a super-hero: \n\nLuna II is a spoiled sweet teenage girl named Annie who refuses to have sex with her fellow male classmates, is heavily involved in her local church group, and dotes on her single father. Moon Maiden murders her father and arranges to have her adopted by Moon Maiden. \n\nKid Viscious II is a lonely rich kid named Richard raised by a widow, who spends her time traveling the globe with her much younger mother. Richard spends his time alone, with only his family's Asian housekeeper and her daughter, to keep him company. Judge Jury murders Richard's mother and frames her boyfriend for the crime, then forces Kid Viscious (who he tortures in order to break him mentally, while pumping him full of steroids and other drugs that cause him to become violent and aggressive 24-7) to murder his housekeeper's daughter when he realizes that he has feelings for the girl. \n\nWild Boy II is a Hispanic skateboarder named Carlos, whose parents run a successful local grocery store. Unlike the other members of Black October, King Rad simply allows a fire caused by arsonists to go unchecked, killing Wild Boy II's parents and siblings that way rather than murdering them himself. Carlos is then made to indulge in harsh drugs against his will by King Rad, but ultimately starts using them willingly after a search and rescue mission goes wrong and Carlos is unable to save a young boy from being torn in two. \n\nTony is raised by a single father, who spends most of his days drunk and forcing Tony to fend for himself for food and basic needs. Midnight Mink murders Tony's father in a staged robbery, then \"adopts\" Tony. \n\nAs the series progress, the four heroes systematically break their young charges mentally and physically through extensive physical abuse (Judge Jury), drug addiction (King Rad), and psychological manipulation (Midnight Mink and Moon Mistress). While they do so, they discuss the missing fifth member of the group: Overman. \n\nA being of pure energy, Overman personally trained Moon Maiden as a hero, was best friends and lovers with Midnight Mink, and who brought the wildcards Judge Jury and King Rad into his orbit to stop a war between the two and Overman and his friends, to allow them to become the sole protectors of Slumburg. \n\nHowever, Overman became jaded with humans and ultimately left the Earth. However, before he left, Overman discovered that Midnight Mink had contracted AIDS and performed a blood transfusion. The transfusion cured Midnight Mink of AIDS, but also granted him (and anyone who is exposed to his blood in transfusion form) super-human endurance to pain and injury, along with the ability (over time) to heal from any wounds inflicted upon them. When Tony proves himself a worthy replacement as Chippy after several battles, Midnight Mink performs a blood transfusion granting him the same power.\n\nBy the end, all four teen heroes are irrevocably broken mentally just like their predecessors: Richard is now a steroid addicted bully, Carlos a drug addict, Annie a completely jaded, teenage slut who performs a coat hanger abortion on herself after having sex with Richard and Carlos. Meanwhile Tony finds himself repeatedly visiting Father Berkeley, as he reveals that all three of his fellow sidekicks hate and despise him due to the fact that Midnight Mink, does not overtly abuse and mock Tony like the other heroes do. He further states that he has become irrevocably jaded with the life of a hero and the sociopathic tendencies of Midnight Mink and the other members of Black October. Midnight Mink interrupts the confession, as he reveals the full control he has over Tony by having him leave the priest to return home with him. Midnight Mink then tells Father Berkeley that the only reason he doesn't kill him/allows his various sidekicks to vent their anguish and suffering to him, is that Midnight Mink gets off on knowing that the priest can do nothing to save his sidekicks or any of the sidekicks, from the hell that is their lives as super-heroes. \n\nThe original five issue mini-series had the following ending that is only available in Brat Pack #5.\n\nAfter leaving Father Berkeley's confessional, the opening scene from the first issue plays out again with the other sidekicks attacking Tony. However, there is a loud scream from the church as the heroes storm in and find Dr Blasphemy waiting for them with a large coffin: he orders the heroes to open it (after flinging the dying remains of the original Chippy at Tony) and reveals it full of contracts and legal documents for merchandise, comics, tv shows, and movies. \n\nDr Blasphemy reveals that the kids are pawns of corporate America: they require the psychopathic heroes have teen sidekicks to make them appear wholesome and fatherly/motherly to the masses and then reveals that their partners murdered their parents, so they could ensure that they did not have to split the money from the merchandise deals. Chippy inspects one document and discovers a clause in it that chills the already jaded young man to the bone: when the sidekicks become legal age (18), the heroes must then start splitting the proceeds from their lucrative merchandise/media deals with their sidekicks. Chippy then realizes that Midnight Mink, Judge Jury, King Rad, and Moon Mistress were responsible for the bomb blast that killed their sidekicks, all of whom were on the verge of turning 18 years old. However, before they can do anything a bomb is dropped on the church by a plane flown by Midnight Mink and Black October. \n\nStorming the bombed out remains the church, Father Berkeley (about to hang himself in the bell tower), finds a bag and a note telling him to open it. Inside, he finds Dr Blasphemy's hood which he puts on as he hangs himself. The Black October go to the bell tower and find him hanging, but quickly realize that he's doesn't have the full costume of their enemy. Suddenly the electrical storm reaches its peak as Over Man returns at long last. The hero murders his former friends and teammates by trapping them under the church bell which he melts on top of them, as King Rad tries desperately to reach out to his faithful butler (who also served as a servant for Black October) for help. Final shot shows the church in ruins as the radio station from the start of the story, declaring a state of emergency and everyone to stay indoors until the lightning storm is over.\n\nWhen the series was released as a trade paperback, Veitch redid the entire ending from scratch for the series. \n\nAfter Midnight Mink's confrontation with Father Berkeley, Tony encounters the original Chippy outside the church; his injuries too severe for his healin factor to fix, he finally dies but gives Chippy his mask before he passes. Meanwhile, after being told that Midnight Mink allows his sidekicks to confess the abuse they endure at the hands of the heroes because he knows the priest can do nothing to save the young teens from the abuse, Father Berkeley pulls out a gun and shoots Mink. Chippy responds by rescuing the hero and overseeing his recovery; going so far as to perform a blood transfusion, so his own healing factor can help speed up Mink's healing process. \n\nAfterwards, the sidekicks are forced to attend a convention where they sign autographs and meet their fans. An overtly angry fan of the original Chippy mortally wounds Tony, revealing his healing factor power to the other teen sidekicks. Once he has healed up, they lure him to the alley behind the church where, like their predecessors, they take turns tormenting and brutalizing Chippy to force him to give up the secret of his healing powers. The torture is interrupted when Dr Blasphemy appears and lures the teens inside. A coffin is then presented to them, claiming to hold death and a secret. While Richard, Annie, and Carlo all proclaim that they hope it is their mentors, Tony realizes the truth. He reveals that the coffin is a bomb and quickly disarms it before opening it up to show the explosives inside. Annie, Carlos, and Richard realize they know their heroes have access to bomb-making equipment and realize that their mentors want to kill them, just like they killed the previous sidekicks they replaced. Bleeding from the beating, Tony grabs a nearby sacrament cup and fills it with his blood, so they can share in his healing factor. He then states the truth: the original sidekicks were murdered simply because Blood October and its members could do it. Pointing out how utterly corrupt and evil they were, Tony warns that they need to either flee town or prepare for a final showdown with their mentors. At which point, from his plane, Midnight Minx drops a bomb on the church. \n\nThe rest of the ending plays out as it did in the original book: Black October go into the church, where they find Father Berkeley having hung himself while wearing a Dr Blasphemy mask. Overman then appears to kill his former teammates, but due to the blood they consumed, the teen sidekicks watch with glee as they reveal that Overman is upset with the utter corruption and evil of his former friends as he executes them for their crimes. However, before the comic ends with the shot of the ruined church and the radio calling for citizens to stay indoors, it is revealed that Dr Blasphemy was Fredo, butler and major domo for King Rad and Black October.\n\nThe main characters of \"Brat Pack\" are:\n\n\"Brat Pack\" is Rick Veitch/King Hell's top-selling title, with the fourth edition selling out in late 2007.

Burkina's contribution to African cinema started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969 and gained government support and permanent structures in 1972. It is the largest film exhibition venue in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than half a million attendees, and takes place in odd numbered years in March. Burkina is also one of the countries producing the most feature films in Africa. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes. For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Thomas Sankara In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagaoudougou. Between 1977 and 1987 Burkina Faso housed a regional film school, Institut d'Education Cinématographique de Ouagadougou (INAFEC), which was instigated by FEPACI and funded in part by UNESCO. But eighty percent of its funding came from the government of Burkina Faso; no other African country participated in its funding and few sent students.\n\nIn the late 1990s, local private production companies began to proliferate and digital production became increasingly prevalent. By 2002 over twenty-five small production companies existed in the country, many pooling their resources and expertise in order to produce. The best known directors from Burkina Faso are: Mamadou Djim Kola, Gaston Kaboré, Kollo Daniel Sanou, Paul Zoumbara, Emmanuel Kalifa Sanon, Pierre S. Yameogo, Idrissa Ouedraogo, Drissa Toure, Dani Kouyaté, and Régina Fanta Nacro. Burkina also produces popular television series such as Bobodjiouf. The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate make also popular television series.\n\nMany films shot in Burkina Faso by local directors have found distribution in Francophone Europe and several have received assistance from the French Ministry of Co-operation. However, while these films have won awards in Europe and are regularly featured in African Studies courses, in Africa itself they are little known outside of academic circles.\n\nBurkina Faso hosts the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) every two years in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital.\n\nIn 2005, director Gaston Kaboré, who won the top prize at FESPACO in 1997 for his film \"Buud Yam\", opened a training school for new filmmakers in Ouagadougou. The school, named Imagine, was built with millions of CFA of Kaboré's own money and opened its doors for the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou 2005.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10983938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10983938", "title": "Cinema of Lebanon", "text": "Cinema of Lebanon\n\nThe cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian Roy Armes, is the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema. Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced more than 500 films.\n\nWhile there has been steady increase in film production since the end of the Lebanese Civil War, the number of films produced each year remains relatively small in comparison to what it used to be in the 1960s, and the industry remains heavily dependent on foreign funding, mainly European. The industry also remains reliant on international box office revenues due to the limited size of the domestic market.\n\nDespite that, local films have enjoyed a degree of local and international success. Ziad Doueiry's \"The Insult\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Nadine Labaki's three features have been screened at the Cannes Film Festival, starting with \"Caramel\" in the Directors’ Fortnight. Her second feature \"Where Do We Go Now?\" was screened in Un Certain Regard and later won the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival while her third feature, \"Capernaum\", was nominated for a Palme D'Or.\n\nCinemas existed in Lebanon since the early 1920s, and a sharp increase in the number of theaters was observed between 1923-1929. By the end of the 1920s, cinemas were common in Beirut, and some were used as a place for political gatherings. For example, in 1925, the Communist Party met at the Crystal Cinema in Beirut. Cinemas had become so popular that in 1931, students marched in a protest, demanding that prices of movie tickets be lowered. To compete against Hollywood, France decreed that all American films that were being imported to Lebanon be dubbed into French.\n\nThe first local film, \"The Adventures of Elias Mabruk\", was made in 1929. It was a silent film, directed by Jordano Pidutti. Pidutti was an Italian immigrant who worked as a chauffeur for the Sursock family before devoting his life to film. His first film, \"The Adventures of Elias Mabruk\" tells the story of a Lebanese emigrant who returns to Lebanon after a long absence in America in search of his family. This tale of an emigrant's homecoming, captured nostalgic feelings in a country of emigrants and would become a recurrent theme in Lebanese cinema. Jordano Pidutti's second film was \"The Adventures of Abu Abed\". The comedy is considered the first film made with Lebanese funding. The financier was Rachid Ali Chaaban, who was also the star of the film.\n\nLebanese women, like Assia Dagher and Mary Queeny, played pioneering roles in Egyptian cinema. In Lebanon, Herta Gargour, who managed the film studio, Luminar Films, is credited with establishing filmmaking in Lebanon after the silent era. \"In the Ruins of Baalbeck\" (1936), which was produced by Luminar Films, was the first sound film. It was a hit with audiences and profitable. The film, which was directed by Julio De Luca and Karam Boustany, depicted the love story of a local prince who falls in love with a foreigner. The film is considered the first Arab film produced entirely in an Arab country and featuring the Lebanese dialect.\n\nAli Al-Ariss became the first Lebanese-born to direct a film on his own when he made \"The Rose Seller\" in 1940, which was followed by \"Planet of the Desert Princess\"\n\nDocumentaries were also being made during this period, but they were heavily censored by the French.\n\nAfter Lebanon gained its independence from France, filmmakers began to examine local themes, especially rural life and folklore. During the post-independence period, Lebanon witnessed an economic boom that made its capital, Beirut, the financial center of the eastern Mediterranean. Lebanon's economic success, along with the presence of 38 banks and its open, multi-cultural and liberal society, made the country an alternative production choice to Egypt, which was at the time the center of filmmaking in the Arabic-speaking world. Additionally, \"Lebanon had the region's best technical facilities\" for film production. Fully equipped studios were set up in 1952, such as Haroun Studio owned by Michel Haroun and Al-Arz Studio\n\nFor the first half of the twentieth century, Lebanese cinema was very closely associated with Egyptian cinema. In addition to exporting numerous Lebanese actors and actresses, such as Nour Al Hoda and Sabah, belly dancers like Badia Massabni and producers like Assia Dagher, Lebanese distributors monopolized export of Egyptian film from 1930s – 1970s.\n\nThe first Lebanese film to be featured In Selection at Cannes Film Festival was Georges Nasser's \"Ila Ayn?\" in 1958. Despite its success abroad and having been screened at numerous film festivals, such as in Moscow and Beijing, the movie theaters in Lebanon hesitated to screen the film, and it only received a limited screening in Cinema Opera. For its sixty-year anniversary, the film was screened again in its restored print version as part of the Cannes Classics events in 2017. George Nasser's work has been more appreciated in recent years, and the filmmaker, who teaches at the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts has been showered with accolades, including at the Tripoli Film Festival, which was held in his honor in 2017.\n\nCo-productions with Egypt and Syria were common in this period, which was considered the \"Golden Age\" of the Lebanese film industry. Additionally, Lebanese producers from 1945 up to 1951 played an influential role in the first stages of production of Iraqi cinema.\n\nThe film industry continued to prosper in the 1960s. After Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the film industry in Egypt in 1963, many private producers, distributors and directors, including Youssef Chahine, moved to Lebanon. The migration of film production to Beirut ushered a Golden Age, making Lebanon the film set for almost all Egyptian movies and establishing the Lebanese film industry as the second largest in the Arab world. Beirut rivaled Cairo’s dominance of Arab filmmaking, and even briefly replaced it as the center for Arab filmmaking; however, films produced in the sixties, for the most part, lacked a sense of national identity and were merely commercial films, targeting a pan-Arab audience. For instance, Lebanese filmmaker, Mohammed Selmane made a series of Bedouin-themed films, like \"Bedouin in Paris\" (1964) and \"Bedouin in Rome\" (1965), both starring Samira Tewfik and targeting not only local but also Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Gulf audiences. Mohamed Selmane, who was trained in Egypt and returned to Lebanon to make 30 films in 25 years, was one of the most successful directors of this period.\n\nThe musicals of the Rahbani Brothers that starred Fairuz were an exception to the films that lacked a national identity. The Rahbani films were centered around nostalgic themes of life in Mount Lebanon villages. Nostalgia was a common theme in Lebanese film since 1929. While many films in the sixties were filmed in the Egyptian vernacular to cater to the large Egyptian market, the Rahbani films were filmed in the Lebanese dialect. \"The Seller of Rings\" (1965), set in a Maronite village and displaying folkloristic elements, was an adaption of one of their operettas to the screen. Another Rahbani film, \"Safar Barlik\", which was set in 1912, depicted Lebanon's struggle against the Ottoman occupation. The film became a staple rerun on Lebanese television, especially on Independence Day.\n\nThere were other exceptions like the auteur films of George Nasser and Youssef Maalouf. Georges Nasser's second feature, \"The Small Stranger\" was also selected for Cannes in 1962. Youssef Maalouf adapted to film Kahlil Gibran's novel, \"The Broken Wings\" in 1962. Prints of the film \"The Broken Wings\" were believed to have been destroyed during the war, but one was found after the war stored in a church, and the film, starring stage actress Nidal Al-Askhar, was restored.\n\nLebanon was also a filming location for international productions. For example, in 1965, Val Guest's \"Where the Spies Are\", starring David Niven and Françoise Dorléac, was filmed in Beirut. \"Twenty-Four Hours to Kill\", starring Mickey Rooney, and \"Secret Agent Fireball\", starring Richard Harrison, were also filmed in Beirut the same year. The following year in 1966, the German director, Manfred R. Köhler, filmed his film, \"\". George Lautner's \"La grande sauterelle\" was also filmed in Beirut in 1967. \"Rebus\", starring Ann-Margret was filmed on location at the Casino du Liban in 1969. While \"Honeybaby, Honeybaby\" was shot in 1974 in Beirut, the producers of \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", which was partially set in Beirut, decided not to film in the Lebanese capital due to the burgeoning political problems.\n\nIn 1965, UNESCO established the Arab Cinema Liaison Center at the National Cinema Center in Beirut as a regional hub for linking cinema activities across the Arab world. Beirut hosted the first international film festival in the Arab world in 1971. Until the mid-1970s, the film industry in Lebanon was flourishing with market appeal that extended to neighboring Arabic-speaking countries. Lebanon was producing \"a string of sexually indulgent films\" such as \"Cats of Hamra Street\" and \"The Guitar of Love\" in 1973, starring Georgina Rizk, the Lebanese beauty queen who won Miss Universe in 1971. In the 1970s, cinema attendance in Lebanon was the highest among Arabic-speaking countries.\n\nHeiny Srour became not only the first Lebanese and Arab woman to have her film in competition at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, but her documentary film \"The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived\" was actually the first film by any female filmmaker to be screened at the festival.\n\nPrior to the civil war, 161 films, mostly commercial melodramas, were produced in Lebanon and exported to various Arab countries, but when the civil war began, film production decreased tremendously.\n\nDespite the war, there was an \"emergence of a new wave of Lebanese filmmakers – fostering, unusually, equal numbers of women and men\". The female filmmakers, who emerged during this period, made highly acclaimed and internationally renowned films. Some of the filmmakers who emerged during this period were \"Maroun Baghdadi, Jocelyne Saab, Borhane Alaouié, Heiny Srour, Randa Chahal Sabag\" and Jean Chamoun. In the 1970s, film themes in Lebanon were concentrated around the political conflicts that the country was undergoing. Displacement was also a recurrent theme as evident in Borhane Alaouie's \"Beirut, the Encounter\" (1981). Films of this period were characterized by a lack of closure, reflective of the seemingly endless war at the time.\n\nOne of the most important directors to emerge during this period was Maroun Baghdadi. According to Lina Khatib, author of \"Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond\", Baghdadi's films were \"considered the cornerstone of Lebanese cinema\". Maroun Baghdadi made \"Little Wars\" (1982) with aid provided by the American filmmaker, Francis Coppola. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. The film also screened at New York Film Festival on 2 October 1982.\n\nDocumentaries by filmmakers like Jocelyne Saab who \"adopted a mainly journalistic style\" also developed rapidly and successfully during this period. Lebanese and Palestinian documentaries produced in Lebanon during the 1970s caused a surge of documentary production across the Arab world. These documentaries contributed to the development of feature film production in the early eighties.\n\nMany filmmakers from this era, such as Jocelyne Saab, Jean Chamoun, Randa Chahal Sabbag, and Maroun Baghdadi settled in France due to the prolonged conflict in Lebanon.\n\n\"\" is a 1987 documentary film that was directed by Jennifer Fox and shot on location at the historic Bustros mansion in Beirut. The documentary, which told the story of one of Lebanon’s wealthiest families, was awarded the Excellence In Cinematography Award and won the Grand Jury Prize Documentary at the 1988 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nDespite the war, Lebanon submitted a film for the first time for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film when \"Promise of Love\" (1978) an Armenian-language film by Sarky Mouradian was submitted to the 51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nIn addition to the wave of festival films and documentaries, a series of commercial films, mostly mimicking action B movies from Hollywood, were made in the early 1980s. Prominent directors such as Youssef Charafeddine and Samir El-Ghoussaini aspired for escapism in their films to take their audiences out of the context of the war. Films such as \"The Last Passage\" (1981), \"The Decision\" (1981), and \"The Leap of Death\" (1982) were popular because they depicted a society free of war where law and order actually existed. Other commercial films, like \"Ghazl Al-Banat\", incorporated the war in the narrative. The era of commercial film production ended with the Israeli war on Lebanon.\n\nAfter the war, Beirut reemerged as one of the centers of mass media production in the Arab world. While media production was concentrated around television, there were attempts to revive the film industry in Lebanon, especially by fresh graduates of Lebanese film schools. While filmmaking schools are a rarity in the region, by the mid-1990s, six of Beirut's universities were offering degrees in cinema and television and that attracted an influx of students from Arab countries who chose to receive some or all of their media training in Lebanon. Financing of film production in Lebanon in this period was mainly dependent on foreign support, both European and from the Lebanese diaspora.\n\nThe civil war was a major theme for Lebanese filmmakers since 1975, and this trend continued in the early post-war era where films continued to be affected thematically by the war. Films made after the war had a common theme of returning to the war setting and dealing with trauma common to post-conflict societies.\n\nMany films, such as Jocelyne Saab's experimental film, \"Once Upon a Time in Beirut\", examined the destruction that was left after the war. Maroun Baghdadi's Beyrouth \"Hors la Vie\" won the Special Jury Prize at Canned in 1991. Other's like Jean-Claude Codsi's \"Histoire d'un retoure\" examined the issue of returning to the country after years of exile and war. In 1994, Codsi's film won the jury award at the \"Festival international du film Francophone\" de Namur in Belgium.\n\nIn 1997, Youssef Chahine's French-produced film, \"Destiny\", was shot on location in Lebanon, including the historic mountain town of in Beiteddine.\n\nWhile many films produced in the 1990s were hits at international festivals, Lebanese viewers were not drawn to the mainly war-themed films. An exception was \"West Beirut (film)\" (1998), which was a local and an international hit. It was not only the first Lebanese film, but also the first Arabic-language film to have general release in America. The film, that received worldwide attention, was the first Lebanese film that the post-war generation in Lebanon actually saw in cinemas, and it ushered a new era in Lebanese filmmaking that historian, Lina Khatib calls a renaissance.\n\nA mélange of local issues and Western aesthetics characterized this period of Lebanese filmmaking. Films in this period gained domestic appeal where many films were not only commercially successful as evident in box-office sales of \"Bosta\", \"Caramel\", \"Stray Bullet\", and \"Where Do We Go Now?\" but also were able to compete with imported, American films. Funding of films remained reliant on European organizations, such as \"Fonds Sud Cinéma\" in France and \"Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie\". Philippe Aractingi's \"Bosta (film)\" is one of the few films that was completely funded locally.\n\nGhassan Salhab's \"Terra Incognito\" (2002) screened in Un Certain Regard in Cannes. In 2003, Randa Chahal's \"The Kite\" examined the issue of families separated due to the occupied territories in southern Lebanon. Her film won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nAlso in 2003, Georges Schoucair returned to Lebanon after studying film in France and established Abbout Productions, the country's first post-war production house, which has become Lebanon's \"foremost production house and one of the most prominent companies for art-house films in the region\".\n\nBy 2004, film production was on the increase with four fiction and two documentaries produced. Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige’s \"The Perfect Day\" (2005) examined the social implications of political kidnappings that happened during the war. Ghassan Salhab's \"The Last Man\" (2006) represented the cultural memory of the war from the eyes of a vampire protagonist caught in limbo between life and death. \"Zozo\" (2005) by Josef Fares follows the life of a young boy and his journey to flee the war to Sweden. New themes that did not necessary deal with the issue of war emerged, like Danielle Arbid’s \"In the Battlefields\" (2005) that critiqued patriarchal society. Filmmakers began to examine the postwar context rather than living in or surviving the war. Michel Kammoun's \"Falafel\" (2005) about disillusioned youth in post-war Beirut premiered in 2006 at Cinema Days of Beirut, a festival which was not cancelled despite the Israeli bombardment of the capital as a sign of \"cultural resistance\". « ring of fire » Zenar el nar by Bahij Hojeij in 2004 \n\nShort film production, especially by the graduates of the film schools in Lebanon, was also on the increase and receiving local and international attention. Hany Tamba's \"After Shave\" won the César Award for best short film in 2006.\n\n2007 was an important year for Lebanese filmmaking when two female directors, Nadine Labaki and Danielle Arbid presented their films at the Cannes Film Festival. Labaki presented \"Caramel\" while Arbid presented \"A Lost Man\". \"A Lost Man\" is possibly the most sexually graphic film ever made by an Arab director. \"Caramel\" enjoyed an international release, including in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Argentina.\n\nAccording to research conducted by Fondation Liban Cinema, \"The film industry in Lebanon has seen a significant growth over the last four years, with 31 movies produced in 2014,\ncompared to just four a decade ago.\". Ghassan Salhab's \"The Mountain\", which was produced by Abbout Productions, had its international premiere during the Doha-Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nIn 2010, 11 films were produced in Lebanon. Muriel Abourouss won the best director of photography award for Georges Hachem's \"Stray Bullet\" at the \"Festival international du film Francophone\" de Namur in Belgium. Vatche Boulghourjian filmed on location in Bourj Hammoud, \"The Fifth Column\" a short film in Western Armenian dialect that won the third place Cinéfondation Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"Ok, Enough, Goodbye\" by Rania Attieh and Daniel Garcia was shot on location in Tripoli, Lebanon in 2010. The film tied with Delphine and Muriel Coulin's \"Ragazze\" for the Special Jury Award ex-aequo at the Torino Film Festival in 2011.\n\nAlso in 2010, \"Carlos\", a Canal+ production that starred Édgar Ramírez as well as a handful of Lebanese stars such as Razane Jammal, Rodney El Haddad, Antoine Balabane, Ahmad Kaabour, Talal El-Jordi and Badih Abou Chakra was shot on location in Lebanon. \"Carlos\", which screened out of competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival won the 2010 Golden Globe award for the Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television.\n\nIncrease in film production was evident in 2011 with 24 movies produced. Nadine Labaki's \"Where Do We Go Now?\" won the Prix Francois Chalais at Cannes. The film also won the people's choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as the audience award at the Films from the South Festival in Oslo, Norway. Sony Pictures Classics acquired the American rights to the film. The film was Lebanon's choice to compete in the Academy Award's \"Best Foreign-Language Film\" category. The film also won the Byarad d'Or at the \"Festival international du film Francophone\" de Namur in Belgium and the Doha Tribeca Film Festival's Best Narrative Film award.\n\n\"Circumstance\", a film by Maryam Keshavarz that explored homosexuality in modern Iran, was filmed entirely on location in Beirut.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, the city of Beirut participated in the 48 Hour Film Project for the first time where 24 teams competed. Cyril Aris won the Best Film category for his short, \"Anoesis,\" which will be Beirut's entry in Filmapalooza 2012, the final festival for the 2011 48 Hour Film Project.\n\nDanielle Arbid's filmed her third feature, \"Beirut Hotel\", which had a world premiere at the 64th Locarno Film Festival in August 2011.\n\nMounir Maasri's \"Rue Huvelin\", which was set in 1990, told the story of seven Saint Joseph University students from Beirut's Rue Huvelin during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Né à Beyrouth produced the film.\n\nJean-Claude Codsi filmed his second feature, \"A Man of Honor\", which was produced by Michel Ghosn and premiered at the Doha Tribeca Film Festival on 28 October 2011.\n\n\"Beirut Kamikaze\", an Experimental/Documentary by Christophe Karabache was released in cinema (Paris) on 16 November 2011.\n\nAlso in 2011, Celine Abiad's Beiroots Productions presented a different perspective of Mediterranean filmmaking by producing and experimental surrealist film (5.1 Dolby surround), shot in 35mm and fully produced in Lebanon: \"A Play Entitled Sehnsucht\", written and directed by Badran Roy Badran. The film was picked up for international distribution at Cannes, by Albany Films International, a company dedicated to the promotion of art house and indie films from gifted and promising directors.\n\nDocumentary filmmaking was also present in 2011. Rania Stephan won \"Best Documentary Filmmaker\" at the Doha Tribeca Film Festival for \"The Three Disappearances of Soad Hosny\". \"It's All in Lebanon\", a documentary film directed by Wissam Charaf and produced by Né à Beyrouth Production, premiered at DIFF in 2011. Hady Zaccak’s Marcedes screened at the Marché du Film. It received several awards, including Best Documentary at the International Federation of Film Critics at the Dubai International Film Festival and the Al-Jazeera Documentary Channel Award for Best Long Film at Al-Jazeera International Documentary Festival.\n\nThirteen feature and short films were premiered at DIFF in 2011, including Danielle Arbid's \"Beirut Hotel\", Youcef Joe Bou Eid's \"Tannoura Maxi\", Daniel Joseph's \"Taxi Ballad\", Simon El Habre's \"Gate #5\", Hady Zaccak's \"Marcedes\", Rami Nihawi's \"Yamo\", Christina Foerch Saab's \"Che Guevara Died in Lebanon\", Tamara Stepanyan's \"19 February\", Wajdi Elian's \"A Place to Go\", Rodrigue Sleiman and Tarek El Bacha's \"Nice to Meet You\", Aseel Mansour's \"Uncle Nashaat\", and Nadim Mishlawi's \"Sector Zero\".\n\nSteady increase in film production continued with 25 films produced in 2012. Lara Saba completed her second feature, \"Blind Intersections\". Despite being critically acclaimed, Ziad Doueiry's film, \"The Attack\" was banned in Lebanon because it was filmed on location in Israel. \"74, La reconstitution d'une lutte\", a docu-fiction by Raed and Rania Rafei, recreates the student occupation of the American University in Beirut 1974.\n\nThe number of films produced in 2013 were 24. Amin Dora's \"Ghadi\", which was released in late 2013, became Lebanon's entry to the Oscars's Foreign Language category and later won the KNN Award (Audience Award) at the Busan International Film Festival. Philippe Aractingi completed and released his documentary feature film, \"Heritages\".\n\nThe number of films produced in Lebanon jumped to 31 films in 2014, and this also reflected an increase in the number of production companies, including 27 focusing only on films. One of the most prominent films of the year was \"Void\", written by George Khabbaz and directed by seven different directors, all of them graduates of Notre Dame University, and the film would be selected as Lebanon's entry to compete at the Oscars in 2015. Ghassan Salhab reunited with actors Carlos Chahine and Carole Abboud in \"The Valley\", which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. \"The Valley\" was shot on 35 mm.\n\nThere were 31 produced films in 2015, growing 675% since 2004.\n\nIn 2015, Noura Kevorkian's drama-documentary hybrid feature film \"23 Kilometres\" was selected for documentary competition at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival as well as Muhr Feature Award competition at Dubai International Film Festival.\n\nTwo government initiative were passed in 2016 that benefited the film industry. The first was the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the Fondation Liban Cinema and the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon (IDAL) which added the media industry, including film production, to IDAL’s mandate of bringing investment to the country and offering incentives such as 100 percent tax exemption on corporate profits for up to 10 years. The other initiative was Banque du Liban's offering of $100 million in loan guarantees at the low interest rate of 1 percent. Banque du Liban also issued Intermediate Circular 416, which subsidizes loans of up to $3 million by banks and financial institutions to support film, television and theatrical productions\n\nIn 2016, \"Solitaire\", Sophie Boutros's first feature film, premiered at the 13th Dubai International Film Festival and Philippe Aractingi's feature film, \"Listen\" was also screened at Dubai Film Festival's Arabian Nights.\n\n\"A Maid for Each\", a documentary by Maher Abi Samra about domestic servants in Lebanon, won the Peace Film Prize at Berlin Film Festival and Post-Production Awards at Final Cut in Venice 2014.\n\nOne of the biggest hits of 2016 was the film, \"What About Tomorrow?\" a restoration of old 8mm footage of Ziad Rahbani’s 1978 play.

{"id": "11169672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11169672", "title": "Cinema of Mongolia", "text": "Cinema of Mongolia\n\nThe cinema of Mongolia has been strongly influenced by the cinema of Russia, which differentiates it from cinematic developments in the rest of Asia.\n\nIt is assumed that the first cinematographic performances in Mongolia happened between 1903 and 1913, as private events for the prince Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren and the Jebtsundamba in the capital Urga.\n\nAfter the socialist revolution, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided in its fifth congress of 1925 to use movies as an instrument of mass education. From 1926 on, mobile projection facilities would regularly show Soviet films to the Mongolian people. The first permanent cinema \"Ard\" (, \"people\") opened in the capital (now named Ulaanbaatar) in 1934. Eventually, every aimag center would have fixed cinemas, and every sums of Mongolia or negdel would have a mobile cinema. In the 1990s, many cinemas, fixed and mobile alike, closed down or reduced activities.\n\nThe national film studios, \"Mongol Kino\", were founded in 1935, with Soviet technical assistance. Their first productions were a documentary on the \"47th anniversary of the 1st May\" and a fictional story named A Mongol son (\"Mongol Khüü\") directed by the Russian Ilya Trauberg and Mongolian Demberel Baldan. The first Mongolian-directed movie was the black-and-white short feature Norjmaa's Destiny (\"Norjmaagiin Zam\") by Baldan in 1938.\n\nFrom then on, the Mongolian movie production focused around heroic revolutionary propaganda and ancient popular legends, still often under Russian direction. This program was very successful with movies like Sükhbaatar (1942) and Tsogt Taij (1945). The studios of Mongol Kino also produced documentaries and current news reports.\n\nAfter World War II, the party moved the focus on working-class heroes, reflected in movies like New Year (\"Shine Jil\", 1954) by Tseveeny Zandraa. Examples of this genre are Awakening (\"Serelt\", 1957) by S. Genden and The Rejected Girl (\"Gologdson khüükhen\") by Dendevyn Chimid-Osor. In 1955, the first musical comedy appeared, which started a trend that continued into the 1960s. The first color movie was The Golden Yurt (\"Altan Örgöö\", 1961), based on a folktale. It was produced in cooperation with the East German DEFA studios. The music of the film, written by L. Mördorj, was played and recorded by the GDR Radio orchestra and became a classic of the Mongolian symphony. As a fairy tale film, it is rich with match moving and other special effects of cinematography.\n\nWhile the production of documentaries increased, the fictional stories turned to everyday life in the 1970s. One of the most famous movies of that time, \"The Crystal Clear Tamir River\" (\"Tungalag Tamir\", 1970) by Ravjagiin Dorjpalam, based on the novel by Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba, is however set during Mongolia's 1921 revolution. Other well-known productions were \"The Legend of the Mother Oasis\" (\"Ehe Bürdiin domog\"), made in 1976 by Gombojav Jigjidsuren (Гомбожавын Жигжидсүрэн) and Jamyangiin Buntar (Жамъяангийн Бунтар), and The Five Colors of the Rainbow (\"Solongiin tavan öngö\") in 1979. The Leading Wrestler Garuda (\"Garid Magnai\", 1983) by Jamyangiin Buntar marks a turning point, where the authors liberate themselves from the existing power structures.\n\nAfter the introduction of the market economy, most mobile and permanent cinemas closed down. Mongolian productions had to seek partners outside of the former COMECON. However, some young filmmakers of the transformation period, such as N. Gankhuyag, B. Uranchimeg, J. Binder, made domestic success films.\n\nThe movie \"Genghis Khan, Under Power of the Eternal Sky\", starring Enkhtaivan Agvaantseren was the first Mongolian-Japanese co-production. State of Dogs (\"Nokhoin Oron\", 1998) was written and directed collaboratively by the Belgian Peter Brosens and the Mongolian Dorjkhandyn Turmunkh.\n\nThe director Byambasuren Davaa has had international success with the German-Mongolian co-productions The Story of the Weeping Camel (2003, nominated for an Academy Award as a foreign documentary in 2005) and The Cave of the Yellow Dog (2005).\n\nElsnii Nuudel (, \"movement of sand\"), was a successful movie produced for the domestic market in 2007. Later known films are Iim negen durlal, Goyoliin Daashinz, etc.\n\nThe 2008 historical film A Pearl in the Forest () by director Enkhtaivan Agvaantseren is one of the first films to openly talk about events of the 1930s and the impact of the rise of Soviet communism on Mongolia. It is also one of the first films intended to present the history of the Buryats, one of the ethnic groups present in Mongolia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "197877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197877", "title": "Crash test dummy", "text": "Crash test dummy\n\nA crash test dummy is a full-scale anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The Crash Test Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury of a human being in an automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over US$400,000.\n\nFor the purpose of U.S. regulation and Global Technical Regulations and for clear communication in safety and seating design, dummies carry specifically designated reference points, such as the H-point; these are also used, for example, in automotive design.\n\nCrash test dummies remain indispensable in the development of and ergonomics in all types of vehicles, from automobiles to aircraft.\n\nThere are many specialized dummies used for obesity, children, rib impact, and spinal impact. THOR is a very advanced dummy because it uses sensors and has a humanlike spine and pelvis. Special classes of dummies called Hybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or rollovers. Hybrid IIIs use dummies that directed towards a specific age, for example, a typical ten year old, six year old, three year old, and a grown man.\n\nThere are certain testing procedures for Hybrid IIIs to ensure that they obtain a correct humanlike neck flexure, and to ensure that they would react to a crash in a similar way that human bodies would. Using cadavers for these topics of research is more realistic than using a dummy for physiologic reasons, but it raises many moral dilemmas.\n\nGoing across a moral ethics line, automobile companies have used a human cadaver, a pig, and people who have volunteered to be tested upon impact. A pig was used specifically for steering wheel impact because they have an internal structure similar to humans, and can be easily placed correctly via sitting up right in the vehicle. Human cadavers along with animals are not personally able to give consent to research studies, although animal testing is not prevalent today.\n\nThere are studies that use specific cadavers including obese cadavers, and children cadavers. Also, studies show how cadavers have been used to modify different parts of a car such as the seatbelt Each new car that is made provides a different structural impact which provides the conclusion that cadavers and crash test dummies will be useful for a long time.\n\nOn August 31, 1869, Mary Ward became the first recorded victim of an automobile accident; the car involved was steam-powered (Karl Benz did not invent the gasoline-powered automobile until 1886). Ward, of Parsonstown, Ireland, was thrown out of a motor vehicle and killed. Thirty years later, on September 13, 1899, Henry Bliss became North America's first motor vehicle fatality when hit while stepping off a New York City trolley. Since then, over 20 million people worldwide have died due to motor vehicle accidents.\n\nThe need for a means of analyzing and mitigating the effects of motor vehicle accidents on humans was felt soon after commercial production of automobiles began in the late 1890s, and by the 1930s, when the automobile became a common part of daily life and the number of motor vehicle deaths were rising. Death rates had surpassed 15.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-miles and were continuing to climb.\n\nIn 1930 cars had dashboards of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against the interior of the automobile or through the windshield. The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, car manufacturers were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.\n\nDetroit's Wayne State University was the first to begin serious work on collecting data on the effects of high-speed collisions on the human body. In the late 1930s there was no reliable data on how the human body responds to the sudden, violent forces acting on it in an automobile accident. Furthermore, no effective tools existed to measure such responses.\nBiomechanics was a field barely in its infancy. It was therefore necessary to employ two types of test subjects in order to develop initial data sets.\n\nThe first test subjects were human cadavers. They were used to obtain fundamental information about the human body's ability to withstand the crushing and tearing forces typically experienced in a high-speed accident. To such an end, steel ball bearings were dropped on skulls, and bodies were dumped down unused elevator shafts onto steel plates. Cadavers fitted with crude accelerometers were strapped into automobiles and subjected to head-on collisions and vehicle rollovers.\n\nAlbert King's 1995 \"Journal of Trauma\" article, \"Humanitarian Benefits of Cadaver Research on Injury Prevention\", clearly states the value in human lives saved as a result of cadaver research. King's calculations indicate that as a result of design changes implemented up to 1987, cadaver research since saved 8,500 lives annually. He notes that for every cadaver used, each year 61 people survive due to wearing seat belts, 147 live due to air bags, and 68 survive windshield impact.\n\nHowever, work with cadavers presented almost as many problems as it resolved. Not only were there the moral and ethical issues related to working with the dead, but there were also research concerns. The majority of cadavers available were older white adults who had died non-violent deaths; they did not represent a demographic cross-section of accident victims. Deceased accident victims could not be employed because any data that might be collected from such experimental subjects would be compromised by the cadaver's previous injuries. Since no two cadavers are the same, and since any specific part of a cadaver could only be used once, it was extremely difficult to achieve reliable comparison data. In addition, child cadavers were not only difficult to obtain, but both legal and public opinion made them effectively unusable. Moreover, as crash testing became more routine, suitable cadavers became increasingly scarce. As a result, biometric data were limited in extent and skewed toward the older males.\n\nVery little attention has been paid to obesity and car crash studies, and it is hard to obtain an obese dummy for the experiment. Instead, human cadavers were used. Body weight is a vital factor when it comes to automobile accidents, and body mass is distributed differently in an obese person versus a non-obese person. At the University of Michigan, obese cadavers were tested and compared to non-obese cadavers, and they found that the obese cadavers had more injuries in their lower extremities. The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a \"cushioning effect.\" \n\nThe use of NDTs or Neutral Density Targets were implemented inside Cadavers brains to focus on the impact and separation of the brain and skull. NDTs provided detailed observations and allowed researchers to look at a specific area of the brain after the crash stimulation. It also helped to establish and develop the FE model. To measure neck injuries for three year olds, the model FE was created. A real child's neck was interpreted and incorporated into the FE model. There are only a few FE models and they were mostly utilized through sled tests.\n\nSome researchers took it upon themselves to serve as crash test dummies. Colonel John Paul Stapp USAF propelled himself over 1000 km/h on a rocket sled and stopped in 1.4 seconds. Lawrence Patrick, then a professor at Wayne State University, endured some 400 rides on a rocket sled in order to test the effects of rapid deceleration on the human body. He and his students allowed themselves to be smashed in the chest with heavy metal pendulums, impacted in the face by pneumatically driven rotary hammers, and sprayed with shattered glass to simulate window implosion. While admitting that it made him \"a little sore\", Patrick has said that the research he and his students conducted was seminal in developing mathematical models against which further research could be compared. But while data from live testing was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests which went past a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of subject.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, the bulk of the information cadaver testing could provide had been harvested. It was also necessary to collect data on accident survivability, research for which cadavers were woefully inadequate. In concert with the shortage of cadavers, this need forced researchers to seek other models. A description by Mary Roach of the \"Eighth Stapp Car Crash and Field Demonstration Conference\" shows the direction in which research had begun to move. \"We saw chimpanzees riding rocket sleds, a bear on an impact swing...We observed a pig, anesthetized and placed in a sitting position on the swing in the harness, crashed into a deep-dish steering wheel at about 10 mph.\"\n\nOne important research objective which could not be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement on the steering column. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from steering wheel impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by General Motors in the early 1960s of the collapsible steering column cut the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.\n\nThe ability to sit upright was an important requirement for test animals in order that another common fatal injury among human victims, decapitation, could be studied. Additionally, it was important for researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a dashboard with too little padding or padding which was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. Rear-view mirror impact is a significant occurrence in a frontal collision; how should a mirror be built so that it is both rigid enough to perform its task and yet of low injury risk if struck.\n\nWhile work with cadavers had aroused some opposition, primarily from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and the indignity of their situations was directly related to easing the pain of the living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.\n\nAlthough animal test data were still more easily obtained than cadaver data, the fact that animals were not people and the difficulty of employing adequate internal instrumentation limited their usefulness. Animal testing is no longer practiced by any of the major automobile makers; General Motors discontinued live testing in 1993 and other manufacturers followed suit shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1980, the use of animals such as bears and pigs were tested in car stimulation crashes. This led to moral dilemmas and was not the first time that animals were used in car crashes. In 1978, The University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute used baboons to be tested as a substitute for humans in car crashes. Although there was the objection of animal cruelty that arose, there was also the controversy of how they are similar to humans and can be used as a sufficient testing substitution for us. The researchers did not end up stopping the use of baboons because of moral objections, but instead stopped because they found sufficient data. The moral inputs from other people and organizations were inconsistent, which caused implications when deciding to ban healthy animals from research testing. The animals were put under anesthesia, so there was no pain put upon them, but the aftereffects can not justify this. The General Motors corporation used animals for testing, and also suggested that they put the animals under anesthesia and then would kill the animals after the testing is complete.\n\nAlthough the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was suggested that this is not the reason why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars. Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement. In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being. The disadvantage though to using an instrumental dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as, for an example, a live animal. Today, it is not common to see animals being tested upon for automobile accidents because of the advance in computers and technology. It is, although, difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families, especially with children. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is a competent person and one who also comprehends the research and testing procedures fully.\n\nThe information gleaned from cadaver research and animal studies had already been put to some use in the construction of human simulacra as early as 1949, when \"Sierra Sam\" was created by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) and Sierra Engineering Co. to test aircraft ejection seats, aviation helmets and pilot restraint harnesses. This testing involved the use of high acceleration to 1000 km/h (600 mph) rocket sleds, beyond the capability of human volunteers to tolerate. In the early 1950s, Alderson and Grumman produced a dummy which was used to conduct crash tests in both motor vehicles and aircraft. The original \"Sierra Sam\" was a 95th percentile male dummy (heavier and taller than 95% of human males).\n\nAlderson went on to produce what it called the VIP-50 series, built specifically for General Motors and Ford, but which was also adopted by the National Bureau of Standards. Sierra followed up with a competitor dummy, a model it called \"Sierra Stan\".\n\nGeneral Motors, who had taken over the impetus in developing a reliable and durable dummy, found neither Sierra model satisfied its needs. GM engineers decided to combine the best features of the VIP series and Sierra Stan, and so in 1971 Hybrid I was born.\nHybrid I was what is known as a \"50th percentile male\" dummy. That is to say, it modeled an average male in height, mass, and proportion. In cooperation with the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), GM shared this design, and a subsequent 5th percentile female dummy, with its competitors.\n\nSince then, considerable work has gone into creating more and more sophisticated dummies. Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation. Hybrid II became the first dummy to comply with the American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for testing of automotive lap and shoulder belts. In 1973, a 50th percentile male dummy was released, and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) undertook an agreement with General Motors to produce a model exceeding Hybrid II's performance in a number of specific areas.\n\nThough a great improvement over cadavers for standardized testing purposes, Hybrid I and Hybrid II were still very crude, and their use was limited to developing and testing seat belt designs. A dummy was needed which would allow researchers to explore injury-reduction strategies. It was this need that pushed GM researchers to develop the current Hybrid line, the Hybrid III family of crash test dummies.\n\nHybrid III, the 50th percentile male dummy which made its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, and he is now a family man. If he could stand upright, he would be 175 cm (5'9\") tall and would have a mass of 77 kg (170 lb). He occupies the driver's seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 65 km/h (40 mph) offset frontal crash tests. He is joined by a \"big brother\", the 95th percentile Hybrid III, at 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) and 100 kg (223 lb). Ms. Hybrid III is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive 152 cm (5 ft) tall and 50 kg (110 lb). The three Hybrid III child dummies represent a ten-year-old, 21 kg (47 lb) six-year-old, and a 15 kg (33 lb) three-year-old. The child models are very recent additions to the crash test dummy family; because so little hard data are available on the effects of accidents on children and such data are very difficult to obtain, these models are based in large part on estimates and approximations. The primary benefit provided by the Hybrid III is improved neck response in forward flexion and head rotation that better simulates the human.\n\nThe Hybrid III dummy for three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, and does not provide the same physical outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When using data from the real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.\n\nWIAMan is a blast test dummy designed to assess potential skeletal injuries of soldiers exposed to under-body blast (UBB). Designed jointly by the U.S. Army and Diversified Technical Systems (DTS), the project includes an anthropomorphic test device and in-dummy data acquisition and sensor solution. Since the project started in February 2015, two generations of WIAMan prototypes have undergone a series of lab tests and blast events in the field.\n\nWith the prototype’s delivery in 2018, WIAMan evaluates the effects of under-body blasts involving vehicles, and assess the risk to soldiers in ground vehicle systems. The goal of the WIAMan project is to acquire data that will improve the design of military vehicles and personal protective equipment. WIAMan and the platform created to simulate an IED explosion are undergoing continued testing.\n\nTest dummies of the past were intended for the auto industry and lacked the same response a human would have to explosions. A challenge for the Army has been to develop a crash test dummy that moves enough like a human body to get an accurate result. The Army is working to make the mannequin \"biofedelic,\" meaning it can match human movement. At 5-feet-11-inches tall and 185 lbs., WIAMan is based on the size and movement of an average soldier.\n\nU.S. Army Research Laboratory and its partners at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab completed biofidelity testing in 2017. The purpose of the testing was to develop a dummy capable of predicting specific injury risk to occupants in a vehicle during live-fire tests, based on human response data.\n\nThe manikin supports up to 146 channels of data acquisition, measuring different variables a soldier may experience in a vehicle blast. WIAMan includes self-contained internal power and the world’s smallest data acquisition system, called SLICE NANO architecture, eliminating the huge mass of sensor cables normally exiting dummies. The data measured within WIAMan includes forces, movements, accelerations and angular velocity.\n\nEvery Hybrid III undergoes calibration prior to a crash test. Its head is removed and is dropped from 40 centimetres to test calibrate the head instrumentation. Then the head and neck are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure. Hybrids wear chamois leather skin; the knees are struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture. Finally, the head and neck are attached to the body, which is attached to a test platform and struck violently in the chest by a heavy pendulum to ensure that the ribs bend and flex as they should.\n\nWhen the dummy has been determined to be ready for testing, calibration marks are fastened to the side of the head to aid researchers when slow-motion films are reviewed later. The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on either the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the ankle, record between 30 000 and 35 000 data items in a typical 100–150 millisecond crash. Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's chest, these data are downloaded to computer once the test is complete.\n\nBecause the Hybrid is a standardized data collection device, any part of a particular Hybrid type is interchangeable with any other. Not only can one dummy be tested several times, but if a part should fail, it can be replaced with a new part. A fully instrumented dummy is worth about €150,000.\n\nChildren in the three-year old age group are more likely to have a fatality because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions. A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.\n\nHybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or rollovers. After head-on collisions, the most common severe injury accident is the side impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13255982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13255982", "title": "Death Race (film)", "text": "Death Race (film)\n\nDeath Race is a 2008 science fiction action film co-produced, written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. It stars Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ian McShane and Joan Allen.\n\nThough referred to as a remake of the 1975 film \"Death Race 2000\" (based on Ib Melchior's short story \"The Racer\") in reviews and marketing materials, director Paul W. S. Anderson stated in the DVD commentary that he thought of the film as something of a prequel.\n\nA remake had been in development since 2002, though production was delayed by disapproval of early screenplays, then placed in turnaround following a dispute between Paramount Pictures and the producer duo Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner (the latter was the producer without Cruise in the film). \"Death Race\" was acquired by Universal Studios, and Anderson re-joined the project to write and direct. Filming began in Montreal in August 2007, and the completed project was released on August 22, 2008. The film received negative reviews from critics.\n\nThree direct-to-video films in the series were then released: \"Death Race 2\" (2010), \"\" (2013) and \"\" (2018).\n\nIn 2012, the collapse of the US economy and the subsequent increase in crime rates leads to the rise of privatized prisons. One such prison is Terminal Island Penitentiary, whose warden, Claire Hennessey, earns her profits by broadcasting a modern gladiator game participated in by the prisoners. In the game \"Death Race\", the racers, along with their navigators, compete in a three-part race over three days on a closed track. The track is littered with pressure plates that activate either the cars' offensive weapons, defensive equipment or deadly traps. Any racer winning five races will be granted freedom.\n\nTowards the end of one race, a masked driver nicknamed Frankenstein is nearing the finish line, pursued by his rival Machine Gun Joe. His navigator, Case, reports that all his defensive equipment have malfunctioned. Against her protest, Frankenstein refuses to let Joe finish first. Case ejects herself out of the car just before Joe destroys it (as it crosses the finish line).\n\nIndustrial worker, ex-con and former NASCAR driver Jensen Ames struggles to support his family. When the steel mill he works at is closed, he and his fellow angry workers are attacked by the arriving riot police, forcing them to fight back. He returns home to his wife and their new-born daughter, Piper. A masked assailant knocks him unconscious. Jensen wakes up with a bloodied knife in hand, his wife dead nearby, and policemen storming into his home and arresting him. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while Piper is placed in foster care.\n\nSix months later, Jensen is transferred to Terminal Island Prison. He immediately gets into a fight with Pachenko and his Aryan Brotherhood gang. Hennessey's right-hand man Ulrich calls Jensen to her office. She tells him that Frankenstein died from his injuries after the previous race, and offers to let Jensen go free if he impersonates Frankenstein to win one more race (as Frankenstein had already won four). Jensen accepts the offer and meets Frankenstein's maintenance crew consisting of Coach, Gunner, and Lists, who explain the main reason she needs Jensen is that the profits and audience of \"Death Race\" has halved since Frankenstein's \"disappearance\". They also inform him of his cars capabilities, his opponents, the navigators (and his), and that Hennessey has had an entire cell block of the prison kept away from everyone else as they have been building something big on her orders.\n\nOn Day 1, Jensen meets his navigator Case. Jensen's cars defensive equipment again mysteriously malfunctions. Under attack by Travis Colt, one of the other competitors, Jensen improvises and spills napalm over Colt's car, and has Case ignite it with the cigarette lighter. Colt's car is then run into by Machine Gun Joe's. Jensen is distracted and hit by Joe when Pachenko does the same hand gesture at him as the masked assailant (making Jensen realize it was Pachenko that killed his wife), coming in last place. Day 1 ends with three racers dead (Siad, Grimm, and Colt) and six remaining. After a conversation with Hennessey and another fight with Pachenko, Jensen deduces that Hennessey ordered Pachenko to frame Jensen, so she can have a replacement for Frankenstein.\n\nOn Day 2, the team go to the workshop to find the concealed section open with a gaping hole as they wonder what was in here. As the race begins, Jensen confronts Case about the malfunctions. Case admits she sabotaged Frankenstein's car to keep him from winning and leaving Death Race, in exchange for her release papers, but that he was only supposed to lose and that he won the last race at the cost of his life. Jensen tricks Pachenko into crashing, then leaves his car and kills Pachenko by snapping his neck. Hennessey then unleashes the Dreadnought, a newly-built heavily armed 18-wheel tanker, to thin out the racers and boost ratings. The Dreadnought kills three more racers (Carson, Riggins, and 14K), leaving only Frankenstein and Joe alive. Jensen contacts Joe and the two work together to trigger a trap which destroys the Dreadnought, much to Hennessey's shock and anger.\n\nAware that he knows her angle, Hennessey asks Jensen to consider staying and racing as Frankenstein, in exchange for a life of comfort compared to attempting to put his old life back together, but he refuses. She orders Ulrich to plant a bomb under his car in case he wins, knowing that she can always find another person to impersonate Frankenstein. Knowing Hennessey has no intention of letting him go (and figuring out that no one will ever win five races, as sooner or later they all get killed), Jensen plans an escape and talks to Joe.\n\nOn the final race, Hennessey deliberately keeps Jensen from activating his weapons and allows Joe to activate his. Jensen, Case and Joe destroy and drive through a weakened wall, discovered by examining footage of the first race, and head for the bridge to the mainland. Hennessey activates the bomb, not knowing that it was removed and neutralized by Coach. As a furious Hennessey dispatches attack helicopters, the cars wreck the pursuing police cruisers, making it to the mainland and split up, and the helicopters follow Jensen's car under Hennessey's orders. Case reveals that she had already received her release papers. She wears Frankenstein's costume, and Jensen jumps out of the car before the helicopters corner her. Case is captured while Joe and Jensen escape on a freight train.\n\nHennessey, although furious about the losses, is happy about re-capturing \"Frankenstein\" and the race's success via ratings. She opens a congratulatory present, only to find the bomb she had planted on Jensen's car. Coach, the sender, detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey and Ulrich along with the media room. He then turns to the camera and, breaking the fourth wall, states \"Damn, I love this game\".\n\nWith Hennessey and Ulrich's deaths, the future of Death Race becomes uncertain. Six months later, Joe and Jensen, reunited with Piper, are shown working in Mexico as mechanics as they escaped across the border, and are soon reunited with Case.\n\n\nIn March 2005, following the success of \"Alien vs. Predator\" (2004), director Paul W. S. Anderson revealed that he was directing a remake of \"Death Race 2000\" (1975) entitled \"Death Race 3000\" at Paramount Pictures based on a script by J. F. Lawton. The remake would be produced by the producer pair Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. Anderson described the remake as a riff on the first film. \"It's not a straight remake at all. The first movie was an across-America race. This will be an around-the-world race. And it's set further in the future, so the cars are even more futuristic. So you've got cars with rockets, machine guns, force fields; cars that can split apart and re-form, a bit like Transformers. Cars that become invisible,\" the director explained. Comingsoon.net reported that \"Paul saw his film almost as a prequel if anything; almost the genesis of the Death Race\", though the film is referred to primarily as a remake in reviews and marketing materials.\n\nTwo years later, Roger Corman, the producer of \"Death Race 2000\", elaborated that he had an option agreement with producer Tom Cruise, and that Cruise would portray the lead role. The director said that Cruise had not been happy with the first two screenplays and that a third one was underway. In June 2006, producer Jeremy Bolt reported that Anderson would direct the remake of \"Death Race 2000\" after completing \"\" (2007). The producer described the remake's new tone: \"We've basically taken the idea of reality television and extended it twenty years. So it's definitely a comment on society, and particularly reality television, but it is not as much a parody or a satire as the original. It's more straight.\" The following August, Paramount ended its relationship with Cruise/Wagner Productions, and \"Death Race\" was placed in turnaround. According to reports, when the project was discovered available, Universal Studios acquired it. Cruise and Wagner resumed their roles as producers, and Anderson returned to write and direct the film.\n\nIn April 2007, actor Jason Statham entered negotiations to star in \"Death Race\", with production slated to begin in late summer or early fall. Anderson described that \"Death Race\" would take place in a prison, and that the film would be \"super-violent\" like its predecessor. \"It has little echoes of the original – a lot of people get run down, but rather than having the points system, which had no pay off anyway, it's a pure race. It's more like \"Gladiator\", with the last person standing – or driving, winning,\" explained the director. Filming on \"Death Race\" began in Montreal in August 2007.\n\nThe film drew generally negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 42% rating based on reviews from 153 critics, and an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Mindless, violent, and lightning-paced, \"Death Race\" is little more than an empty action romp.\" Metacritic reports a rating of 43 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore during opening weekend gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on a scale ranging from A+ to F.\n\nRobert Koehler of \"Variety\" called \"Death Race\" \"as hard as metal and just as dumb\" and criticized it for removing the humor of \"Death Race 2000\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film half a star (out of four), calling it \"an assault on all the senses, including common.\" Keith Phipps of the A.V. Club said the film is \"ideal for those who want to watch a bunch of cars blow each other up, without having to think about it all that much.\" Marc Savlov of the \"Austin Chronicle\" called \"Death Race\" \"one of the most boring drags of all time.\"\n\nPeter Hartlaub of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called the film \"an ill-advised and severely wussified remake.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film one and a half stars (out of four), calling it \"junk\" and saying that \"the chases are pretty cool, but there's absolutely nothing else to see.\" A positive review came from Nathan Lee of \"The New York Times\", who said that \"the movie is legitimately greasy, authentically nasty, with a good old-fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews awarded \"Death Race\" a score of two and a half stars (out of four), saying that it's \"weak when it comes to things like plot, character, and acting, but it's very good at provoking visceral reactions.\"\n\nThe film grossed $75,677,515, of which $36,316,032 was from North America.\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on September 26, 2008, but was moved to August 22, 2008.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-ray were released in the United States on December 21, 2008. There was also an unrated edition released. The Blu-ray version of the movie features a Digital Copy of the film. In the DVD commentary, Anderson further elaborates on his thought of the movie as a prequel more than a remake.\n\nThe score to \"Death Race\" was composed by Paul Haslinger and conducted by Tim Davies. Haslinger recorded the string portion of his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.\n\nThe soundtrack was released on August 19, 2008.\n\nThe film is followed by two direct-to-video prequel films \"Death Race 2\" (2010) and \"\" (2013); both take place before this film and were filmed in South Africa. The films were directed by Roel Reiné, and star Luke Goss, Tanit Phoenix, Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames all appeared in the prequels. Lists and 14K are the only returning characters and are portrayed by Frederick Koehler and Robin Shou, respectively. A fourth film is a direct-to-video sequel to the first film, titled \"\" (2018).\n\n"}

It is a parody of typical hunting games, specifically \"Deer Hunter\".\n\n\nThe protagonist of the game is a deer named Bambo, a portmanteau of the action hero Rambo and the Disney character Bambi. He is a bipedal deer who hunts humans in a fashion similar to typical deer hunting in order to avenge all deer hunted by humans. Bambo mounts the heads of humans he kills on a wall in his cabin. He can tote a vast array of weapons ranging from slingshots to machine guns. He is voiced by Brian McCann, who frequently appeared on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nIn the first three games, Bambo had a sleek physique with a bandana tied around his forehead, a forest green hunting vest, and an ammo bandolier. However, in the fourth game, Bambo was given a broad-shouldered, muscular physique. The cause for this change was never explained.\n\nBambo is very crude and crass, often farting, and yelling obscenities and stereotypical jokes at his prey. He also is very sexually inclined, and is often portrayed having sex with a doe.\n\nStarting with \"Deer Avenger 3D\", polygon characters are used.\n\nIn the fourth edition of the game, as Bubba, now an angel, floats to Heaven he states will be back in \"Deer Avenger 5\". However, a fifth game has yet to be made.\n\n\"Deer Avenger: Stag Party\" is a box set containing the first two games in the series.\n\n\"Deer Avenger: Open Season\" is a compilation of the first three games in the series.\n\n"}

He appeared in supporting roles in many Broadway shows, but it was his appearance in Florenz Ziegfeld's \"Ziegfeld Follies\" that would provide the impetus for his own career as a theatrical impresario on Broadway. White appeared in the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" of 1911 and 1915; in the latter show, he popularized the Turkey Trot dance.\n\nHe launched his \"Ziegfeld Follies\" imitation, the \"George White’s Scandals\", in 1919. \"Scandals\" provided audiences with popular songs, comic sketches, eccentric dancers and his own version of the Ziegfeld girls. Though not as grand as the \"Ziegfeld Follies\", his \"Scandals\" were quite successful. The shows, which were micromanaged by White and reflected his tastes, were fast-paced and featured a lot of dancing.\n\nWhite reached the apogee of his Broadway career with the 1926 edition of \"Scandals\", which ran for 424 performances. The Black Bottom, danced by \"Ziegfeld Follies\" star Ann Pennington and Tom Patricola, touched off a national dance craze. However, by the time he produced his last staging of \"Scandals\" in 1939, the show was derided by critics as being old-fashioned. In addition to his \"Scandals\" and \"George White's Music Hall Varieties\" (essentially \"Scandals\" under a different name), White also produced several book musicals and legitimate plays on Broadway.\n\nWhite also was a movie director, producer and screenwriter. He produced the movies \"Flying HIgh\" (1931), \"George White's Scandals\" (1934) \"George White's 1935 Scandals\" (1935) and \"George White's Scandals\" (1945), and directed the 1934 and 1935 celluloid versions of his \"Scandals\". He also appeared in and took screenwriting credit for the 1934 and 1935 pictures. he also received screenwriting credits for the movies \"Ziegfeld Follies (1945) and Duffy's Tavern\" (1945).\n\nIn 1946, White was involved in a hit-and-run automobile accident in which two people died. He was sentenced to nine months in prison. Freed from jail, White tried to turn \"Scandals\" into a show that would tour the nightclub circuit. The venture failed and he went bankrupt. His attempt to open a nightclub in Las Vegas also failed.\n\nWhite died from leukemia in 1968 in Hollywood, California and was interred in Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park in North Hollywood.\n\n"}

He appeared in vaudeville, burlesque, film, radio, and television. Cameron was best known for his vaudeville performances, first as part of the Kammerer & Howland musical comedy act, and later as a principal comedian on the Keith-Albee circuit. He appeared in several motion pictures and could be heard on WPRO (AM) radio as the “Singing Salesman.”\n\nKammerer was born as Jacques Kammerer on November 22, 1883, in Troyes, France. In 1896, he immigrated to Providence, Rhode Island with his father, Joseph Kammerer, and grandmother, Victorine Kammerer. As a teenager, Kammerer worked in a hat factory and trained as a gymnast at the Providence Boys’ Club. He began performing as an acrobat at Rocky Point Amusement Park’s Forest Casino in 1903. He appeared in local minstrel shows and with The Newman Comedy Four. In 1904, Kammerer married Clara Montgomery Higgs. They had three children and divorced in 1911. After the divorce, the children lived with Kammerer’s grandmother, Victorine, and uncle on a dairy farm in Rehoboth, MA.\n\nKammerer entered Providence vaudeville as a performer of illustrated songs. In 1910, Kammerer and Edna Howland, a classically trained pianist, began appearing together at the Bijou theatre as “Kammerer & Howland -- Classical Comedy Singing and Talking Act”. The Bijou was specifically designed as a venue for illustrated songs, which were performed between films, and an act like Kammerer & Howland would offer an upward of nine song programs per day at six days per week. The duo joined Fred Homan’s Musical Stock Company at the Scenic Temple on Matthewson Street in 1911. Homan's company also included Eddie Dowling. Though it disbanded after only two years, the company was remembered fondly by Rhode Island theatregoers.\n\nKammerer & Howland appeared on Marcus Loew’s national circuit for the first time in 1913. They toured North America on the Loew’s circuit for four years, and were known for comedic songs, clever banter, acrobatic dancing, and for Kammerer’s impersonations of Ford Sterling, Charlie Chaplin, and Bert Williams. Kammerer & Howland were billed alongside celebrated entertainers, such as Will Rogers and Marie Stoddard. In 1914, Kammerer joined the White Rats of America, a labor union organized by theatre employees in an effort to destabilize the Vaudeville Managers Association.\n\nToward the end of the decade, Kammerer & Howland appeared together in American burlesque. They married and had one child, Donald L. Kammerer, born in Missouri during Kammerer and Howland’s tour with the 1919-1920 season of Pat White’s \"Gaiety Girls\". The cast included Joe Yule and Nell Carter, who welcomed their only child, Mickey Rooney, while on the same tour. \n\n\"The Gaiety Girls’\" tour was the last for the duo of Kammerer & Howland. Howland returned to Providence, RI, with their son shortly after his birth. In 1923, she sued Kammerer for divorce on grounds of neglect and extreme cruelty. Howland was awarded custody, as well as a provision of ten dollars per week.\n\nIn 1921, Kammerer adopted the stage name Jack Cameron. Around this time, he was offered a string of lead roles in New York City burlesques. He appeared in Sliding Billy Watson’s \"World of Frolics\", Eddie Dowling’s \"Hello Miss Radio\", and Fred Clark’s \"Let’s Go\". In 1923, Cameron was cast as a principal in Charles Waldron’s \"Bostonians\". The show earned mixed reviews, but Cameron was a stand out. Alfred Nelson, theatre critic for \"Billboard\", referred to Cameron as “a singer, dancer, and versatile actor of remarkable ability.” \"Variety\" noted that the audience \"couldn't get enough\" of Cameron’s baritone. \"Bostonians\" also marked the first artistic collaboration between Cameron and the youthful singer, Leo Lee.\n\nAfter \"Bostonians\", Cameron was cast as the principal comedian in vaudeville producer Charles B. Maddock’s \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp: A Song of the Road\", book by Ballard MacDonald. \"Tramp\" paired Cameron once again with Leo Lee, along with six supporting male performers. The men played singing hobos, thrown together by fate in a camp beside a railroad track. The show was a hit and toured nationally on the Keith-Albee Circuit between 1925 and 1927. Cameron followed \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp\" with lead roles in three other C.B. Maddock productions: \"Sidekicks\" (1927-1929), \"Style Shop\" (1930), and \"All Wet\" (1931).\n\nIn 1929, Cameron starred alongside Helen Morgan in the Rouben Mamoulian motion picture, \"Applause\". Cameron’s character was true to life: he played an aging burlesque clown by the name of “Joe King.” During the opening scenes of Applause, Cameron’s comedic and acrobatic abilities are on full display, with shots of Cameron clowning-around and backflipping across the sound stage. Joe King disappears from the story after making an unsuccessful offer of marriage to Kitty Darling, played by Helen Morgan. Cameron appeared in two subsequent motion pictures: \"The Spy\" (1929) with Tom Howard, directed by Monte Brice, and \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" (1936) with Mickey Rooney, directed by John Cromwell.\n\nCameron continued to work as an entertainer throughout the 1930s and 1940s. He performed in the role of Gonzorgo in \"Babes in Toyland\" for two seasons, 1930 and 1931, with the Aborn Opera Company and Singer's Midgets, at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway. In 1934, he reunited with Leo Lee, from \"Tramp\" and \"Sidekicks\", to star in a new show, \"Broadway to Withersville\". It was a flop. Toward the end of the 1930s, Cameron launched his “drunk” nightclub act, \"There Is a Tavern in the Town\", at the Old Fashioned Cafe in Boston, MA. Cameron could be heard on WPRO (AM) radio as the “Singing Salesman” and appeared on the WBZ television show, \"You’re On\". Cameron retired from show business in 1947. He died in Rehoboth, MA, on September 25, 1956.\n\n"}

In the 15th century, the Portuguese were the primary exporters of African slaves to the Americas, and with slaves came their musical traditions. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a massive Brazilian presence in Angola, enabling a cultural exchange between the two Portuguese colonies. This exchange enabled subtle amalgamations of musical styles between Angola, Brazil and other African slave trade countries. The establishment of a creole population in Brazil led to further cultural developments in language, religion and art.\n\nRecords from the inquisition of the 18th century reveal that the Europeans initially considered gandus and lundus to be witchcraft. Many slave-owning Europeans in Brazil tolerated the dance in an attempt to avoid slave rebellion. Eventually, the style became attractive to Europeans in Brazil for its sexualized quality and its believed effectiveness in reversing witchcraft. de Mattos was disgruntled by the blurring by dance and drums of strict racial and cultural boundaries in Brazil.\n\nGradually, the lundu style grew in popularity among the elite population in Brazil. In 1749, Brazilian musician Manuel de Almeida Botelho immigrated to Lisbon, bringing with him the modinha and lundu musical styles. By the 19th century, lundu had become the music of choice for the Luso-Brazilian bourgeoisie. Historians have even called the style the “…most characteristic late 18th century [genre] of dance and song in Portugal and Brazil”.\n\nLundus are characterized by varying structure, the interplay of tonic and dominant harmony, and strummed chords layered atop a syncopated rhythm reminiscent of traditional West African music. Limited recordings are available of traditional lundus style. Usually a flirtatious ritual of a couple dance, accompanied by a guitar, or sometimes a thumb piano or drums, Lundu is related to the Spanish fandango and other new-world dances like the Argentine Zamba, the Peruvian Zamacueca and the Cuban Bolero - they all involve, to some degree, handkerchiefs, castanets, and holding one's arms above one's head. In the 19th century, the lundu was one of the sources of the Choro, the Maxixe and the Samba\n"}
{"id": "10419395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10419395", "title": "Magician's assistant", "text": "Magician's assistant\n\nA magician's assistant is a performer in a magic act who is not billed as the magician or principal name in the act. The role of an assistant can include holding the props that are used by a magician, shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction.\n\nAlthough magician's assistants appear to play a supporting role and receive a lesser billing than the magician who appears to be the source of illusions, the assistant is often the one making the mechanics of the illusions work. In the words of Joanie Spina, who worked for 11 years as principal assistant, choreographer and artistic consultant to illusionist David Copperfield:\n\n...I did find fault with the term \"assistant\" because it sounds like someone rolling props on and off stage when many of us were highly trained actors and dancers.\n\nAssistants have been part of magic shows for most of the recorded history of magic as a performance art. Despite their often crucial role in magic acts they, and the work they do, have suffered from negative public perceptions. The assistant's role has often been stereotyped as consisting of menial tasks and having the primary purpose of adding a visually aesthetic element to an act. This is associated with the perception that assistants are usually female and often dressed in revealing costumes. Although there have been plenty of instances of male assistants throughout the history of magic, the glamorous female stereotype has made a particular impact because female assistants were a prominent feature of illusion shows during the 20th century, when magic began to reach huge new audiences, first through the burgeoning of live vaudeville and variety shows and then through television. The glamorous female assistant has become an iconic image that continues in modern media and literature.\n\nA notable feature of the glamorous female assistant iconography is the frequency with which assistants play the role of \"victim\" in illusions where they are tied up, apparently cut with blades, penetrated with spikes or swords or otherwise tortured or imperilled. Examples include \"Aztec Lady\", \"Devil's Torture Chamber\", \"Mismade Girl\", \"Radium Girl\", \"Zig Zag Girl\", and, perhaps most famous of all, \"Sawing a woman in half\". Noted illusion designer and historian Jim Steinmeyer has identified the advent of the sawing illusion as a turning point in magic history and a moment which, more than any other, marks the origin of the cliche of the female assistant as victim. It is generally agreed that a \"sawing\" type illusion was first performed publicly by P. T. Selbit in January 1921. His presentations of what he titled \"Sawing through a woman\" made an enormous impact and greatly affected public expectations of stage magic for decades afterwards. Steinmeyer has explained:\n\nBefore Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of Robert-Houdin, both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions. Victorian gowns often made it unrealistic for a lady to take part in an illusion or be pressed into a tight space.\n\nChanges in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of \"victim\" both practical and popular. Steinmeyer notes: \"During the 1900s, as a shapely leg became not only acceptable on the stage but admired, it was fashionable to perform magic with a cast of attractive ladies\".\n\nThat was only part of the story, however. The trauma of war had helped to desensitize the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were also tiring of the gentler forms of magic represented by the likes of John Nevil Maskelyne. It took something more shocking, such as the horrific productions of the Grand Guignol theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: \"...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment\".\n\nIn contrast to the publicity given to Selbit, the names of the assistants who made this influential act work have received almost no publicity. There were two premieres of the illusion. Selbit first presented it to an audience in December 1920; however, on that occasion the spectators were a small group of invited theatrical agents and promoters who Selbit hoped would book the act. The public premiere then occurred on 17 January 1921 at the Finsbury Park Empire music hall after Selbit was hired by the Moss Empire group. According to Steinmeyer, the assistant at the 1920 preview was Jan Glenrose, Selbit's main assistant at that time. The public performances featured principal assistant Betty Barker.\n\nMany of these illusions, together with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes of one sort or another. This has led to the nickname \"box jumper\" which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant. One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an assistant that can fit into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men.\n\nFeminist critics have taken the above aspects of illusions and performances as evidence to support claims that magic is misogynistic, but this view has been contested by some magicians and assistants. However, a few prominent assistants have stated that they deserve better recognition for their efforts and achievements (see \"Documentaries\" below).\n\nSome modern magic acts have preserved the glamorous elements of the female assistant iconography while attempting to give full recognition to female performers by billing women as equal partners in acts. A notable example was the husband and wife act The Pendragons, for which Charlotte Pendragon wore very revealing costumes and did traditional \"box jumping\" roles yet received equal billing with her husband. She was also honored in her own right as a top professional magician.

The bands features trombones, tubas, horns, clarinets, flutes and piccolos and percussion.\n\nThe first marchinha was the composition (in 1899) of Chiquinha Gonzaga entitled \"O Abre Alas\", made to the Cordão Carnavalesco \"Rosa de Outro\".\n\nMarchinhas are composed and played to date by the blocos carnavalescos every year, in the \"street carnival\" of Rio de Janeiro.\n"}

Asylum support services include face-to-face advice both in initial accommodation centers and on an outreach basis, along with a nationwide telephone service. Most asylum seekers have fled war or persecution and many arrive with limited understanding of life in the UK. Migrant Help UK provides them with advice, information and support to negotiate the asylum system, access services and overcome the challenges of integration.\n\nMigrant Help works on Syrian Resettlement programmes with local authorities in South East England, welcoming new families to the UK and supporting and orienting them to their new communities over an extended period. The charity supports access to local healthcare and education services, English lessons, specialist counselling, managing budgets and becoming work ready.\n\nMigrant Help also supports victims of modern-day slavery and human trafficking in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe charity works with a number of organisations around the UK including local authorities, strategic partners and volunteer groups on community-based schemes.\n\nClear Voice, a subsidiary trading arm of Migrant Help, is an interpreting and translation service that operates with a pool of 350+ interpreters and translators country-wide in more than 90 different languages. The interpreters work extensively with refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nClear Voice was established by Migrant Help in 2008 to provide high quality, cost effective and socially aware language services. Clear Voice specialises in the provision of telephone interpreting, face-to-face interpreting and translation services across the UK.\n\nAll profits go back into Migrant Help to support its work with vulnerable migrants. In 2017, Clear Voice provided over 89,000 telephone and over 1400 face-to-face interpretation sessions.\n\nMigrant Help was set up in 1963 by Helen Ellis (MBE), a leading figure in provision of welfare support to migrants travelling through the Dover Port since 1946. The organisation, known at this time as the 'Kent Committee for the Welfare of Migrants' (KCWM), was established in response to the growing number of migrants arriving at the Channel Ports.\n\nIn 1970, immigrants were given right of 'Appeal' from decisions relating to their entry. The 'United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service' (UKIAS), funded by the Home Office, was established to represent migrants on 'Appeal'. KCWM worked alongside the UKIAS as the organisation supporting the welfare of arriving immigrants at the Channel Ports.\n\nHelen Ellis retired in 1993 after 50 years of service to migrants. In the following year the working name 'Migrant Helpline' was adopted. Also in 1994, the charity received a grant from the Home Office to deliver support services to newly arrived asylum seekers.\n\nIn 2002, Migrant Helpline was asked by the Home Office to establish and operate the first Induction Center. Here, briefings were delivered to asylum seekers about the asylum process and their rights and responsibilities. Migrant Helpline's operation expanded to London and a reception service for asylum seekers opened in Croydon. The charity was funded to manage the London accommodation center for newly arrived asylum seekers, known as 'Emergency Initial Accommodation'.\n\nA number of projects were established in the following years including the 'Sunrise' project to help new refugees integrate into life in the UK, a 'Training and Employment' project was launched for refugees in Kent (until 2009) and Migrant Helpline was invited to provide an independent important advice service to foreign national prisoners in Canterbury Prison.\n\nThe 'European Migrant Advice' service was established in response to the increased call for support from EU migrants in the UK. This service was later extended in 2010 to meet support needs in Suffolk and Norfolk.\n\nIn 2008, the 'United Kingdom Human Trafficking Center' approached the charity to provide support for victims of labour exploitation. The 'Victims of Slavery Support Service' team was established.\n\nClear Voice, a trading arm of Migrant Help, was established by Migrant Helpline in 2008 to provide high quality, cost effective and socially aware language services. Clear Voice works with a pool of 800+ interpreters and translators country-wide in more than 90 different languages and specialises in the provision of telephone interpreting, face-to-face interpreting and translation services across the UK.\n\nMigrant Helpline became known as Migrant Help in 2010. The charity continues to work to improve the lives of vulnerable migrants in partnership with other organisations and community groups.\n\nMigrant Help was shortlisted for Charity Awards in 2016 for innovation in advice and support to asylum seekers. Some of the programs that Migrant Help has been involved in are:\n\nMigrant Help employs 160+ people from 43 different countries of origin. Approximately 47 per cent of staff are non-UK born and many have personal experiences of the refugee journey.\n\nMigrant Help holds the \"Investors in People\" accreditation, is authorised by the Office of Immigration Services Commissioner, holds an Advice Quality Standard mark and is a National Living Wage employer.\n"}

During the Victorian era in Great Britain and in the United States, these games were extremely popular among the upper and middle classes. They were often played in a parlour, hence the name.\n\n\"The Victorian age was certainly the Golden Age of the parlor game.\" During the 19th century, the upper and middle classes had more leisure time than people of previous generations. This led to the creation of a variety of parlour games to allow these gentlemen and ladies to amuse themselves at small parties. Boxed parlour games were very popular from around 1920 until into the 1960s, especially around Christmas. Parlour games competed for attention with the mass media, particularly radio, movies, and television. Though decreased in popularity, parlour games continue to be played. Some remain nearly identical to their Victorian ancestors; others have been transformed into board games such as Balderdash.\n\nMany parlour games involve logic or word-play. Others are more physical games, but not to the extent of a sport or exercise. Some also involve dramatic skill, such as in charades. Most do not require any equipment beyond what would be available in a typical parlour. Parlour games are usually competitive, but cumulative scores are not usually kept. The length and ending time of the game is typically not set; play continues until the players decide to end the game.\n\nParlor games are also interchangeably used with carnival games such as, but not limited to, \"ping pong toss\", \"dart throwing\", \"strong man\", and \"dunk water\". These can be played either indoors or outdoors and is usually accompanied with a token prize (i.e. stuffed animal) upon winning.\n\nBy analogy, the phrase \"parlour game\" has been used to accuse political opponents of the use of deliberately nebulous or confusing language when describing their positions on issues.\n\nExamples of parlour games include:\n\n"}

Patoruzú is a wealthy Tehuelche \"cacique\" with great estate properties in Patagonia, and possesses both superhuman physical strength and a charitable yet naive heart. He was originally only a side character in Quinterno's series \"Don Gil Contento\", but became so popular with readers that the comic was renamed after him.\n\nPatoruzú first appeared on October 19, 1928, in the \"Las Aventuras de Don Gil Contento\" strip in the \"Crítica\" newspaper, under the name of \"Curugua Curuguagüigua\"; \"last cacique of the giant Tehuelches\", of whom \"Don Gil\" becomes tutor. The name was deemed too difficult to pronounce and was soon changed to Patoruzú, after the then-popular candy \"Pasta de Orozú\". Nevertheless, the strip was canceled by the newspaper after only a few days.\n\nLater that year Dante Quinterno started working for \"La Razón\" newspaper with the strip \"Don Julián de Monte Pío\" (predecessor of another of Quinterno's popular characters: the playboy Isidoro Cañones). In September 1930, Patoruzú was again introduced into the strip when Don Julián became his tutor. Slowly, Patoruzú assumed greater importance in the strip, which on December 11, 1931, was renamed to \"Patoruzú\".\n\nIn 1935 Quinterno sold the publication rights to \"El Mundo\" newspaper, and the first compilation of the adventures of the \"cacique\" was published. The strip was also published in newspapers in other Argentine cities outside of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn November 1936 the first Patoruzú monthly magazine was released and completely sold out the same day. The magazine was then published fortnightly, and then weekly. The magazine reached a record circulation of 300,000 copies, soon requiring a team to create its scripts and drawings, under the supervision of Quinterno.\n\nOn April 30, 1977, the 2,045th and last issue of Patoruzú was released. Slightly adapted versions of the original have been published, as well as the comic \"Patoruzito,\" about the life of young Patoruzú.\n\nIn 1942 the 12-minute short film \"Upa en apuros\" was the first Argentine animated film produced in colour.\n\nPatoruzú is the last descendant of the fictional Tehuelche \"Patoruzek\" dynasty. The source of his uncommon strength seems to be related to what he was fed as a child—soup made from the bones of an extinct giant animal—but also to the strength of all his ancestors, which he receives whenever he faces injustice.\n\nHe is extremely generous and charitable but is often deceived by greedy characters, who in the end are always properly punished. Patoruzú uses many native expressions that give his speech an aboriginal flavor; however, they derive from different tribes of Argentina and so are not consistent with each other (e.g. Guaraní \"gurí\", Guaraní \"Che\" , etc.).\n\nAn incorrigible playboy and stereotypical \"porteño\", he is supposed to be Patoruzú's tutor and look after him, but he spends most of his time trying to find new ways of getting more \"patacones\" bills out of him, to spend on parties, cars, and horses.\n\nPatoruzú's teenage brother is shy and naive, yet more aware of modern ways than his older brother. He has a big belly that he uses as a weapon whenever injustice is to be fought.\n\nPatora is the youngest sister; she lives in a convent in Patagonia because her obsessive desire to get married makes her fall for the first man she sees.\n\nPatoruzú's nanny and wet nurse lives on the \"estancia\" (ranch), far from any city. In spite of her age, she is vigorous and hard-working. Her empanadas are highly appreciated by the other characters.\n\nThe foreman of Patoruzú's \"estancia,\" he is often in a bad mood, but Patoruzú respects and trusts him.\n\nThe Colonel, the quintessential retired military man, is the uncle and tutor of Isidoro. A very correct and respected person, he is always trying to straighten out his nephew.\n\nPampero (\"from the Pampa\" and also the name of a strong southern wind, meaning in essence that he \"runs like the wind\") is Patoruzú's faithful horse, one of the fastest, if not \"the\" fastest, in the world. He responds only to Patoruzú's call.\n\nThis modern comic is set during the early years of the life of Patoruzú, with \"Isidorito\" (young Isidoro), \"Patoruzito\" (young Patoruzú) and his horse \"Pamperito\" (young Pampero).\n\n"}

It is the largest amusement park company in the world, based on the number of properties owned, and is ranked seventh in terms of attendance. The company maintains twenty five properties throughout North America including theme parks, amusement parks, water parks, and family entertainment centers. In 2017, Six Flags properties hosted 30.4 million guests.\n\nSix Flags was founded in Texas on August 5, 1961 and derived its name from its first property, Six Flags Over Texas. The company maintains a corporate office in Midtown Manhattan, while its headquarters are in Grand Prairie, Texas. On June 13, 2009, the corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which it successfully exited after restructuring on May 3, 2010.\n\nThe name \"Six Flags\" originally referred to the flags of the six different nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States, and the Confederate States of America. Six Flags parks are still divided into different themed sections, though many of the original areas from the first three parks have been replaced.\n\nSix Flags Theme Parks originated in 1957 with the creation of \"The Great Southwest Corporation\" by Angus G. Wynne and other investors. Construction of \"Six Flags Over Texas\" started in 1960, and the park opened the next year for a short (45-day) season. The park initially featured a Native American village, a gondola ride, a railroad, some Wild West shows, a stagecoach ride, and \"Skull Island\", a pirate-themed adventure attraction. There was also an excursion, inspired by the historical La Salle Expeditions in the late 1600s, called \"LaSalle's River Adventure\", aboard French riverboats through a wilderness full of animated puppets. Over time, all of those attractions, except for the railroad, would be replaced by others, such as roller coasters, swing rides, log flumes, and shoot-the-chute rides, as well as an observation tower.\n\nThe original Six Flags park, Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington (between Dallas and Fort Worth) was sold in 1966 to a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which was actively pursuing non-railroad investments in an effort to diversify its sources of income. (In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions. Six Flags opened Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967 and Six Flags Over Mid-America in 1971, which would be the last two original parks constructed by the company.\n\nSix Flags continued to grow by acquiring independent parks. Six Flags purchased AstroWorld in Houston, Texas in 1975, Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey in 1977 and Magic Mountain in Valencia, California in 1979. These purchases were followed by Penn Central selling assets to Bally Manufacturing in 1982.\n\nIn 1984, the Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois was acquired from the Marriott hotel chain.\n\nAlso in 1984, as a result of its acquisition of Great America, Six Flags acquired the rights to Time Warner/Warner Bros.' \"Looney Tunes\" animated characters for use in Six Flags properties. Bally surrendered control of the chain to Wesray Capital Corporation in a 1987 leveraged buyout. Time Warner quickly began to gain more leverage in the company, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder & Company. Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company's name from \"Six Flags Corp\". to \"Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc\".\n\nIn 1996, Six Flags began to manage Fiesta Texas theme park in San Antonio, Texas and purchased the park from USAA in 1998.\n\nPremier Parks originally operated as the Tierco Group, Inc., an Oklahoma-based real estate company. The company purchased the Frontier City theme park in Oklahoma City in 1982 for $1.2 million, although Tierco had no intention of entering the amusement park business. Company officials described Frontier City as \"beat up\" and \"run down\"; they planned to demolish it, subdivide the land, and build a shopping center. However, given an oil bust in Oklahoma, developers lost interest in converting the park into a shopping center. In 1984 Tierco hired Gary Story as general manager of Frontier City and sunk about $13 million into improving the park. As the new head of Frontier City, he quadrupled the park's attendance and revenues. Under his leadership, two rides, a ticket booth, sales office, and a petting zoo were added to the park. Food service improved.\n\nIn 1988, Tierco shifted its strategic direction to amusement parks. It sold much of its property in the late 1980s, generating capital to reinvest in Frontier City. As this reinvestment paid off, more capital became available, creating further growth. By 1991, Tierco opened White Water waterpark in Oklahoma City (the name later became White Water Bay). The company realized the key to boosting a park's attendance was to add new and exciting rides, and make it family-friendly.\n\nTierco acquired the financially troubled Wild World in Largo, Maryland, in 1992 and later changed that park's name to Adventure World. With a $500,000 investment, Tierco expanded Wild World's kiddie section and remodeled its buildings to give the park a tropical look and feel. Story was promoted to executive vice president after the purchase of Wild World. In 1994, he was promoted again to president and chief operating officer (COO). More flat rides and two roller coasters were added to that park.\n\nSince Tierco was on its way to becoming a \"premier\" regional theme park operator, in 1994 it changed its name to Premier Parks, Inc. Kieran E. Burke, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), noted that the new name signified the beginning of a new era for the company.\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, Premier picked up speed. In 1995, the company acquired these Funtime, Inc. properties: Geauga Lake near Cleveland, Ohio, Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio, Darien Lake near Buffalo, New York, and Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut. In 1996, Premier added to its portfolio, buying Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado, the Waterworld USA waterparks in Sacramento and Concord, California, Riverside Park in Agawam, Massachusetts, and Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom in Lake George, New York. Premier immediately sold the Lake Compounce park to Kennywood in Pennsylvania.\n\nGeauga Lake, Wyandot Lake, and Adventure World included water parks, while Frontier City was 14.8 miles away from White Water Bay that required separate admission. Riverside added one just before being sold. Premier Parks, in 1995 and 1996, added water parks to Darien Lake, Lake Compounce (immediately before the Kennywood sale), Elitch Gardens, and Great Escape.\n\nPremier went public in 1996 and raised nearly $70 million through an initial offering at $18 per share. The company planned to use the money to expand its ten parks and acquire others. In 1997, Premier purchased Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, and Marine World near San Francisco. A second public offering, at $29 per share, raised an additional $2 million.\n\nNearly 8.8 million people visited Premier's parks in 1996.\n\nPremier added amusement park rides and roller coasters to Marine World in 1998.\n\nSix Flags Theme Parks, Inc. was purchased in whole on April 1, 1998 from Time Warner by Premier Parks for $1.86 billion. Premier began to apply the Six Flags name to several smaller parks that the company had already owned: Darien Lake, Elitch Gardens, Kentucky Kingdom, and Adventure World.\n\nIn 1999, Premier Parks purchased Warner Bros. Movie World Germany and the yet-to-be-built Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid from Warner Bros.. As part of the acquisition Premier Parks had the opportunity to open more European theme parks with Warner Bros. Movie World branding. Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia was not part of the deal. The same transaction saw Premier Parks obtain exclusive rights for Warner Bros. licensing in Europe and Latin America, in addition to their existing rights for the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 2000, Premier Parks assumed the \"Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc\". name and continued re-branding its parks, including the Geauga Lake park into Six Flags Ohio and Riverside Park to Six Flags New England. Six Flags began a vigorous expansion, attempting to branch out internationally, acquiring numerous properties across the USA, plus the Walibi chain, and the historic Belgian park Bellewaerde in Europe, La Ronde in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Reino Aventura in Mexico. Three of those parks were re-branded as Six Flags parks: Walibi Flevo became Six Flags Holland, Walibi Wavre became Six Flags Belgium, and Reino Aventura became Six Flags Mexico.\n\nIn 2001, Six Flags acquired the former SeaWorld Ohio from Anheuser-Busch, merged it with the adjacent Six Flags Ohio and re-branded the combined park as \"Six Flags Worlds of Adventure\". The park was positioned to compete against northern Ohio's Cedar Point.\n\nIn 2004, Six Flags began to close and sell properties in an effort to help alleviate the company's growing debt. On March 10, Six Flags sold its European parks, with the exception of the Movie World park in Madrid, Spain, to Star Parks, a division of Palamon Capital Partners. The Madrid park was sold back to Time Warner and renamed \"Parque Warner Madrid\". In April, Six Flags determined that the investment required to keep Worlds of Adventure competitive with Cedar Point would be too great, leading to that park being sold to Cedar Fair. These sales raised $345 million in an effort to relieve Six Flags' massive debt.\n\nIn 2005, Six Flags endured even more turmoil. Some of the company's largest investors, notably Bill Gates's Cascade Investments (which then owned about 11% of Six Flags) and Daniel Snyder's Red Zone, LLC (which owned 12%), demanded change. On August 17, 2005, Red Zone began a proxy battle to gain control of Six Flags' board of directors. On August 29, Six Flags New Orleans was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nOn September 12, Six Flags Chief Executive Officer Kieran Burke announced that Six Flags AstroWorld would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as the park's performance, and parking issues involving the Houston Texans football team, Reliant Stadium, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, leveraged with the estimated value of the property which included the park. Company executives were expecting to receive upwards of $150 million for the real estate, but ended up receiving $77 million when the bare property (which cost $20 million to clear) was sold to a development corporation in 2006.\n\nOn November 22, Red Zone announced it had gained control of the board. Kieran Burke was removed on December 14 and replaced by Mark Shapiro, former executive vice president of programming at ESPN. Six Flags then named former Representative Jack Kemp, entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein, and Michael Kassan, the former president of the Interpublic Group of Companies Incorporated, to their newly revamped board of directors.\n\nEven with the new management team, the sell-off would continue into 2006. On January 27, Six Flags announced the sale of Frontier City and White Water Bay after the 2006 operating season. At the same time, Six Flags announced it would close corporate offices in Oklahoma City, moving its headquarters to New York City. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld. In June, Six Flags announced it was considering closing or selling up to six of its parks, including Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, WaterWorld in (Concord, California), Wild Waves and Enchanted Village in Federal Way, Washington, Splashtown in Houston, Texas and, most notably, Six Flags Magic Mountain. In addition, Six Flags announced the sale of Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio to the neighboring Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Ultimately, Six Flags Magic Mountain was spared, with the remaining six parks sold on January 11, 2007 to CNL Lifestyle Properties for $312 million: $275 million cash and a note for $37 million.\n\nThe company's cash flow had decreased by over $120 million annually during the Shapiro years. In October 2008, Six Flags was warned its stock value had fallen below the required minimums to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With the financial crisis of 2007–2008 weighing both on consumer spending and the ability to access credit facilities, Six Flags was believed to be unable to make a payment to preferred stockholders due in August 2009. Management saw the business as a sound one, noting that attendance across the company's parks increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said that the company's problem was the declining attendance and cash flow created by his new management initiatives. If not resolved, the company warned in its 2008 annual report that the situation might require a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, with Six Flags already retaining counsel should that occur. The company stated at the time that it expected business to continue as normal in the event of such a filing, although one analyst believed attendance at the company's parks would decrease by six percent, suggesting parents would be leery of letting their children ride a roller coaster operated by a bankrupt company. In April 2009, the New York Stock Exchange announced it would delist Six Flags' stock on April 20, a decision that the company did not intend to appeal. On June 1, 2009, Six Flags announced they would delay their $15 million debt payment further using a 30-day grace period. Less than two weeks later, on June 13, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but issued a statement that the parks would continue to operate normally while the company restructured. On August 21, 2009, Six Flags' Chapter 11 restructuring plan was announced in which lenders would control 92% of the company in exchange for cancelling $1.13 billion in debt.\n\nOne component of the restructuring was negotiating a new lease agreement with the Kentucky State Fair Board, which owned much of the land and attractions for Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom. Six Flags had asked to forgo rent payments for the remaining nine years of its current lease agreement in exchange for profit-sharing from the park's operations. When it appeared that the offer had been rejected, Six Flags announced in February 2010 that it would not re-open the park. However, the Kentucky State Fair Board stated at the time that they were still open to negotiating a revised lease agreement.\n\nOn April 28, 2010, the company's bondholders reached an agreement on a reorganization plan. Junior note holders, including hedge funds Stark Investments and Pentwater Capital Management, assumed control of the company, while senior note holders were paid in cash. Despite objections from some parties who stood to gain nothing, the bankruptcy judge approved the plan on April 30, 2010. As part of the settlement, chairman of the board Dan Snyder was removed, while chief executive officer Mark Shapiro briefly remained in his post.\n\nSix Flags officially emerged from bankruptcy protection as Six Flags Entertainment Corp. on May 3, 2010, and announced plans to issue new stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Amid suspected disagreements regarding the future of the company with the board, Shapiro left the company and Al Weber, Jr. was brought in as interim president and CEO. The company announced their corporate headquarters would move from New York City to Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nSix Flags announced that Jim Reid-Anderson would replace Weber and become chairman, president and chief executive officer (CEO) on August 13, 2010. John Duffey also joined the company in 2010, taking the role of chief financial officer (CFO). As of October 1, 2012, Al Weber, Jr. had retired as chief operating officer (COO) with no immediate successor.\n\nOn February 18, 2016, Six Flags announced that Jim Reid-Anderson had been promoted as executive chairman and John M. Duffey succeeded him as president and CEO.\n\nOn January 11, 2016, Six Flags announced Six Flags Zhejiang, then named Six Flags Haiyan, in China. On the same day, a website was created along with concept art for the property. A month later on February 2, 2016. Six Flags announced Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oaxtepec. The water park, originally named Parque Acuatico Oaxtepec, is a 76-acre park located in Morelos that went bankrupt in 2011.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, Six Flags announced a partnership with NaVi Entertainment to build a Six Flags-branded theme park and a Six Flags Hurricane Harbor-branded water park in Vietnam.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, Six Flags announced the revival of its previously cancelled Six Flags Dubai. As part of the second phase of the Dubai Parks and Resorts project in Jebel Ali, the park is expected to open in 2019.\n\nOn July 20, 2016, Six Flags announced an agreement with Riverside Investment Group Co. Ltd. for the development of a second Six Flags-branded theme park in China together with a water park. The two parks will be located in Bishan District, a district of Chongqing.\n\nOn April 27, 2017, the company announced it would take over operations of Waterworld California in Concord, California making it Six Flags' 20th property.\n\nOn July 18, 2017, Six Flags announced that president and CEO John M. Duffey had retired from the company and Jim Reid-Anderson had re-assumed the roles of chairman, president, and CEO.<ref>\n"}

Produced by Ang Hock Liem for Union Films and directed by R Hu, this black-and-white film starred Raden Soekarno, Ratna Djoewita, Oedjang, and Soehaena. The story, written by Djojopranoto, follows two young men who compete for the affections of a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers.\n\nCompleted between September and October 1941, \"Soeara Berbisa\" featured \"keroncong\" music and was shot partly in western Java. It was released to coincide with the Eid al-Fitr holiday, and rated for all ages. Advertisements emphasised the film's appeal to both Native and Dutch audiences, and a review in \"De Indische Courant\" was positive. Although the film – Union's penultimate production – was screened as late as 1949, it is now likely lost.\n\nThe young athlete Mitra and his sweetheart Neng Mardinah are to be wed. However, a young man named Mardjohan has fallen in love with Mardinah, and to win her heart he spreads rumours about Mitra being the son of a convicted criminal. In the backlash over the rumours, Mitra abandons the city and his beloved, hoping to find peace in the countryside.\n\nThere, Mitra finds work at a factory which is, coincidentally, owned by Mardjohan. Refusing the romantic advances of a worker there, he leaves the factory. One day, he comes across Mardjohan, gravely injured following an accident. Mitra saves the man, then takes him for treatment. Mardjohan's mother, seeing Mitra, believes that he is her son who went missing when he was aged three. She finds several witnesses who testify of the resemblance, and is ultimately able to prove her suspicions. Meanwhile, Mitra's name is cleared, and he is reunited with Mardinah.\n\nThe sixth production of Union Films, \"Soeara Berbisa\" was produced by Ang Hock Liem and directed by R Hu, an ethnic Chinese director who had worked for the company since 1940; the sound technician Boen Kin Nam served as assistant director. The screenplay was written by Djojopranoto, who replaced Union's former screenwriter Saeroen after the latter left for rival company Star Film following \"Wanita dan Satria\" (1941). The film began production by September 1941, and by October it was nearly complete.\n\n\"Soeara Berbisa\" starred Raden Soekarno and Ratna Djoewita, and featured the acting talents of Oedjang and Soehaena. Soekarno and Soehana were new hires, whereas Oedjang and Djoewita had previously done work for Union; the former had been acting for Union since its first production, \"Kedok Ketawa\", in 1940, and the latter had held a role in \"Wanita dan Satria\". This black-and-white film included several \"keroncong\" songs, and was partly shot in the Preanger region of west Java.\n\nUnion announced that \"Soeara Berbisa\" would be released to coincide with the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which began on 22 October 1941, and advertisements for screenings in Medan, in northern Sumatra, date to early November 1941. A review in the Surabaya edition of \"De Indische Courant\", however, indicates that the film had only premiered in the east Javan city on 14 January 1942. That newspaper gave a positive review, describing \"Soeara Berbisa\" as a tense film with humorous moments and beautiful scenery. Its review ended with a recommendation that young people and their parents see the film.\n\n\"Soeara Berbisa\" was open to audiences of all ages. To reach educated audiences, Union claimed to have \"paid attention to dialogue, arranged it as best as possible in accordance with the wants of the Indonesian people\". In Dutch-language newspapers, the film was advertised as \"an interesting and fascinating tale of two young men in the world of indigenous sports\", which nonetheless was produced in a \"civilised\" manner such that it could be appreciated by European audiences.\n\nUnion's final production, \"Mega Mendoeng\", was directed by Boen and released in early 1942. It again starred Soekarno, though this time alongside the new find Sofiati. The company was closed after the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, and most of its employees never returned to the film industry. Soekarno was an exception; he continued to act until the 1970s, though he was generally credited as Rendra Karno.\n\n\"Soeara Berbisa\" was screened as late as February 1949. The film is likely lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\n"}

{"id": "47309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47309", "title": "Striptease", "text": "Striptease\n\nA striptease is an erotic or exotic dance in which the performer gradually undresses, either partly or completely, in a seductive and sexually suggestive manner. The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a \"stripper\" or exotic dancer.\n\nIn Western countries, the venues where stripteases are performed on a regular basis are now usually called strip clubs, though they may be performed in venues such as pubs (especially in the UK), theaters and music halls. At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at a bachelor or bachelorette party. In addition to providing adult entertainment, stripping can be a form of sexual play between partners. This can be done as an impromptu event or – perhaps for a special occasion – with elaborate planning involving fantasy wear, music, special lighting, practiced dance moves, or unrehearsed dance moves.\n\nStriptease involves a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics such as the wearing of additional clothes or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude. The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them.\n\nStriptease and public nudity have been subject to legal and cultural prohibitions and other aesthetic considerations and taboos. Restrictions on venues may be through venue licensing requirements and constraints and a wide variety of national and local laws. These laws vary considerably around the world, and even between different parts of the same country.\n\nH. L. Mencken is credited with coining the word \"ecdysiast\" – from \"ecdysis\", meaning \"to molt\" – in response to a request from striptease artist Georgia Sothern, for a \"more dignified\" way to refer to her profession. Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the most famous striptease artists of all time, approved of the term.\n\nThe origins of striptease as a performance art are disputed and various dates and occasions have been given from ancient Babylonia to 20th century America. The term \"striptease\" was first recorded in 1932, though \"stripping\", in the sense of women removing clothing to sexually excite men, seems to go back to at least the late 19th century.\n\nThere is a stripping aspect in the ancient Sumerian myth of the descent of the goddess Inanna into the Underworld (or Kur). At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. When she returned, fecundity abounded. Some believe this myth was embodied in the dance of the seven veils of Salome, who danced for King Herod, as mentioned in the New Testament in Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:21-22. However, although the Bible records Salome's dance, the first mention of her removing seven veils occurs in Oscar Wilde's play of 'Salome', in 1893.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the lawgiver Solon established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC. Among these classes of prostitutes were the auletrides: female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men. In ancient Rome, dance featuring stripping was part of the entertainments \"(ludi)\" at the Floralia, an April festival in honor of the goddess Flora. Empress Theodora, wife of 6th-century Byzantine emperor Justinian is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a courtesan and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed \"as far as the laws of the day allowed\". She was famous for her striptease performance of \"Leda and the Swan\". From these accounts, it appears that the practice was hardly exceptional nor new. It was, however, actively opposed by the Christian Church, which succeeded in obtaining statutes banning it in the following century. The degree to which these statutes were subsequently enforced is, of course, opened to question. What is certain is that no practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages.\n\nAn early version of strip-tease became popular in England at the time of the Restoration. A strip tease was incorporated into the Restoration comedy \"The Rover\", written by Aphra Behn in 1677. The stripper is a man; an English country gentleman who sensually undresses and goes to bed in a love scene. (However, the scene is played for laughs; the prostitute he thinks is going to bed with him robs him, and he ends up having to crawl out of the sewer.) The concept of strip-tease was also widely known, as can be seen in the reference to it in Thomas Otway's comedy \"The Soldier's Fortune\" (1681), where a character says: \"Be sure they be lewd, drunken, \"stripping\" whores\".\n\nStrip-tease became standard fare in the brothels of 18th century London, where the women, called 'posture girls', would strip naked on tables for popular entertainment.\nStrip-tease was also combined with music, as in the 1720 German translation of the French \"La Guerre D'Espagne\" (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707), where a galant party of high aristocrats and opera singers has resorted to a small château where they entertain themselves with hunting, play and music in a three-day turn:\n\nThe dancers, to please their lovers the more, dropped their clothes and danced totally naked the nicest entrées and ballets; one of the princes directed the delightful music, and only the lovers were allowed to watch the performances.\n\nAn Arabic custom, first noted by French colonialists and described by the French novelist Gustave Flaubert may have influenced the French strip-tease. The dances of the Ghawazee in North Africa and Egypt consisted of the erotic dance of the bee performed by a woman known as Kuchuk Hanem. In this dance the performer disrobes as she searches for an imaginary bee trapped within her garments. It is likely that the women performing these dances did not do so in an indigenous context, but rather, responded to the commercial climate for this type of entertainment. Middle Eastern belly dance, also known as oriental dancing, was popularized in the United States after its introduction on the Midway at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago by a dancer known as Little Egypt.\n\nSome claim the origin of the modern striptease lies in Oscar Wilde's play of 'Salome', in 1893. In the Dance of the Seven Veils the female protagonist dances for King Herod and slowly removes her veils until she lies naked. After Wilde's play and Richard Strauss's operatic version of the same, first performed in 1905, the erotic 'dance of the seven veils', became a standard routine for dancers in opera, vaudeville, film and burlesque. A famous early practitioner was Maud Allan who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to King Edward VII.\n\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, Parisian shows such as the Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère were featuring attractive scantily clad women dancing and tableaux vivants. In this environment, an act in the 1890s featured a woman who slowly removed her clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body. \"The People's Almanac\" credits the act as the origin of modern striptease.\n\nIn 1905, the notorious and tragic Dutch dancer Mata Hari, later shot as a spy by the French authorities during World War I, was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the Musée Guimet. The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments over her arms and head. Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos, who entered dressed only in three very small shells. In the 1920s and 1930s the famous Josephine Baker danced topless in the \"danse sauvage\" at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the Tabarin. These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. In his 1957 book \"Mythologies\", semiotician Roland Barthes interpreted this Parisian striptease as a \"mystifying spectacle\", a \"reassuring ritual\" where \"evil is advertised the better to impede and exorcise it\". By the 1960s \"fully nude\" shows were provided at such places as Le Crazy Horse Saloon.\n\nIn the United States, striptease started in traveling carnivals and burlesque theatres, and featured famous strippers such as Gypsy Rose Lee and Sally Rand. The vaudeville trapeze artist, Charmion, performed a \"disrobing\" act onstage as early as 1896, which was captured in the 1901 Edison film, \"Trapeze Disrobing Act\". Another milestone for modern American striptease is the possibly legendary show at Minsky's Burlesque in April 1925: The Night They Raided Minsky's. The Minsky brothers brought burlesque to New York's 42nd Street. However the burlesque theatres here were prohibited from having striptease performances in a legal ruling of 1937 leading to the later decline of these \"grindhouses\" (named after the bump 'n grind entertainment on offer) into venues for cinema.\n\nThe 1960s saw a revival of striptease in the form of topless go-go dancing. This eventually merged with the older tradition of burlesque dancing. Carol Doda of the Condor Night Club in the North Beach section of San Francisco is given the credit of being the first topless go-go dancer. The club opened in 1964 and Doda's première topless dance occurred on the evening of June 19 of that year. The large lit sign in front of the club featured a picture of her with red lights on her breasts. The club went \"bottomless\" on September 3, 1969 and began the trend of explicit \"full nudity\" in American striptease dancing. which was picked up by other establishments such as Apartment A Go Go. San Francisco is also the location of the notorious Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre. Originally an X-rated movie theater this striptease club pioneered lap dancing in 1980, and was a major force in popularizing it in strip clubs on a nationwide and eventually worldwide basis.\n\nIn Britain in the 1930s, when Laura Henderson began presenting nude shows at the Windmill Theatre, London, the British law prohibited naked girls from moving. To get around the prohibition the models appeared in stationary tableaux vivants. The Windmill girls also toured other London and provincial theatres, sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round, though strictly speaking, staying within the letter of the law by not moving of their own volition. Another example of the way the shows stayed within the law was the fan dance, in which a naked dancer's body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants, until the end of her act in when she posed nude for a brief interval whilst standing still.\n\nIn 1942, Phyllis Dixey formed her own company of girls and rented the Whitehall Theatre in London to put on a review called The Whitehall Follies.\n\nBy the 1950s, touring striptease acts were used to attract audiences to the dying music halls. Arthur Fox started his touring shows in 1948 and Paul Raymond started his in 1951. Paul Raymond later leased the Doric Ballroom in Soho and opened his private members club, the Raymond Revuebar in 1958. This was one of the first of the private striptease members clubs in Britain.\n\nIn the 1960s, changes in the law brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho with \"fully nude\" dancing and audience participation. Pubs were also used as a venue, most particularly in the East End with a concentration of such venues in the district of Shoreditch. This pub striptease seems in the main to have evolved from topless go-go dancing. Though often a target of local authority harassment, some of these pubs survive to the present day. An interesting custom in these pubs is that the strippers walk round and collect money from the customers in a beer jug before each individual performance. This custom appears to have originated in the late 1970s when topless go-go dancers first started collecting money from the audience as the fee for going \"fully nude\". Private dances of a more raunchy nature are sometimes available in a separate area of the pub.\n\nStriptease became popular in Japan after the end of World War II. When entrepreneur Shigeo Ozaki saw Gypsy Rose Lee perform, he started his own striptease revue in Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood. During the 1950s, Japanese \"strip shows\" became more sexually explicit and less dance-oriented, until they were eventually simply live sex shows.\n\nRecently pole dancing has come to dominate the world of striptease. In the late 20th century, pole dancing was practised in exotic dance clubs in Canada. These clubs grew up to become a thriving sector of the economy. Canadian style pole dancing, table dancing and lap dancing, organized by multi-national corporations such as Spearmint Rhino, was exported from North America to (among other countries) the United Kingdom, the nations of central Europe, Russia and Australia. In London, England a raft of such so-called \"lap dancing clubs\" grew up in the 1990s, featuring pole dancing on stage and private table dancing, though, despite media misrepresentation, lap-dancing in the sense of bodily contact was forbidden by law.\n\n\"Feature shows\" are used to generate interest from potential customers who otherwise would not visit the establishment but know the performer from other outlets. A headlining star of a striptease show is referred to as a \"feature dancer\", and is often a performer with credits such as contest titles or appearances in adult films or magazines. The decades-old practice continued through the late 2000s (decade) to the present day with high-profile adult film performers such as Jenna Haze and Teagan Presley scheduling feature shows through the USA.\n\nIn December 2006, a Norwegian court ruled that striptease is an art form and made strip clubs exempt from value added tax.\n\nIn the latter 1990s, a number of solo performers and dance groups emerged to create Neo-burlesque, a revival of the classic American burlesque striptease of the early half of the 20th century. New Burlesque focuses on dancing, costumes and entertainment (which may include comedy and singing) and generally eschews full nudity or toplessness. Some burlesquers of the past have become instructors and mentors to New Burlesque performers such as and The World Famous Pontani Sisters. The pop group Pussycat Dolls began as a New Burlesque troupe.\n\nUntil the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Since then, male strippers have also become common. Before the 1970s, dancers of both sexes appeared largely in underground clubs or as part of a theatre experience, but the practice eventually became common enough on its own. One of the better-known troupes of male strippers are the Chippendales. Male strippers have become a popular option to have at a bachelorette party.\n\nA variation on striptease is private dancing, which often involves lap dancing or contact dancing. Here the performers, in addition to stripping for tips, also offer \"private dances\" which involve more attention for individual audience members. Variations include private dances like table dancing where the performer dances on or by customer's table rather than the customer being seated in a couch.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present day, striptease was considered a form of public nudity and subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on moral and decency grounds. Such restrictions have been embodied in venue licensing regulations and various national and local laws, including liquor licensing restrictions.\n\nNumerous U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease. One of the more notorious local ordinances is San Diego Municipal Code 33.3610, specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials which included contacts in the nude entertainment industry. Among its provisions is the \"six foot rule\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance while performing.\n\nOther rules forbid \"full nudity\". In some parts of the USA, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by pasties by the dancer (though no such taboo applies to the exposure of male nipples). In early 2010, the city of Detroit banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008. The city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties but kept other restrictions. Both cities were reputed to have rampant occurrences of illicit activity linked to its striptease establishments. For some jurisdictions, even certain postures can be considered \"indecent\" (such as spreading the legs).\n\nIn Britain in the 1930s, when the Windmill Theatre, London, began to present nude shows, British law prohibited performers moving whilst in a state of nudity. To get around that rule, models appeared naked in stationary tableaux vivants. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. Fan dances were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer's body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage. Changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho, with \"fully nude\" dancing and audience participation. Following the introduction of the Policing and Crime Act 2009, a local authority licence is required for venues in England and Wales (and later Scotland) where live nude entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year.\n\nThe legal status of striptease in Iceland was changed in 2010, when Iceland outlawed striptease. Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's prime minister said: \"The Nordic countries are leading the way on women's equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale.\" The politician behind the bill, Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir, said: \"It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold.\"\n\nMary Martin reprised her famous fur coat striptease of \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" in the 1940 movie \"Love Thy Neighbor\" and the 1946 Cole Porter biopic \"Night and Day\".\n\n\"Lady of Burlesque\" (known in the UK as \"Striptease Lady\") (1943) based on the novel \"The G-String Murders\" (1941), by famous striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee, stars Barbara Stanwyck as a stripper who gets involved in the investigation of murders at a burlesque house. A play by Gypsy Rose Lee entitled \"The Naked Genius\" (1943) was the inspiration for \"Doll Face\" (1945), a musical about a burlesque star (Vivian Blaine) who wants to become a legitimate actress.\n\n\"Gilda\" (1946), showcases one of the most famous stripteases in cinematic history, performed by Rita Hayworth to \"Put the Blame on Mame\"), though in the event she removes just her gloves, before the act is terminated by a jealous admirer. \"Murder at the Windmill\" (1949), (known in the U.S.A. as \"Mystery at the Burlesque\") directed by Val Guest is set at the Windmill Theatre, London and features Diana Decker, Jon Pertwee and Jimmy Edwards. \"Salome\" (1953) once again features Rita Hayworth doing a striptease act; this time as the famous biblical stripper Salome, performing the Dance of the Seven Veils. According to Hayworth's biographers this erotic dance routine was \"the most demanding of her entire career\", necessitating \"endless takes and retakes\". \"Expresso Bongo\" (1959) is a British film which features striptease at a club in Soho, London.\n\nIn 1960, the film \"Beat Girl\" cast Christopher Lee as a sleazy Soho strip club owner who gets stabbed to death by a stripper. \"Gypsy\" (1962), features Natalie Wood as the famous burlesque queen Gypsy Rose Lee in her memorable rendition of \"Let Me Entertain You\".

Another documentary film, which looked at the unglamorous side of striptease, is the 1966 film called,\"Strip\", filmed at the Phoenix Club in Soho.\n\"Secrets of a Windmill Girl\" (1966) featured Pauline Collins and April Wilding and was directed by Arnold L. Miller. The film has some fan dancing scenes danced by an ex-Windmill Theatre artiste. \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\" (1968) gives a possibly legendary account of the birth of striptease at Minsky's Burlesque theatre in New York. In 1968, the sci-fi film \"Barbarella\" depicted Jane Fonda stripping in zero-gravity conditions whilst wearing her spacesuit. \"Marlowe\" (1969) stars Rita Moreno playing a stripper, in the finale of the movie simultaneously delivering dialogue with the title character and performing a vigorous dance on stage. The Beatles movie \"Magical Mystery Tour\" has a scene where all the men on the tour bus go to a gentleman's club and watch a woman strip on stage.\n\n\"Ichijo's Wet Lust\" (1972), Japanese director Tatsumi Kumashiro's award-winning \"Roman porno\" film featured the country's most famous stripper, Sayuri Ichijō, starring as herself. A British film production of 1976 is the film \"Get 'Em Off\", produced by Harold Baim. Alain Bernardin the owner of the Crazy Horse in Paris directed the film,\"Crazy Horse de Paris\" [1977]. \"Paul Raymond's Erotica\" (1981) stars Brigitte Lahaie and Diana Cochran and was directed by Brian Smedley-Aston. The Dance routines were filmed at the Raymond Revuebar Theatre.\n\nIn addition to lesser-known videos such as \"A Night at the Revuebar\" (1983), the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving stripping. These included \"Flashdance\" (1983), which told the story of blue-collar worker Alexandra (Alex) Owens (Jennifer Beals), who works as an exotic dancer in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bar at night and at a steel mill as a welder during the day. Stripping also was part of \"genre\" films, such as horror thriller \"Fear City\" (1984), by Abel Ferrara, about a mass-murderer who terrorizes dancers working at a seedy strip club in Times Square, New York City. The erotic drama \"9½ Weeks\" (1986) depicted Kim Basinger stripping to the tune of \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" by Joe Cocker. \"Stripped to Kill\" (1987) was an exploitation film from Roger Corman about a lady cop who poses as a stripper to catch a murderer; which was followed by a sequel of the same name. \"Ladykillers\" (1988), was a 'whodunnit' murder mystery involving the murders of male strippers by an unknown female assailant. \"Blaze\" (1989) features Lolita Davidovitch as notorious stripper Blaze Starr.

It was released on 27 July 2017.\n\nDetective Francis McQueen, who leads the underfunded Darkside Division must investigate evil occurrences in Twin Lakes City.\n\nCreators Paul Conway and Christopher Colston originally created a short demo at a gaming convention in Galway. The demo was made in under eight hours, but received significant attention after it was posted online, promoting them to turn it into a full game. After decided to enter production on the game, they hired writer Dave McCabe and lead developer Tracey McCabe to assist in the production.\n\nDuring the development process, the team of five would do group read throughs to discuss issues and ideas, with McCabe then creating an interactive version of any ideas that they had using clipart to allow them to further map out how it would work within the game. Once an idea was decided on, the team would then start creating visuals, animations, interactions, sound and music based around the idea.\n\nThe Darkside Detective received mostly positive reviews and has a score of 75% on Metacritic. Hardcore Gamer awarded it a score of 3.5 out of 5, saying \"The Darkside Detective is a charming point and click adventure with a taste for the sillier aspects of horror.\" Video Gamer awarded it 7 out of 10, saying \"The Darkside Detective has a very distinct sense of humour that you'll either love or hate.\" Ted Hentschke of Dread Central praised the gameplay and atmosphere but criticising its short length, saying \"If the game were 50% longer, I would be in serious danger of genuinely loving it.

{"id": "1585377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1585377", "title": "The Soup", "text": "The Soup\n\nThe Soup is an American television series that aired weekly on E! from July 1, 2004 until December 18, 2015. The program was a revamped version of \"Talk Soup\" that focused on recaps of various popular culture and television moments of the week. The show was hosted by comedian Joel McHale, who provided sarcastic and satirical commentary on the various clips. On November 18, 2015, \"The Soup\" was cancelled by E! and its last episode aired December 18, 2015. On February 18, 2018, \"The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale\", a spiritual successor to \"The Soup\", premiered on Netflix.\n\n\"The Soup\" started on July 1, 2004 as the \"What The...? Awards\", but the name was changed to maintain name recognition with \"Talk Soup\".\n\nOn January 9, 2013, \"The Soup\" debuted a new graphics package, including a new logo designed by Newspeak Agency.\n\nStarting June 2, 2014, \"The Soup\" began airing live episodes. Originally only to last for one month, the program has since become a live show.\n\nOn November 18, 2015 \"The Soup\" was cancelled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the November 2015 Paris attacks due to multiple references to \"killing Baby Hitler\". As the episode was pre-filmed, it later aired on November 27, likely replacing a clip show due to it being the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe show features the host, Joel McHale, on a green-screened set with a screen to his right. The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. McHale introduces each clip, which is then played. He then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips.\n\nAlthough the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, a blog was started for \"The Soup\" on E!'s website.\n\n\"The Soup\" has its own cast of recurring characters. They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxipad (Tess Rafferty, a supervising producer and the only female writer on \"The Soup\"), two nerds who dress as \"Star Wars\" characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting sound effect purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca (Chewbacca's lawyer), and \"Spaghetti Cat\", a cat eating spaghetti from \"The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet\". Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's stage manager and former stage manager on \"Talk Soup\", and Kelly Levy (\"née\" Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, have made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying Courtney Stodden. Executive producer Edward Boyd's chihuahua Lou is used regularly in segment openings, most notably the \"Clip of the Week\", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with Joel at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week, until the intro was changed in early 2010. The current intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer Anndi McAfee and a \"reaction\" by another clip, wildly out of context.\n\nThe show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:\n\n\"The Soup\" has also featured other recurring segments:\n\nThe show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of Ryan Seacrest. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.\n\nJoel has also spoofed other actors, most notably \"\" leading man David Caruso, who plays Lieutenant Horatio Caine. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2–3 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.\n\nJoel also jokes about how self-centered Tyra Banks is on her self-titled talk show. More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's \"creepy flesh colored beard\" as well as the ages of Larry King and Regis Philbin and how they are still alive. Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses \"interns\" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to \"shoot\" Mankini, but with no effect.\n\nThe Spaghetti Cat from \"The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet\" has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.\n\nJoel has often made fun of Bruno Tonioli's flamboyancy while giving comments on \"Dancing with the Stars\" stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel \"Jazz Hands and Cold Feet\".\n\n\"The Soup\" makes jokes at the A&E TV Series, \"\". Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say \"That's Right It's Steven Seagal\", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal \"energy drink\" that would humorously float into frame.\n\nDue to NFL Coach Jimmy Johnson's recent appearance on \"\", Joel usually mentions his \"Extenze-enhanced penis\", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, \"I do.\"\n\nA number of clips have been repeatedly shown on \"The Soup\". One clip features Oprah Winfrey saying \"My va-jay-jay is painin'!\" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort. Another clip involves Whitney Houston yelling \"Kiss My Ass!\" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites. Still another clip that is often shown is of \"The Today Show\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s news correspondent Ann Curry starting her report by saying, \"Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning\", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of Kendra Wilkinson from \"The Girls Next Door\" laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of Elizabeth Taylor screaming \"Marriage?! Noooooo!\" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of Danny Noriega (\"I guess some people weren't likin' it!\"), and more recently, Tatiana Del Toro giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include Gary Busey exclaiming \"I'm going to pull your endocrine system out of your body\", Tila Tequila yelling out \"A pig's vagina!\", Michelle Galdenzi from \"Scream Queens\" saying \"and by record, I mean vagina.\", \"Big Brother\" contestants Jase Wirey and Michelle Costa \"talking\" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; \"Chicken Tetrazzini\" clip from \"Maury\", Spencer Pratt from \"The Hills\" whispering \"That's the problem\", Billy Bush saying \"It's Gross\", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice \"Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!\". Recently, the Jeffrey Osborne song, \"On the Wings of Love\", has been used to mock the current season of \"The Bachelor\". Vonda, a woman featured on the TruTv show \"Over the Limit\" has been featured saying, \"Dunka Doo Balls.\" This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from \"Fantasia for Real\" featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, \"Gurl Please\", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of \"Ma\" from TruTV's \"Ma's Roadhouse\" saying \"He's a douchebag,\" after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as Mel Gibson, has come into use. Another clip of Ryan Seacrest saying, \"Hell no, say what\", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's \"The Fashion Show\", has recently been featured in a clip saying, \"Oh, here go Hell Come.\" Frequently following \"Good Day New York\" clips, McHale will ask Greg Kelly to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, \"Science\".\n\n\"The Soup\" will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of \"\" and \"The Hills\") or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying \"We doctored that.\" However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by \"The Soup\" for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand \"We did not doctor this.\"\n\nOriginal skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are \"Spider-Man 3\" (in reference to McHale's appearance in \"Spider-Man 2\"), \" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", \" Made of Honor\", \"Righteous Kill\", \"Mamma Mia\", \" Beverly Hills Chihuahua\", \" Quarantine\", (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about Disney Channel celebrities), \"Prom Night\", \"Fast & Furious\", and a Tyler Perry movie.\n\n\nIn addition to regular episodes, special \"Best of...\" episodes of \"The Soup\" have been shown under the header \"\"The Soup\" Presents\". Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two \"Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies\" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called \"Love and Other Burning Sensations\", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on \"The Soup\" (the \"shows [they] just cannot quit\"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).\n\n\"The Soup\" started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!. By 2006 it was the third highest rated show on the network.\n\nIn July 2013, \"The Soup\" averaged 682,000 viewers, and about 56 percent of viewers watch a recorded version of the show. The 500th episode of \"The Soup\" recorded 909,000 viewers, with 653,000 of those in the 18—49 demographic.\n\nThe one-hour finale on December 18, 2015 ended with 561,000 viewers.\n\nSince E! is owned by Comcast Entertainment Group, their now-defunct sibling networks aired tailored versions for their networks, including Style, Versus and G4, all taped in the same studio and utilizing the same crew.\n\nOn August 16, 2008, Style premiered \"The Dish\", hosted by Danielle Fishel. The show focused more on celebrity, magazine, and fashion industry trends, along with style and fashion-related reality programs in more detail, including \"Project Runway\" and various shows on the shopping channels, HGTV and DIY Network. It was cancelled on March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBC and Comcast was complete. It was thought the cancellation was the direct result of former competitors Bravo and Oxygen coming under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style; the two networks and their programming had been among the major comedic targets of \"The Dish\".\n\nOn September 15, 2008, E! parent Comcast Entertainment Group announced another spin-off, this time sports-related, of the series, which aired on the group's sports network, Versus (now known as NBC Sports Network since 2012), called \"Sports Soup\" and was hosted by Matt Iseman. Debuted on October 14, the program once aired twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Later, production was reduced to weekly at 10 pm ET on Tuesdays (or later depending on the end of \"NHL on Versus\" or other sports coverage). It was cancelled on July 15, 2010.\n\nA third version, airing on G4, titled \"Web Soup\", hosted by Chris Hardwick debuted June 7, 2009 at 9 pm ET. This version is more of a blend of the commentary and reaction portions of \"The Soup\" and two other G4 programs; \"Whacked Out Videos\" and the \"Around the Net\" viral video segment which opens \"Attack of the Show\". This show ended after its 3rd season on July 20, 2011.\n\n\"Celebrity Soup\" was the British version of the American show hosted by comedian Iain Lee. Unlike \"The Soup\", \"Celebrity Soup\" airs 19 episodes in a season, instead of year-round like in the United States. It had some of the same features as the original (i.e. \"Chat Stew\"), but also has its own running gags and features. The series had a similar set, with a window overlooking London's Big Ben instead of Hollywood, as in the U.S. original.\n\n\"The Soup Investigates\" was a spin-off of The Soup. It features most of the same crew, including Joel McHale as the host. In the spin-off, the reporters go looking for potentially funny celebrity news stories. It is a spoof of investigative journalism.\n\n\n"}

It remains a staple of many shows to this day. called it one of the most popular tricks in the world.\n\nThe magician places a large metal ball on a small pedestal on a table. The ball is then covered with a large silk cloth which the magician holds above the ball. The ball then begins to lift into the air and move about under the cloth, before appearing out from under cloth to roll along the upper edge of the stretched-out cloth, or along the magician's arms. The ball may also disappear and re-appear as it moves about. The ball is finally coaxed to return to its pedestal and the cloth is removed.\n\nThe usual way this effect is done is with a rod that clips to the finger, and is hidden from view by the cloth. By simply moving his finger (generally his thumb), the magician can achieve an almost lifelike reaction from the ball. The ball and cloth have to be moved so the rod remains invisible through the performance. Considerable practice and stagecraft is required to make it appear that the cloth is being pulled about by the ball, as opposed to being under the magician's control.\n\nGlorpy, the \"trick of the millennium\", is essentially the zombie ball without the ball.\n\n"}
