It involves teams of various sizes competing to write, shoot, edit and score a short film, which must be between 1 and 7 minutes long (5 minutes in 2016), over a single 48-hour period. Developed from the US-based 48 Hour Film Project, which was run in Auckland in 2003, \"48Hours\" has been running as a New Zealand-only event since 2004. with regional competitions organised in 8 cities around New Zealand: Auckland, Hamilton, Gisborne, Rotorua, Taranaki, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. The 2018 competition will take place from 11–13 May 2018.\n\nThe event is organised by Anthony \"Ant\" Timpson. Teams attend a launch ceremony on a Friday night where each team is given a randomly selected genre within which to base their film's theme. They are also given three compulsory features which are common to all teams. These are a line of dialogue, a prop, a character, and since 2010, a \"technical\" element.\n\nAll creative work required to produce the film must be undertaken and completed within the 48 hours of the competition. This includes storylining, scriptwriting, filming, editing and audio mixing. Teams must deliver their finished film to the competition organisers by the Sunday evening to be eligible for prizes, although late deliveries will still be screened in the heats.\n\nBy 2011 the competition had grown to include more than 800 teams nationwide with at least 10,000 people believed to be involved.\n\nEvery year teams are given a number of compulsory elements to help ensure that film has been wholly created on the shoot weekend. The elements include a character with a gender-neutral name, a character trait, a line of dialogue, a prop, and as of 2010, a technical shot. As well as these, teams are randomly allocated a genre for their film. 2017 saw the introduction of themes, different elements, and the ULTRA48 Challenge for teams that elect to do it for added difficulty.\n\nAlso for 2005, there was a bonus prop of \"a red scarf\" to include.\n\nAlso for 2017, each team had to choose one theme from this list: Redemption, Love, Transformation, Sacrifice, Vengeance, Friendship, Justice, Jealous, Ambition, Fate.\n\nAfter initially being held in Auckland in 2003 as part of the international 48 Hour Film Project, the independent 48Hours began in 2004 with teams in Auckland and Wellington. At its peak in 2011, it was represented in eight cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18006192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18006192", "title": "Cinema of Moldova", "text": "Cinema of Moldova\n\nThe cinema of Moldova developed in the early 1960s during the Soviet period, experiencing a flowering of about a decade and a half. Stagnation followed, and after the Moldavian SSR became independent in 1991, the industry almost completely disappeared.\n\n1897-1939\n\nThe beginnings of Moldovan cinema are difficult to trace, owing largely to the divergent cinematic histories of the left- and right-bank regions, a division which continues today. From 1897 to 1927, film production in Moldova was sparse and remains mostly undocumented. After Bessarabia, now part of Moldova’s current territorial boundaries, was absorbed into Romania in 1918, the USSR created the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) on the left bank of the Dniester River in 1924. This newly created Soviet republic included land taken from Ukraine as well as modern-day Transnistria, a breakaway region that remains unrecognized by any UN-member nations. At that time, the USSR attempted to modernize and Sovietize the MASSR, which included cryrillicizing the Romanian language, industrializing the region, and educating many of the MASSR’s film professionals at the Odessa State College of Cinematography in neighboring Ukraine.\n\nMost of the films produced by these early Moldovan film professions were documentary works, most of which were propaganda films, such as \"Protest Rally: Remember Bessarabia\" (1928), \"The Bessarabian Agricultural Community\" (1928), and \"Five Years of the MASSR\" (1928). However, the 1928 documentary \"Everything is Quiet\" is the most noteworthy film from this period and included an entirely Moldovan film crew.\n\nDespite these efforts, the region never had its own national film studio. Throughout the MASSR’s existence, the Moldovan film industry and Ukrainian film industry were almost one and the same: in 1930, the USSR created the Moldovan cinematography department at UkraFilm, which change its title in 1934 and, again, in 1936. Additionally, many film workers involved with these early MASSR productions were Ukrainian.\n\n1939-1952\n\nIn the right-bank region, filmmaking in Bessarabia was virtually nonexistent since its cinematic identity was bound up with that of Romania’s, which, due to devastation occasioned by World War I, was progressing at a modest pace. After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, which effectively ceded Bessarabia to the USSR, the Soviet army invaded Bessarabia and took control of the region. From 1940 to 1944, Bessarabia experienced its biggest in the field of cinema since 1918. Several Russian-language films were subtitled in the Romanian language, and Soviet filmmakers began producing documentaries and newsreels about the region, such as \"On the Danube\".\n\nThis cinematic growth came to an end, though, when Nazi Germany and Romania, which had recently aligned itself with the Axis Powers, moved into Bessarabia and crossed the Dniester River into modern day Transnistria. Afterwards, all soviet republics’ film industries were enlisted into the war effort and, like the film industries of the Allied Powers, produced documentaries and newsreels about the USSR’s military activities.\n\nAfter the USSR recaptured Bessarabia and Transnistria, both regions were devastated by the war. Chişinău, the capital city of Moldova, was almost entirely destroyed from the bombing campaigns. But the Bessarabian region also faced additional hurdles, as noted by Leonid Brezhnev: Because it was not part of the USSR during the 1920s, Bassarabia remained undeveloped in comparison with its Soviet counterparts. Hence, rapid collectivization and sovietization followed the Second World War. Although there were efforts to cultivate a Moldovan film culture in this period—Russian-language films continued to be subtitled in Romanian, the government published soviet newsreels focusing on Moldova, etc.—the cinematic situation remained stagnant until the 1950s.\n\n1952-1970\n\nOn April 26, 1952, after much planning, the USSR Ministry of Cinematography created the Documentary Film Studio in Chişinău. During the first year two documentaries, \"Kodry\" and \"Moldovan Cannery\" appeared. However, these films, like those of the MASSR, lacked a distinctly Moldovan identity. The directors working in Moldova at this point were from Moscow and Odessa, in part because there were no trained Moldovan film professionals. Between 1952 and 1957, six documentaries were screened.\n\nAfterwards, more Moldovan filmmakers began to participate in local productions, which caused the MSSR to take an increased interest in the state's role in developing a national film culture. To that end, on January 24, 1957, the MSSR Council of Ministers renamed the national film studio the \"Studio for Fiction Movies and Chronicle Documentaries from Chişinău,\" also known as \"Moldova-Film\". Moldova-Film was far more productive than its predecessor. Funded by the State, Moldova-Film turned out 160 feature films, 1,500 documentaries and educational shorts, and over 100 animated films between 1957 and 1992. A few years later, in 1967, the MSSR founded Telefilm Chișinău, which, like Moldova-Film, received state funding and was similarly productive, producing over 300 documentaries, music videos, and telefilms during its existence.\n\nIt was during this period that many notable Moldovan filmmakers began receiving training at VGIK in Moscow and returning to Moldova to shoot films in their home country. This allowed Moldovan cinema to develop a distinct identity. During Khruschev's thaw, which ushered increased liberties in artistic expression, Moldovan filmmakers such as Emil Loteanu and Valeriu Gagiu produced films which comprised the “Moldovan Poetic Film,” a genre which fused realism with romance and enjoyed wide appeal in the USSR.\n\nHowever, as in the rest of the Soviet republics, the state exercised a considerable influence in the content of these films, and with the rise of Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary came a resurgence of official censorship. Socialist Realism, once \"de rigueur\" under Stalin’s leadership, became, again, the artistic model for film professions; and critiques of Soviet history were vehemently disfavored by party leaders. For instance, Valeriu Gagiu’s A Taste of Bread (1966), about Moldovan resistance during Stalin’s tight-fisted agricultural collectivization policies after the Second World War, elicited outrage from party leaders, despite the film’s enthusiastic reception at film festivals. Hence, in keeping with the state’s systematic suppression of Moldovan cinema and culture, the Central Committee of the Moldovan Communist Party banned the film in 1970. Other Moldovan films suffered similar fates.\n\n1970-1990\n\nDuring the post-Thaw era of the 1970s, characterized by stagnation, studios continued to curtail artistic freedoms, though there were a few artistic successes at this time, such as Emil Loteanu’s \"Lăutarii\" (1972) and \"Gypsies Are Found near Heaven\" (1976). But by the 1980s, \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost\" occasioned a resurgence of artistic freedom and impressive Moldovan films, like Valeriu Jereghi’s \"Iona\" (1987), Gheorghe Urschi’s \"Whoever Swears, He Pays\" (1989), and Victor Bucătaru’s \"Crucifix\" (1990).\n\nIn 1957, the first fiction comedy film was called \"Cînd omul nu-i la locul lui\" (\"When the man is not himself\") after a script written by Ion Druta.\n\nIn 1968, the first cartoon film, \"The Goat with Three Kids\", was released, a film inspired by Ion Creanga's fairy-tale with the same title. In 1972, the satirical series \"Usturici\" appeared.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1982, 120 fiction movies, 800 documentaries, 750 editions of the cinema magazine \"Soviet Moldova\", 40 editions of \"Usturici\" and 40 cartoons were filmed at the Moldova-Film studio. It also dubbed 12 fiction movies and 70 short stories annually by the end of the 1980s.\n\nA cinema was built in the beginning of the 1950s in the center of Chişinău, which is now part of the Moldovan \"Patria\" chain.\n\nThe first internationally acclaimed success was the film of Moldovan producer Mihail Kalik - \"Lullaby\" (), released in 1960 at Moldova-Film studios. The movie was awarded the \"Prize for Participation\" at the international cinema competition at the Locarno International Film Festival, bringing attention to the emergent Moldovan film industry.\n\nAnother international success was \"Man Is Walking After the Sun\" (\"Man Is Following the Sun\" ), written by Valeriu Gagiu and Mihail Kalik. The world press compared this movie to the Albert Lamorisse movie \"Le Ballon Rouge\", where, just as in the Moldovan movie, the main hero was a little boy. Vadim Derbenev, the cameraman, was awarded the special jury diploma at the International Cinema Festival in Helsinki for his work.\n\nAnother one of the first Moldovan films was the \"Ataman of Codru\" (), which enjoyed success in Asia and Latin America. The viewers called the movie \"Ataman Kadyr\".\n\nThe Moldovan breakthrough in the world's cinema industry was a film written by Ion Druţă and producer and cameraman Vadim Derbenev - \"Last Month of Autumn\" (). The film received prizes at the Mar del Plata Film Festival, including the \"Sympathy Prize of Viewers\". Evgueniy Lebedev was awarded the main prize of the festival - the \"Big Southern Cross\" - in the best male role nomination. \"La Nación\" described the film as a \"remarkably beautiful work\". \"La Prensa\" wrote \"This film, amongst all the mess that flooded the cinema world invites us to the sources of the true reachess of life\". Besides appraisal in Argentina, the movie was awarded the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival in 1966. At the International Film Festival Kino Pavasaris in Vilnius, the director Vadim Derbenev won \"Best Production\". However, in Vilnius, the film was awarded only the second main film prize, the first place being taken by Vytautas Žalakevičius's film \"Nobody Wanted to Die\" ().\n\n\"Lăutarii\" by Emil Loteanu (producer Vitaliy Kalashnikov, composer Eugen Doga) was a success, particularly in Italy. The movie received four prizes, including the \"Prize of Viewers' Sympathy\" and the second main prize \"Silver Shell\". Norwegian newspaper \"Arbeiterbladet\" compared the Moldovan movie to the Broadway musical \"The Sound of Music\". Czech weekly \"Film a Divadlo\" wrote \"Every nation expresses to the best its deepest feelings, but the Moldovan one did it the best\". In 1975, the movie won in the category of \"Best Foreign Film\", leaving behind traditional Hollywood productions. During the week of Soviet Cinema in Naples, the film was awarded the \"Silver Nymph\".\n\n\"Red Meadows\" by Emil Loteanu was also another major Moldovan success at the Locarno International Film Festival. România Liberă highlighted the symbolism of this art work, which made it an unforgettable sight\".\n\nVery few films have been made in Moldova since independence: the government has failed to protect its domestic industry and funding is rare (save for occasional co-productions). The country also has the world's second-lowest cinema attendance rate.\n\nThe animation movies produced at Moldova-Studios reach an international audience. The cartoon \"Haiduc\", produced by Leonid Gorokhov and Yuriy Katsap, with scenario written by Vlad Druc, was awarded the Grand-Prix of the Cannes Film Festival in the cartoon category.\n\nThe top Soviet pop star Sofia Rotaru starred in the musical movie filmed at Moldova-Film studios called \"Dnestrovskiye melodiy\".\n\n\n"}

The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography.\n\nThe cinematographer selects the camera, film stock, lenses, filters, etc., to realize the scene in accordance with the intentions of the director. Relations between the cinematographer and director vary; in some instances the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence; in others, the director allows little to none, even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection. Such a level of involvement is not common once the director and cinematographer have become comfortable with each other; the director will typically convey to the cinematographer what is wanted from a scene visually, and allow the cinematographer latitude in achieving that effect.\n\nSeveral American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' DP; Jan de Bont, cinematographer on films as \"Die Hard\" and \"Basic Instinct\", directed \"Speed\" and \"Twister\". In 2014, Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three \"Batman\" films, made his directorial debut with \"Transcendence\"; whilst British cinematographers Jack Cardiff and Freddie Francis regularly moved between the two positions.\n\nIn the infancy of motion pictures, the cinematographer was usually also the director and the person physically handling the camera. As the art form and technology evolved, a separation between director and camera operator emerged. With the advent of artificial lighting and faster (more light sensitive) film stocks, in addition to technological advancements in optics, the technical aspects of cinematography necessitated a specialist in that area.\n\nCinematography was key during the silent movie era; with no sound apart from background music and no dialogue, the films depended on lighting, acting, and set.\n\nIn 1919 Hollywood, the then-new motion picture capital of the world, one of the first (and still existing) trade societies was formed: the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), which stood to recognize the cinematographer's contribution to the art and science of motion picture making. Similar trade associations have been established in other countries too.\n\nThere are a number of national associations of cinematographers which represent members (irrespective of their official titles) and which are dedicated to the advancement of cinematography. These include:\n\n\nThe A.S.C. defines cinematography as:\n\n\n"}

Various influential comedy hip hop groups began in the late 1980s, such as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Kid 'n Play, Das EFX and Fu-Schnickens and throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, rappers including Eminem, Ludacris and Afroman gained popularity, as did rappers such as Hopsin. Rucka Rucka Ali is an artist who experiments with comedy hip hop filled with racism, such as his song, \"What The Black Says\". \"Weird Al\" Yankovic has made entries to this music genre, along with Nerdcore. \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis is also a well-known song of comedy hip hop. While few rappers make comedy hip hop their focus with the exception of a few, mainly Lil Dicky and Ugly God, the genre maintains a substantial loyal following.\n\nOutside the English-speaking world, the genre spread in the 1990s, with bands and artists such as the German group Fettes Brot, the Swedish-Finnish artist Markoolio and the French group Svinkels.\n\n"}

In this type of sentimental comedy, the impending tragedy was resolved at the end, amid reconciliations and floods of tears. Plays of this genre that ended unhappily nevertheless allowed the audience to see that a \"moral triumph\" had been earned for the suffering heroes and heroines. \n\nThomas Heywood's masterpiece, \"A Woman kilde with kindnesse\" (acted 1603; printed 1607), can be considered a forerunner of this genre. \n\nIn Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée's \"Mélanide\", the genre is fully developed. Comedy was no longer to provoke laughter, but tears. The innovation consisted in destroying the sharp distinction then existing between tragedy and comedy in French literature. Indications of this change had been already offered in the work of Marivaux, and La Chaussée's plays led naturally to the domestic drama of Diderot and of Sedaine. \n\nLouis-Sébastien Mercier considered himself a supporter of this genre.\n\nBy blurring the distinctions between comedy and tragedy, the \"comédie larmoyante\" formed the basis for the subsequent genre known as \"Drame Bourgeois\", the form of realistic comedy heralded by Denis Diderot's \"Le Fils naturel\" (published 1757, performed 1771).\n\nThere are many examples of 'comédie larmoyante' in both French and Italian opera where it gave birth to the genre of opera semiseria: André Grétry's \"Lucile\", Nicolas Dalayrac's Nina, ou La folle par amour, Pasquale Anfossi's \"La vera costanza\" (1776) and Joseph Haydn's work of the same name (1779).\n"}

They are typically used in television productions where they can be held off-camera and are unseen by the audience. Cue cards are still currently being used on many late night talk shows including \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" and \"Conan\" as well as variety and sketch comedy shows like \"Saturday Night Live\" due to the practice of last minute script changes. Many other TV shows, including game and reality shows, still use cue cards due to their mobility, as a teleprompter only allows the actor or broadcaster to look directly into the camera.\n\nCue cards were originally used to aid ageing actors. One early use was by John Barrymore in the late 1930s.\n\nCue cards however did not become widespread until 1949 when Barney McNulty a CBS page and former military pilot, was asked to write ailing actor Ed Wynn's script lines on large sheets of paper to help him remember his script. McNulty volunteered for this duty because his training as a pilot taught him to write very quickly and clearly. McNulty soon saw the necessity of this concept and formed the company \"Ad Libs.\" McNulty continued to be Bob Hope's personal Cue Card man until he stopped performing. McNulty who died in 2000 at the age of 77 was known in Hollywood as the \"Cue-Card King\".\n\nMarlon Brando was also a frequent user of cue cards, feeling that this helped bring realism and spontaneity to his performances, instead of giving the impression that he was merely reciting a writer's speech.

Members include household names in the gambling industry such as Bet365, Betfair, Ladbrokes and William Hill.\n\nThe GBGA's purpose is to speak on behalf of the Gibraltar remote gambling licensees on matters of legal and regulatory importance to the gambling industry, when engaging in dialogue with relevant authorities around the world. It also aims to provide governments, legislators and policy makers with a better understanding of the gambling industry and its importance to Gibraltar. The GBGA has operated since January 2005, however in April 2013 it was incorporated into corporate form.\n\nPeter Howitt, was appointed Chief Executive of the GBGA in May 2013. Peter is the founder of Ramparts, a law firm in Gibraltar. The GBGA also receives consultancy advice from Sir Peter Caruana, the ex Chief Minister of Gibraltar.\n\nThe GBGA stated in 2013 that it may seek a judicial review of what became the Gambling (Licensing & Advertising) Act 2014 on the basis that it breaches EU law. The Act includes the introduction of a UK licensing regime and a tax on gambling of 15% in the UK (point of consumption tax). The changes to tax legislation are anticipated to raise over £300 million in UK tax revenues. \n\nPeter Howitt attended a session at UK Parliament to give oral evidence regarding the proposal, heard by MPs including Helen Grant the Minister for the Department for Culture Media and Sport.\n\nIn November 2013 the GBGA set out its proposals for an alternative passporting regime whereby gambling companies holding remote gambling licences from reputable jurisdictions could rely on their existing licence to operate in the UK without having to obtain a separate UK Gambling Commission Licence. The proposals can be found at UK Parliament Publications\n\nOn 18 June 2014 the GBGA wrote to both the UK Government and UK Gambling Commission putting them on notice of a claim for judicial review of the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014 on the basis that the Act is 'unlawful' and 'unworkable'.\n\nThe GBGA has an affiliate partnership with the European Betting and Gaming Association (EGBA), and is the first national member of the EGBA. This partnership is intended to enable both associations to more effectively consult at EU level on matters of importance to the gambling industry, such as anti-money laundering legislation.\n\n"}

The graphical form is an alternate compact representation of a game using the interaction among participants.\n\nConsider a game with formula_1 players with formula_2 strategies each. We will represent the players as nodes in a graph in which each player has a utility function that depends only on him and his neighbors. As the utility function depends on fewer other players, the graphical representation would be smaller.\n\nA graphical game is represented by a graph formula_3, in which each player is represented by a node, and there is an edge between two nodes formula_4 and formula_5 iff their utility functions are depended on the strategy which the other player will choose. Each node formula_4 in formula_3 has a function formula_8, where formula_9 is the degree of vertex formula_4. formula_11 specifies the utility of player formula_4 as a function of his strategy as well as those of his neighbors.\n\nFor a general formula_1 players game, in which each player has formula_2 possible strategies, the size of a normal form representation would be formula_15. The size of the graphical representation for this game is formula_16 where formula_17 is the maximal node degree in the graph. If formula_18, then the graphical game representation is much smaller.\n\nIn case where each player's utility function depends only on one other player:\nThe maximal degree of the graph is 1, and the game can be described as formula_1 functions (tables) of size formula_20.

Both are based off the real Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi, but with different appearances and exaggerated personalities. They travel around the world on their customized tour bus along with their well-intentioned yet greedy manager Kaz Harada (Keone Young). From rocking out at a concert to hanging out in their hometown of Tokyo, the duo take the world by storm with their musical talent, trend-setting style, and humor, dishing out lessons in J-pop justice and establishing the international language of \"cool\" along the way.\n\nSecondary characters include: Jang-Keng (Grey DeLisle) and Tekirai (Janice Kawaye), the duo's pet cats who enjoy tormenting Kaz; Harmony (Sandy Fox), a six-year-old girl who is the self-proclaimed \"Number One Fan\" of Puffy AmiYumi and (later) Kaz and constantly stalks them; Eldwin Blair (Nathan Carlson), a sinister land developer who tries to tear down beloved places for his own selfish needs; King Chad (Katie Leigh), a selfish \"bad boy\" who is a master of the card game \"Stu-Pi-Doh!\" (a parody of \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\"); the evil Talent Suckers (Nathan Carlson; Corey Burton), a vampire rock trio from Transylvania; and Atchan (Rob Paulsen), a caricature of Vo Atsushi (lead singer of the pop band New Rote'ka) who speaks in third-person and thinks he is a superhero.\n\nThe animated Puffy AmiYumi travel all over the world in their tour bus. While appearing the same size as a regular bus on the outside, it appears to have enough internal space to house the girls' rooms (including full-sized beds), Kaz's room, their equipment, televisions, and computers, among other things. In the episode \"Domo\", Kaz refers to an upstairs area. It also seems capable of running on autopilot, as Kaz, Ami, and Yumi are sometimes sitting in the rear cabin of the bus while traveling. Occasionally, the rear door has been opened to receive packages delivered by a boy on a scooter.\n\nDuring the first season, the show included live-action clips of the real Ami and Yumi making childish commentary (in English and non-subtitled Japanese) at the beginning and end of each episode. They only performed short clips at the beginning of the show during the second and third seasons. Starting with the second season, the duo was sometimes shown holding title cards introducing the cartoon segments. At the end of the episode \"Sitcomi Yumi\", Ami and Yumi watched television and saw the animated Kaz with the real Ami and Yumi. All of the live-action clips were produced by Freegate, Ltd.\n\nThe real PUFFY performs the cartoon's theme song (which is also in Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese in the respective regions), and many episodes feature one or more of the duo's songs playing in the background, along with music by their Puerto Rican muse Andy Sturmer.\n\nThough the characters speak English, the script intersperses their vernacular with Japanese speech, especially when the characters react to events that they find to be surprising. Calling out \"Tasukete!\" instead of \"Help!\" is commonly used.\n\nAccording to Register, the target audience of the show is boys and girls from 6 to 11 years old. However, it also has a cult following of teen and adult fans of the real-life Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura who make up the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi. Register, who was a fan of the band, wished to spread its fame to other parts of the world and thus created the series.\n\nThe series features the adventures of animated versions of the duo, who have been immensely popular in Japan since making their debut in 1996. The group now has its own U.S. albums, including a 2004 companion album to this program, and was known to viewers of Cartoon Network in the USA for performing the theme to the \"Teen Titans\" animated series. During production of the series, DeLisle learned some Japanese from Kawaye and Young, both of whom speak the language fluently.\n\nThe cartoon was the only one at the time produced entirely in the United States (thus making their choice of characters quite ironic), with characters designed by famed Canadian artist Lynne Naylor which got the show nominated for the coveted Annie Award. It used a combination of Macromedia Flash and traditional cel animation. Each program was 30 minutes long (with commercials) and featured three seven-minute segments that borrow inspiration from Japanese animation (such as \"Pokémon\", the Sunbow Productions animated series based on Hasbro properties, and \"ThunderCats\").\n\nSam Register originally pitched the idea of Puffy AmiYumi having their own television series on Cartoon Network and afterwards Renegade Animation developed a test short on April 22, 2003 in hopes of making the channel greenlight the show's production. Renegade Animation originally, at first, created other Cartoon Network pilots before \"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\"; two of which feature \"Captain Sturdy\"; one in 2001, entitled \"Back in Action\", and the other in 2003, entitled \"The Originals\", but they were ultimately rejected, and Renegade Animation then started working on \"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\" starting with its pilot on April 22, 2003. The pilot was not broadcast, but was initially successful, and got the green-light from Cartoon Network. Finally, it was shown in non-full version as a preview on Cartoon Network DVDs and VHS tapes.\n\nThe series was officially announced at Cartoon Network's upfront on February 26, 2004. It was originally planned to premiere in December 2004 but was later pushed back to November 19.\n\nOn October 2, 2006, the show's crew announced on their blog (puffycrew.blogspot.com) that Cartoon Network had cancelled \"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\" after three seasons and 39 episodes due to Sam Register leaving the channel. Afterwards, the network removed all mention of the show from its website.\n\nCartoon Network did not acknowledge the show again until 2012, when Ami and Yumi appeared on Cartoon Network's 20th anniversary poster.\n\nYumi appeared in a cameo in Cartoon Network's OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes special, Crossover Nexus.\n\n\"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\" premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network on November 19, 2004. After ending on June 27, 2006, the show continued to rerun until December 22, 2006, where it aired in reruns normally, and occasionally, would be one of the few non-Cartoon Cartoons to air in reruns on \"The Cartoon Cartoon Show\" before being removed from the network's schedule.\n\nSince Cartoon Network is available worldwide, the show has been dubbed into multiple languages and aired on Cartoon Network worldwide. In Canada, the series premiered on YTV on September 5, 2005. In Japan, the show began airing on Cartoon Network in English with Japanese subtitles in 2005. A dubbed version began airing on TV Tokyo's Oha Suta block on October 6, 2005, and started to air on January 8, 2006, on Cartoon Network Japan.\n\nIn Germany, the show aired on Cartoon Network Germany with all episodes. It premiered in 2005 on the Cartoon Network's block of Kabel eins. The show stopped airing there after two seasons in 2006. The reason was that Cartoon Network Germany launched and most of the shows moved there.\n\nIn Australia, the show premiered on the 3 April 2005. It stopped airing on Cartoon Network Australia in November 2008. The third season was never shown there. From August to November 2009, the Australian channel GO! showed the last season instead and was abandoned in January 2010.\n\n\"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\" received mostly positive reviews and became one of Cartoon Network's top rated and most popular series. The series earned a 6.2/10 on IMDb, and a 7.4/10 on TV.com.\n\n\"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\" debuted on Cartoon Network on November 19, 2004 at 7:30 PM ET/PT with two half-hour episodes. During that time, it scored the highest-ever Kids 2-11 rating and delivery and the second highest Kids 6-11 rating (4.4) and delivery (1,068,000) ever for an original series premiere. The show also charted double-digit increases with Girls 6-11 in ratings and delivery for Cartoon Network's Fridays programming block. During the following week, the show became the network's top-rated hit for kids 6-11. It also increased Cartoon Network's audience among that age group by 49% over the previous year.\n\nThe series has been nominated three times for the Annie Award. Two of them came in 2005 and one came in 2006.\n\n\nThere are two video games released by D3Publisher of America (D3PA) based on the show.\n\n\n\n"}

To accompany The Accomplishments Swift also publishes an Elegy for Partridge in which, typical of Swift’s satire, he blames not only Partridge, but those who purchase the Almanacs as well:\nThe hoax, gaining immense popularity, plagued Partridge till the \"real\" end of his life. Mourners, who believed him to be dead, often kept him awake at night crying outside his window. Accounts of an undertaker arriving at his house to arrange drapes for the mourning, an elegy being printed and even a gravestone being carved, all culminate to Partridge publishing a letter in hopes to have a last word on the matter and proclaim (and reclaim) himself as living. In 1709 Swift, writing as Bickerstaff for the last time, publishes A Vindication of Isaac Bickerstaff in which he abandons any real attempt to maintain the hoax. Bickerstaff counter-argues Partridge's letter of proclamation disputing, “\" They were sure no man alive ever to writ such damned stuff as this\".” He goes on to sarcastically reason that “death is defined by all Philosophers [as a] separation of the soul and body. [Partridge’s wife] has gone about for some time to every Alley in the neighborhood…\"that her husband had neither life nor soul in him\".”\n\nLater in 1709, Richard Steele bolstered the release of his new paper \"The Tatler\" by naming the fictitious Isaac Bickerstaff Esq. as editor. \"The Tatler\" had occasional contributions from Swift, although largely written by Steele and Joseph Addison.\n\nBenjamin Franklin based the persona of \"Poor Richard\", the author of \"Poor Richard's Almanack\", on Swift's Bickerstaff character.\n\nH. P. Lovecraft used the pseudonym \"Isaac Bickerstaffe [sic], Jr.\" in 1914 for a series of letters to the editor of \"The Providence Evening News\", refuting the predictions of an astrologer the paper published.\n\nThe Canadian caricaturist Don Evans (born Toronto, 1936) published in 1975-85 three volumes of cartoons under the pseudonym Isaac Bickerstaff. He lives in Orillia, Ontario, where he is active in local politics. Personal archives including 300 drawings are at the University of Calgary.\n\nIn the novel \"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\" (2008) and its eponymous 2018 film adaptation, the lead character, author Juliet Ashton, writes under the pen name Izzy Bickerstaff.\n\n"}

Japanese variety shows are predominately made to be weird and extremely fast-paced as for entertainment purposes and are primarily scheduled during prime television time. They usually feature a variety of hosts that include, but are not limited to celebrities, comedians, J-pop Idols, and so on. The typical Variety show will typically involve eating weird or disgusting things, playing games, odd questions, and more.\n\nJapanese variety shows have been around since the 1950s and there are many of them. There are Variety shows that deal with eating weird foods to playing weird games. Japanese Variety shows see a lot of interest in the United States and a lot of Japan is classified and stereotyped because of these variety shows. There are a variety of memes that are circulating around the world that try to show how \"weird\" Japan is. People were drawn to these quiz like shows with their bizarre questions and impossible scenarios. Watching people make fools of themselves was extremely entertaining and to think it all started with a basic game show that was similar to charades called \"Gesture\". The second longest-running Japanese television show, which is a comedy, is \"Shoten\" which began running in 1966 on Nippon TV. Television in Japan made a big impact in the 1930s but then was put to a halt because of WWII. After WWII NHK and Nippon television were able to start up again around 1953. One of the first shows to have started on Nippon TV was \"Downtown no Gaki Tsukai ya Arahende\", which started in 1989 and is still running to this day with 1378 episodes as of Oct 29, 2017. Takeshi's Castle is yet another older show that had aired between 1986 and 1990 with 133 episodes total.\n\nJapanese television programs such as Music Station and Utaban continue in an almost pristine format from the same variety shows of years before. The only major changes have been the increasing disappearance of live backup music since the 1980s.\n\nA once-popular host Kyosen Ōhashi said, \"Weird shows that are called Variety only exists in Japan.\"\n\nOne of the more well-circulated clips is a segment in Gaki no Tsukai, hosted by the comedy duo Downtown. In one part, if the male contestants fail to say a tongue-twister correctly, they get hit in the crotch by a spring-loaded pole (The Chinko Machine, or, literally, the Penis Machine), causing great pain. Hitoshi Matsumoto attempted to withdraw but the host - his comedy partner and co-host Masatoshi Hamada, cajoled him back on the platform.\n\nJapanese game shows have gained popularity around the world in recent years. \"Hole in the Wall\" or \"Brain Wall\" have sold rights to countries like Russia, China, Argentina and Australia. America has even caught on to adapting some of these quirky style game shows. Both FOX and ABC have purchased rights to different versions of some popular Japanese Games Shows set to air in the Summer and Fall of 2008. One of the popular names that premiered on ABC was \"I survived a Japanese Game Show\". Another one that was an adaptation of \"I survived a Japanese Game Show.\" is \"Japanizi\" which wasn't premiered on the typical FOX or ABC, but was premiered on Disney XD and YTV in Canada and the United States.\n\nABC has been sued by TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) for their \"Wipeout\" program allegedly copying \"Sasuke\" and \"Takeshi's Castle\".\n\nThe BBC also has its own version of \"Hole in the Wall\" in the United Kingdom, while Cartoon Network has the American version of \"Hole in the Wall\" with Teck Holmes.\n\nSweden also had a version of their own Japanese game show that was titled \"Hjälp! Jag är med i en japansk tv-show\", which literally translates to \"Help! I am in a Japanese T.V. Show.\" They did take most of the idea from the American \"I survived a Japanese Game Show\" and made it their own.\n\n"}
{"id": "40584421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40584421", "title": "Jest book", "text": "Jest book\n\nJest books (or Jestbooks) are collections of jokes and humorous anecdotes in book form - a literary genre which reached its greatest importance in the early modern period.\n\nThe oldest surviving collection of jokes is the Byzantine \"Philogelos\" from the first millennium. In Western Europe, the medieval fabliau and the Arab/Italian novella\nbuilt up a large body of humorous tales; but it was only with the \"Facetiae\" of Poggio (1451) that the anecdote first appears rendered down into joke form (with prominent punchline) in an early modern collection.\n\nLike his immediate successors Heinrich Bebel and Girolamo Morlini, Poggio translated his folk material from their original language into Latin, the universal European language of the time. From such universal collections, developed the particular vernacular jestbooks of the various European countries in the sixteenth century.\n\nTudor and Stuart jest books were typically anonymous collections of individual jests in English, a mix of verse and prose perhaps more comparable to the latter-day magazine than to a normal book. Some, however (following a German model), did attempt to link their jokes into a picaresque sort of narrative around one, often roguish hero, as with Richard Tarlton.\n\nJest books took a generally mocking tone, with civility, and social superiors like the 'stupid scholar' as favourite targets.\n\nThe low-life, realistic tone of the jest book, akin to coney-catching pamphlets, fed into the early English novels (or at least prose fiction) of writers like Thomas Nashe and Thomas Deloney.\n\nJestbooks also contributed to popular stage entertainment, through such dramatists as Marlowe and Shakespeare. Playbooks and jestbooks were treated as forms of light entertainment, with jokes from the one being recycled in the other, and vice versa.\n\nAdvances in printing meant that quantitatively jestbooks reached their greatest circulation in the 17th and 18th centuries; but qualitatively their contents was increasingly either a repetition of earlier publications or an artificial imitation of what had in the Elizabethan jest book been a genuine folk content.\n\nBowdlerisation in the 19th century completed the fall of the English-language jest book from Elizabethan vitality to subsequent triviality.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8852887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8852887", "title": "Jesus and Mo", "text": "Jesus and Mo\n\nJesus and Mo is a British webcomic created by an artist using the pseudonym Mohammed Jones. Launched in November 2005, the comic is published on its eponymous website once a week now.\n\nThe comic is simply drawn, typically using a single image for each face, each of which is duplicated for each panel in the strip. It features two present-day religious prophets, Jesus and Mo. While Jesus is portrayed as the bona fide Christian Jesus, Mo claims to be a body double, using casuistry to circumvent the Islamic restriction against pictorial depictions of Muhammad.\n\nJesus and Mo share a flat (and a bed), and occasionally venture outside, principally to a public house, \"The Cock and Bull\", where they drink Guinness and engage in conversation and debate with an atheist female bartender known simply as Barmaid, who is never drawn but is characterised only as an out-of-frame speech bubble. The barmaid functions as the voice of reason when criticising the Abrahamic religions or religion in general. Other times, Jesus or Mo may act as the voice of reason depending on which religion a particular comic aims to criticise. Jesus will act as the author's mouthpiece if the comic aims to criticise Islam while the character Mo will be used to criticise Christianity. They also converse with each other on a park bench.\n\nThe Abrahamic prophet Moses appears in some cartoons. The Hindu deity Ganesh made a one-time appearance; both Jesus and Mo mocked his depicted weight and four arms. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, has also appeared: his face hidden by a hat, a reference to Smith supposedly reading seeing stones by putting them inside a stovepipe hat and sticking his face inside.\n\nIn the comic for 24 September 2008, the author used animation (blinking eyes) in the final panel. Starting with the strip released on 10 November 2009, both of the principal figures were redrawn in a somewhat cleaner style.\n\nThe comic consists mainly of religious satire, often criticising arguments for religion, religious texts and decrees and the actions of believers. As the comic centres on Christian and Muslim figures, the satire is generally directed at the two religions, though some critiques apply to many forms of theism.\n\nEpisodes from \"Jesus and Mo\" have been published in paperback. Strips 1–50 are published in \"Vol 1 \"Where's the soap?\"\" and strips 51–100 in \"Vol 2 \"Transubstantiated\"\". \"Vol 3 \"Things Not Seen\"\" contains strips 101–140, as well as 10 previously unreleased strips. A fourth compendium of 140 strips '\"Big Al\"' was published in 2008. All print copies are published by Lulu.\n\nThe strip is published sporadically in the British magazine \"The Freethinker\". Three strips were printed in the Danish newspaper \"Information\" and one in their online version on 2007-03-22.\n\nMembers of the London School of Economics Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society were ordered to cover-up their Jesus and Mo T-shirts at the LSE Students' Union Freshers' Fair in October 2013. A new comic was published in response.\nIn December, the University apologised for the incident.\n\nMuslim Liberal Democrat politician Maajid Nawaz tweeted a picture of one of the \"Jesus and Mo\" T-shirts, after the cartoon came up in a discussion on a BBC programme \"The Big Questions\". On the programme, the production team stopped participants from being shown wearing T-shirts with the cartoon, which depicted Jesus saying \"Hey\" and \"Mo\" saying \"How ya doing?\". The BBC had feared a hostile response from some Muslims. On Twitter, Nawaz later wrote that he did not find the T-shirts offensive and claimed he received death threats for this stance.\n\n\n"}

When her complaints were ignored, she sued the author of the entry (Hiroo Yamagata), the publisher and Shufu-no-Tomo-sha, the distributor of the book, for what she termed \"textual harassment.\" The lawsuit was broadly supported by Japanese writers. The Japan PEN Club established a Women Writer's Committee, with feminist critic Kazuko Saegusa as chair, and Kotani as sub-chair.

She attended a costume party at the 17th Nihon SF Taikai (also known as \"Ashinocon\") science fiction convention in 1978 wearing a costume based on the cover art for Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel \"A Fighting Man of Mars\". This costume has sometimes been misreported as a Triton costume (from the manga \"Triton of the Sea\") due to its visual similarity and because Kotani was known at the time as a member of the TRITON fan club. She was one of about the twenty people at the event wearing a costume; the others were either members of the same \"Triton of the Sea\" fan club or of , the antecedent of the Gainax anime studio. Despite being a costume party, most attendees wore ordinary clothing.\n\nWorks by Kotani include:\n\n"}

The displays include costumes, set designs, autograph scores, and musical instruments of historical interest as well as paintings of musicians and actors, and a range of related paraphernalia including precious ceramic figures portraying characters from the commedia dell'arte, and board games which used to be played in the theatre's foyer.\n\nThe Biblioteca Livia Simoni, the museum's library, is situated at the II floor of the Museum. It was formed in 1952 with 40,000 volumes donated by author and \"Corriere della Sera\" critic Renato Simoni; it is named in honour of his mother.

He served as President and COO of MCA Inc. and Universal Studios for over 40 years.\n\nSheinberg, the son of Jewish immigrants, a Ukrainian mother and a Polish father, grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas where he was born on January 14, 1935. In 1955, Sheinberg graduated from Columbia University and subsequently attended Columbia Law School, as both a Harlan Fiske Stone and James Kent Scholar, where he obtained his JD. Sheinberg is a recipient of Columbia Law School's highest honors awarded to alumni: the Medal of Excellence and the John Jay Award. \n\nIn the summer of 1958, he arrived in California where he accepted a teaching position at UCLA School of Law. In 1959 while awaiting the results of his California Bar Examination, Sid joined the legal department of Revue Productions, the former television subsidiary of MCA Inc., and began his career in the entertainment industry. In the late 1960s, Sheinberg had seen Steven Spielberg's first short film, Amblin, and signed the director, then 20, to a contract. Sheinberg gave Steven Spielberg his first job in 1968. Having the benefit of being guided by Lew Wasserman, Sheinberg acknowledged that an essential part of being a mentor is having confidence in the people you're guiding and mentoring. Together they transformed Universal from a second-string studio, dependent on its TV productions, into a major player.\n\nIn June 1973, Sheinberg was elected President and Chief Operating Officer of MCA, Inc. and Universal Studios, serving alongside Lew Wasserman. Sheinberg is credited with discovering director Steven Spielberg and signing him to the MCA/Universal Television division under a 7-year contract. Sheinberg told him, \"a lot of people will stick with you in success; I'll stick with you in failure.\"\n\nUnder Sheinberg's leadership, Universal released the highest-grossing films of the last three decades of the twentieth century. Those films being Universal/Spielberg projects, beginning with 1975's \"Jaws\", 1982's \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" and concluding with 1993's \"Jurassic Park\".\n\nDuring pre-production, \"Jaws\" was always on thin ice. Sheinberg attached Spielberg to the project and despite many headwinds, pushed for the picture to be released. When 1975's Jaws ran over budget, Sheinberg had Spielberg's back — what skeptics dismissed as an overpriced B-movie became a horror classic that defined the new summer-blockbuster genre. (The $471 million it collected worldwide would be more than $1.9 billion today.)\n\nOther high-performing films credited to him are \"Schindler's List\" (1993) and \"Back to the Future\" (1985). Sheinberg famously wanted to change the name from \"Back to the Future\" to \"Space Man From Pluto\" despite the film having nothing to do with outer space, spacemen, or the dwarf planet Pluto.\n\nIn 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel \"Schindler's Ark\", which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. Sheinberg sent director Spielberg a copy of the book along with a \"New York Times\" review. Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made \"Jurassic Park\" first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed \"Schindler\" I wouldn't be able to do \"Jurassic Park\".\" The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable. Spielberg forewent a salary for the film, calling it \"blood money\", and believed the film would flop. The film was a box office success, bringing in over $320 million and is considered a historic motion picture that poignantly captured the holocaust.\n\nSheinberg saw significant opportunity in the music industry and led MCA Music Entertainment's (later renamed Universal Music Group) acquisition of Motown in 1988 for $61 million and Geffen Records in 1990 for $550 million.\n\nIn 1982, Sheinberg was quoted saying, \"You'd better start saving money to pay your attorney's fees, I view litigation as a profit center\" during a meeting to get Nintendo to pay Universal to pay royalties for Nintendo's \"Donkey Kong\" franchise. Later when Universal sued Nintendo, this quote was brought up in court. Nintendo was found non-infringing, and it was also revealed that Universal knew \"King Kong\" was in the public domain all along. See also, \"Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.\"\n\nHis battle with Terry Gilliam over the final cut of the movie \"Brazil\" was the subject of a book and documentary entitled \"The Battle of Brazil\".\n\nIn 1990, Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman negotiated a $6.59 billion sale of MCA and Universal to Japan's Matsushita Electric in cash and securities.\n\nSheinberg departed Universal in July 1995, following the takeover of the studio by the Seagram Company. He produced several feature films through his production company The Bubble Factory over the decade that followed.\n\nSheinberg serves on the National Board of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Pitzer College (one of the Claremont group of colleges), the Board of The American Jewish Committee, the Board of Research To Prevent Blindness and the Board of Trustees of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, is Vice Chairman of Human Rights Watch and is co-founder of the Children's Action Network. He has been honored by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force for his life's work in civil rights and inclusive support of the LGBT community.\n\nHe received Columbia College's John Jay Award in 1981 for distinguished professional achievement, the American Jewish Committees Human Relations Award in 1982, the National Conference of Christians and Jews Humanitarian Award in 1983, and Pioneer Of The Year Award in 1984 from the Motion Picture Pioneers, as well as the rank of \"Chevalier\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1984 bestowed by the French government.\n\nIn 1987, he received the DeWitt Carter Reddick Award at the University of Texas in Austin, and in 1989 he was named a Lifetime Honorary Member of the Directors Guild of America for his decades of service on the DGA-AMPTP Creative Rights Committee. He received the AIDS Project Los Angeles Commitment to Life Award in 1991, the Medal of Honor from the American Academy of Achievement in 1994 and the GLAAD Media Award in 1996.\n\nThe Sheinbergs jointly received the 1995 Simon Wiesenthal Center's Humanitarian Award.\n\nSheinberg Place (a street on the Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles), was dedicated in his honor February 4, 2008, at a ceremony honoring the former studio chief. David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg were among those attending.\n\nSheinberg has been married to actress Lorraine Gary since 1956. They have two sons, Bill and Jon.\n"}
{"id": "790670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=790670", "title": "Space Mutiny", "text": "Space Mutiny\n\nSpace Mutiny (also known as Mutiny in Space) is a 1988 South African space opera action film about a mutiny aboard the generation ship known as the \"Southern Sun\". The film has since developed a cult following after being featured in a popular episode of the television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".\n\nThe \"Southern Sun\" is a generation ship, or a spacefaring vessel that contains a large number of people, whose mission is to colonize a new world. Its voyage from its original homeworld (implied to be Earth) has lasted thirteen generations, so many of its inhabitants have been born and will die without ever setting foot on solid ground. This does not please the antagonist, Elijah Kalgan (John Phillip Law), who conspires with the pirates infesting the nearby Corona Borealis system and the ship’s Chief Engineer MacPhearson (James Ryan). Kalgan hatches a plot to disrupt the Southern Sun’s navigation systems and use the Enforcers, the ship’s police force, to hijack the ship and direct it towards this system. At this point, the inhabitants of the \"Southern Sun\" will have no choice but to accept his \"generosity\".\n\nKalgan sabotages a key part of the ship just as an important professor's shuttle is on a landing trajectory. The loss of guidance control causes the ship to explode. The shuttle's pilot, Dave Ryder (Reb Brown), is able to escape, but the professor dies in the explosion. This sabotage seals off the flight deck for a number of weeks, which gives Kalgan the opportunity to attempt to wrest control. With the Enforcers in his hand, and with the flight deck out of commission, he holds the entire population of the \"Southern Sun\" hostage. Commander Jansen (Cameron Mitchell) and Captain Devers enlist Ryder’s assistance, aided begrudgingly by Jansen’s daughter Dr. Lea Jansen (Cisse Cameron), to regain control of the ship.\n\n\n\"Space Mutiny\" stars Reb Brown, Cisse Cameron, Cameron Mitchell and John Phillip Law. The spaceship effects were lifted wholly from the original \"Battlestar Galactica\" TV series.\n\nThe director of \"Space Mutiny\" has stated on his website that he was called away from set due to a death in the family before filming began, and delegated directing duties to the assistant director. Contractually he was apparently unable to get an Alan Smithee credit. Some commentators began to compile rather large lists of continuity errors.\nThe engineering areas of the ship were filmed in an industrial building with un-futuristic brick walls, windows and concrete floors, while the bridge looks remarkably like a vintage-1980s corporate office (non-shag, neutral carpeting; white particleboard desks; computers with 16-color ANSI displays, including one with a 5¼ inch floppy disk drive as an ID card reader). Kalgan’s \"torture chamber\" set features contemporary computer keyboards inexplicably mounted on the walls. The characters tend to wear the silver or white lamé outfits that were common to science fiction/futurist productions of the time, while many of the female characters wear spandex leotards.\n\nThe film's notable flaws provided substantial material for later spoofing on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", and Eccentric Cinema described it as \"quite possibly the worst science fiction/space adventure film made in English\". The engineering deck interiors include several shots of windows, which show sky beyond. In one scene, the camera passes by a bridge officer, Lt. Lemont, working at her computer console as an extra despite having been killed in the previous scene.\nOne chase scene involves slow-moving Enforcer vehicles, strongly resembling bowling-alley floor polishers, and the collision of two of these vehicles produces an extraordinary explosion for such small craft. The scene is further undermined by the intense sunlight streaming into the corridor.\n\nJohn Phillip Law, who appeared in this movie as the villain Elijah Kalgan, also starred in the 1968 Italian film \"\" (coincidentally, \"Diabolik\" was also featured as the series finale on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\"). Cameron Mitchell played Commander Jansen, along with his daughter Camille Mitchell, who provided the voice for Jennara, the lead Bellarian; and his son Chip Mitchell played Blake, a mustachioed member of Kalgan’s crew.\n\nThe song that plays over the end credits, \"Edge of a Dream\", is performed by Steven McClintock.\n\nNine years after its initial release, \"Space Mutiny\" was lampooned in a November 1997 episode of movie-mocking television comedy series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" (MST3K). The movie’s editing flaws, stilted dialog, and poor production lent itself well to the \"MST3K\" treatment, and it has repeatedly proved to be one of the most popular episodes, released as part of the \"MST3K DVD Collection, Vol. 4\" from Rhino Entertainment. It was also chosen by fans to appear in the MST3K 2016 Turkey Day Marathon.\n\nMany of the scenes involving characters being thrown to their deaths over guardrails in the interior were coined as \"railing kills\" by Mike and the Bots, and inspired Tom Servo to install railings all over the Satellite of Love. Mike and the Bots also mock the fact that a character killed on screen shows up prominently as an extra in later scenes. Throughout the film, the appearances of the characters were sources of ridicule: Dave Ryder, the muscular protagonist, is referred to by many ridiculous names, including, but not limited to, \"Slab Bulkhead\", \"Bolt Vanderhuge\", \"Hack Blowfist\", \"Fridge Largemeat\", \"Big McLarge Huge\", \"Buff Drinklots\", \"Stomp Beefknob\", and \"Punt Speedchunk\". Ryder is also compared to Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren. Ryder's love interest, Lea Jansen, who in the movie appears to be much older than him despite being six years younger, is referred to as Lea's father (Commander Jansen)'s \"grandmadaughter\"; Commander Jansen is compared to Santa Claus and to God, due to his white hair and beard, while Captain Devers is compared to Sting and Kalgan is noted for his resemblance to Pat Riley. Kalgan receives additional mockery for the similarity of his name to the Calgon home maintenance brand.\n\nSome ten minutes of footage were cut from \"Space Mutiny\" for its use on \"MST3K\". Much of the edited footage featured space battle scenes taken from the original television series of \"Battlestar Galactica\". The version of the film featured in the episode was, in essence, consistent with the full version; the discontinuities apparent in the episode were all present in the 1988 film. Mike Nelson and the robots did not comment on the reused \"Battlestar Galactica\" footage. Series writer Paul Chaplin acknowledged this omission, but did not provide an explanation.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, The film was treated to an all-new riffing by Nelson, Corbett and Murphy in one of their \"Rifftrax - Live!\" shows, broadcast to theatres via satellite, this time for the entire film. A rebroadcast was presented on June 19th.\n\n"}

The current prints, restored by the Library of Congress and released by Kino International on DVD, now exist only in black and white.\n\nFootage from the film was used on \"Fractured Flickers\" in the segment \"Hymie und Me\" (Episode 14), in which the dummy is presented as a real living comedian with von Stroheim as his straight man.\n\nThe movie follows brilliant ventriloquist \"The Great Gabbo\" (Stroheim), who increasingly uses his dummy \"Otto\" as his only means of self-expression—an artist driven insane by his work.\n\nGabbo's gimmick is his astonishing ability to make Otto talk—and even sing—while Gabbo himself smokes, drinks and eats. Gabbo's girlfriend and assistant Mary (Betty Compson) loves him, but is driven to leave him by his megalomania, superstitions, irritability, and inability to express any human emotion without using Otto as an intermediary. In Otto's voice Gabbo accepts the blame for Mary's leaving and recounts all the things she did for him, but as Gabbo he denies his feelings and tells the dummy to shut up.\n\nTwo years later, Gabbo has become a nationally renowned ventriloquist. He is revered for his talent even as he is ridiculed for his eccentricity: he takes Otto with him everywhere he goes, even dining out with him, providing much entertainment to the restaurant patrons. Despite his success he continues to pine for Mary, who is now romantically involved with another singer/dancer, Frank (Donald Douglas). With both Mary and Frank performing in a show in which Gabbo is the headliner, he attempts to win her back. Mary is charmed by Gabbo's new romantic behavior, driving Frank to angry fits of jealousy. As his courtship meets with continued success, Gabbo increasingly expresses his emotions to Mary directly, without using Otto.\n\nOne day Gabbo finds that in his absence, Mary has straightened up his dressing room the way she always used to. Convinced that she wants to come back to him, he confronts her with his feelings, admitting his loneliness without her and in the process revealing that he has grown past many of his old failings, such as his superstitions and obsession with his personal success. However, Mary tells him that she loves Frank, and has been married to him since before Gabbo came back into her life. She says that she missed Otto but not Gabbo, and in a last farewell she says \"I love you\" to Otto.\n\nIn profound frustration at this, after Mary is gone Gabbo punches Otto in the face, but immediately apologizes and embraces the dummy, weeping. He then storms onto the stage during the finale and loudly rants at the performers. He is forced off the stage and fired from the show. Mary tries to confront Gabbo afterwards, but he only looks at her sadly and walks away. The film ends with workers taking down the letters of \"The Great Gabbo\" from the marquee as Gabbo looks on.\n\n\nTouted in advertising as an \"all-dialog singing, dancing and dramatic spectacle\", this early sound film oddly interleaves stark drama with gratuitous full-length, large-scale, on-stage musical production numbers such as \"Every Now and Then\", \"I'm in Love with You\", \"The New Step\", \"The Web of Love\", and the now-missing \"The Ga Ga Bird\", which was filmed in color. The \"Web of Love\" number, in which the performers wear stylized spider and fly costumes, is occasionally shown on Classic Arts Showcase. Footage from the dance sequences was re-used with different music in \"The Girl from Calgary\" (1932).\n\nThe public domain version available on Internet Archive runs 68 minutes, while the original film ran 96 minutes, including the exit music. The opening credits mention \"Color sequences by Multicolor\", but those sequences are now either lost or have survived only in black-and-white form. Multicolor, based on the earlier Prizma color process, went out of business in 1932; its assets were bought by Cinecolor.\n\nThe quality and clarity of the film sound is notable.\n\nA 94 minute public domain version is now available.\n\n\"The Great Gabbo\" opened to lukewarm reviews. Stroheim received good notices, but the film did nothing to further his career. \"Photoplay\" called the film \"a bitter disappointment... Cruze seems to have lost his sense of humor, and the lighting and scenario are terrible.\" The \"New York Times\" review commented unfavorably on the technical quality of the color sequences. Historian Arthur Lennig wrote that \"The Great Gabbo\" \"betrays little inventiveness and shows few of its actors to advantage.\" He notes that, due to obvious budget constraints, several line-flubs by cast members made it into the final cut.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3495562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3495562", "title": "The Town Hall (New York City)", "text": "The Town Hall (New York City)\n\nThe Town Hall is a performance space, located at 123 West 43rd Street, between Sixth Avenue and Broadway, in midtown Manhattan New York City. It opened on January 12, 1921, and seats approximately 1,500 people.\n\nIn the 1930s, the first public-affairs media programming originated here with the \"America's Town Meeting of the Air\" radio programs. In recognition of this the National Park Service placed the building on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012, and designated it a National Historic Landmark in 2013.\n\nThe Town Hall was built by the League for Political Education, whose fight for passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (women's suffrage) led them to commission the building of a meeting space where people of every rank and station could be educated on the important issues of the day. The space, which became The Town Hall, was designed by the renowned architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, to reflect the democratic principles of the League. To this end, box seats were not included in the theater's design, and every effort was made to ensure that there were no seats with an obstructed view. This design principle gave birth to The Town Hall's long-standing mantra: \"Not a bad seat in the house.\"\n\nIt has not only become a meeting place for educational programs, gatherings of activists, and host for controversial speakers (such as the American advocate of birth control, Margaret Sanger, who was arrested and carried off The Town Hall stage on November 13, 1921, for attempting to speak to a mixed-sex audience about contraception), but as one of New York City's premiere performance spaces for music, dance, and other performing arts. While the lecture series and courses on political and non-political subjects sponsored by the League continued to be held there, The Town Hall quickly established a reputation as an arts center during the first fifteen years of its existence.\n\nIt has also had a long association with the promotion of poetry in the United States, which predates Edna St. Vincent Millay's public poetry reading debut at the Hall in 1928. The Hall has retained a close association with poets and poetry that continues to this day.\n\n\"America's Town Meeting of the Air\" was a radio program produced at the Hall for over twenty years, from 1935 to 1956. \"Town Meeting\" was the brain-child of George V. Denny, Jr., then the associate director of the Hall. Envisioned as a means of expanding the audience — first nationally, then internationally — for the programs held at the Hall which promoted the free exchange of ideas, the format of \"Town Meeting\" was a conversation among four speakers on a predetermined question. The series was launched on the NBC Blue Network on Memorial Day 1935. Although it began broadcasting on a single station with approximately 500,000 listeners, within three years, \"Town Meeting\" was carried by 78 stations and boasted 2.5 million listeners. \"Town Meeting\" also toured the United States and twelve cities on three continents. It won numerous awards.\n\nRecordings of \"America's Town Meeting of the Air\", from 1935 to 1952, are preserved at the United States' National Archives' Donated Historical Materials collection, the catalog number of which is \"DM.13\".\n\nThe organizational records (archives) of Town Hall, Inc. and \"America's Town Meeting of the Air\", 1895–1955, are held by the Manuscripts and Archives Division of The New York Public Library.\n\nThe Town Hall was owned by New York University for twenty years beginning in 1958.\n\nThe outstanding acoustic properties of Town Hall for musical performance — which some performers claim rival those of Carnegie Hall — were discovered during the first musical event held at the venue: a recital by Spanish violinist Juan Manén on February 12, 1921. Later in 1921, German composer Richard Strauss gave a series of concerts that cemented the Hall's reputation as an ideal space for musical performances. Aside from the acoustics, the sight lines and remarkable intimacy of the auditorium has made it a popular venue for both new and experienced artists, whatever the instrument, repertoire, or style of the performer. During the 1920s and 1930s, The Town Hall quickly gained a reputation amongst performers and audiences as \"the place\" for a performer to make a New York debut.\n\nIn 1928, The Hall began producing regular musical concert series, and over the next few seasons, \"The Town Hall Endowment Series\" featured artists including Sergei Rachmaninoff, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Lily Pons, Feodor Chaliapin, Yehudi Menuhin, and many more legends of the classical Western repertoire.\n\nMarian Anderson, considered one of the greatest contraltos ever born in the United States, made her New York debut at the Hall on December 30, 1935, after she had been denied an opportunity at an operatic career elsewhere due to discrimination against African-Americans.\n\nA notable world premiere in chamber music took place at the Town Hall on January 20, 1941, when the Kolisch Quartet gave the first performance of Béla Bartók's String Quartet No. 6.\n\nEddie Condon led a series of nationally broadcast radio shows from New York's Town Hall during 1944–45.\n\nOther important jazz concert appearances at The Town Hall include the June 22, 1945 concert — featuring Dizzy Gillespie, on trumpet; Charlie Parker, on alto saxophone; Don Byas, on tenor saxophone; Al Haig, on piano; Curley Russell, on bass, and Max Roach, on drums (with Sid Catlett substituting for Roach on a few titles) — which provided the public with its first mainstream exposure to the quickly evolving style of jazz that came to be popularly known as bebop. This concert illustrates how progressive The Town Hall's jazz programming has been since the venue's inception; prior to appearing in concert at the Hall, Gillespie and Parker had released only one 78-RPM release, and only Gillespie — due to his high-profile associations with Cab Calloway, Earl Hines, and Billy Eckstine — enjoyed mainstream name-recognition. (In June 2005, the Uptown Jazz label released a CD containing seven sonically restored performances transcribed from acetates made at the concert.) The Town Hall also hosted the 1947 concert that led to the re-invigoration of Louis Armstrong's career, and which led to the formation of Louis Armstrong and His All Stars, the small traditional jazz combo that he led for the last quarter-century of his life.\n\nThe Hall's tradition of jazz programming continues with the \"Not Just Jazz\" series of concerts, which also features poetry, film and dance. Past participants in the series include: The Art Ensemble of Chicago, the Lounge Lizards, Cassandra Wilson, Meredith Monk, and Allen Ginsberg.\n\nOn May 15, 1958, Town Hall hosted the 25th Year Retrospective Concert of the music of John Cage. This performance was recorded by Columbia Records producer George Avakian, and the resulting 3-LP set was instrumental in making Cage's music known to many listeners.\n\nJazz composer and bandleader Charles Mingus also held two concerts here, resulting in his live albums from October 1962 and April 1964.\n\nThe Hall offers \"Morning Performances\", offered free of charge to public school students in grades 3 to 8, during the day. It also features programming in alliance with Theatreworks USA as part of its \"Arts in Education\" program.\n\nWhen on tour, the radio show \"A Prairie Home Companion\" is often broadcast live from Town Hall in its New York appearances.\n\nIn September 2009, singer Whitney Houston chose the Town Hall for her first interview in seven years, appearing on Oprah Winfrey's season premiere. When asked by Winfrey why she chose the Town Hall, Whitney said it holds a special place in her heart because it's where she performed for the first time at the age of 14.\n\n"}

{"id": "23275212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23275212", "title": "Todd Joseph Miles Holden", "text": "Todd Joseph Miles Holden\n\nTodd Joseph Miles Holden (also known as T.J.M. Holden and Todd Holden) is an American-born social scientist, essayist, philosopher, and novelist. He was the first tenured foreign professor at Tohoku University, one of Asia’s elite universities, where he taught for 26 years. His scholarship has been multi- and trans-disciplinary, embracing globalization, media studies, cultural studies, semiotics, advertising, television, Japanese popular culture, sociology, cultural anthropology, political communication, gender, identity, and digital youth. Between 2000 and 2009 he was a contributor to the international webzine PopMatters, writing a regular column on Japanese popular culture called \"ReDotPop\", and creating \"PM\"’s first blog, \"Peripatetic Postcards\". In 2011 he published a book by the same name, bearing the subtitle \"the journey of life through 25 of the world's cities\". Recent work has included literary treatments of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, dystopia, philosophical detection, comedy and caper.\n\nHolden received his BA in Social Ecology from the University of California, Irvine, and his PhD in Interdisciplinary Social Science from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.\n\nAt UCI, he was strongly influenced by Ralph (Ray) Catalano and worked with Larry Agran, who went on to become Mayor of Irvine and, later, candidate for President of the United States. At Syracuse he was mentored by John A. Agnew, who oversaw his dissertation, along with Ralph Ketcham and Thomas E. Patterson. Other important influences were Barry Glassner, then-chair of the sociology department, and Robert Bogdan, whose approach to ethnography and qualitative content analysis have been apparent in Holden’s scholarship.\n\nUpon obtaining his PhD, in 1988, Holden was recruited by Tohoku University, the third oldest of Japan’s so-called “Imperial Universities\", and one of Asia's top-ranked universities. His initial post was lecturer in the Department of English in the (now-defunct) College of General Education. Thereafter, he taught in the Department of Social Structure and Change in the Graduate School of Information Sciences and was an associate professor of society and culture at the (now-defunct) School of Language and Culture. In 2001 he was appointed professor of mediated sociology in the Graduate School of International Cultural Studies (GSICS), becoming the first foreigner to secure tenure at Tohoku University since its establishment in 1907. Twice Chair of the Department of Multi-Cultural Societies, he helped build a small, but dynamic graduate program on media, culture and society. He retired in 2014 after nearly 27 years of service.\nIn 2000 Holden served on the planning committee of Tohoku University's \"International Symposium on Research and Education in the 21st Century,\" (ISRE 2000), an assembly that led to exchange agreements with 29 universities and 114 university departments from 31 nations. In 2005 he was part of the working group that designed the so-called Internet School (ISTU), the university's first step toward establishing a distance education program. In 2008 he was a Visiting Lecturer in Geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, teaching a course on sports globalization; in 2013, he was a Visiting Scholar at Harvard University's Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, working on \"\"Ukiyo\"-ad\", a book on Japanese advertising, cultural communication and media theory.\n\nDuring his career, Holden held executive positions in various international professional associations, including two terms (8 years) as Chair of the Gender and Communication section of the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR), 4 years as Vice-President of the Asia-Pacific Sociology Association (APSA), and 4 years as Executive Committee Member of Anthropology of Japan in Japan (AJJ). He also served as webmaster and Communications Director for all three of these associations.\n\nIn the main, Holden’s research has attended to the multiple, cross-cutting relationships between societal structures and processes, cultural values and practices, and media. Funded and published research has explored: cell phones, the Internet, television, advertising, novels, children’s picture books, and film. The work has generally, but not exclusively, centered on Japan. Reflecting his familiarity with various communication platforms, his scholarship has appeared in the \"Sage Handbook of Media Studies \" (a global survey of advertising), \"The Encyclopedia of Television\" (a historical overview of Japanese TV), the first book ever on \"Japanese Cybercultures\" (a chapter on Internet dating), and \"Global Youth\" (a study of adolescent cell phone use in Japan). His Internet dating study, co-authored with Takako Tsuruki, has been extensively cited, as has his grounded theorization of media-reproduced \"surveillance\" in Japanese society.\n\nDespite the core attention to media/tion, Holden’s overriding concern has been the interaction between indigenous and exogenous values and practices – what is generally referred to as \"globalization\". This intellectual thread is directly traceable back to Agnew’s \"landmark\" study of place, completed during Holden's final year at SU. For Holden, it is the mediation between people, media technologies and communication content in specific contexts that best accounts for political, cultural, and social phenomena, (and thereby reveals the contours and extent of globalization). This focus is most evident and best captured in the title of his 2006 book \"medi@sia: Global media/tion in and out of context\" (co-edited with Timothy J. Scrase). Even so, this geo-symbolic mediation can be discerned a decade earlier, in his comparative content analysis of 3,059 Japanese and American television ads, and his study of differential presentations of the body in national advertisements – a research topic that also bears some echoes of Glassner’s body study, launched during the latter's time at SU.\n\nThe question of place also arises in Holden’s widely circulated updating, to Japan, of Goffman's classic “gender advertisements”. This Japanese study, Medcalf noted, demonstrates that discrepancies in the hetero-normative narrative are “not a result of post-modern, globalizing transformations, but, rather, of long standing internal cultural and historical processes and contradictions.” Such complex relationships between gender, media and local distinctiveness were further explored in a much-sampled 2005 article on masculinities in Japanese cooking shows.\n\nHolden has also employed other approaches to expose the distinctiveness of place-based ideas and practices. For instance, qualitative, semiotic-attuned content analysis demonstrated the integral role color plays in generating cultural meaning in American and Japanese advertising. The significance of such research, Patrick Hunout has observed, is that:\nHolden points to numerous localized practices, which do not transcend national/cultural borders. Context-specific meanings serve to underscore the limits on globalization; they indicate the large degree to which cultures communicate in distinct, unique ways. Coloration becomes more than a semiological tool; it provides insight into societal ontology. It can be used to explain how cultures have been organized, how they “think” and even suggest, at times, why they act.\nThat said, not all of his studies of mediation in context have found clear-cut divergence. His ethnographic study of the advent of political consultants and spot-centered campaigns in the 1996 Japanese national elections were highly supportive of creeping convergence, as was his content analysis of what he has labeled “adentity”. In the latter case, messages of self-identification in Japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous—insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the West. Appraising the implications of Holden's grounded theorization, Kenji Kosaka observed that such adentifications reflect a departure from the past, where identity was often mediated by the group. To Kosaka, Holden's study was further evidence that Japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1994 Holden served as Head Coach of the men’s basketball team at Tohoku University. A perennial Division 2 bottom-dweller, the team ascended to Division 1 in Holden’s second season at the helm. It also won the prestigious the same year, Tohoku University’s first basketball championship in 32 years. After becoming a fixture at youth basketball camps in the Tohoku region, Holden was offered the head coaching job with a professional women’s basketball team sponsored by Yamagata Bank. In his first year, 1994–95, the team qualified for the play-in round for promotion to the First Division—the first time a team from Tohoku had earned this chance. His year coaching a women's professional team was briefly described in his \"PM\" feature on Tohoku and is the basis for the unpublished manuscript, \"Red Dot, Orange Rock, Blues\".\n\nAfter writing a column about Japanese popular culture for nearly a decade for the ezine \"PopMatters\" and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, Holden published the memoir, \"Peripatetic Postcards: The journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities\", in 2010. Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life’s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, \"Peripatetic Postcards\" operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.\n\nIn 2013 Holden published a novel, \"Mr. Big Maus\", a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. \"Mr. Big Maus\" is a blend of late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character’s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution. Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression.\n\nHolden's current projects include two novels about the events surrounding Japan's triple disaster of March 11, 2011: \"Tsunami\" and \"Escape from Sonoyo\". The former, covers the disaster in sixteen self-contained, interconnected stories; the latter centers on the ordeals of one family divided, in search of themselves and one another. Combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance through the eyes of victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. The result can be read as more than a record of one period in a particular nation’s history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis.\n\nOther projects in various stages of development include: \"Red Dot, Orange Rock, Blues\", an autobiographical meditation on being and becoming, based on Holden's six years coaching men’s collegiate and women’s professional basketball in Japan; \"The Seekers of Wisdom\", a novel blending the prodigal return, philosophical detection, high school sports, the literary canon, hard-boiled mystery and police procedural; and \"Orphan 7Y-05-O\", a dystopian tale centering on a training school for terrorists and, possibly, capitalist democracy's inescapable future.\n\nHolden was born in Pasadena, California in 1958. He is the son of Joseph T. Holden, PhD, a biochemist, Emeritus Senior Scientist, and Director Emeritus of the Beckman Research Institute at the City of Hope National Medical Center. His mother, Nancy Holden, attended the original Little Red School House in New York City, and later earned an MS. A career educator, she founded a program for special needs children in Los Angeles and has been active as board member and president of various Jewish genealogy societies. Holden attended The Chandler School and was one of only four students to graduate from its short-lived high school. During that time he played on the same football team as Drew Pinsky (also known as “Dr. Drew”). Holden's wife, Takako, and his children, Maya and Alex, play prominent roles in the concluding chapter of \"Peripatetic Postcards\". \"Mr. Big Maus\" is dedicated to Maya and Alex, as well as Holden's father.\n\n\n"}

It was the sister of Japanese MMA promotion Cage Force, both operated by Greatest Common Multiple (GCM) Communication. Contrary to other Japanese women MMA promotions at the time, it featured a cage instead of a ring and used the same venues as Cage Force.\n\nAround , GCM Communication, the parent company of Japanese promotion Cage Force, had already hosted some all-women MMA events named \"Cross Section\" and with the imminent dissolution of female MMA promotion Smackgirl, GCM Communication announced at the event \"Cage Force 08\" on that the company would hold a new all-female promotion which would be named Valkyrie and would have its first event on in a double-header event with Cage Force. Takeshi Nagao, a former Smackgirl executive, and Yasuko Mogi were appointed as producers. Mogi announced several details of the promotion, such as the weight classes and the rules, which would be essentially the same as those used in Cage Force, and also that former Smackgirl Lightweight Champion Yuka Tsuji would participate in the promotion in a match against Mei Yamaguchi. Other matches would be announced at later dates. As part of its business strategy, Valkyrie events were held before Cage Force, in this way sharing venue, cage and other resources.\n\nValkyrie first event was held as planned on , with a card featuring a victorious Tsuji, Yasuko Tamada, Tomomi Sunaba and Roxanne Modafferi against their rivals.\n\nIn its second event, \"Valkyrie 02\", on , Valkyrie crowned its first featherweight champion with Yuka Tsuji defeating American fighter Kate Martinez\n\nThe next Valkyrie event, title \"Cage Force & Valkyrie\", was co-promoted with Cage Force and featured three female bouts.

Due to an injury, Yuka Tsuji would be unable to defend her title against Mei Yamaguchi, so it was decided to postpone that match for another event. Due to this, Yasuko Mogi stepped up to fight again against Misaki Takimoto in the main bout.

A few days before the event, Ayame Miura got injured and was replaced by Megumi Yabushita. Yabushita and Kyoko Takabayashi, who defeated standout Emi Fujino, were the more notable winners of the event.\n\nOn , \"Valkyrie 06\" was held. During the event, future star Rin Nakai beat seasoned veteran Megumi Yabushita and in the flyweight tournament final Yasuko Tamada defeated Naoko Omuro to become Valkyrie's first champion in that weight.\n\n\"Valkyrie 07\", held on , was an event with only three professional MMA bouts, two of which were part of the tournament to crown the first openweight champion of the promotion. Rin Nakai and Mizuho Sato advanced to the final of the tournament.\n\nFor the next event of the promotion, \"Valkyrie 08\", Rin Nakai and Mizuho Sato were set to fight for Valkyrie openweight title and Mei Yamaguchi would fight against Kyoko Takabayashi to defend Valkyrie featherweight title.

Also notably, Naho Sugiyama defeated flyweight champion Yasuko Tamada in a non-title bout.\n\nAfter several months with no news from the promotion, on , in a notable development for female MMA promotions in Japan, Yasuko Mogi, matchmaker of Valkyrie, in an effort to keep Valkyrie alive, given that GCM Communication was apparently out of business with no other event planned, was present during the press conference of Jewels and announced along with Shigeru Saeki, Jewels matchmaker, that some of the MMA bouts of the Jewels event would have the theme \"Jewels vs Valkyrie\", where fighters representing their respective promotions would face each other, starting with Misaki Takimoto vs. Naho Sugiyama and Miyoko Kusaka vs. Sachiko Yamamoto.\n\nAfter the Jewels vs. Valkyrie theme in \"Jewels 13th Ring & 14th Ring\", followed also in \"Jewels 15th Ring\", and due to the lack of Valkyrie events, fighters from the Valkyrie promotion started joining rival Japanese promotion Jewels. Some of them had already participated in other MMA promotions already.\n\nOn , members of Wajyutsu Keisyukai announced the formation of a new players association to separate themselves from GCM Communication and its president Toyoki Kubo due to the lack of activity of GCM Communication which had not held any new MMA event since and had not paid storage fees and other payments. A few weeks later, at \"Jewels 17th Ring\" on Yasuko Mogi became the matchmaker of Jewels and this effectively meant the end for the Valkyrie promotion.\n\nGenerally speaking, the rules were based on Cage Force rules, which in turn were similar to the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, minus elbow strikes to the head and no ground-and-pound in amateur bouts. With respect to the length of matches, regular bouts were three three-minute rounds and title bouts were three five-minute rounds.\n\nThese were the official weight classes used by the promotion.\n\nCage Force\n\n"}

The company had created WeeWorld.com, formally known as a social networking site, to which was mostly geared towards teens and tweens. The website is also known for its brand of instant messaging and chat-based avatars, known as “WeeMees”, Which was also released on a variety of digital platforms and services. There were approximately 180 million WeeMees created worldwide, but the site was unexpectedly shut down, as of May 11, 2017. From then on, there has not been anymore information from WeeWorld or the company itself. It is said that the company could no longer profit off of WeeWorld, and the only option left was to sell it to the new owners, who had then decided to shut it down.\n\nWeeMees are two-dimensional cartoon avatars that WeeWorld users are issued when first joining the community. Users can purchase virtual goods for their avatars, such as clothing, accessories, and food and drink items. As WeeWorld's target demographic is teenagers, many of the virtual goods reflect current pop culture and celebrity fashion trends.\n\nWeeWorld has partnered with corporations such as AOL, MSN and Skype. Through a partnership with RCA, it has promoted artists such as Alicia Keys and Avril Lavigne through virtual merchandise sales and WeeMees of the respective artists. WeeWorld has also promoted artists such as the Jonas Brothers, Justin Timberlake, Raven-Symoné, the Pussycat Dolls, Justin Bieber, and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe avatars were created in 2001 by the Co-Founders of Saw-You.com, Mike Kinsella and John McGuire in Glasgow, Scotland. In 2003, Microsoft began offering the avatars for use to their Hotmail customers via the MSN chat service. The new service attracted 150,000 users during the first day of the avatars being launched, with the WeeMee website attracting 1.5 million hits daily. In 2004 the UK's largest social network, Friendsreunited.com, also introduced the WeeMee to their user base. In December 2008 the virtual technology firm DA agreed to develop a 3-D version of the avatar.\n\nThe company was run by a rookie CEO, Celia Francis and went into liquidation in 2014. Was then sold to Glasgow business Opinurate, who closed the website down earlier in 2017.\n"}

Open to the public from 1992 to 1999, the Museum's collection at one point numbered 20,000 original works from hundreds of artists including Simon Bisley, Vaughn Bodē, Robert Crumb, Richard Corben, Frank Frazetta, Jaime Hernandez, Jack Kirby, George Pratt, Dave McKean, Frank Miller, Jon J Muth, Bill Sienkiewicz, and Gilbert Shelton.\n\nThe Museum was founded in 1990 by artist Kevin Eastman, co-creator of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Initially located in Northampton's Roundhouse Building, the Museum opened its doors on October 9, 1992.\n\nIn late 1994, the Museum moved to the Beardsley Building (named for English illustrator Aubrey Beardsley), into a state-of-the-art four-floor facility in downtown Northampton, which it occupied until its closing.\n\nDespite receiving a large donation in the summer of 1996, by mid-1997 it was reported that the Museum was facing financial difficulties. The Museum closed its doors for good on July 16, 1999.\n\nAfter the closure of the physical exhibition space, the Museum's outreach program moved online in the form of the Virtual Words & Pictures Museum, and featured online educational exhibits and research directories. The virtual Museum's website does not appear to have been updated since 2002.\n\nCartoonist John Severin's artwork was exhibited three times at the Words & Pictures Museum—in the grand-opening group show (October 9, 1992 – January 5, 1993), the group exhibit \"War No More\" (May 18 – August 8, 1993), and the group show \"Classic Comics: A Selection of Stories from EC Comics\" (December 7, 1995 – February 11, 1996).\n\n1993 saw the exhibit \"War No More\", featuring George Pratt, Bill Sienkiewicz, Jack Kirby, John Severin, and Frank Redondo.\n\n1994 saw an exhibition devoted to the art of Jack Kirby, while 1995 featured a Frank Miller show (also featuring the work of Bill Sienkiewicz and Klaus Janson).\n\n\"Oliphant: The New World Order\" was a 1996 exhibition.

{"id": "11208322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11208322", "title": "Zen Studios", "text": "Zen Studios\n\nZen Studios is an international video game developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software with headquarters in Budapest, Hungary and offices in the United States. It is known for its game franchises, \"Pinball FX\" and \"Zen Pinball\", as well as \"CastleStorm\", a tower defense hybrid which received the Apple Store's Editor’s Choice award. The company is considered \"synonymous with licensed pinball tables,\" having produced dozens of tables with characters and themes from the \"Star Wars\" and Marvel universes, films like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", TV series like \"Archer\", \"South Park\", \"Family Guy\" and \"Bob's Burgers\", and video game franchises such as \"Plants vs. Zombies\", \"Portal\", \"Street Fighter\", and \"The Walking Dead\".\nThe company's games have been released for various game platforms, including Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Steam, Amazon, and Android. Zen Studios was ranked second on Metacritic's list of mid-size game publishers in 2015, ahead of publishers like Capcom and Microsoft.\nZen Studios was founded in Budapest in 2003 by a team of four people. It started as a technology and work for hire studio, doing game engine development, middleware tools, and ports for other games. The company name is based on the team's belief in Zen as a creed to follow in their work and lives, specifically with employees and fans. By the time PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade arrived, the studio had gained knowledge and experience with console platforms and gaming handhelds. The company CEO Zsolt Kigyossy, a pinball fan, decided to try to make the best pinball simulation video game on the market.\nIts first pinball game was \"Pinball FX\", released for Xbox 360 in 2007. It would sell more than 100,000 copies per year until 2010. Because \"Pinball FX\" was published by Microsoft, it could not appear on Sony’s PlayStation 3, leading to the development of \"Zen Pinball\" for the PS3 in 2008 (and later for iOS, the Wii U, and Android). \"Zen Pinball\" was the top-selling PSN game in May and September 2009.\nThe company made the first of its three departures from pinball when it released \"\" in 2009. This first-person shooter in the style of the \"Punisher MAX\" franchise was released for Playstation 3. The company embarked on what would become its biggest media franchise cooperation yet when they teamed up with Marvel Comics and released \"Marvel Pinball\" in December 2010. The cooperation has resulted in twenty-one different pinball tables based on the Marvel Universe, with more anticipated in the future. Another big franchise used for Zen Studios tables is Lucasfilm's and Disney's \"Star Wars\". In 2012, the company debuted \"Star Wars Pinball,\" the first pack to feature officially licensed digital \"Star Wars\" pinball tables.\nIn 2013, Zen Studios released two non-pinball games. The company tackled the tower defense genre with \"CastleStorm\" for XBLA, a hybrid of traditional tower defense with real-time physics-based \"Angry Birds\"-esque catapult combat and resource management. \"CastleStorm\" would go on to become a successful franchise, earning the Editor’s Choice award in the US Apple App Store, as well as an Editor’s Choice distinction from Google Play. Rhythm-based martial arts game \"KickBeat\" debuted on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3. On the pinball side, Zen Studios released \"Super League Football\" in 2014, where players competed by siding with their favorite European football clubs and famous players. The game was seen as a modern version of the famous pinball machine \"World Cup Soccer\" from 1994. The same year saw the release of a \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" table.\nThe company partnered with Valve in mid-2015 to create digital pinball tables based on Valve's games, most notably the \"Portal\" table. That year, Zen Studios' licensed tables included a table based on Telltale Game’s \"The Walking Dead\" and on the TV show \"South Park\". The new \"Iron & Steel\" collection consisted of a table based on \"CastleStorm\" and the studio's first wholly original table in three years, \"Wild West Rampage\".\nIn early 2016, Zen Studios teamed up with Oculus Rift to create pinball tables in virtual reality. Pinball FX2 VR, which features three original table designs from the Zen Studios development team, was released on the Oculus Rift’s launch day, March 28, 2016.\nZen Studios' pinball style has been called \"cinematic\". In order to capture the mood of a game or franchise, its tables include spoken lines, animations and deep references from movies, TV or animated shows they are based on, weaving those references into the action in a fun and interesting way. Each table is a separately designed game, with distinct layouts and graphical styles. One of the \"Star Wars\"-themed tables, for example, \"feels inextricable from the universe, its elements combining into something truly evocative,\" while the \"Ant-Man\"-based table \"faithfully recreates the aesthetic of the film and makes good use of the notable elements in the table design.\" In \"The Walking Dead\" pinball game, there is no playing table. Instead, the field of play is surrounded by scale representations of the most memorable set pieces from each of the episodes contained in \"The Walking Dead: Season One\".\nOn the other hand, its tables have been praised for their \"realism\", which means that they try to create the illusion that \"you're at an arcade or in your basement with your eyes peeled to the table in front\", and that the ball physics make \"predicting angles and opportune flipper timing as natural as possible\".\nThe company's first game, \"Pinball FX\", introduced microtransactions in the world of pinball gaming, since additional tables were available for purchase. At the launches of \"Pinball FX2\" and \"Zen Pinball 2\", pinball tables could be exported for free from the previous games into the sequels. Upon release of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, \"Pinball FX2\" and \"Zen Pinball 2\" respectively were ported over, and allowed owners of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions (via Cross-Buy) to import their purchased tables onto the new platform when available at no additional cost. Tables are available for purchase either individually or as part of themed packs.\n"}

The company performs in the Karelian language. The company was founded in 2005 at the initiative of Pekka Zaikov, who at the time was the head of the Department of the Karelian and Veps languages. Amongst those who founded the company were teachers, students and alumni of the Faculty of Baltic Finnic languages of the Petrozavodsk State University. A year later the company performed their first play, \"Kuin hukka vasikalla muamona oli\" (‘When the Wolf Stood in for the Calf’s Mother’).\n\nAlthough Čičiliusku performs for all kinds of audiences both in their home state and abroad, they want to target Karelian speaking people in the peripheral areas of Karelia, especially the youth, and inspire them to be more active in the use of the Karelian language. The shows are free, although the company hopes that the spectators would provide them with financial support, each according to his or her means.\n\nThe members of the Čičiliusku company, ca. 15 persons, represent the same groups as those who founded the company. The members of the company are Karelian language and Karelian political activists who are active in the association Nuori Karjala (‘Young Karelia’) and the political movement Karjalan rahvahan liitto (‘Karelian People’s Union’). Čičiliusku is one of the most successful projects of Nuori Karjala.\n\nThe company have their rehearsals in the Cultural Centre of the Karelian Republic, and the centre provides them with financial support. They also receive support from the Karelian Ministry of Culture.\n\nThe head of the company is Natal’ya Golubovskaya, who has been a member ever since the company was founded. The props and the puppets are supplied by Marina Zlenko and Boris Kudryavcev, while Oleg Gureyev is in charge of the music.\n\nThe company performs in the Livvi and the North Karelian languages, both languages being used in each performance. The company does not perform in the Central Karelian language (the latter being the same language variant as Tver Karelian). The plays consist of well-known folk stories and of various life situations that are familiar to all people. The company strives to present the plays in such a way that enables even those with little or no knowledge of Karelian to follow them. The puppets make it easier for the audience to grasp the essence of the plays.\n\nČičiliusku visited Finland during November 10–17, 2012, and performed two plays, \"Canine Kalevala\", based on the book of the same title by the Finnish cartoonist and author Mauri Kunnas, and the aforementioned \"Kuin hukka vasikalla muamona oli\" (‘When the Wolf Stood in for the Calf’s Mother’). The Finnish premiere of \"Canine Kalevala\" was in Sastamala on November 10, 2012, and a repeat of the play was seen in Tampere the following day. The tour ended in Helsinki on November 17.\n\n\"Canine Kalevala\" is the first Kalevala related work to have been published in the North Karelian language, the language of the area from which the bulk of the Kalevala was collected by Elias Lönnrot. It was translated by Nadezhda Lutokhina, and it was published by Karjalan Sivistysseura (‘Society for the Promotion of the Karelian Culture’) in 2010.\n\n"}
