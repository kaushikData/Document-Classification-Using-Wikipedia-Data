The chairman is Sheikh Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani. The acting director general is Dr. Mostefa Souag. The network's news operation currently has a total of 70 bureaux around the world that are shared between the network's channels and operations, the second largest amount of bureaux of any media company in the world after the BBC.\n\nThe original Al Jazeera Satellite Channel (then called JSC or Jazeera Satellite Channel) was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the first BBC Arabic language television station, then a joint venture with Orbit Communications Company, owned by Saudi King Fahd's cousin, Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to thwart a documentary pertaining to executions under sharia law.\n\nThe Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, provided a loan of QAR 500 million ($137 million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book \"Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West\".\n\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6-hours of programming per day; this would increase to 12-hours by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable, as well as through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world). 1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting. Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25 million at the time.\n\nIn 2003, Al Jazeera hired its first English-language journalists, among whom was Afshin Rattansi, from the BBC's Today Programme.\n\nIn March 2003, it launched an English-language website. (see below)\n\nOn 4 July 2005 Al Jazeera officially announced plans to launch a new English-language satellite service to be called Al Jazeera International. The new channel started at 12h GMT on 15 November 2006 under the name Al Jazeera English and has broadcast centers in Doha (next to the original Al Jazeera headquarters and broadcast center), London, Kuala Lumpur and Washington D.C. The channel is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week news channel, with 12 hours broadcast from Doha, and four hours each from London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C. Among its staff were journalists hired from ABC's \"Nightline\" and other top news outfits. Josh Rushing, a former media handler for CENTCOM during the Iraq war, agreed to provide commentary; David Frost was also on board. In an interesting technical feat, the broadcast of the new operation was handed off between bases in Doha, London, Washington, D.C., and Kuala Lumpur on a daily cycle.\n\nThe new English language venture faced considerable regulatory and commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes. At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the Arabic language. There were hundreds of millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be interested in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007.\n\nIn 2011 Al Jazeera Media Network created Al Jazeera Balkans, a version of Al Jazeera in the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian language(s) stationed in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina catering to and broadcasting around the Balkans. In 2013 they announced the creation of Al Jazeera TÃ¼rk, a version of Al Jazeera that will be in the Turkish language(s) stationed in Istanbul catering to and broadcasting around Turkey. On January 22, 2014 Al Jazeera Turk`s website launched with news content. The move made Al Jazeera Turk the first 24-hour news operation to go digital before broadcast. \n\nAl Jazeera America was an American version of Al Jazeera English. The channel launched on 20 August 2013 exclusively on cable and satellite systems in the United States.\n\nOn 2 January 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network announced that it purchased Current TV in the United States and would be launching an American news channel. Originally 60% of the channel's programming would be produced in America while 40% would be from Al Jazeera English, that has since changed to almost all the content being U.S. originated.\n\nThough Current TV had large distribution throughout the United States on cable and satellite TV, it averaged only 28,000 viewers at any time. The acquisition of Current TV by Al Jazeera allowed Time Warner Cable to drop the network due to its low ratings, but released a statement saying that they would consider carrying the channel after they evaluated whether it made sense for their customers. The channel was later added to Time Warner and Bright House Networks lineups after a new carriage deal was agreed upon.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, Al Jazeera America CEO Al Anstey announced that the network would cease operations on April 12, 2016, citing the \"economic landscape\".\n\nIn 2004 Al Jazeera expanded into the world of sports with the establishment of Al Jazeera Sports (now known as beIN Sports) and the building of 8 Arabic language specialty sports channels.\n\nOn 1 January 2014, Al Jazeera Sports was renamed beIN Sports after its acquisition of beIN Media Group the channels were legally spun off and to have consistency with all the Network's sports properties. According to Kate O'Brian, President of Al Jazeera America, beIN sports revenue helped fund the network when it was in operation similar to how BBC Worldwide helps fund the BBC.\n\nAl Jazeera Media network also operates Al Jazeera Documentary Channel an Arabic language documentary channel, Al Jazeera Mubasher, a live politics and public interest channel (similar to C-SPAN, Houses of the Oireachtas Channel or BBC Parliament), which broadcasts conferences in real time without editing or commentary the first channel of its kind in the Middle East and Al Jazeera Turk, a mainly online channel at the moment.\n\nAl Jazeera restructured its operations to form a network that contains all their different channels. Wadah Khanfar, then the managing director of the Arabic Channel, was appointed as the Director General of the Al Jazeera Network. He also acted as the Managing Director of the Arabic channel. Khanfar resigned on 20 September 2011, proclaiming that he had achieved his original goals, and that eight years was enough time for any leader of an organization, in an interview aired on Aljazeera English.\n\nOn 26 November 2009, Al Jazeera English received approval from the CRTC, which enables Al Jazeera English to broadcast via satellite in Canada.\n\nIn 2011, in accordance with the renaming of the corporation, AJMN was legally re-designated from a \"public institution to a 'private institution of public utility'\"; however, it was unknown how this would affect editorial management and funding.\n\nThe network is also funded though its television contracts and revenue from its sports division.\n\nAl Jazeera media network operates a number of specialty channels besides its original flagship news channel.\n\nAl Jazeera network's TV channels include(d):\nAl Jazeera Media network also operates mobile apps for their various channels with Al Jazeera Mobile and Al Jazeera New Media\n\nThe network operates Aljazeera.com which is the main website for the Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera Balkans and the former Al Jazeera America web sites. For its Arabic language properties it has Aljazeera.net. and for its Turkish properties Aljazeera.tr.\n\nOn January 1, 2018, Al Jazeera launched a Mandarin-language news website becoming the first Middle Eastern news provider to target the Chinese audience. The staff of the project are in contact with their audience via Chinese social media like Weibo, Meipai and WeChat. \n\nAl Jazeera Media Network also has a digital online only news channel AJ+. The channel is an online and mobile only news channel primarily on its mobile app and YouTube operated by Al Jazeera New Media out of San Francisco, California. The channel consists of mostly On Demand content. It soft launched on 13 June 2014 with a new webpage, Facebook page and videos on YouTube, the full channel launched with an app in September 2014. There are also Arabic and Spanish language versions of the channel.\n\nIn 2017, the network launched a podcasting network called Jetty. The network is available via the network's website as well as Soundcloud, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio. The network is based out of San Francisco alongside AJ+ and is available in English.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network owns and operates the Al Jazeera Center for Studies . Established in 2006, the Al Jazeera Center for Studies conducts in-depth analysis of current affairs at both regional and global levels. Its research agenda focuses primarily on geo-politics and strategic developments in the Arab world and surrounding regions. The center with an extensive network of distinguished researchers, and a wide range array of experts from across the globe, the center aims to promote dialogue and build bridges of mutual understanding and cooperation between cultures, civilizations, and religions.\n\nThe center also contains the Al Jazeera Media Training and Development Center.\n\nThe Al Jazeera International Documentary Film Festival is an annual film festival held at the Doha Sheraton in Doha, Qatar. The first festival was held on 18 April 2005. Every year the festival has a different theme. The vision of the festival is to make the festival an invitationâ¦. to introduce different cultures from all over the world, foster better relationships through an exchange of experiences and knowledge thus creating a foundation of respect and understanding. Al Jazeera seeks to make the festival become a place where filmmakers from different countries and cultures meet to create a unique platform that celebrates creative talent and encourages a cultural interest in documentary films.\n\nThe festival endeavors to promote creative talent from all over the world and in this way, leave behind a unique stamp of originality and professionalism.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network sued AT&T in 2013 for refusing to carry its United States channel, claiming this was in violation of their contract. The two sides later settled in 2014 leading to the channel being added on AT&T's U-Verse systems.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network sued AT&T over contracts AT&T tried to illegally pursue in 2003.\n\n\n"}

A sequel to \"The Mad Doctor of Blood Island\", it was directed by Eddie Romero. It was the fourth in a series of four Filipino horror films, produced by Romero and Kane W. Lynn, known as the \"Blood Island\" series, which also included \"Terror Is a Man\", \"Brides of Blood\" and \"Beast of Blood\". It was also Romero's last film for Lynn's Hemisphere Pictures, as the two went separate ways after this film was completed.\n\nThe plot of this film picks up where \"The Mad Doctor of Blood Island\" leaves off. Upon leaving Blood Island, the ship carrying Dr. Bill Foster (John Ashley), Sheila Willard, her father and Carlos Lopez explodes and sinks after mutated \"chlorophyll creature\" Don Ramon Lopez (the titular \"Beast\") is found secreted on board and goes on a rampage, destroying the ship. The monstrous Don Ramon washes up back on Blood Island and heads into the jungle. Dr. Foster is the only other survivor, and after a few months recovering in a hospital, he heads back to Blood Island on another ship. On board is reporter Myra Russell (Celeste Yarnall), who is investigating the explosion of the ship.\n\nWhen Foster and Russell arrive on the island, they find the natives in a state of fear, believing that the old Lopez mansion is cursed. With the village headman Ramu (Alfonso Carvajal) and the ship's captain (played by co-producer Beverly Miller), they search the house and find Razak (Bruno Punzalan) alive. The \"green men\" return and after a fight, Myra is captured and taken to the evil Dr. Lorca (Eddie Garcia), who is still alive but horribly scarred from his seeming demise in the earlier film.\n\nDr. Foster and Laida (Liza Belmonte) search the mountains and find Dr. Lorca's hidden lab. Laida goes back to the village for help and Lorca shows Foster his latest experiments. He has removed Don Ramon's head and has attached it to machines while the decapitated body remains strapped to a table. Lorca knows the head can speak, but it refuses to say anything.\n\nThe captain, Laida and Ramu lead an attack on Lorca's headquarters and fight with his men. Laida finds her father, who shows signs of the chlorophyll poisoning, and rescues him. Foster shoots Razak. Don Ramon's head controls his body from afar and wills it to attack and apparently kill Dr. Lorca, crushing his head with a piece of machinery. Lorca's lab explodes, killing all inside, and Foster and the group leave with a box of Dr. Lorca's papers and notes.\n\n\nThe film's budget has been estimated at between $125,000 to $200,000. Actor Ronald Remy did not return to play Dr. Lorca as he had in \"Mad Doctor of Blood Island\", so in \"Beast of Blood\", Garcia played the mad doctor. Co-producer Beverly Miller played the ship's captain.\n\nTo promote the film, the producers had fake $10 bills printed that folded in half, revealing an ad flier for \"Beast of Blood\" when opened. The phony bills were then scattered all over the surrounding neighborhood nearest the drive-in that was playing the film. Jim Arena said, \"The poster for the film depicted the chlorophyll monster gruesomely ripping its own head off! This horrific drawing eventually became better known than the film itself. While no such scene actually exists in the picture, it is the kind of tantalizing movie promotion that helped get those cars lining up at the drive-in\".\n\nThe film was released in 1970 on a double bill with \"Curse of the Vampires\", a 1966 Filipino horror film that was directed by Gerardo de Leon. \"Beast of Blood\" did substantial business in New York theaters, and producer Lynn (as Hemisphere Pictures) looked forward to getting the distribution rights to Ashley's next horror film, titled \"Beast of the Yellow Night\". However, Ashley and his own production company, Four Associates, put up the money to produce the film themselves with director Romero, and Ashley cut a deal with Roger Corman's then-fledgling New World Pictures to distribute it. After \"Beast of Blood\", Lynn found himself cut out of the deal entirely.\nImage Entertainment released \"Beast of Blood\" on DVD in 2002, including an audio commentary track by Sam Sherman and interviews with Romero and Yarnall. In 2018, it was released on Blu-ray by Severin Films.\n\n"}

It was released for iOS on February 21, 2014, and for Android in August of the same year.\n\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, citing its inventive and fun gameplay.\n\nCalculords is based on the framework of a turn-based strategy game in which the player controls one side of three lanes and the opponent controls the other. Both sides attempt to destroy the other's base by sending troops towards it. Each base has a certain number of hit points; once those drop to zero, the base is destroyed and that side loses the game.\n\nThe player draws cards from a virtual deck representing units. These units have numbers, while the player is given a set of numbers at the start of each turn. The player must perform mathematical equations to make their set of numbers equal the numbers on the cards, at which time they can deploy that particular card. The player receives bonuses if they are able to use the entire set of numbers in a single turn, which increase for each turn they can use all the numbers.\n\nThe player plays as the \"Star Nerd\", a human soldier who travels across the galaxy attempting to conquer various planets that are ruled by warlords.\n\nThe game's creator, Seanbaby, was inspired to develop the game because he thought CCG video games were \"sort of a mess\" and wanted to improve on them. He added the math equations to the game because he believed there was \"something satisfying in having equations to work out\". He did not mind if the math problems reduced the game's commercial appeal, saying that while he hoped the game was successful, his primary motivation was to have fun developing the game, and that those who were mainly motivated by making a commercially appealing game were \"probably an asshole\".\n\nThe game was positively received by critics, with an aggregate score of 83 on Metacritic.\n\nZack Kotzer of Kill Screen noted that while the game was \"not edutainment\", it still made him \"feel like a math hero of the universe\" and \"more confident in [his] relationship with numbers\".\n"}

{"id": "41631841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41631841", "title": "Corps Altsachsen Dresden", "text": "Corps Altsachsen Dresden\n\nThe Corps Altsachsen is a fraternity (\"Studentenverbindung\") in Dresden, Germany. It was founded on October 31, 1861 and is one of 162 \"German Student Corps\" in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical Fraternities in Europe with roots dating back to the 15th century.\n\nFour presidents (\"Rektor\") of Dresden University of Technology, Dresden's largest university with approximately 30.000 students, are among the list of members of the fraternity, underlining the deep connection between the Corps and the local alma mater. The connections with the university and the city of Dresden go far back to the fraternity's early beginnings in the late 19th century, with members aspiring to drive developments for the university over the course of history. Two major accomplishments were (1) ensuring the university's recognition by developing the former Technical Institute into the Royal Saxon Technical College of Dresden in the late 1800s and (2) founding of today's Studentenwerk Dresden in the early 1900s as the university's student council. Outside of the university's circles, many of the fraternity's members drove developments in the architectural style and design of several of Dresden's buildings such as the \"Dresden's Neuer Bahnhof\".\n\nMembership in the fraternity is open to honorable men studying at one of Dresden's universities and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character. Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Altsachsen's members wear the traditional couleur, colored stripes, in grey-green-gold. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, who are stemming from very diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.\n\nLike all \"German Student Corps\", Altsachsen expects tolerance from its members in political, scientific and religious affairs. Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Altsachsen as an entity always remains neutral. This \"neutrality\" is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity. The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging \"fox\") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal character and merit, before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (\"Rezeption\"). The fraternity has about 200 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.\nMembers of the Corps Altsachsen value and practice the tradition of engagements in \"academic fencing\", or \"Mensur\" in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the German school of fencing, is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character, allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time. Mark Twain described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices. Altsachsen's members identify themselves wearing the traditional \"couleur\", colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as \"wearing colors\" (German: \"Farben tragen\"), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.\nAltsachsen's members value the art of \"rhetoric\". The tradition is kept alive by both impromptu or \"stand-up and talk\" speeches (\"Stegreifrede\" in German) as well as elaborate platform presentations typical of industry and academia. All members must present a significant number of such talks and are graded on their presentation skills. In order to become a full member, pledge members must pass a curriculum of predetermined talks in front of their peers and guests.\n\n\"Activity\" and \"responsibility\" are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term (\"Semester\") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies. Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility. All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society. Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of \"Alter Herr\" (alumnus).\n\nLong-term guidance is expected from and provided by said \"Alte Herren\", who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities (Weinheim and Bad KÃ¶sen) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/KSCV). In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.\n\nThe fraternity was founded on October 31, 1861, at the BrÃ¼hl's Terrace in Dresden's city center as the Rhetoric Society by students of Dresden's former Institute of Technology, now the Dresden University of Technology. The name chosen for the new fraternity was originally \"Polyhymnia\", after the muse of sacred poetry, rhetoric and eloquence. The founders strongly believed that a rhetoric education and discourse should be part of a complete humanistic higher education. The colors \"grey-green-gold\" were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles focusing on academia (grey), being full of fresh energy and hope for its principles (green), and valuing friendship among fraternity brothers (gold). The strong connection to the fraternity's founding location is often revived with a rhetoric get-together at BrÃ¼hl's Terrace and spontaneous afternoon pub gatherings near the river Elbe as well as lavish balls throughout the year.\nBy 1868, the fraternity had adopted the tradition of academic fencing or \"Mensur\" challenges (back then \"duels\") with members of other proper fraternities and had changed its official name to \"Akademische Verbindung Polyhymnia\" (Academic Fraternity Polyhymnia). The motto \"Litteris et amicitiae\" (Science and Friendship) was adopted on June 25, 1880. The fraternity's coat of arms was chosen in the same year, depicting the one-headed black eagle of the time of the German Empire (1871-1918) instead of the two-headed eagle at the time of the fraternity's foundation.\nDresden's main university, today's Technical University (short: TU) Dresden was founded in 1828 as one of the first technical institutes of the world, then called \"Technical School of Saxony\". After Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire in 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute (KÃ¶niglich-SÃ¤chsisches Polytechnikum). At this point in time, topics not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced to the school curriculum. Several of Altsachsen's fraternity members were in high-ranking institute and government positions and had an influential role by lobbying Saxony's state government to recognize the technical institute as a higher education provider with polytechnical merits, which resulted in yet another name change to \"KÃ¶niglich-SÃ¤chsischen Technischen Hochschule Dresden\" (Royal-Saxon Technical College of Dresden) in 1890. \nTo honor the recognition of the educational institution, the fraternity established the \"academic principle\" (\"akademische Prinzip\"). This meant that every member could only become an alumnus after graduating with a higher academic degree and in good academic standing, an initiative by fraternity member and Honorary Senator Fritz Zeuner, son of the former president of the Poly-technical Institute Gustav Zeuner. They and others in the fraternity significantly influenced the college's course, eventually leading to the college's privilege to graduate students with doctoral degrees in 1900. Aside from traditional doctoral graduations, the university was also allowed to honor exceptional scientists and businessmen as honorary doctors; the first such honor was granted to Friedrich August Siemens.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, fraternities began forming fraternity circles and umbrella organizations. Differences in opinion about tolerance and general politics led to the end of \"honorable greeting and fencing\" with certain types of fraternities, such as the Cheruscia Dresden in 1899. This led to problems trying to maintain a high level of fencing engagements among similar fraternities, which is why five of Polyhymnia's fraternity brothers founded the \"fencing fraternity Franconia Dresden\" (\"Freischlagende Verbindung Franconia\", later \"Corps Franconia Dresden\") in Juli of 1899. Monetary stimulus for the new fraternity was provided by Polyhymnia's alumni-organisation. Both \"fencing fraternities\", not yet Corps at that point, formed the Dresden Fraternity Cartel (\"Dresdner Verbindungs-Cartell\" D.V.C.) to rival and engage in regular social and fencing events.\n\nTo guarantee her members reliable means to fence with other fraternities of like principles, Polyhymnia joint the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) in 1927 and was renamed Corps Altsachsen. The name change from \"Polyhymnia\" to \"Corps Altsachsen\" happened in compliance with WSC rules for fraternity names at that time. Likewise, most of the local fraternities merged to form similar umbrella organizations in the following years. From that point on, most of the social activity, such as eloquent balls as well as fencing engagements became limited to like-minded fraternities, the German Student Corps.\n\nSimilar to other fraternities who encouraged their members to have their own free thought and will, members of the Corps Altsachsen felt the increasing pressure of national socialist surveillance as well as political pressure in the early 1930s. A similar-minded fraternity, \"Corps Makaria Dresden\", fused with the Corps Altsachsen in 1934, which strengthened bonds and numbers within the fraternity. Still, as political pressures in Nazi Germany had increased to dangerous levels for fraternities during the next years, Corps Altsachsen officially suspended activities in 1936. During the 1930s, eventually all corps abiding by a free democratic order did the same as their view of the world was in stark contrast to the so-called FÃ¼hrerprinzip (FÃ¼hrer-principle), where one person governs essentially as dictator instead of relying on a democratic, consensus-based majority in a convent.\n\nAfter the war, the fraternity was reconstituted at the University of Cologne in 1950 and soon fused with the smaller \"Corps Gothia Dresden\" in 1953. Originally located in KÃ¶ln-Lindenthal, Altsachsen soon moved to KÃ¶ln-Marienburg, where it stayed until the Iron Curtain collapsed. During the Soviet dictatorship in East Germany, fraternities abiding by free will and common consensus were again not allowed to exist as they could not be controlled by the Socialist Party. Following Germany's reunification in 1989, the fraternity returned to Dresden in 1994 with the aid of the \"Blaues Kartell\", a circle of four like-minded fraternities that Altsachsen had joined in 1993. The \"Blaues Kartell\" today includes the Corps Saxo-Thuringia MÃ¼nchen in Munich, Corps Hannoverania in Hanover and Corps Berlin in Berlin. In 1997, the Corps Altsachsen transitioned its headquarters to its newly remodeled fraternity house on Weissbachstreet 1, right in the middle of the Campus of the Dresden University of Technology, thereby reconnecting with its traditional roots.\n\nThe fraternity is known for its strong commitment to the university and its rhetoric traditions as well as lavish social events. Among these are regular boat parties on Dresden's steam boats as well as traditional balls allowing the Corps brothers to enjoy waltz, Latin or many other forms of ballroom dance. Many of these events are not limited to the region of Dresden, as there are several trips per year to other cities.\n\nCorps Altsachsen is a member of the \"Blaues Kartell\", a circle of four German Student Corps that understand the union as \"one fraternity spanning four cities\" (Dresden, Munich, Hanover, and Berlin).\n\n\n\n\nThe KlinggrÃ¤ff-Medal is awarded for the combination of extraordinary accomplishments in academia, involvement for the fraternity and proven leadership on local and, preferentially, national level. An average of \"five medals is awarded each year nation-wide\", chosen by a joint alumni committee of KSCV and WSC representatives. The award indirectly reflects back at the fraternity, showing leaders in their field among the fraternity's brothers.

{"id": "766049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=766049", "title": "Dramatic structure", "text": "Dramatic structure\n\nDramatic structure is the structure of a dramatic work such as a play or film. Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE). This article looks at Aristotle's analysis of the Greek tragedy and on Gustav Freytag's analysis of ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama.\n\nIn his \"Poetics\", the Greek philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. \"A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end\" (1450b27). He split the play into two parts: complication and unravelling.\n\nThe Roman drama critic Horace advocated a 5-act structure in his Ars Poetica: \"Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula\" (lines 189â190) (\"A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts\").\n\nThe fourth-century Roman grammarian Aelius Donatus defined the play as a three part structure, the protasis, epitasis, and catastrophe).\n\nIn 1863, around the time that playwrights like Henrik Ibsen were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the German playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote \"Die Technik des Dramas\", a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid. Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts: exposition (originally called introduction), rising action (rise), climax, falling action (return or fall), and dÃ©nouement/<wbr>resolution/<wbr>revelation/<wbr>catastrophe.\n\nMany structural principles still in use by modern storytellers were explained by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\". In the part that we still have, he mostly analyzed the tragedy. A part analyzing the comedy is believed to have existed but is now lost.\n\nAristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end. There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts: complication and unravelling. During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.\n\nTwo types of scenes are of special interest: the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation. Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points needs to be properly set up.\n\nComplications should arise from a flaw in the protagonist. In the tragedy, this flaw will be his undoing.\n\nAccording to Freytag, a drama is divided into five parts, or acts, which some refer to as a : exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dÃ©nouement. Freytag's Pyramid can help writers organize their thoughts and ideas when describing the main problem of the drama, the rising action, the climax and the falling action.\n\nAlthough Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure is based on five-act plays, it can be applied (sometimes in a modified manner) to short stories and novels as well, making dramatic structure a literary element. Nonetheless, the pyramid is not always easy to use, especially in modern plays such as Alfred Uhry's \"Driving Miss Daisy\" and Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\", which is actually divided into 25 scenes without concrete acts.\n\nThe exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.\n\nIn the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.\n\nThe climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in his or her favor, often requiring the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths. If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses.\n\nDuring the falling action, the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.\n\nThe dÃ©nouement (, ; ) comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. Conflicts are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of catharsis, or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader. Etymologically, the French word \"dÃ©nouement\" is derived from the word \"dÃ©nouer\", \"to untie\", from \"nodus\", Latin for \"knot.\" It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a plot.\n\nThe comedy ends with a \"dÃ©nouement\" (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy ends with a catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the beginning of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic \"dÃ©nouement\" is the final scene of Shakespeareâs comedy \"As You Like It\", in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two disguised characters are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the \"dÃ©nouement\" is usually the death of one or more characters.\n\nFreytag's analysis was intended to apply to ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama, not modern.\n\nContemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact (melodrama). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20138524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20138524", "title": "Dusit Thani", "text": "Dusit Thani\n\nDusit Thani () was a miniature city and micronation project created by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) of Siam (Thailand) in Dusit Palace (later moved to Phaya Thai) in the 1910sâ1920s. The project explored aspects of democracy, as members of the court were to be \"citizens\" owning property in the model city. Elections were held, a constitution written, and two newspapers regularly published for the fictional country. Although critics have dismissed the project as nothing more than the king playing with dollhouses, others regard it as the first trial of a constitutional government in Thailand.\n\nDusit Thani was a Thai miniature city that was designed as a model city, established by King Vajiravudh or King Rama VI of Thailand. It was reported that Dusit Park was originally sited as the location of the city, which later was moved to Phraya Thai at the end of 1919. \"Dusit Thani\" means 'town in heaven'. \"Dusit\" is the name of the fourth of the six levels of Buddhist heaven and \"Thani\" means 'town'. King Rama VI was interested in democracy as he was the first Thai king to go to study abroad in England and to pursue the intention of his father (King Rama V) and grandfather (King Rama IV) of bringing modernization to the nation. The city was an experiment in democratic constitution which the king, himself, chose to initiate.\n\nThe reign of King Rama VI is considered one of the golden ages of Thai literature. He was hoping to educate his citizens about democracy and set up Dusit Thani, a democratic model city. It was difficult for Thai's at that time to understand the king, who was Westernized, and his concept of democracy because it was unfamiliar and hard to comprehend.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, miniature objects became a fad, especially in England where King Rama VI was educated. Dusit Thani was an example of the miniature object at that period. The intention of the city was to show equality of all citizens in a democratic society. Craftsmen were hired by noble families in Bangkok in order to reconstruct their houses in the miniature city. They had to register and buy land to become citizens in the city. They could freely express and participate in debating public affairs in the city. Two political groups were founded in Dusit Thani, the Blue Party and the Red Party. King Rama VI adopted the name \"MR. Rama\" to participate in the city.\n\nDusit Park was a rice field before modernizing. Later, Dusit Thani was relocated to Phraya Thai where it was redeveloped.\n\nThe miniature model city was planned on one acre of the Dusit Park or the Royal Amporn Gardens near the present Congress building. Buildings inside Dusit Thani were scaled to one-fifteenth life size. Palaces, hotels, hospitals, a clock tower, 12-story buildings, a fire brigade, a bank, flying bridges, trade centers, canal locks, and newspapers, were represented in the city.\n\nThe project was a failure. It was rejected because the country was not ready for democracy and if the city was actually built, the constitution would be used only in the city but not nationwide. The constitution of Dusit Thani was written by King Rama VI and it was administered by the Blue and the Red political groups with representatives selected by elections. In 1925, the king died, which caused a halt to the miniature city project and the city was never actually built. There were some attempts by Thai students, who were educated in Europe and had been interested in democracy and modernization, to carry on the ideal of democracy. Seven years after the king's death a revolution occurred. A new government, a constitutional monarchy, replaced 700 years of absolute monarchy. However, Dusit Thani had a different path. The model city was poorly preserved after the king's death and had never been repaired. Only a few surviving buildings were moved to the gardens of the Monk's Hospital. They were either covered by dust or ended up in trash cans. No remains are left to be seen today except for a tiny bandstand.\n"}
{"id": "17035544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17035544", "title": "French post-structuralist feminism", "text": "French post-structuralist feminism\n\nFrench post-structuralist feminism takes post-structuralism and combines it with feminist views and looks to see if a literary work has successfully used the process of mimesis on the image of the female. If successful, then a new image of a woman has been created by a woman for a woman, therefore it is not a biased opinion created by men. Along with Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Cixous is considered one of the mothers of poststructuralist feminist theory. Since the 1990s, these three together with Bracha Ettinger have considerably influenced French feminism and feminist psychoanalysis.\n\n\"Ãcriture fÃ©minine\" literally means \"women's writing.\" It is a philosophy that promotes women's experiences and feelings to the point that it strengthens the work. It is a strain of feminist literary theory that originated in France in the 1970s.\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Cixous first uses this term in her essay, \"The Laugh of the Medusa\" in which she asserts:\n\n\"Woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies. Ãcriture fÃ©minine places experience before language, and privileges the anti-linear, cyclical writing so often frowned upon by patriarchal society.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, Cixous began writing about the relationship between sexuality and language. Like many other feminist theorists, Cixous believes that human sexuality is directly tied to how people communicate in society.\n\nIn HÃ©lÃ¨ne Cixous' essay \"The Laugh of the Medusa\", she discusses how women have been repressed through their bodies all through history. She suggests that if women are forced to remain in their bodies as a result of male repression then they can do one of two things. The first option is to remain trapped inside their bodies, thereby perpetuating the passivity women have been a party to throughout history. The second option is to use the female body as a medium of communication, a tool through which women can speak. This is ironic given the body, the very thing women have been defined by and trapped within, can now become a vehicle in transcending the boundaries once created by the body.\n\nIn the original myth Medusa was a beautiful woman who confronted endless hardships that were brought about by the actions of men. She was raped, killed, and beheaded by various gods. However even in the face of tragedy and disgrace, Medusa was still portrayed as a meaningful figure. Following the moment her head was cut off, a Pegasus flew out of her body, representing the birth of beauty.\n\nIn the more popular version known by most today, Medusa is a monster with hair of a thousand snakes whose glance will turn anything she looks at into stone. Cixous claims that this monstrous image of Medusa exists only because it has been directly determined by the male gaze. Even though this version of the myth is misrepresentative of the original version, people continue to believe the modern version without question.\n\nCixous suggests that it is important for women to expose the flaws in language that currently exist. Through the awareness of such flaws, as well as the invention of new ways of expression, women can overcome the obstacles that are constructed by what she labels a phallocentric discourse. She argues that even through attempts to expose current inadequacies, it will always be impossible to define a feminine practice of writing because this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded. \"It will always surpass the discourse that regulates the phallocentric system; it does and will take place in areas other than those subordinated to philosophico-theoretical domination. It will be conceived of only by those who are breakers of automatisms.\" \n\nBorn in Belgium in 1932 Irigaray is a French feminist, psychoanalytic, and cultural theorist. Best known works: Speculum of the Other Woman (1974) and This Sex is Not One (1977).\nShe was inspired by the psychoanalytic theories of Jaques Lacan and the deconstruction of Jaques Derrida. Her work aims to reveal a perceived masculine philosophy underlying language and gestures toward a ânewâ feminine language that would allow women to express themselves if it could be spoken.\n\nBorn on June 24, 1941 in Bulgaria Kristeva is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, literary critic, psychoanalyst, feminist, and (most recently) novelist, who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. Julia Kristeva has become influential in today's international critical analysis, cultural theory, and feminism after publishing her first book \"SemeiotikÃ¨\" in 1969.\nAlthough Kristeva does not refer to her own writing as feminist, many feminists turn to her work in order to expand and develop various discussions and debates in feminist theory and criticism.\n\nThree elements of Kristeva's thought have been particularly important for feminist theory in Anglo-American contexts:\nHer notion of abjection as an explanation for oppression and discrimination.\n\nSigmund Freud established the initial theories which would serve as a basis for some of Cixous' arguments in her writings. Freud's analysis of gender roles and sexual identity concluded with separate male (Oedipus) and female (Electra) theories of which Cixous was critical. For Bracha Ettinger both Oedipus and Electra are complexes that belong to the phallic paradigm. She proposes a different paradigm: the feminine-matrixial borderspace.\n\n\n"}

Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum).

Trinidad shares a common history of Spanish colonisation with Venezuela and there have been close relationships between the two countries with many aspects of shared culture.

Kerr's tone is at various points jocular, learned and lucid, with humorous titles, clear prose and an evident wide knowledge of playwrights from the Greeks all the way to Arthur Miller and other playwrights of the mid 20th century.\n\nOf moderate length (244 pages), the book takes on many themes and topics. Kerr offers insights both into the practice and finances of contemporary theatre, blaming the declining audience (declining even in 1955) on the poor and un-entertaining fare being put before the public by both commercial and institutional producers.\n\nIn particular, he blames decades of slavish imitation of Henrik Ibsen and Anton Chekhov, not only because their styles had become hackneyed and arthritic (Ibsen, himself, had abandoned \"Ibsenism\" after only a decade), but because they were created by and for an intelligentsia, and no thriving theatrical culture has ever been built that way, citing the case of William Shakespeare \"vs.\" the school of John Lyly, among others.\n\nHe asserts that plays will always be more successful if they are highly entertaining, and argues that that entertainment can be at once enjoyable and artistically sophisticated. He also calls for a return to verse, pointing out Christopher Fry as an example of a new and supple 20th-century theatrical verse style.\n\nAbove all, Kerr is an advocate for creating believable, active characters and putting them into interesting stories, even at the expense of clean structures in plays, overarching intellectual / political theses, or delicate dissections of neurasthenic and impotent personalities.\n\nIn light of Kerr's marriage to playwright Jean Collins Kerr, his musing on the ethics of a critic reviewing a wife's play inspired Ira Levin's play and movie \"Critic's Choice\".\n"}
{"id": "407591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407591", "title": "Hulk (film)", "text": "Hulk (film)\n\nHulk is a 2003 American superhero film based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same name directed by Ang Lee which stars Eric Bana as the title character, Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross, Sam Elliott as General Thaddeus E. \"Thunderbolt\" Ross , Josh Lucas, and Nick Nolte as Bruce's father. The film explores the origins of Bruce Banner, who after a lab accident involving gamma radiation finds himself able to turn into a huge green-skinned monster whenever he is emotionally provoked or stressed, while he is pursued by the United States military and comes into a conflict with his biological father, who has his own dark agenda for his son.\n\nDevelopment for the film started as far back as 1990. The film was at one point to be directed by Joe Johnston and then Jonathan Hensleigh. More scripts had been written by Hensleigh, John Turman, Michael France, Zak Penn (who would go on to write \"The Incredible Hulk\"), J. J. Abrams, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, Michael Tolkin, and David Hayter before Ang Lee and James Schamus' involvement. \"Hulk\" was shot mostly in California, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\"Hulk\" was a commercial success, grossing over $245 million worldwide, higher than its $137 million budget, earning praise for its visual effects, ambition, performances and complexity (especially compared with other superhero films released at that time), while the film's pacing, bleak tone, Hulkâs CGI aspects and lack of more action were subjects of criticism. A reboot, titled \"The Incredible Hulk\", was released on June 13, 2008 as the second film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nDuring the 1960s, scientist David Banner has the idea to forge supersoldiers by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use human subjects, considering it dangerous and stupid. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After the birth of his son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process by a furious Ross who'd found out about the secret work. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers.\n\nYears later, Bruce is a geneticist working with colleague and girlfriend Betty Ross, within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on nanomed research to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low-level gamma radiation exposure to turn on the nanomeds once they are introduced into a living organism, planning to use it to cure all from sicknesses such as cancer and Alzheimer's. They get harassed by Major Glenn Talbot who plans to use the work to forge supersoldiers. During routine maintenance of their appropriated gamma-ray spectrometer, a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of gamma radiation.\n\nBetty visits Bruce in the hospital and remarks that he should be dead, but Bruce feels great. A new janitor at the lab claims that he is Bruce's biological father, whom Bruce forgot. Bruce presumes the janitor was lying until he finds it was truth when he checks his own genes. When under extreme stress, Bruce transforms into the Hulk, a huge, humanoid, green-skinned monstrous being who destroys the laboratory, though Bruce forgets soon after. General Ross suspects Bruce of collaborating with David Banner but deduces Bruce has repressed memories after questioning. He orders Bruce to be put under house arrest.\n\nThrough a phone call with his father, Bruce learns that the radiation unleashed something that was already in his DNA, and that David Banner plans to have Betty killed by his dogs, which now have similar powers to the Hulk thanks to David mutating them with gamma radiation. Bruce is then attacked by Talbot who accused him of going behind the back to cut him from the work, leading to a second transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seriously injures Talbot before leaping to save Betty. After being wounded in a lengthy struggle, he kills David's dogs and changes back into Bruce before being captured by the military the next morning.\n\nBruce is kept under observation at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, but instead of turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to absorb any material he touches or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after lying to Betty and telling that he had accidentally murdered his wife in front of the child Bruce due to fury done by Ross's interference.\n\nBruce has a nightmare about the event, he realises his father thought he was a monster and tried to kill him while his mother protected him. This leads to a more powerful transformation into the Hulk. While attempting to gain a sample of the monster, Talbot is killed by a grenade-launcher he uses. The Hulk escapes Desert Base and rampages across the desert to San Francisco, battling Army forces sent after him. Betty calms Bruce into his human form.\n\nDavid tries to taunt his son into transforming into the Hulk, but fails. He then decides to \"go first\" and bites an electrical cable, absorbing all the electricity in San Francisco. The electricity hits Bruce, triggering his own transformation. A brutal fight ensues between David and the Hulk, with David absorbing the Hulk's energy. It proves too much for David to handle, but when he himself transforms into a massive creature, he is killed by an Army missile. One year later, Bruce is presumed dead, while General Ross mentions apparent Hulk sightings and Betty admits her love for Bruce. In a South American jungle, Bruce has become a doctor and is approached by rebel militants who want to take medical supplies from the poor. Bruce faces the militants' leader, warning him that, \"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry\". His eye turns green and the roar of the Hulk is heard from the distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHulk co-creator/executive producer Stan Lee and former \"Hulk\" actor Lou Ferrigno made cameo appearances in the film as security guards. Johnny Kastl and Daniel Dae Kim have small roles as soldiers.\n\nProducers Avi Arad and Gale Anne Hurd began the development for \"Hulk\" in 1990, the same year the final TV movie based on the 1970s TV series aired. They set the property up at Universal Pictures in 1992. Michael France and Stan Lee were invited into Universal's offices in 1994, with France writing the script. Universal's concept was to have the Hulk battle terrorists, an idea France disliked. John Turman, a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1995, getting approval from Lee. Turman wrote ten drafts and was heavily influenced by the \"Tales to Astonish\" issues, which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military, the Leader, Rick Jones, the atomic explosion origin from the comics, and Brian Banner as the explanation for Bruce's inner anger. Universal had mixed feelings over Turman's script, but nonetheless future screenwriters would use many elements.\n\nHurd brought her husband Jonathan Hensleigh as co-producer the following year and Industrial Light & Magic was hired to use computer-generated imagery to create the Hulk. Universal was courting France once more to write the script, but changed their minds when Joe Johnston became the director in April 1997. The studio wanted Hensleigh to rewrite the script due to his successful results on Johnston's \"Jumanji\". France was fired before he wrote a single page, but received a buy-off from Universal. Johnston dropped out of directing in July 1997 in favor of \"October Sky\", and Hensleigh convinced Universal to make the \"Hulk\" his directing debut. Turman was brought back a second time to write two more drafts. Zak Penn then rewrote it. His script featured a fight between the Hulk and a school of sharks, as well as two scenes he eventually used for the 2008 film; Banner realizing he is unable to have sex, and triggering a transformation by falling out of a helicopter. Hensleigh rewrote from scratch, coming up with a brand new storyline featuring Bruce Banner, who prior to the accident which will turn him into The Hulk, experimenting with gamma-irradiated insect DNA on three convicts. This transforms the convicts into \"insect men\" that cause havoc.\n\nFilming was set to start in December 1997 in Arizona for a summer 1999 release date, but filming was pushed back for four months. Hensleigh subsequently rewrote the script with J. J. Abrams. Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were also brought on board to rewrite with Hensleigh still attached as director. In October 1997, \"Hulk\" had entered pre-production with the creation of prosthetic makeup and computer animation already under way. Gregory Sporleder was cast as \"Novak\", Banner's archenemy while Lynn \"Red\" Williams was cast as a convict who transforms into a combination of human, ant and beetle. In March 1998 Universal put \"Hulk\" on due to its escalating $100 million budget and worries of Hensleigh directing his first film. $20 million was already spent on script development, computer animation, and prosthetics work. Hensleigh immediately went to rewrite the script in order to lower the budget.\n\nHensleigh found the rewriting process to be too difficult and dropped out, and felt he \"wasted nine months in pre-production\". It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed \"Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure if this was a science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie.\" France was writing the script on fast track from JulyâSeptember 1999. Filming for \"Hulk\" was to start in April 2000.\n\nFrance stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his \"amiable, nerdy genius\" incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced Brian Banner, Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father. However, he has anger management issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The \"Don't make me angry...\" line from the TV series was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the \"Gammasphere\", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the black ops made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999-January 2000.\n\nMichael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote the script afterwards, despite positive response from the producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and get caught in the same accident that creates the Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from \"King Kong\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jekyll and Hyde\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Faust\", and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.\n\nSchamus was still rewriting the script in October 2001. In early 2002, as filming was underway, Michael France read all the scripts for the Writers Guild of America, to determine who would get final credit. France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a deeper character, and was saddened they had denigrated his and Turman's work in interviews. Schamus elected to get solo credit. France felt, \"James Schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner's father as a real character in the present. But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman's scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that's why we were credited.\" France, Turman and Schamus received final credit. A theatrical release date for June 20, 2003 was announced in December 2001, with the film's title as \"The Hulk\".\n\nFilming began on March 18, 2002 in Arizona, and moved on April 19 to the San Francisco Bay Area. This included Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley labs, Oakland, Treasure Island military base, and the sequoia forests of Porterville, before several weeks in the Utah and Californian deserts. The penultimate battle scene between Hulk and his father used the real Pear Lake in Sequoia National Park as a backdrop. Filming then moved to the Universal backlot in Los Angeles, using Stage 12 for the water tank scene, before finishing in the first week of August. Filming of \"Hulk\" constituted hiring 3,000 local workers, generating over $10 million into the local economy. Mychael Danna, who previously collaborated with Lee on \"Ride with the Devil\" and \"The Ice Storm\", was set to compose the film score before dropping out. Danny Elfman was then hired.\n\nEric Bana commented that the shoot was, \"Ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid in a lot of ways.\" Lee told him that he was shooting a Greek tragedy: he would be making a \"whole other movie\" about the Hulk at Industrial Light & Magic. An example of Lee's art house approach to the film was taking Bana to watch a bare-knuckle boxing match. Visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren was on the set every day. One of the many visual images in the film that presented an acting challenge for Bana was a split screen technique employed by Lee to cinematically mimic the panels of a comic book page. This required many more takes of individual scenes than normal. Sound design was completed at Skywalker Sound. Muren and other ILM animators used previous technology from \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" (for the Dobby character) to create the Hulk with computer-generated imagery. Other software used included PowerAnimator, Softimage XSI, and RenderMan Interface Specification. ILM started computer animation work in 2001, and completed in May 2003, just one month before the film's release. Lee provided some motion capture work in post-production.\n\nThe musical score for \"Hulk\" was composed by Danny Elfman, who scored \"Spider-Man\" the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, was the original composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much of the character of Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores. \"They did leave some of my music in the movie,\" said Danna, \"so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing and I guess he liked it.\"\n\nA soundtrack album was released on June 17, 2003 by Decca Records. It features the song \"Set Me Free\" by Velvet Revolver, which is played during the film's end credits.\nUniversal Pictures spent $2.1Â million to market the film in a 30-second television spot during Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. And a 70-second teaser trailer was attached to \"Spider-Man\" on May 3, 2002. Just weeks before the film's release, a number of workprints were leaked on the Internet. The visual and special effects were already being criticized, despite the fact that it was not the final editing cut of the film.\n\n\"Hulk\" was released on VHS and DVD on October 28, 2003. The film earned $61.2Â million in DVD sales during 2003. \"Hulk\" was released on HD DVD format on December 12, 2006 and it was later released on Blu-ray on September 16, 2008.\n\n\"Hulk\" received mixed-to-positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes calculated a 62% approval rating out of 232 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While Ang Lee's ambitious film earns marks for style and an attempt at dramatic depth, there's ultimately too much talking and not enough smashing.\" By comparison Metacritic collected an average score of 54 based on 40 reviews. Roger Ebert gave a positive review, explaining, \"Ang Lee is trying to actually deal with the issues in the story of the Hulk, instead of simply cutting to brainless visual effects.\" Ebert also liked how the Hulk's movements resembled King Kong. Although Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" felt \"Hulk\" should have been shorter, he heavily praised the action sequences, especially the climax and cliffhanger. Paul Clinton of \"CNN\" believed the cast gave strong performances, but in an otherwise positive review, heavily criticized the computer-generated imagery, calling the Hulk \"a ticked-off version of Shrek\".\n\nConversely, Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" considered \"the film is more thoughtful and pleasing to the eye than any blockbuster in recent memory, but its epic length comes without an epic reward.\" Ty Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" felt \"Jennifer Connelly reprises her stand-by-your-messed-up-scientist turn from \"A Beautiful Mind\".\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated, \"a big-budget comic-book adaptation has rarely felt so humorless and intellectually defensive about its own pulpy roots.\"\n\nIn later years, \"Hulk\" received retrospective praise from critics for its artistic difference from other superhero films. In 2012, Matt Zoller Seitz cited the film as one of the few big budget superhero films that \"really departed from formula, in terms of subject matter or tone\", writing that the film is \"pretty bizarre... in its old-school Freudian psychology, but interesting for that reason\". In Scout Tafoya's 2016 video essay on another film directed by Ang Lee, \"Ride with the Devil\", he mentioned \"Hulk\" as \"Lee's ill-fated but quietly soulful and deeply sad adaptation of \"The Incredible Hulk\" comics\". In 2018, Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com wrote that the film is \"a genuinely great example of cinematic pop art that deserves a reappraisal\".\n\n\"Hulk\" was released on June 20, 2003, earning $62.1Â million in its opening weekend, which made it the 16th highest ever opener at the time. With a second weekend drop of 70%, it was the first opener above $20Â million to drop over 65%. The film went on to gross $132,177,234 in North America on an estimated budget of $137,000,000, and made $113,183,246 in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $245,360,480. With a final North American gross of $132.2Â million it became the largest opener not to earn $150Â million.\n\nConnelly and Danny Elfman received nominations at the 30th Saturn Awards with Best Actress and Best Music. The film was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film but lost out to another film based on Marvel characters, \"X2\". Dennis Muren, Michael Lantieri and the special effects crew were nominated for Best Special Effects.\n\nAfter the mixed reception of \"Hulk\", Marvel Studios reacquired the film rights to the character, and writer Zak Penn began work on a sequel titled \"The Incredible Hulk\". However, Edward Norton rewrote Penn's script after he signed on to star, retelling the origin story in flashbacks and revelations, to help in establishing the film as a reboot; director Louis Leterrier agreed with this approach. Leterrier acknowledged that the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America.\n\n"}

{"id": "5443545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5443545", "title": "Krazy Kat", "text": "Krazy Kat\n\nKrazy Kat (also known as Krazy & Ignatz in some reprints and compilations) is an American newspaper comic strip by cartoonist George Herriman (1880â1944), which ran from 1913 to 1944. It first appeared in the \"New York Evening Journal\", whose owner, William Randolph Hearst, was a major booster for the strip throughout its run. The characters had been introduced previously in a side strip with Herriman's earlier creation, \"The Dingbat Family\". The phrase \"Krazy Kat\" originated there, said by the mouse by way of describing the cat. Set in a dreamlike portrayal of Herriman's vacation home of Coconino County, Arizona, \"Krazy\" mixture of offbeat surrealism, innocent playfulness and poetic, idiosyncratic language has made it a favorite of comics aficionados and art critics for more than 80 years.\n\nThe strip focuses on the curious relationship between a guileless, carefree, simple-minded cat named Krazy of indeterminate gender (referred to as both \"he\" and \"she\") and a short-tempered mouse named Ignatz. Krazy nurses an unrequited love for the mouse. However, Ignatz despises Krazy and constantly schemes to throw bricks at Krazy's head, which Krazy interprets as a sign of affection, uttering grateful replies such as \"Li'l dollink, allus f'etful\", or \"Li'l ainjil\". A third principal character, Officer Bull Pupp, often appears and tries to \"protect\" Krazy by thwarting Ignatz' attempts and imprisoning him. Later on, Officer Pupp falls in love with Krazy.\n\nDespite the slapstick simplicity of the general premise, the detailed characterization, combined with Herriman's visual and verbal creativity, made \"Krazy Kat\" one of the first comics to be widely praised by intellectuals and treated as \"serious\" art. Art critic Gilbert Seldes wrote a lengthy panegyric to the strip in 1924, calling it \"the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today.\" Poet E. E. Cummings, another Herriman admirer, wrote the introduction to the first collection of the strip in book form. These critical appraisals by Seldes and Cummings were influential in establishing \"Krazy Kat\"s reputation as a work of genius. Though \"Krazy Kat\" was only a modest success during its initial run, in more recent years, many modern cartoonists have cited the strip as a major influence.\n\n\"Krazy Kat\" takes place in a heavily stylized version of Coconino County, Arizona, with Herriman filling the page with caricatured flora and fauna, and rock formation landscapes typical of the Painted Desert. These backgrounds tend to change dramatically between panels, even while the characters remain stationary. While the local geography is fluid, certain sites were stableâand featured so often in the strip as to become iconic. These latter included Officer Pupp's jailhouse and Kolin Kelly's brickyard. A Southwestern visual style is evident throughout, with clay-shingled rooftops, trees planted in pots with designs imitating Navajo art, along with references to Mexican-American culture. The strip also occasionally features incongruous trappings borrowed from the stage, with curtains, backdrops, theatrical placards, and sometimes even floor lights framing the panel borders.\n\nThe descriptive passages mix whimsical, often alliterative language with phonetically-spelled dialogue and a strong poetic sensibility (\"Agathla, centuries aslumber, shivers in its sleep with splenetic splendor, and spreads abroad a seismic spasm with the supreme suavity of a vagabond volcano.\"). Herriman was also fond of experimenting with unconventional page layouts in his Sunday strips, including panels of various shapes and sizes, arranged in whatever fashion he thought would best tell the story.\n\nThough the basic concept of the strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to tweak the formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head sometimes succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or gnomic pronouncements irritating the mouse so much that he goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even self-referential humor is evidentâin one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.\n\nPublic reaction at the time was mixed; many were puzzled by its iconoclastic refusal to conform to linear comic strip conventions and straightforward gags. But publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst loved \"Krazy Kat\", and it continued to appear in his papers throughout its run, sometimes only by his direct order.\n\nSimple-minded, curious, mindlessly happy and perpetually innocent, the strip's title character drifts through life in Coconino County without a care. Krazy's dialogue is a highly stylized argot (\"A fowl konspirissy â is it pussible?\") phonetically evoking a mixture of English, French, Spanish, Yiddish and other dialects, often identified as George Herriman's own native New Orleans dialect, Yat. Often singing and dancing to express the Kat's eternal joy, Krazy is hopelessly in love with Ignatz and thinks that the mouse's brick-tossing is his way of returning that love. Krazy is also completely unaware of the bitter rivalry between Ignatz and \"Offissa\" Pupp and mistakes the dog's frequent imprisonment of the mouse for an innocent game of tag (\"Ever times I see them two playing games togedda, Ignatz seems to be It\"). On those occasions when Ignatz is caught before he can launch his brick, Krazy is left pining for the \"l'il ainjil\" and wonders where the beloved mouse has gone.\n\nKrazy's own gender is never made clear and appears to be fluid, varying from strip to strip. Most authors post-Herriman (beginning with Cummings) have mistakenly referred to Krazy only as female, but Krazy's creator was more ambiguous and even published several strips poking fun at this uncertainty. When filmmaker Frank Capra, a fan of the strip, asked Herriman to straightforwardly define the character's sex, the cartoonist admitted that Krazy was \"something like a sprite, an elf. They have no sex. So that Kat can't be a he or a she. The Kat's a spiritâa pixieâfree to butt into anything.\" Most characters inside the strip use \"he\" and \"him\" to refer to Krazy, likely as a gender-neutral \"he\".\n\nIgnatz is driven to distraction by Krazy's naÃ¯vetÃ©, and he throws bricks at Krazy Kat's head. To shield his plans from Officer Pupp, Ignatz hides his bricks, disguises himself, or enlists the aid of willing Coconino County denizens (without making his intentions clear). Easing Ignatz's task is Krazy Kat's willingness to meet him anywhere at any appointed time, eager to receive a token of affection in the form of a brick to the head. Ignatz is married with three children, though they are rarely seen.\n\nIronically, although Ignatz seems to generally dislike Krazy, one strip shows his ancestor, Mark Antony Mouse, fall in love with Krazy's ancestor, an Egyptian cat princess (calling her his \"Star of the Nile\"), and pay a sculptor to carve a brick with a love message. When he throws it at her, he is arrested, but she announces her love for him, and from that day on, he throws bricks at her to show his love for her (which would explain why Krazy believes that Ignatz throwing bricks is a sign of love). In another strip, Krazy kisses a sleeping Ignatz, and hearts appear above the mouse's head.\n\nIn the last five (or so) years of the strip, Ignatz's dislike for Krazy was noticeably downplayed. While earlier, one got the sense of his taking advantage of Krazy's willingness to be \"bricked\", now one gets the sense of Ignatz and Krazy as chummy co-conspirators against Pupp, with Ignatz at times quite aware of the positive way Krazy interprets his missiles.\n\nA police dog who loves Krazy, and always tries (sometimes successfully) to thwart Ignatz's desires to pelt Krazy Kat with bricks. Officer Pupp and Ignatz often try to get the better of each other even when Krazy is not directly involved, as they both enjoy seeing the other played for a fool. He appears slightly less frequently than Krazy and Ignatz. He is also the main character of his own short film series.\n\nBeyond these three, Coconino County is populated with an assortment of incidental, recurring characters.\n\nOther characters who make semi-frequent appearances are: \n\n\"Krazy Kat\" evolved from an earlier comic strip of Herriman's, \"The Dingbat Family\", which started in June 1910 and was later renamed \"The Family Upstairs\". This comic chronicled the Dingbats' attempts to avoid the mischief of the mysterious unseen family living in the apartment above theirs and to unmask that family. Herriman would complete the cartoons about the Dingbats, and finding himself with time left over in his 8-hour work day, filled the bottom of the strip with slapstick drawings of the upstairs family's mouse preying upon the Dingbats' cat.\n\nThis \"basement strip\" grew into something much larger than the original cartoon. It became a daily comic strip with a title (running vertically down the side of the page) on October 28, 1913 and a black and white full-page Sunday cartoon on April 23, 1916. Due to the objections of editors, who didn't think it was suitable for the comics sections, \"Krazy Kat\" originally appeared in the Hearst papers' art and drama sections. Hearst himself, however, enjoyed the strip so much that he gave Herriman a lifetime contract and guaranteed the cartoonist complete creative freedom.\n\nDespite its low popularity among the general public, \"Krazy Kat\" gained a wide following among intellectuals. In 1922, a jazz ballet based on the comic was produced and scored by John Alden Carpenter; though the performance played to sold-out crowds on two nights and was given positive reviews in \"The New York Times\" and \"The New Republic\", it failed to boost the strip's popularity as Hearst had hoped. In addition to Seldes and Cummings, contemporary admirers of \"Krazy Kat\" included Willem de Kooning, H. L. Mencken, and Jack Kerouac. More recent scholars and authors have seen the strip as reflecting the Dada movement and prefiguring postmodernism.\n\nBeginning in 1935, \"Krazy Kat\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Sunday edition was published in full color. Though the number of newspapers carrying it dwindled in its last decade, Herriman continued to draw \"Krazy Kat\"âcreating roughly 3,000 cartoonsâuntil his death in April 1944 (the final page was published exactly two months later, on June 25). Hearst promptly canceled the strip after the artist died, because, contrary to the common practice of the time, he did not want to see a new cartoonist take over.\n\nThe comic strip was animated several times (see filmography below). The earliest \"Krazy Kat\" shorts were produced by Hearst in 1916. They were produced under Hearst-Vitagraph News Pictorial and later the International Film Service (IFS), though Herriman was not involved. In 1920, after a two-year hiatus, the John R. Bray studio began producing a second series of \"Krazy Kat\" shorts. These cartoons hewed close to the comic strips, including Ignatz, Pupp and other standard supporting characters. Krazy's ambiguous gender and feelings for Ignatz were usually preserved; bricks were occasionally thrown. With added sound effects and music, these cartoons were in periodic reissue during the 1930s and 1940s, and ended up being syndicated to television in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1925, animation pioneer Bill Nolan decided to bring Krazy to the screen again. Nolan intended to produce the series under Associated Animators, but when it dissolved, he sought distribution from Margaret J. Winkler. Unlike earlier adaptations, Nolan did not base his shorts on the characters and setting of the Herriman comic strip. Instead, the feline in Nolan's cartoons was a male cat whose design and personality both reflected Felix the Cat. This is probably due to the fact that Nolan himself was a former employee of the Pat Sullivan studio. Other Herriman characters appeared in the Nolan cartoons at first, though similarly altered: Kwakk Wakk was at times Krazy's paramour, with Ignatz often the bully trying to break up the romance. Over time, Nolan's influence waned and new directors, Ben Harrison and Manny Gould, took over the series. By late 1927, they were solely in charge.\n\nWinkler's husband, Charles B. Mintz, slowly began assuming control of the operation. Mintz and his studio began producing the cartoons in sound beginning with 1929's \"Ratskin\". In 1930, he moved the staff to California and ultimately changed the design of Krazy Kat. The new character bore even less resemblance to the one in the newspapers. Mintz's Krazy Kat was, like many other early 1930s cartoon characters, imitative of Mickey Mouse, and usually engaged in slapstick comic adventures with his look-alike girlfriend and loyal pet dog. In 1936, animator Isadore Klein, with the blessing of Mintz, set to work creating the short, \"Lil' Ainjil\", the only Mintz work that was intended to reflect Herriman's comic strip. However, Klein was \"terribly disappointed\" with the resulting cartoon, and the Mickey-derivative Krazy returned. In 1939, Mintz became indebted to his distributor, Columbia Pictures, and subsequently sold his studio to them. Under the name Screen Gems, the studio produced only one more Krazy Kat cartoon, \"The Mouse Exterminator\" in 1940.\n\nKing Features produced 50 \"Krazy Kat\" cartoons from 1962â1964, most of which were created at Gene Deitch's Rembrandt Films in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic), whilst the rest were produced by Artransa Film Studios in Sydney, Australia. The cartoons were initially televised interspersed with \"Beetle Bailey\" (some of which were also produced by Artransa) and \"Snuffy Smith\" cartoons to form a half-hour TV show. These cartoons helped to introduce Herriman's cat to the baby boom generation. The King Features shorts were made for television and have a closer connection to the comic strip; the backgrounds are drawn in a similar style, and Ignatz is present. This incarnation of Krazy was made female; Penny Phillips voiced Krazy while Paul Frees voiced Ignatz. The recurring character Officer Bull Pupp also has his own cartoon series. Jay Livingston and Ray Evans did the music for most of the episodes. Most of the episodes are available on DVD.\n\nIn 1951, Dell Publishing revived the characters for a run of comic books. All five issues were drawn by cartoonist John Stanley, best known for his \"Little Lulu\" comic books. While the general plot premise is reminiscent of Herriman's strip, the look and feel are entirely different: firmly in the visual and written style of 1950s \"funny animal\" strips for children. Krazy is male in this version of the strip while Ignatz is female. This \"Krazy Kat\" also made several one-shot appearances in Dell's \"Four Color Comics\" series, from 1953 through 1956 (#454, 504, 548, 619, 696,) and was reprinted in some Gold Key and Page Comics over the next decade.\n\nThe strip went through several format changes during its run, each of which impacted the artwork and the narratives that the form of the strip could accommodate. What follows are the landmarks, which can also help to date the era of a given strip.\n\n\nIn 1934, the live action film \"Babes in Toyland\" starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy the cat playing the fiddle (Peter Gordon) is repeatedly hit in the head with a brick by a mouse (a capuchin monkey) costumed to look similar to Disney's Mickey Mouse. \n\nIn 1999, \"Krazy Kat\" was rated #1 in a \"Comics Journal\" list of the best American comics of the 20th century; the list included both comic books and comic strips. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps.\n\nWhile Chuck Jones' Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner shorts, set in a similar visual pastiche of the American Southwest, are among the most famous cartoons to draw upon Herriman's work, \"Krazy Kat\" has continued to inspire artists and cartoonists to the present day. Patrick McDonnell, creator of the current strip \"Mutts\" and co-author of \"Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman\", cites it as his \"foremost influence.\" Bill Watterson of \"Calvin and Hobbes\" fame named \"Krazy Kat\" among his three major influences (along with \"Peanuts\" and \"Pogo\"). Watterson would revive Herriman's practice of employing varied, unpredictable panel layouts in his Sunday strips. Charles M. Schulz and Will Eisner both said that they were drawn towards cartooning partly because of the impact \"Krazy Kat\" made on them in their formative years. Bobby London's \"Dirty Duck\" was styled after \"Krazy Kat\".\n\nJules Feiffer, Philip Guston, and Hunt Emerson have all had \"Krazy Kat\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s imprint recognized in their work. Larry Gonick's comic strip \"Kokopelli & Company\" is set in \"Kokonino County\", an homage to Herriman's exotic locale. Chris Ware admires the strip, and his frequent publisher, Fantagraphics, is currently reissuing its entire run in volumes designed by Ware (which also include reproduction of Herriman miscellanea, some of it donated by Ware). In the 1980s, Sam Hurt's syndicated strip \"Eyebeam\" shows a clear Herriman influence, particularly in its continually morphing backgrounds. Among non-cartoonists, Jay Cantor's 1987 novel \"Krazy Kat\" uses Herriman's characters to analyze humanity's reaction to nuclear weapons, Russell Hoban's novel \"The Medusa Frequency\" (also 1987) uses a quote from the cartoon in an epigraph (\"ZIP... POW... LOVES ME\") while Michael Stipe of the rock band R.E.M. has a tattoo of Krazy and Ignatz. In one \"Garfield\" comic strip, where it shows the Garfield logo, you can see Ignatz throwing a brick at Garfield. Also, in the Garfield TV special \"\", Garfield plays a stunt double for Krazy Kat. In one 1989 \"Bloom County\" strip by Berke Breathed, Krazy and Ignatz can be seen watching Binkley, Oliver, and Opus float through a Herriman-esque landscape.\n\nFor many decades, only a small percentage of Herriman's strip was available in reprinted form. The first \"Krazy Kat\" collection, published by Henry Holt and Company in 1946, just two years after Herriman's death, gathered 200 selected strips. In Europe, the cartoons were first reprinted in 1965 by the Italian magazine \"Linus\", and appeared in the pages of the French monthly \"Charlie Mensuel\" starting in 1970. In 1969, Grosset & Dunlap produced a single hardcover collection of selected episodes and sequences spanning the entire length of the strip's run. The Netherlands' Real Free Press published five issues of \"Krazy Kat Komix\" in 1974â1976, containing a few hundred strips apiece; each of the issues' covers was designed by Joost Swarte. However, owing to the difficulty of tracking down high-quality copies of the original newspapers, no plans for a comprehensive collection of \"Krazy Kat\" strips surfaced until the 1980s.\n\nAll of the Sunday strips from 1916 to 1924 were reprinted by Eclipse Comics in cooperation with Turtle Island Press. The intent was to eventually reprint every Sunday \"Krazy Kat\", but this planned series was aborted when Eclipse ceased business in 1992. Beginning in 2002, Fantagraphics resumed reprinting Sunday \"Krazy Kat\"s where Eclipse left off; in 2008, their tenth release completed the run with 1944. Fantagraphics then reissued, in the same format, the strips previously printed in Eclipse's now out-of-print volumes. Both the Eclipse and Fantagraphics reprints include additional rarities such as older George Herriman cartoons predating \"Krazy Kat\".\n\nKitchen Sink Press, in association with Remco Worldservice Books, reprinted two volumes of color Sunday strips dating from 1935 to 1937; but like Eclipse, they collapsed before they could continue the series. Issue number five of \"The 3-D Zone\" comic book series, published by The 3-D Zone in June 1987, features reprints of \"Krazy Kat\" strips converted into 3-D, and also includes two pairs of red/blue 3-D glasses.\n\nThe daily strips for 1921 to 1923 were reprinted by Pacific Comics Club. The 1922 and 1923 books skipped a small number of strips, which have now been reprinted by \"Comics Revue\". \"Comics Revue\" has also published all of the daily strips from September 8, 1930 through December 31, 1934. Fantagraphics come out with a one-shot reprint of daily strips from 1910s and 1920s in 2007, and plans a more complete reprinting of the daily strip in the future.\n\nScattered Sundays and dailies have appeared in several collections, including the Grosset & Dunlap book reprinted by Nostalgia Press, but the most readily available sampling of Sundays and dailies from throughout the strip's run is \"Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman\", published by Harry N. Abrams, Inc. in 1986. It includes a detailed biography of Herriman and was, for a long time, the only in-print book to republish \"Krazy Kat\" strips from after 1940. Although it contains over 200 strips, including many color Sundays, it is light on material from 1923 to 1937. A small selection of dailies appears in a 2018 literary anthology published by The Green Bag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Krazy and Ignatz: The Komplete Kat Komics\" (series), Bill Blackbeard, ed. Each of these volumes reprints a year of Sunday strips.\n\n\"The Komplete Kolor Krazy Kat\" (series). Each volume reprinted two years of Sundays. (The publisher dissolved before the series' aim of completeness could be achieved.)\n\n\n\"All the Daily Strips...\" (series) 6Â¼ x 6Â¼ inch format.\n\"Presents Krazy and Ignatz\" (series) Four 3Â¼ x 4Â inch volumes reproducing the 1921 strips in miniature.\n\n(The following volumes, through 1944, are in color, reflecting the shift to color in the Sunday newspaper version.)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Contrary to what the name suggests, \"Monday\" was distributed throughout the greater Victoria area every Thursday until July 2013 when it became an arts calendar monthly. The publication features articles on art, food and entertainment in Victoria but is most widely used as an event listing. \n\n\"Monday\" was founded in 1975 by Gene Miller, a native New Yorker who arrived in Victoria in 1970, five years before founding Monday. Miller aspired to create a publication for the Victoria readership that was rooted in the social consciousness of the Village Voice but written in the style of The New Yorker.\n\nShortly after establishing the paper, Miller was joined by Andrew Lynch and George Heffelfinger and the three divided ownership equally. In 1988, Millerâdisheartened with his creationâsold his one-third interest to Lynch and Heffelfinger. Andrew Lynch continued in his role as publisher of \"Monday\" until it was taken over by David Black's Island Publishers Ltd. in 1996. It is currently published by Black Press Group Ltd.\n\nUntil May 1, 2013, \"Monday Magazine\" earned its reputation as a critical voice in Victoria's political, social and cultural communities. It is no longer a member of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies. The paper targets educated, active adults and currently reaches approximately 38,445 households.\n\n\"Monday\" routinely received awards for investigative features on the environment, social and political justice, arts, culture and the outdoors. In 2011 and 2012, its staff earned 20 newspaper awards through the BCYCNA, CCNA and AAN organizations. \"Monday Magazine\" historically tended to the left of the political spectrum and was often critical of centre and right wing politicians and policies at the city and provincial levels.\n\n\n"}

The museum owns over 300 mechanical machines, and is one of the largest privately owned collection of such games in the world.\n\nOwner Ed Zelinsky began collecting at age 11 and his games were exhibited in the 1920s at Playland. In 1972 Playland closed and MusÃ©e MÃ©canique became a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The museum moved into the basement of Cliff House, just a few blocks north and across the Great Highway from the Playland site. Zelinsky's son, Dan Zelinsky, took a temporary job in the 1970s maintaining the collection. The museum was featured in the 2001 film \"The Princess Diaries\" and in a 2011 episode of the Japanese television show GameCenter CX.\n\nIn 2002, when renovations to the Cliff House had begun, the National Park Service announced plans to relocate the MusÃ©e MÃ©canique temporarily to Fisherman's Wharf. A portion of the $14 million renovation was devoted to moving the museum, with support from the National Park Service, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and museum owner Ed Zelinsky. \n\nThe museum move instigated protests against the move by San Francisco locals. An online petition was created to protest the closure of the museum, with over 12,000 signatures being collected. Many of the protesters believed that the money was unavailable to fund the move and renovations, but many were emotional due to the historical and nostalgic meaning of the museum due to its history at Playland. Many of the protesters were also unaware of the museum's for-profit status, and many attempted to donate to the museum to keep it at its current location. Despite public frustration, museum manager Dan Zelinsky remained excited about the move, understanding the historical and emotional connections that San Francisco locals held for the museum: \"You have to understand that people grew up with these kind of machinesÂ ... To the generation before, these were the video games. Many visitors haven't been here since childhood, but when they walk through that door, they are going back in time.\" Original plans were slated to have the museum return to the Recreation Area in 2004, upon completion of construction, however the museum remains at Fisherman's Wharf. Despite the locals' love for the original location, National Public Radio described the original space at the Recreation Area as \"cramped, noisy, damp and a little dingy,\"\n\nThe MusÃ©e MÃ©canique is a for-profit museum and is owned by and managed by Dan Zelinsky. The machines require constant maintenance, with some having undergone major restorations. More than 100,000 visitors a year visit the MusÃ©e MÃ©canique. While the museum is free, visitors must pay for use of each game. In 2011 \"U.S. News & World Report\" called the MusÃ©e MÃ©canique one of the top three \"Things to Do in San Francisco\". \"SF Weekly\" called it the \"Best Old-School Arcade\" for 2011.\n\nThe MusÃ©e MÃ©canique has a collection of more than 300 mechanical games including: music boxes, coin-operated fortune tellers, Mutoscopes, video games, love testers, player pianos, peep shows, photo booths, dioramas, pinball machines and more. The museum displays about 200 of the machines at their current location.\n\nThe museum has many rare and historical pieces. A large diorama of a traveling carnival with a Ferris wheel and other rides sits in the center of the museum. The museum owns what is believed to be the only steam-powered motorcycle in the world, built in Sacramento, in 1912. The Royal Court diorama features couples ballroom dancing and was featured in the PanamaâPacific International Exposition. Laffing Sal, which has been described as \"famously creepy\", is a 6-foot-tall, laughing automaton. The museum also owns a collection of machines made out of toothpicks by prisoners at San Quentin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5663761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5663761", "title": "Nautanki", "text": "Nautanki\n\nNautanki is one of the most popular folk operatic theater performance forms of South Asia, particularly in northern India. Before the advent of Bollywood (the Hindi film industry), Nautanki was the biggest entertainment medium in the villages and towns of northern India. Nautanki's rich musical compositions and humorous, entertaining storylines hold a strong influence over rural people's imagination. Even after the spread of mass media (such as television and DVDs), a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 can be seen at the top Nautanki performances. Nautanki's origins lie in the Saangit, Bhagat, and Swang musical theatre traditions of Northern India. One Saangit called \"Saangit Rani Nautanki Ka\" became so popular that the whole genre's name became Nautanki.\n\nNautanki performances are operas based on a popular folk theme derived from romantic tales, mythologies, or biographies of local heroes. The performance is often punctuated with individual songs, dances, and skits, which serve as breaks and comic relief for audiences. Audiences sometimes use the breaks to go to the toilet or pick up food from their homes or nearby shops. Nautanki performances involve a lot of community participation from audiences. For instance, community members provide logistical support, financial support, and talented actors for Nautanki performances. Audience members choose what script will be performed and often intervene during the performance to demand a repeat of a particular song or skit.\n\nNautanki performances can take place in any open space available in or around a village that can accommodate audiences in hundreds or thousands. Sometimes this space is made available by the village chaupal (village community center). Other times, the playground of the local school becomes the performance site. A Nautanki stage is elevated above the ground and is made up of wooden cots (usually provided by local villagers). Until a few decades back, there was no electricity in Indian villages, so light was provided either by big lanterns or Petromax (a device run by kerosene oil).\n\nThe pleasure of Nautanki lies in the intense melodic exchanges between two or three performers; a chorus is used sometimes. \n\nTraditional Nautankis usually start late at night, often around 10 p.m. or so, and go all night until sunrise the next morning (for a total of 8â10 hours). There is no intermission in Nautanki performances. \n\nStory lines of traditional Nautankis range from mythological and folk tales to stories of contemporary heroes. For instance, while Nautanki plays such as \"Satya-Harishchandra\" and \"Bhakt Moradhwaj\" are based on mythological themes, \"Indal Haran\" and \"Puranmal\" originated from folklore. In the first half of the 20th century, contemporary sentiment against British rule and feudal landlords found expression in Nautankis such as \"Sultana Daku\", \"Jalianwala Bagh\", and \"Amar Singh Rathore\". In the last four decades, Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma (a renowned Nautanki maestro) and later Dr. Devendra Sharma have co-authored many new Nautankis. These new Nautankis are centered on contemporary social messages such as health, HIV/AIDS, women's empowerment, dowry, immigration, and family planning. They are of a much shorter duration â around two hours. This is to give audiences an opportunity to watch performances during a break in their daily routine. These contemporary Nautankis have been performed extensively in India and America and met with resounding popularity.\n\nSome popular traditional Nautankis are \"Syah-Posh (Pak Mohabbat)\", \"Sultana Daku\", \"Indal Haran\", \"Amar Singh Rathore\", \"Bhakt Puranmal\", and \"Harischandra-Taramati\". Some popular contemporary ones are \"Mission Suhani\", \"Subah ka Bhoola\", \"Behkaani and Muskaani\", and \"Beti ka Byah\" (all of these contemporary Nautankis are written by Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma).\n\nSome famous performers are Gokul Korea, Ghasso, Ram Swarup Sharma of Samai-Khera, Manohar Lal Sharma \nand Giriraj Prasad of Kaman District Bharatpur, Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma, Chunni Lal, Puran Lal Sharma, Amarnath, Gulab Bai, and Krishna Kumari.\n\nIn 2002, Nautanki was introduced in America by Dr. Devendra Sharma, a Nautanki artist, singer, writer, director, and scholar of communication and performance. The participants in Sharma's productions are engineers, doctors, and other members of the Indian diaspora living in America, who are given a rare opportunity to connect with their cultural roots. At the same time, these performances have exposed other communities in America to Indian culture. \n\nOne such Nautanki is \"Mission Suhani\", an original Nautanki co-authored by Sharma and Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma that communicates a contemporary and controversial social issue concerning Indians and Indian immigrants in America. It critically examines the phenomenon of some Indian men who come to America to study or work, but go back to India and get married â either because of parental pressure or to get a big dowry (cash given to the groom's family by the bride's side). Many of these men leave their wives in India and never bring them to America, where they often have another wife or a girlfriend. One of the unique aspects of this Nautanki is that it is bilingual (Hindi and English). This protects the traditional operatic and artistic elements of Nautanki while effectively communicating the story and contemporary social issue to a diverse audience. Nautankis such as \"Mission Suhani\" involving global social issues help to update Nautanki to emerging issues in India and around the world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27452839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27452839", "title": "Newsweek gay actor controversy", "text": "Newsweek gay actor controversy\n\nThe \"Newsweek\" gay actor controversy refers to the reaction to a piece written in 2010 by \"Newsweek\" magazine writer Ramin Setoodeh in which he asserts that openly gay actors are not capable of convincingly playing straight characters. Setoodeh's article provoked strong reactions from both within and outside the entertainment industry.\n\nIn a \"Newsweek\" article titled \"Straight Jacket\" dated April 26, 2010, journalist Ramin Setoodeh reviewed the Broadway revival of \"Promises, Promises\" starring Sean Hayes as the male lead. Hayes had recently come out as gay in an interview with the LGBT-interest \"The Advocate\" magazine. Setoodeh found Hayes's performance \"wooden and insincere, like he's trying to hide something, which of course he is\". Setoodeh also challenged the acting ability of openly gay actor Jonathan Groff, who had recently joined the cast of \"Glee\". While recognizing Groff as \"a knockout singer and a heartthrob\" for his Broadway performance in \"Spring Awakening\", Setoodeh found that Groff's television performance was \"off\" and distracting. From these two performances, along with how Setoodeh's perceptions of the performances of actors Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter, Van Johnson and Anthony Perkinsâcloseted or semi-closeted during their careers but now known to have been gayâchanged with his knowledge of the actors' homosexuality, Setoodeh concluded that once the public learns that an actor is gay, the actor can no longer convincingly play straight characters. Setoodeh acknowledged the ability of actors Neil Patrick Harris and Portia de Rossi to play straight characters on television (on \"How I Met Your Mother\" and \"Better Off Ted\" respectively) but dismissed them with the claim that they are playing caricatures, not characters.\n\nThe day after the \"Newsweek\" article appeared online, LGBT media website AfterElton.com denounced Setoodeh and his conclusions. Editor Michael Jensen noted previous articles by Setoodeh in which he claimed that effeminate characters on television were harmful to the gay movement and seemed to suggest that openly gay teenage murder victim Lawrence King was partially to blame for his own murder because of his effeminate self-expression. He pondered whether Setoodeh's opinion on openly gay actors was rooted in some issue of Setoodeh's own with effeminate men. Jensen questioned what Setoodeh, himself openly gay, hoped to accomplish with the article and asserted that by writing it, Setoodeh was only making it harder for gay actors to make the decision to come out.\n\nActress Kristin Chenoweth, Hayes's co-star in \"Promises, Promises\", rose to Hayes's defense. Posting to Newsweek.com, Chenoweth noted that Hayes was nominated for Drama League, Outer Critics Circle and Tony Awards and that \"thousands of people have traveled from all over the world to enjoy Hayesâ performance and donât seem to have one single issue with his sexuality\". She accused Setoodeh of engaging in selection bias through his choices of actors upon whom he focused the article and found the entire piece \"horrendously homophobic\". Following Chenoweth's response, \"Glee\" creator Ryan Murphy called for a boycott of \"Newsweek\", writing in an open letter, \"This article is as misguided as it is shocking and hurtful...I extend an open invitation to Mr. Setoodeh to come to the writers room of our show, and perhaps pay a set visit...Hopefully, some of the love we attempt to spread will rub off on Mr. Setoodeh â a gay man deeply in need of some education â and he not only apologizes to those he has deeply offended but pauses before he picks up his poison pen again to work through the issues of his own self loathing.\" In a second open letter, Murphy announced that Setoodeh had accepted his invitation and would meet with \"Glee\"'s writers and observe casting sessions. \"I hope observing this process firsthand â and talking with our cast â will be illuminating to Mr. Setoodeh, and inform his future journalistic endeavors.\"\n\nJarrett Barrios, president of the LGBT media watchdog organization Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) joined with openly gay Academy Award-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black to take Setoodeh to task, writing for \"The Hollywood Reporter\": \"The whole posse of off-kilter anecdotes in \"Straight Jacket\" seem only to confirm one thing: America is starting to embrace open gay and lesbian actors in heterosexual roles on stage and screen and Setoodeh himself is not yet ready to. In one example, Setoodeh goes out of his way to call Sean Hayes \"queeny\" and assert it as a disqualifier for his straight role in \"Promises, Promises.\" It's when the author peddles tired stereotypes like a \"queeny\" that the piece leans away from reality and tilts toward openly gay Setoodeh's own issues with sexuality and femininity. The truth is, the glass ceiling Setoodeh posits has been constructed by his own arguments -- ones that ignore fact after fact about the direction Hollywood is headed in 2010. Maybe Setoodeh can't see 'Glee' and 'Promises, Promises' except through a lens of dark stereotypes he's inherited. Maybe he's got some axe to grind. But whatever the reason, with the stakes so high for gay Americans at this moment, it is no excuse for his editors inflicting such hurtful â and baseless â musings on the readers of \"Newsweek\". We'd all have been better off leaving Setoodeh's tortured thoughts on his therapist's couch and leaving baseless stories like this one on the editor's desk.\" GLAAD further called upon \"Newsweek\" and Setoodeh to issue an apology.\n\nSeveral openly gay actors, including Cheyenne Jackson, Michael Urie, Jane Lynch and Cynthia Nixon strongly criticized Setoodeh's article.\n\nThree months after the article appeared, Groff spoke to British newspaper \"The Independent\" about it. Comparing the article to a bad review based on an actor's not using an appropriate accent for a role, Groff said \"You just have to take it like any good or bad review, and try to let it roll off your back. I've played all kinds of characters, with all kinds of sexuality, and I hope to go on doing that.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Ramin Setoodeh wrote a piece responding to the controversy. Titling it \"Out of Focus\", Setoodeh asserted that his intention \"was not to disparage my own community, but to examine an issue that is being swept under the rug\", the issue supposedly being that society as a whole has trouble accepting openly gay actors in straight roles, and that he wanted to start a debate on the subject. He characterized much of the criticism directed at him as \"attacks\" and said that his opponents were twisting his words. He denied assertions that he is self-loathing or homophobic. \n\nSetoodeh's response prompted AfterElton.com editor Jensen to accuse Setoodeh of \"play[ing] the victim card\" and failing to address any of the criticisms that were leveled at the article. \"If his goal was to start a 'debate,' and he says it was, it's telling how uninterested he seems to be in actually having that debate.\"\n\n\"Newsweek\" culture editor Marc Peyser sat down with Dustin Lance Black and Jarrett Barrios to discuss the fallout from Setoodeh's article and the broader issues of being openly gay in Hollywood. Barrios and Black continued to point out what they viewed as attacks on the ability and talent of gay actors and discussed whether an actor at the top of his or her profession could maintain a career after coming out.\n\nScreenwriter and producer Aaron Sorkin wrote a piece for \"The Huffington Post\" in which he asserted that people being critical of Setoodeh were missing the point. Assuring readers that Setoodeh is \"on the side of the good guys\", Sorkin wrote, \"The problem doesn't have anything to do with sexual preference. The problem has everything to do with the fact that we know too much about each other and we care too much about what we know. In one short decade we have been reconditioned to be entertained by the most private areas of other people's lives.\" Rather than directing ire at Setoodeh or boycotting \"Newsweek\", celebrities should \"[b]oycott the red carpet instead. You're going to win the Emmy, Ryan, and you're going to get the whole publicity bump that comes with it. You and your cast should proudly walk past every microphone that's shoved in your faces.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Andrew Wallenstein wrote that he could not understand what Setoodeh supposedly did wrong. Asserting that \"sexual orientation can distort a performance, and in more ways than one\", Wallenstein continues, \"there is always the possibility that even the most brilliant closeted actor in the most incredibly scripted heterosexual role could fall short, especially in a romantic lead role\". Gay actors, he wrote, should be considered for straight leading roles but they may not be successful in playing them, and it is possible that Setoodeh merely identified two who cannot. Regardless of whether that is true or not, people should not \"vilify those who dare to speak their mind even when being unkind\".\n"}

The stated goal of founder Susan P. Crawford is for OneWebDay to foster and make visible a global constituency that cares about the future of the Internet.\n\nThe first OneWebDay was held on September 22, 2006. The idea was created by Susan P. Crawford, who was an ICANN board member at the time, in association with other Internet figures such as Doc Searls, David Weinberger, David R. Johnson, Mary Hodder, and David Isenberg, who would all join the board of what would eventually become a 501(c)3 corporation â OneWebDay Inc. A website was established and a global network of events promoted. The 2006 OneWebDay's anchor celebration featured speakers Craig Newmark, Scott Heiferman, and Drew Schutte in New York City's Battery Park.\n\nBy 2008 OneWebDay had grown to more than 30 international events. In Washington Square Park, New York City, speakers included Crawford, John Perry Barlow, Jonathan Zittrain, Craig Newmark, and Lawrence Lessig.\n\nIn May 2009, after founder Crawford had joined the Obama administration, Mitch Kapor took over chairmanship of OneWebDay. It was also announced that funding had been granted by the Ford Foundation. A ning-based organizing network was set up.\n\nIn April 2010, it was announced that OneWebDay would \"retire its brand\" and be folded into a new Mozilla Foundation year-round initiative called Drumbeat.\n\nIn August 2010, a number of veterans took over organizing the 2010 event on a volunteer basis. A new website and network was established. Events took place in several cities including New York City, Melbourne, Kolkata, Chennai, London, and Pachuca.\n\nIn 2011, the main event was a presentation in New York City by Bob Frankston â \"Infrastructure commons â the future of connectivity\".\n\nIn 2012 the theme of OneWebDay was advancing local content.\n\nIn 2013 the theme was accessibility, particularly in remembrance of web-accessibility advocate Cynthia Waddell, who died in April 2013.\n\nIn 2014 the OneWebDay theme was \"Recognizing Core Internet Values\", and promoted the viewing of three videos: a TEDx talk by Dave Moskowitz, \"The Internet Belongs to Everyone\" from the United States State Department, and the Dynamic Coalition on Core Internet Values at the 2014 Internet Governance Forum.\n\nIn 2015 the theme is \"Connecting the Next Billion\", aligned with the current IGF Intersessional Program, and promotes the viewing of a speech by Catherine Novelli â 'Connecting The World' at the USA-IGF in July 2015.\n\nIn 2016 the theme was again \"Connecting the Next Billion\", this time highlighting a speech by United States Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Catherine A. Novelli.\n\nIn 2017 the theme was \"Open The Pipes\", about the need for connectivity for Community Networks, and highlights a speech by Internet Society CEO/President Kathy Brown at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai.\n\nIn 2018 the theme is, in co-ordination with the Global People's Summit, \"Reimagine Humanity: Changing the Status Quo\" and promotes participation in a global conversation about ways of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n"}

{"id": "9531550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9531550", "title": "Pig show", "text": "Pig show\n\nPig shows are an event where pigs are evaluated for their quality. They are evaluated on a multitude of things which include composition (muscle vs. fat), capaciousness, and skeletal integrity along with general appearance and conformation to their respective breed. Other names for a pig show include swine show and hog show. A pig show is frequently part of a larger agricultural show.\n\nPig shows began on farms where the owner and other pig farmers would gather to decide which pig had the best qualities for breeding. These would not be named pig shows, but ultimately they were making a decision on which animals to retain to breed. Eventually, breeders would meet at a specified location and bring an outside person to evaluate their pigs, and to order them in a ranking. These were the first shows. \n\nA show is typically divided up into classes so that the judge can study fewer pigs at a time. Typically these classes are broken down to the breed of pig, weight, or age. There are division or breed champions and reserve champions. Then ultimately, an over-all grand champion will be chosen.\nSwine judging is the process of selectively ordering swine or domestic pigs in order to determine the best pig. For market hogs, traits are ranked in order of their importance: Degree of muscling, growth, capacity or volume, degree of leanness, structure and soundness.\nFor breeding gilts, the traits by order of importance are: Structure and soundness, Growth, Underline quality, Capacity or volume, Degree of muscling, Degree of leanness.\n\nA judge will have different priorities and rank importance of certain traits differently than other judges. Judges are selected because they are typically influential breeders within the show pig industry. \n\nShow pig breeds in the United States\nIn China, the first pig show was the Guangdong Breeding Pigs Auction which began January 18, 1996. Most pig shows in china are pig-breeding auctions.

They were one of the best known rave names on the Rave scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe first event was held at a circus tent on 16 September 1989 at Jenkins Lane, Beckton in east London. This was Britain's first legal all night rave.\n\nDJ's such as Carl Cox, Dave Angel, LTJ Bukem, Mr C, DJ Rap, John Digweed, Kevin \"Reece\" Saunderson, Slipmatt, Fabio and Grooverider started out at Raindance. Live acts such as Shades of Rhythm, N-Joi and The Prodigy have all played at Raindance.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1993, Raindance went on to hold large-scale events across Essex, Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire, Somerset and even Spain. The venues Raindance used held up to 10,000 ravers. DJ Slipmatt's brother, Paul Nelson, was one of the original promoters. The original idea to hold a rave came from Slipmatt himself.\n\nBut by 1993 with pressure from the authorities (Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994) and the rave music scene splintering into different dance genres, Raindance took a break from holding mass events. Between 1993 and 1998 there were one-off events, then the promoters returned hosting regular indoor events in clubs around North and East London.\n\nIn 1999 Raindance started hosting raves at The Drome, an unused car park underneath London Bridge railway station. They would get regular attendances of over 2,000 people at this venue. In 2002, The Drome was renovated and seOne was born. Over the next 8 years SeOne would be Raindance's home and with a 3,000 capacity with 7 different arenas (Jenkins Lane 89-90, Old Skool 91-93, Jungle/Drum & Bass 93-10, Hardcore 95-10, Hard House, Breakbeat, House & Trance).

{"id": "59190687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59190687", "title": "SmartStudy", "text": "SmartStudy\n\n\"SmartStudy\"' (), is a South Korean educational entertainment company established in 2010, a subsidiary of Samsung Publishing Co Ltd. It develops mobile applications for children and owns intellectual property rights for its popular animated characters, including Pinkfong and Baby Shark, whose mobile app was reported in November, 2018 to have been downloaded by 150 million people in 112 countries. In 2016, the company released their first game, \"Monster Super League\".\n\nSmartStudy was founded in June, 2010, by three former game developers, CEO Kim Min-seok, CFO Lee Ryan Seung-kyu and VP Park Hyun-woo.\n\nKim, who was around thirty-years-old at the time, was a publisher and the oldest son at his family's business, Samsung Publishing Company Ltd., SmartSudy's parent company, with his father, CEO Kim Jin-yong, and his grandfather, the company's founder, Kim Bong-kyu. The company, established on July 3, 2002, has no relation to the Samsung Group, and mainly published books for children and magazines for computer users, with another division operating food courts in highway service areas and a subsidiary operation that marketed stationery products. Kim joined the company, in preparation as successor, in 2008, and, while there, he helped launch a self-directed program \"Samsung English\", and worked on content digitization and app development. He studied to be an information specialist at Yonsei University and worked at the game company Nexon while in college. After graduation, he was a developer and project manager at Hangame and also, worked at NHN.\n\nWith Samsung Publishing as it's first investor, the media startup company SmartStudy was formed by Kim, his close friend Park, who also worked at NHN, and Lee, who he met at Nexon. Lee had begun his career as an online community developer at Freechal.\n\nWhile brainstorming ideas for the company, the thought of making video games was quickly dropped, because, as Lee said, âAt that point, we were all tired of making games\". The final choices were education and medicine, but as they had no expertise in medicine, they focused on education. With more ideas from Samsung Publishing, they decided to focus on the children's education market by making and uploading four music videos for Samsung Publishing's children's songs on their apps. The international response was good. âIt was then that we realized that instead of making what we want, we should create content based on what the market wants,â Lee said.\n\nDiscussing what market they would focus on, Kim said reaching out to global customers was more viable, as potential customers were limited in South Korea, where the birthrate per year was around 400,000. They further planned to target pre-kindergarten or 2-year-old to kindergarten, looking to open offices in China and the U.S. to make local content geared for each of those markets. According to Lee, the U.S. users favored \"interactive, actionable content such as writing letters on the tablet or taking pictures with the character\", while Asian users preferred \"one-way streaming video content\". Based on results in South Korea and China, they focused on creating content in English and Spanish for the U.S. market, and started producing videos with its characters in several languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish and Russian; and operating its own mobile app providing content directly to viewers. Many of the creators at the company were from children's book publishing and many of the apps were based on chant melodies to attract children's attention.\n\nThey also added mobile VOD, comics, and finally, games. As the company grew, they continued their debate on games and entertainment versus education. \"Education combined with entertainment, edutainment, is hard to achieve. If itâs too much focused on games, it has less educational value, and if itâs too much focused on education, it will need sugar-coating with game features\", Lee said. Consequently, they returned to their forte in September, 2016, when they released a mobile game called âMonster Super Leagueâ. Kim said he understood the importance of child education, but thought about the expertise of team members who were prior game developers at Nexon or NCSoft, and who were also fathers.\n\nThey realized their market with international growth through Google and Apple app stores and expanded to IPTV in late 2013. They felt their willingness to understand subtle cultural differences instead of just enhancing language aspects benefited them. An example they provided was utilizing country differences in the sounds a police car siren makes, to localize their products for children. In particular, for Chinese marketing, they created new work using old Chinese fables and texts that Chinese children would know from kindergarten, and uploading on native platforms like Youku, iQiyi and Tencent Video in China, where YouTube is banned.\n\nJournalist Kwon Oh-seong of The Hankyoreh visited the company for interviews in April, 2015 and described a unique organizational culture that emphasized autonomous work. His visit coincided with a customary monthly birthday rooftop celebration, presently the one for 34-year-old CEO Kim. The employees, with an average age of thirty, called each other by nicknames like \"Radio\", and \"Patriarch\" for Kim, and detailed a flexible work atmosphere, with periods of self-imposed hard work, along with chimaek breaks and unlimited vacation rewards. Kim said the structure is based on the teachings of his father, who allowed him freedom to grow and create on his own.\n\nBy 2017, the company had branches in Los Angeles and Shanghai. In 2017, CEO Bin Jeong, of Pinkfong's U.S. branch, which opened in 2016 with a couple of employees, said SmartStudy had about 150 employees, and writing about women in STEM jobs, she said about 60 percent were women.\n\nIn August 2015, their big breakthrough occurred on YouTube with their popular character and brand Pinkfong, a magenta-colored animated fox, which was used in a \"Baby Shark\" song and dance video. It was launched in late 2015, and started going viral on YouTube in 2016, becoming the company's most popular series with 800 million views by September 2018. By 2018, the company reported 150 million people in 112 countries had downloaded its app.\n\nBy 2014, the parent company, Samsung Publishing, was seeing an increased net profit from its new subsidiary SmartStudy, and in 2017, Samsung Publishing sales were approximately $160 million. In 2015, SmartStudy's sales were 9.5 billion won (about US$8.5 million). In 2016, SmartStudy's sales increased 80 percent, due to revenue from YouTube and apps sales, to 17.5 billion won (about US$15.5 million), with overseas sales accounting for 65 percent. In 2017, SmartStudy sales were 27.2 billion won (about US$24,127,000) with an operating profit of 1.9 billion won (about US$1,685,000).\n\nIn September 2018, Samsung Publishing's stocks \"soared\" by more than 76 percent after Pinkfong's \"Baby Shark\" song charted on the UK Top 40 at number 37. In November 2018, industry sources were predicting that SmartStudy was preparing to go public in 2020, with CEO Kim the biggest shareholder with 23.1 percent stake and Samsung Publishing which owns 20.8 percent.\n\n"}
{"id": "61141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61141", "title": "Song of the South", "text": "Song of the South\n\nSong of the South is a 1946 American live-action/animated musical film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures. It is based on the collection of Uncle Remus stories as adapted by Joel Chandler Harris, and stars James Baskett as Uncle Remus. The film takes place in the southern United States during the Reconstruction Era, a period of American history shortly after the end of the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. The story follows 7-year-old Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) who is visiting his grandmother's plantation for an extended stay. Johnny befriends Uncle Remus, one of the workers on the plantation, and takes joy in hearing his tales about the adventures of Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear. Johnny learns from the stories how to cope with the challenges he is experiencing living on the plantation.\n\nWalt Disney had wanted to produce a film based on the Uncle Remus stories for some time. It was not until 1939 that he began negotiating with the Harris family for film rights, and later in 1944, filming for \"Song of the South\" finally began. The studio constructed a plantation set for the outdoor scenes in Phoenix, Arizona, and some other scenes were filmed in Hollywood. The film is mostly live action, but includes three animated segments, which were later released as stand-alone television features. Some scenes also feature a combination of live action with animation. \"Song of the South\" premiered in Atlanta in November 1946 and the remainder of its initial theater run was a financial success. The song \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Original Song and Baskett received an Honorary Academy Award for his performance as Uncle Remus.\n\nSince its release, \"Song of the South\" has remained a subject of controversy. Some critics have described the film's portrayal of African Americans as racist and offensive, pointing out the black vernacular and other qualities as stereotypes. In addition, the plantation setting is sometimes criticized as idyllic and glorified. Because of this controversy, Disney has yet to release \"Song of the South\" on any home video format in the United States. Some of the musical and animated sequences have been released through other means, and the full film has seen home video distribution in other countries around the world. The cartoon characters from the film have continued to remain popular for decades, being featured in a variety of books, comics, and other media. The Disney theme park ride Splash Mountain is also based on the film.\n\nThe film is set on a plantation in the southern United States, specifically in the state of Georgia, some distance from Atlanta. Although sometimes misinterpreted as taking place before the American Civil War while slavery was still legal in the region, the film takes place during the Reconstruction Era after slavery was abolished. Harris' original Uncle Remus stories were all set after the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Harris himself, born in 1848, was a racial reconciliation activist writer and journalist of the Reconstruction Era. The film makes several indirect references to the Reconstruction Era: clothing is in the newer late-Victorian style; Uncle Remus is free to leave the plantation at will; black field hands are sharecroppers, etc.\n\nSeven-year-old Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother's Georgia plantation with his parents, John Sr. (Erik Rolf) and Sally (Ruth Warrick). When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart for a while, and he is to live at the plantation with his mother and grandmother (Lucile Watson) while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship in the city's newspaper. Johnny, distraught because of his father's departure, secretly sets off that night for Atlanta with only a bindle.\n\nAs Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he is attracted by the voice of Uncle Remus (James Baskett) telling tales of a character named Br'er Rabbit. By this time, word had gotten out that Johnny was missing, and some plantation residents are looking for him. Johnny evades being discovered, but Uncle Remus catches up with him. They befriend each other and Uncle Remus offers him some food for his journey, taking him back to his cabin. Back at the cabin, Uncle Remus tells Johnny the traditional African-American folktale, \"Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute\". In the story, Br'er Rabbit (Johnny Lee) attempts to run away from home only to change his mind after an encounter with Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear (James Baskett and Nick Stewart). Johnny takes the advice and changes his mind about leaving the plantation, letting Uncle Remus take him back to his mother.\n\nJohnny makes friends with Toby (Glenn Leedy), a young black boy who lives on the plantation, and Ginny Favers (Luana Patten), a poor white girl. Ginny gives Johnny a puppy after her two older brothers, Joe (Gene Holland) and Jake (George Nokes), threaten to drown it. Johnny's mother refuses to let him take care of the puppy, so he takes the dog to Uncle Remus. Uncle Remus takes the dog in and delights Johnny and his friends with the fable of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar-Baby, stressing that people shouldn't get involved with something they have no business with in the first place. Johnny heeds the advice of how Br'er Rabbit used reverse psychology on Br'er Fox and begs the Favers Brothers not to tell their mother (Mary Field) about the dog. The reverse psychology works, and the boys go to speak with their mother. After being spanked, they realize that Johnny had fooled them. In an act of revenge, they tell Sally about the dog. She becomes upset that Johnny and Uncle Remus kept the dog despite her order (which was unknown to Uncle Remus). She instructs Uncle Remus not to tell any more stories to her son.\n\nJohnny's birthday arrives and Johnny picks up Ginny to take her to his party. On the way there, Joe and Jake push Ginny into a mud puddle. With her dress ruined, Ginny is unable to go to the party and runs off crying. Johnny begins fighting with the boys, but their fight is broken up by Uncle Remus. Johnny runs off to comfort Ginny. He explains that he does not want to go either, especially since his father will not be there. Uncle Remus discovers both dejected children and cheers them up by telling the story of Br'er Rabbit and his \"Laughing Place\". When the three return to the plantation, Sally becomes angry at Johnny for missing his own birthday party, and tells Uncle Remus not to spend any more time with him. Saddened by the misunderstanding of his good intentions, Uncle Remus packs his bags and leaves for Atlanta. Johnny rushes to intercept him, but is attacked by a bull and seriously injured after taking a shortcut through a pasture. While Johnny hovers between life and death, his father returns. Johnny calls for Uncle Remus, who is then escorted in by his grandmother. Uncle Remus begins telling a tale of Br'er Rabbit and the Laughing Place, and the boy miraculously survives.\n\nJohnny, Ginny, and Toby are next seen skipping along and singing while Johnny's returned puppy runs alongside them. Uncle Remus is also in the vicinity and he is shocked when Br'er Rabbit and several of the other characters from his stories appear in front of them and interact with the children. Uncle Remus rushes to join the group, and they all skip away singing.\n\nWalt Disney had long wanted to produce a film based on the Uncle Remus storybook, but it was not until the mid-1940s that he had found a way to give the stories an adequate film equivalent in scope and fidelity. \"I always felt that Uncle Remus should be played by a living person\", Disney commented, \"as should also the young boy to whom Harris' old Negro philosopher relates his vivid stories of the Briar Patch. Several tests in previous pictures, especially in \"The Three Caballeros\", were encouraging in the way living action and animation could be dovetailed. Finally, months ago, we 'took our foot in hand,' in the words of Uncle Remus, and jumped into our most venturesome but also more pleasurable undertaking.\"\n\nDisney first began to negotiate with Harris' family for the rights in 1939, and by late summer of that year he already had one of his storyboard artists summarize the more promising tales and draw up four boards' worth of story sketches. In November 1940, Disney visited the Harris' home in Atlanta. He told \"Variety\" that he wanted to \"get an authentic feeling of Uncle Remus country so we can do as faithful a job as possible to these stories.\" Roy Oliver Disney had misgivings about the project, doubting that it was \"big enough in caliber and natural draft\" to warrant a budget over $1 million and more than twenty-five minutes of animation, but in June 1944, Disney hired Southern-born writer Dalton Reymond to write the screenplay, and he met frequently with King Vidor, whom he was trying to interest in directing the live-action sequences.\n\nDalton Reymond wrote a treatment for the film. Because Reymond was not a professional screenwriter, Maurice Rapf, who had been writing live-action features at the time, was asked by Walt Disney Productions to work with Reymond and co-writer Callum Webb to turn the treatment into a shootable screenplay. According to Neal Gabler, one of the reasons Disney had hired Rapf to work with Reymond was to temper what Disney feared would be Reymond's \"white Southern slant\".\n\nRapf was a minority, a Jew, and an outspoken left-winger, and he himself feared that the film would inevitably be Uncle Tomish. \"That's exactly why I want you to work on it,\" Walt told him, \"because I know that you don't think I should make the movie. You're against Uncle Tomism, and you're a radical.\"\n\nRapf initially hesitated, but when he found out that most of the film would be live-action and that he could make extensive changes, he accepted the offer. Rapf worked on \"Uncle Remus\" for about seven weeks. When he got into a personal dispute with Reymond, Rapf was taken off the project. According to Rapf, Walt Disney \"ended every conference by saying 'Well, I think we've really licked it now.' Then he'd call you the next morning and say, 'I've got a new idea.' And he'd have one. Sometimes the ideas were good, sometimes they were terrible, but you could never really satisfy him.\" Morton Grant was assigned to the project. Disney sent out the script for comment both within the studio and outside the studio.\n\n\"Song of the South\" was the first live-action dramatic film made by Disney. James Baskett was cast as Uncle Remus after responding to an ad for providing the voice of a talking butterfly. \"I thought that, maybe, they'd try me out to furnish the voice for one of Uncle Remus' animals,\" Baskett is quoted as saying. Upon review of his voice, Disney wanted to meet Baskett personally, and had him tested for the role of Uncle Remus. Not only did Baskett get the part of the butterfly's voice, but also the voice of Br'er Fox and the live-action role of Uncle Remus as well. Additionally, Baskett filled in as the voice of Br'er Rabbit for Johnny Lee in the \"Laughing Place\" scene after Lee was called away to do promotion for the picture. Disney liked Baskett, and told his sister Ruth that Baskett was \"the best actor, I believe, to be discovered in years\". Even after the film's release, Disney maintained contact with Baskett. Disney also campaigned for Baskett to be given an Academy Award for his performance, saying that he had worked \"almost wholly without direction\" and had devised the characterization of Remus himself. Thanks to Disney's efforts, Baskett won an honorary Oscar in 1948. After Baskett's death, his widow wrote Disney and told him that he had been a \"friend indeed and [we] certainly have been in need\".\n\nAlso cast in the production were child actors Bobby Driscoll, Luana Patten, and Glenn Leedy (his only screen appearance). Driscoll was the first actor to be under a personal contract with the Disney studio. Patten had been a professional model since age 3, and caught the attention of Disney when she appeared on the cover of \"Woman's Home Companion\" magazine. Leedy was discovered on the playground of the Booker T. Washington school in Phoenix, Arizona, by a talent scout from the Disney studio. Ruth Warrick and Erik Rolf, cast as Johnny's mother and father, had actually been married during filming, but divorced in 1946. Hattie McDaniel also appeared in the role of Aunt Tempy.\n\nProduction started under the title \"Uncle Remus\". The budget was originally $1,350,000. The animated segments of the film were directed by Wilfred Jackson, while the live-action segments were directed by Harve Foster. Filming began in December 1944 in Phoenix, where the studio had constructed a plantation and cotton fields for outdoor scenes, and Disney left for the location to oversee what he called \"atmospheric shots\". Back in Hollywood, the live action scenes were filmed at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio.\n\nOn the final day of shooting, Jackson discovered that the scene in which Uncle Remus sings the film's signature song, \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", had not been properly blocked. According to Jackson, \"We all sat there in a circle with the dollars running out, and nobody came up with anything. Then Walt suggested that they shoot Baskett in close-up, cover the lights with cardboard save for a sliver of blue sky behind his head, and then remove the cardboard from the lights when he began singing so that he would seem to be entering a bright new world of animation. Like Walt's idea for Bambi on ice, it made for one of the most memorable scenes in the film.\"\n\nThere are three animated segments in the film (in all, they last a total of 25 minutes). The last few minutes of the film also contain combine animation with live-action. The three sequences were later shown as stand-alone cartoon features on television.\n\nNine songs are heard in the film, with four reprises. Nearly all of the vocal performances are by the largely African-American cast, and the renowned all-black Hall Johnson Choir sing four pieces: two versions of a blues number (\"Let the Rain Pour Down\"), one chain-reaction-style folk song (\"That's What Uncle Remus Said\") and one spiritual (\"All I Want\").\n\nThe songs are, in film order, as follows:\n\n\n\"Let the Rain Pour Down\" is set to the melody of \"Midnight Special\", a traditional blues song popularized by Lead Belly (Huddie William Ledbetter). The song title \"Look at the Sun\" appeared in some early press books, though it is not actually in the film. The song \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" was influenced by the chorus of the pre-Civil War folk song \"Zip Coon\", that is considered racist as it plays on an African American stereotype.\n\nThe film premiered on November 12, 1946, at the Fox Theater in Atlanta. Walt Disney made introductory remarks, introduced the cast, then quietly left for his room at the Georgian Terrace Hotel across the street; he had previously stated that unexpected audience reactions upset him and he was better off not seeing the film with an audience. James Baskett was unable to attend the film's premiere because he would not have been allowed to participate in any of the festivities, as Atlanta was then a racially segregated city. The film grossed $3.3 million at the box office.\n\nAs had been done earlier with \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", Disney produced a Sunday comic strip titled \"Uncle Remus & His Tales of Br'er Rabbit\" to give the film pre-release publicity. The strip was launched by King Features on October 14, 1945, more than a year before the film was released. Unlike the \"Snow White\" comic strip, which only adapted the film, \"Uncle Remus\" ran for decades, telling one story after another about the characters, some based on the legends and others new, until it ended on December 31, 1972. Apart from the newspaper strips, Disney \"Br'er Rabbit\" comics were also produced for comic books; the first such stories appeared in late 1946. Produced both by Western Publishing and European publishers such as Egmont, they continue to appear.\n\nIn 1946, a Giant Golden Book entitled \"Walt Disney's Uncle Remus Stories\" was published by Simon & Schuster. It featured 23 illustrated stories of Br'er Rabbit's escapades, all told in a Southern dialect based on the original Joel Chandler Harris stories.\n\n\"Song of the South\" was re-released in theaters several times after its original premiere, each time through Buena Vista Pictures: in 1956 for the 10th anniversary; in 1972 for the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney Productions; in 1973 as the second half of a double bill with \"The Aristocats\"; in 1980 for the 100th anniversary of Harris' classic stories; and in 1986 for the film's own 40th anniversary and in promotion of the upcoming Splash Mountain attraction at Disneyland. The film has been broadcast on European television, including the BBC as recently as 2006.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has yet to release a complete version of the film in the United States on home video given the film's controversial reputation. Over the years, Disney has made a variety of statements about whether and when the film would be re-released. In March 2010, Disney CEO Robert Iger stated that there were no plans to release the movie on DVD, calling the film \"antiquated\" and \"fairly offensive\". On November 15, 2010, Disney creative director Dave Bossert stated in an interview, \"I can say there's been a lot of internal discussion about \"Song of the South\". And at some point we're going to do something about it. I don't know when, but we will. We know we want people to see \"Song of the South\" because we realize it's a big piece of company history, and we want to do it the right way.\" Film critic Roger Ebert, who normally disdained any attempt to keep films from any audience, supported the non-release position, claiming that most Disney films become a part of the consciousness of American children, who take films more literally than do adults. However, he favored allowing film students to have access to the film.\n\nDespite not having a home video release in the United States, audio from the filmâboth the musical soundtrack and dialogueâwere made widely available to the public from the time of the film's debut up through the late 1970s. In particular, many book-and-record sets were released, alternately featuring the animated portions of the film or summaries of the film as a whole. The Walt Disney Company has also allowed key portions of the film to be issued on many VHS and DVD compilations in the U.S., as well as on the long-running Walt Disney anthology television series. Most recently, \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" and some of the animated portions of the film were issued on the \"Alice in Wonderland\" 2-DVD Special Edition set. These segments are part of a 1950 Walt Disney TV special included on the DVD which promoted the then-forthcoming \"Alice in Wonderland\" film.\n\nThe full-length film has been released in various European, Latin American, and Asian countries. In the UK, it was released on PAL VHS tape in 1982 and again in 1991. In Japan it appeared on NTSC VHS, Beta, and LaserDisc in 1985 then again on LaserDisc in 1990 with subtitles during songs (additionally, under Japanese copyright law, the film is now in the public domain). A NTSC LaserDisc was released in Hong Kong for the Chinese rental market by Intercontinental Video Ltd, which has been the exclusive distributor of Walt Disney Studios since 1988. This release appears to have been created from a PAL videotape, and has a 4% faster running time because of its PAL source. While most foreign releases of the film are literal translations of the English title, the German title, \"Onkel Remus' Wunderland\", translates to \"Uncle Remus' Wonderland\", the Italian title, \"I Racconti Dello Zio Tom,\" translates to \"The Stories of Uncle Tom\", and the Norwegian title \"Onkel Remus forteller\" translates to \"Storyteller Uncle Remus.\"\n\nIn July 2017 after being inaugurated as a Disney Legend, Whoopi Goldberg expressed a desire for \"Song of the South\" to be re-released publicly to American audiences.\n\nAlthough the film was a financial success, netting the studio a profit of $226,000 ($2,833,970 in 2017 dollars) some critics were less enthusiastic about the film, not so much the animated portions as the live-action portions. Bosley Crowther for one wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"More and more, Walt Disney's craftsmen have been loading their feature films with so-called 'live action' in place of their animated whimsies of the past, and by just those proportions has the magic of these Disney films decreased\", citing the ratio of live action to animation at two to one, concluding that is \"approximately the ratio of its mediocrity to its charm\". However, the film also received positive notice. \"Time\" magazine called the film \"topnotch Disney\". In 2003, the Online Film Critics Society ranked the film as the 67th greatest animated film of all time. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 55% approval rating, based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.\n\nThe score by Daniele Amfitheatrof, Paul J. Smith, and Charles Wolcott was nominated in the \"Scoring of a Musical Picture\" category, and \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", written by Allie Wrubel and Ray Gilbert, won the award for Best Song at the 20th Academy Awards on March 20, 1948. A special Academy Award was given to Baskett \"for his able and heart-warming characterization of Uncle Remus, friend and story teller to the children of the world in Walt Disney's \"Song of the South\"\". Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten in their portrayals of the children characters Johnny and Ginny were also discussed for Academy Juvenile Awards, but in 1947 it was decided not to present such awards at all.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThe film has received significant controversy for its handling of race. Cultural historian Jason Sperb describes the film as \"one of Hollywood's most resiliently offensive racist texts\". Sperb, Neal Gabler, and other critics have noted the film's release as being in the wake of the Double V campaign, a propaganda campaign in the United States during World War II to promote victory over racism in the United States and its armed forces, and victory over fascism abroad. Early in the film's production, there was concern that the material would encounter controversy. Disney publicist Vern Caldwell wrote to producer Perce Pearce that \"the negro situation is a dangerous one. Between the negro haters and the negro lovers there are many chances to run afoul of situations that could run the gamut all the way from the nasty to the controversial.\"\n\nThe Disney Company has stated that, like Harris' book, the film takes place after the American Civil War and that all the African American characters in the movie are no longer slaves. The Hays Office had asked Disney to \"be certain that the frontispiece of the book mentioned establishes the date in the 1870s\"; however, the final film carried no such statement.\n\nWhen the film was first released, Walter Francis White, the executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), telegraphed major newspapers around the country with the following statement, erroneously claiming that the film depicted an antebellum setting:\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recognizes in \"Song of the South\" remarkable artistic merit in the music and in the combination of living actors and the cartoon technique. It regrets, however, that in an effort neither to offend audiences in the north or south, the production helps to perpetuate a dangerously glorified picture of slavery. Making use of the beautiful Uncle Remus folklore, \"Song of the South\" unfortunately gives the impression of an idyllic master-slave relationship which is a distortion of the facts.\n\nWhite however had not yet seen the film; his statement was based on memos he received from two NAACP staff members â Norma Jensen and Hope Spingarn â who attended a press screening on November 20, 1946. Jensen had written that the film was \"so artistically beautiful that it is difficult to be provoked over the clichÃ©s\" but that it contained \"all the clichÃ©s in the book\", mentioning that she felt scenes like blacks singing traditional black songs were offensive as a stereotype. Spingarn listed several things she found objectionable from the film, including the use of African-American English. Jim Hill Media stated that both Jensen and Spingarn were confused by the film's Reconstruction setting, writing that \"It was something that also confused other reviewers who from the tone of the film and the type of similar recent Hollywood movies [\"Gone with the Wind\"; \"Jezebel\"] assumed it must also be set during the time of slavery.\" Based on the Jensen and Spingarn memos, White released the \"official position\" of the NAACP in a telegram that was widely quoted in newspapers. \"The New York Times\"' Bosley Crowther made a similar assumption, writing that the movie was a \"travesty on the \"antebellum\" South.\"\n\n\"Time\" magazine, although it praised the film, cautioned that it was \"bound to land its maker in hot water\", because the character of Uncle Remus was \"bound to enrage all educated Negroes and a number of damyankees\". Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., a congressman from Harlem, branded the film an \"insult to American minorities [and] everything that America as a whole stands for.\" The National Negro Congress set up picket lines in theaters in the big cities where the film played, with its protesters holding signs that read \"\"Song of the South\" is an insult to the Negro people\" and, lampooning \"Jingle Bells\", chanted: \"Disney tells, Disney tells/lies about the South.\" On April 2, 1947, a group of protesters marched around Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California) with picket signs reading, \"We want films on Democracy not Slavery\" and \"Don't prejudice children's minds with films like this\". Jewish newspaper \"B'nai B'rith Messenger\" of Los Angeles considered the film to be \"tall[ying] with the reputation that Disney is making for himself as an arch-reactionary\".\n\nSome black press had mixed reactions on what they thought of \"Song of the South\". While Richard B. Dier in \"The Afro-American\" was \"thoroughly disgusted\" by the film for being \"as vicious a piece of propaganda for white supremacy as Hollywood ever produced,\" Herman Hill in \"The Pittsburgh Courier\" felt that \"Song of the South\" would \"prove of inestimable goodwill in the furthering of interracial relations\", and considered criticisms of the film to be \"unadulterated hogwash symptomatic of the unfortunate racial neurosis that seems to be gripping so many of our humorless brethren these days.\"\n\nDespite the lack of any public release in the US since 1986, \"Song of the South\" has made its way around in the form of bootleg copies found around numerous internet message boards. The film has grown an online following that has kept the film's presence alive, despite the general audience's views on the film, according to Jason Sperb.\n\nAs early as October 1945, a newspaper strip named \"Walt Disney Presents \"Uncle Remus\" and His Tales of Br'er Rabbit\" appeared in the United States, and this production continued until 1972. There have also been episodes for the series produced for the Disney comic books worldwide, in the U.S., Denmark and the Netherlands, from the 1940s up to the present day, 2012. Br'er Bear and Br'er Fox also appeared frequently in Disney's Big Bad Wolf stories, although here, Br'er Bear was usually cast as an honest farmer and family man, instead of the bad guy in his original appearances.\n\nBr'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear appeared as guests in \"Disney's House of Mouse\". They also appeared in \"\". Br'er Bear and the Tar-Baby also appear in the film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". Br'er Bear can be seen near the end while the Toons are celebrating finding the will. The Tar-Baby can briefly be seen during the scene driving into Toon Town.\n\nBr'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear also appeared in the 2011 video game \"Kinect Disneyland Adventures\" for the Xbox 360. The game is a virtual recreation of Disneyland and it features a mini game based on the Splash Mountain attraction. Br'er Rabbit helps guide the player character through that game, while Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear serve as antagonists. The three Br'ers also appear as meet-and-greet characters in the game, outside Splash Mountain in Critter Country. In the game, Jess Harnell reprises his role from the attraction as Br'er Rabbit and also takes on the role of Br'er Fox, while Br'er Bear is voiced by James Avery, who previously voiced Br'er Bear and Br'er Frog in the Walt Disney World version of Splash Mountain. This is the Br'ers' first major appearance in Disney media since \"The Lion King 1Â½\" in 2004 and their first appearance as computer-generated characters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11508087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11508087", "title": "Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961", "text": "Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961\n\nThe Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 affects Title 15 of the United States Code, Chapter 32 \"Telecasting of Professional Sports Contest\" (Â§Â§ 1291-1295) \n\nThe Sports Broadcasting Act was passed in response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated antitrust laws. The court ruled that the \"pooling\" of rights by all the teams to conclude an exclusive contract between the league and CBS was illegal.\n\nThe Act overrules that decision, and permits certain joint broadcasting agreements among the major professional sports. It recognizes the fact that the various franchises in a sports league, while competitors in the sporting sense, are not as much business competitors as they are interdependent partners, whose success as enterprises is intertwined, as a certain level of competitive balance between them must exist for any of them to remain viable enterprises. Therefore, it permits the sale of a television \"package\" to a network or networks in which the league members share equally, a procedure which is common today. Of the five major North American professional team sports, the Act is most pertinent to the NFL, as all of its regular-season and playoff games are covered by the rights assigned by its various packages with the networks, including its own. \n\nThe law has been interpreted to include the so-called \"blackout rules\" which protect a home team from competing games broadcast into its home territory on a day when it is playing a game at home, and from having to broadcast games within its home market area that have not sold out. It also, in effect, protects high school football and college football game attendance by blacking out pro football games locally on Friday evenings and Saturdays during those sports' regular seasons; these measures effectively outlawed the broadcasting (and, in practice, the playing) of NFL games on those days, since virtually all of the country is within 75 miles (120 km) of at least one high school game on every Friday night in September and October. \n\nThis portion of the act has since been partially circumvented; the NFL extended its season in 1978 to allow a few weeks of Friday night or Saturday games if the league so wished. Late-season Saturday games have been common since then, but Friday night games are still extremely rare; the league has played only eight Friday games since 1978, mostly because of the NFL's restrictions during Christmas. (In 2005, a Miami Dolphins-Kansas City Chiefs matchup, scheduled for Sunday, October 23 in Miami, was moved up to 7pm Friday night due to Hurricane Wilma. The game was televised only in the South Florida and Kansas City TV markets, and was not seen nationally.)\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s broadcast packages are not subject to the antitrust exemption and it suffered for it, when the Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA's restrictive television policies were a violation of antitrust law in the 1980s when the University of Georgia and the University of Oklahoma sued the NCAA over television restrictions (limit of six television appearances over two years) established in 1952. However, after their court victory, neither Georgia nor Oklahoma made serious efforts to market their own television packages, but instead followed the lead of their conferences, the Southeastern Conference and the Big 8 Conference respectively.\n\nThe College Football Association, an alliance of 64 schools from some of the major conferences and selected independents, sold their own television package in 1984, first to ABC, and later to CBS. The Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences, not CFA affiliates, sold their own separate package, to ABC.\n\nBy 1990, the landscape changed. ABC had both the CFA, Big Ten, and Pac-10 packages, and NBC the Notre Dame home package. It was once again relegated to limited appearances.\n\nThe CFA collapsed, and in 1995, the Southeastern Conference signed a national deal with CBS. They are the only major conference guaranteed a national \"game of the week\" because ESPN's games may come from any of the conferences they offer.\n\nIn November 2006, former Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, (R-PA) proposed legislation to repeal the NFL's antitrust exemption under the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961.\n\nSpecter's concern was based on the National Football League's NFL Network, which is available in a limited number of homes, as compared to the other broadcasters of the NFL. For the 2006-07 NFL season, each NFL team annually earned more than $120 million in shared TV money. The league's officials negotiated various deals with CBS, NBC, Fox, and Disney, and ended up with a six-year (later extended to eight), $24 billion broadcast and cable rights contract. The television deals ended in 2013. Additionally, DirecTV paid $700 million every year through 2010 for its Sunday Ticket package. The NFL also decided to keep an eight-game Thursday-to-Saturday night package in-house, placing it on its NFL Network.\n\nBoth the Sunday Ticket and NFL Network became issues of concern to Specter, possibly because DirecTV rival Comcast is headquartered in his home state of Pennsylvania. Comcast's Versus network attempted to bid for the eight-game package the NFL gave to their own network, but lost.\n\nThe NFL Network's high per-subscriber fees charged to the cable companies force cable firms to offer the channel as a premium-tier network. This, according to the NFL, is unacceptable, and they demanded their channel be placed on a basic tier, as compared to the higher-priced sports tiers. By doing so, cable companies would have to reduce the number of basic channels or increase the basic cable package rate to comply with the NFL's request. NFL rules however, require that NFL games shown on cable channels (including the NFL Network), be shown on a broadcast television station in the markets of the participating teams (subject to blackouts for the home team when necessary).\n\nThe other major concern is the lack of availability of NFL Sunday Ticket, restricting it severely through its exclusivity with DirecTV. A similar situation happens with NASCAR HotPass, which moved from the cable companies to DirecTV in 2007, and thwarted by Major League Baseball's MLB Extra Innings, which MLB attempted to push to DirecTV exclusively starting in 2009, but was stopped by threats from legislators.\n\nIn what may have been a goodwill gesture to Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey and, in an effort to sway Specter, the NFL gave Time Warner and Cablevision subscribers a free week of programming between December 24 and December 30, 2006. The timing allowed subscribers to tune into the RutgersâKansas State Texas Bowl matchup and another college bowl game featuring Minnesota and Texas Tech. Lautenberg had complained that many Rutgers fans in New Jersey were being unfairly denied the opportunity to watch Rutgers in the Texas Bowl because the NFL Network, which has rights to the game, had not yet reached deals with Cablevision and Time Warner Cable.\n"}
{"id": "11094562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11094562", "title": "Steer riding", "text": "Steer riding\n\nSteer riding is a rodeo youth event that is an introductory form of bull riding for younger riders, usually between the ages of seven and fourteen. Instead of bucking bulls, the children ride steers that buck. Steers are used because they are known to have a less volatile temperament than bulls and many breeds weigh less than bulls, which makes them a perfect stepping stone to junior bulls. The steers usually weigh between . Steer riding usually follows mutton busting and calf riding as the participant ages and grows. Many young and aspiring bull riders who train in steer riding compete in the National Junior Bullriders Association.\n\nThe National Junior Bullriders Association holds these annual contests:\n\n\nRiders use equipment and riding techniques that are similar to adult bull riding. The steers are equipped with the following: a flank strap â the flank strap is placed around a steer's flank, just in front of the hind legs, to encourage bucking. And then they also use a \"steer rope\" â a rope that goes around the steer for the rider to hang onto with a bell underneath. The riders wear batwing chaps, and spurs. For safety, they use protective vests and helmets with a face mask that resemble those worn by hockey goalies.\n\nEvents are usually broken down by age brackets. Parental permission is required for their children to compete, and they must sign a liability waiver. It is possible for competitors to be seriously injured in the event.\n\nLike bull riding, riders must stay on for eight seconds for a qualified ride. Half of the score is awarded for the cowboyâs ability to ride, and the other half for the steerâs ability to buck. One difference is that in some steer riding competitions, riders are allowed to hang on with both hands. They can choose to compete riding one-handed, like the adults, but if they do, they fall under the same rules as bull riding and can be disqualified for grabbing the steer with both hands. Riders can also be disqualified for touching the animal or themselves during the ride. Failure to stay on for the full 8 seconds or a disqualification results in a no score.\n\nRiding steers allows riders to develop needed skills before taking on bulls. As bulls are being bred to be more athletic and dangerous, it is more important than ever for adolescent, teenagers, and young adults to get all of the experience they need before taking on bulls. One man, a former PRCA World Champion Bull Rider, Cody Custer, discusses this issue at length on his web site. When youngsters take on \"junior bulls\" that only a decade or two ago were considered pro level bulls, they have an extremely low success rate and get discouraged or injured beyond what is reasonably acceptable.\n\nThere are also some steers not used in rodeo who have been trained not to buck and instead are gentled to be ridden. Most people who have trained their cattle to be ridden have used them to perform similar tasks which horses perform, such as trail riding, jumping, and running. However, they do require different maintenance and handling than horses. It should also be noted that some breeds of cattle are more conducive than others.\n\n"}

Tam Cuc is not just played for entertainment, but also played in ceremonies and festivals. It is a card game that is commonly played in New Year celebrations, it a habit of northerner to play this game while wait for the banh chung to cook. Tam cÃºc is mostly played by women because the number of cards is less than in the Tá» tÃ´m, which is more common among men. It is similar to the games of , , and Giog.\n\nA deck of tam cÃºc has 32 cards with 2 kinds of set red and black. Each set has 1 general (\"tÆ°á»ng\" å°), 2 advisors (\"sÄ©\" å£«), 2 elephants (\"tÆ°á»£ng\" è±¡), 2 chariots (\"xe\" è»), 2 cannons (\"phÃ¡o\" ç ²), 2 horses (\"mÃ£\" é¦¬), and 5 soldiers (\"tá»t\" å). The black side general is called \"tÆ°á»ng bÃ \", and red side is called \"tÆ°á»ng Ã´ng\".Red side advisors are called \"sÄ© Äiá»u\". The rest of the cards are addressed by their name and color. The deck of the tam cÃºc is similar to Chinese chess pieces.\n\nThe Tam Cuc deck is divided from high to low in rank as follows:\n\nGeneral > intellectuals > elephants > carts > guns > horses > soldiers\n\nThe red suit is worth more than black of same rank.\n\nCombinations of the hand:\n\nTam Cuc can be played with 4, 3, or 2 players. When played with three players one red soldier and one black soldier will not be used, or a total of five cards are discarded: the two generals, both of red and black intellectuals, and 1 red soldier and 1 black soldier.\nAt first one-person will shuffle the deck of card and another will play as the House. The way to become the House is that players will each call out the name of the card general, intellectuals, elephant, cart, gun, horse, and soldier and the card will be deal until the called get the card that they called and become the House. The following house will be establishing the person on the right of the previous House. The House allows dealing the card and goes first. The deck of card is deal out until the end. The house will lay down the cards first and called out for how many card going he be play single card, two cards, or three cards. The following person will lay down the number of card the same as the number being called out face down. When all the players placed down their cards, starting with the house each player will flip their cards up and the one with the highest hand will become the House and the process starts again until end. An exception is that every player allows accept defeated and hides their hand to keep their cards secret. All played cards get collected and discarded as trash.\n\nIf one have five sons (5 soldiers with same color) or four sons (4 soldiers with same color), they show their hand and win automatically and become the House. As there are only four players then there will be no five sons because missing 1 black and 1 red soldier. When the last ground is play, if the House calls a black soldier pair (the lowest hand possible) and if the hand is win then it become pair and more point will be added to the player. Also, when the last ground is play, if the House calls three black soldiers and if the hand is win then it become 3 of a kind and more point will be added to the player. In some area the player allow to exchange their cards in secret face-down to make better to both side of the players.

After the first production number of the event, it was made public that the benefit show raised â±14 million. Two months after the event was aired, some of the AlDub libraries were already fully constructed in the schools at Laguna, Capiz and Iligan City. In October 2016, Maine Mendoza herself turned over the AlDub library project to one of the beneficiaries in Cebu. \n\nThe \"Tamang Panahon\" episode of \"Eat Bulaga!\" obtained a 50.8% rating in Mega Manila and 42.9% rating in urban areas in the Philippines (as measured by NUTAM or Nationwide Urban Television Audience Measurement) making it as the highest rated single episode for 2015 according to AGB Nielsen. In the Kantar Media ratings, the special \"Eat Bulaga!\" episode garnered a 40.1% rating beating ABS-CBN's \"It's Showtime\" (its closest competition) by about four times, making it the highest rated daytime show for 2015 in the Philippine television.\n\nSome netizens criticized the gown worn by Maine Mendoza during the event and pointed that it was already worn by actress Kim Chiu on a previous event. Liz Uy of Stylized Studio who was hired to do stylist works for the show made a statement regarding the gown and argued that the producers of \"Eat Bulaga!\", TAPE Inc., purchased the gown from Francis Libiran and she had chosen it to fit the Cinderella-themed event. Libiran also commented on the issue and said that indeed Chiu wore the gown in a 2013 fashion show but the one that Mendoza wore was a different one although it was the same design as the gown modeled by Chiu.\n\nKim Chiu herself appealed through Twitter to stop the hate and the \"gown is just a gown.\" \"Eat Bulaga!\" host Allan K also pleaded on Twiiter and said that do not put an issue on the gown since Libiran already released a statement about the history of the gown.\n\nThe Guinness World Records recognized the \"Tamang Panahon\" hashtag #AlDubEBTamangPanahon as the most used hashtag in twenty four hours on Twitter. The said hashtag generated 40,706,392 tweets from October 24, 2015 to October 25, 2015. The recognition is part the record-breaking feats in the ten years history of Twitter. The most retweeted tweet for the event came from a post from the official Twitter account of Maine Mendoza, which was retweeted more than 74,000 times.\n\n\"Tamang Panahon\" received a special award during the 2016 Box Office Entertainment Awards as the Highest Record Rating of a Noontime Show of All Time (Local & Global). The event was also featured in a special collectors edition of the December 2015 issue of \"Yes!\" magazine. \n"}
{"id": "31178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31178", "title": "Tarot", "text": "Tarot\n\nThe tarot (; first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi, tarock and tarot) is a pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian tarocchini, French tarot and Austrian KÃ¶nigrufen. Many of these tarot card games are still played today. In the late 18th century, it began to be used in parallel for divination in the form of tarotology and cartomancy and specialist packs were developed for such occult purposes.\n\nLike common playing cards, the tarot has four suits (which vary by region: French suits in Northern Europe, Latin suits in Southern Europe, and German suits in Central Europe). Each suit has 14 cards, ten pip cards numbering from one (or Ace) to ten and four face cards (King, Queen, Knight, and Jack/Knave). In addition, the tarot has a separate 21-card trump suit and a single card known as the Fool. Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit. These tarot cards, without occult symbology, are still used throughout much of Europe to play card games. \n\nIn English-speaking countries, where these games are not played, tarot cards are used primarily for divinatory purposes, usually using specially designed packs. The cards are traced by some occult writers to ancient Egypt or the Kabbalah but there is no documented evidence of such origins or of the usage of tarot for divination before the 18th century.\n\nThe word tarot and German \"Tarock\" derive from the Italian \"tarocchi\", the origin of which is uncertain but \"taroch\" was used as a synonym for foolishness in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The decks were known exclusively as \"trionfi\" during the fifteenth century. The new name first appeared in Brescia around 1502 as \"tarocho\". During the 16th century, a new game played with a standard deck but sharing a very similar name (trionfa) was quickly becoming popular. This coincided with the older game being renamed \"tarocchi\". In modern Italian, the singular term is \"tarocco\", which, as a noun, means a type of blood orange, and, as an adjective, means 'fake, counterfeit'.\n\nPlaying cards first entered Europe in the late 14th century, most likely from Mamluk Egypt, with suits of Batons or Polo sticks (commonly known as Wands by those practicing occult or divinatory tarot), Coins (commonly known as disks, or pentacles in occult or divinatory tarot), Swords, and Cups. These suits were very similar to modern tarot divination decks and are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese playing card decks.\n\nThe first documented tarot packs were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in Milan, Ferrara, Florence and Bologna when additional trump cards with allegorical illustrations were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called \"carte da trionfi\", triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as trionfi, which became \"trumps\" in English. The earliest documentation of \"trionfi\" is found in a written statement in the court records of Florence, in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta.\n\nThe oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so Visconti-Sforza tarot decks painted in the mid-15th century for the rulers of the Duchy of Milan. A lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke Filippo Maria Visconti and described by Martiano da Tortona probably between 1418 and 1425, since the painter he mentions, Michelino da Besozzo, returned to Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the Greek gods and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as \"trumps\" since in 1449 Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a \"novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus\", or \"a new and exquisite kind of triumphs\". Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the Sola-Busca and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.\n\nIn Florence, an expanded deck called \"Minchiate\" was used. This deck of 97 cards includes astrological symbols and the four elements, as well as traditional tarot motifs.\n\nAlthough a Dominican preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in cards (chiefly owing to their use in gambling) in a sermon in the 15th century, no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its early history.\n\nBecause the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It was only after the invention of the printing press that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the Italian Wars. The most important tarot pattern used in these two countries was the Tarot of Marseilles of Milanese origin.\n\nThe original purpose of tarot cards was to play games. A very cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425. Vague descriptions of game play or game terminology follow for the next two centuries until the earliest known complete description of rules for a French variant in 1637. The game of tarot has many regional variations. Tarocchini has survived in Bologna and there are still others played in Piedmont and Sicily, but in Italy the game is generally less popular than elsewhere.\n\nThe 18th century saw tarot's greatest revival, during which it became one of the most popular card games in Europe, played everywhere except Ireland and Britain, the Iberian peninsula, and the Ottoman Balkans. French tarot experienced a revival beginning in the 1970s and France has the strongest tarot gaming community. Regional tarot gamesâoften known as \"tarock\", \"tarok\", or \"tarokk\" are widely played in central Europe within the borders of the former Austro-Hungarian empire.\n\nThese were the oldest form of tarot deck to be made, being first devised in the 15th century in northern Italy. The so-called occult tarot decks are based on decks of this type. Three decks of this category are still used to play certain games:\n\nThe Tarocco Siciliano is the only deck to use the so-called Portuguese suit system which uses Spanish pips but intersects them like Italian pips. Some of the trumps are different such as the lowest trump, \"Miseria\" (destitution). It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups: it thus has 64 cards but the ace of coins is not used, being the bearer of the former stamp tax. The cards are quite small and not reversible.\n\nThe illustrations of French-suited tarot trumps depart considerably from the older Italian-suited design, abandoning the Renaissance allegorical motifs. With the exception of novelty decks, French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for card games. The first generation of French-suited tarots depicted scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called \"Tiertarock\" ('Tier' being German for 'animal') appeared around 1740. Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with genre art or veduta. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these patterns:\n\n\nGerman-suited decks for Bauerntarock, WÃ¼rttemberg Tarock and Bavarian Tarock are different. They are not true tarot/tarock packs, but a Bavarian or WÃ¼rttemberg pattern of the standard German-suited decks with only 36 cards; the pip cards ranging from 6 to 10, Under Knave (\"Unter\"), Over Knave (\"Ober\"), King, and Ace. These use Ace-Ten ranking, like Klaverjas, where Ace is the highest followed by 10, King, Ober, Unter, then 9 to 6. The heart suit is the default trump suit. The Bavarian deck is also used to play Schafkopf by excluding the Sixes.\n\nThe earliest evidence of a tarot deck used for cartomancy comes from an anonymous manuscript from around 1750 which documents rudimentary divinatory meanings for the cards of the Tarocco Bolognese. The popularization of esoteric tarot started with Antoine Court and Jean-Baptiste Alliette (Etteilla) in Paris during the 1780s, using the Tarot of Marseilles. After French tarot players abandoned the Marseilles tarot in favor of the Tarot Nouveau around 1900, the Marseilles pattern is now used mostly by cartomancers.\n\nEtteilla was the first to issue a tarot deck specifically designed for occult purposes around 1789. In keeping with the misplaced belief that such cards were derived from the Book of Thoth, Etteilla's tarot contained themes related to ancient Egypt.\n\nThe 78-card tarot deck used by esotericists has two distinct parts:\n\n\nThe terms \"major arcana\" and \"minor arcana\" were first used by Jean-Baptiste Pitois (also known as Paul Christian) and are never used in relation to Tarot card games. Some decks exist primarily as artwork; and such art decks sometimes contain only the 22 major arcana. \n\nThe three most common decks used in esoteric tarot are the Tarot of Marseilles, the Rider-Waite tarot deck, and the Thoth tarot deck.\n\n"}

{"id": "1240030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1240030", "title": "Three Card Poker", "text": "Three Card Poker\n\nThree Card Poker is a casino table game based on poker.\n\nThe casino variant of Three Card Poker was first created by Derek Webb in 1994 and patented in 1997. Webb's goal wasn't to create a version of poker that played with the speed of other table games. It was important to Webb that he got the correct mix of three important factors for any casino game: the game rules were easy to understand, the payouts were large enough to attract players, and the house edge was enough that casino owners would be interested in adopting the game.\n\nWebb established a business called Prime Table Games to market the game in both the United States and United Kingdom. The British Casino Association, now known as the National Casino Industry Forum (NCiF) suggested that Webb gain some experience in the US first, since the UK had regulations against such a table game and his application was not strong enough to convince regulators to make significant changes to their rules and regulations for a new game.\n\nThe first casino to adopt the game was Grand Casino Gulfport in Mississippi, after Webb had unsuccessful sales pitches with casino owners in Reno, Las Vegas, and Atlantic City. United Kingdom gambling regulations were changed to allow the introduction of Three Card Poker in 2002.\n\nPrime Table Games continued marketing Three Card Poker until 1999, when Shuffle Master acquired the rights to the game outside the British Isles. The sale was prompted by a lawsuit filed that year in US federal court by Progressive Gaming International Corporation (PGIC), the then-owners of Caribbean stud poker, alleging patent infringement; Shuffle Master agreed to defend that litigation as part of the purchase. Subsequently in 2007, Prime Table Games showed in a countersuit that the 1999 PGIC litigation was based on invalid patent claims; PGIC settled for $20 million. Further, Prime Table Games filed suit against Shuffle Master in 2008 alleging in part that Shuffle Master had undisclosed knowledge that the PGIC claims were invalid prior to the 1999 purchase; it was later settled for over $2 million.\n\nThree Card Poker is played as heads-up between the player's hand and the dealer's hand. After all ante wagers are placed, three cards are dealt to each player and the dealer. Players have a choice to either fold or continue in the game by placing a \"play\" wager equal to their ante. Hands are then exposed and wagers resolved.\n\nThe dealer's hand must be Queen high or better for the dealer hand to play. If the dealer does not play, then there is no action on play wagers and ante wagers are paid 1 to 1. If the dealer does play, the dealer and player hands are compared. If the player hand loses, both the ante and play wagers are lost. If the player hand wins both the ante and play wagers are paid 1 to 1. If the hands are tied, then there is no action on either wager.\n\nAdditional optional bets are offered. The Pair Plus wager is a bet that the player's hand will be a pair or better. The Pair Plus wager loses if the player has less than a pair and wins with a pair or better. The payoff applies regardless of the dealer's hand, as the Pair Plus wager is not in competition against the dealer's hand. Some casinos also offer an Ante Bonus, which is paid on the ante wager for a straight or better. The typical Ante Bonus paytable pays 5 to 1 for a straight flush, 4 to 1 for a three of a kind, and 1 to 1 for a straight. Like the Pair Plus wager, the Ante Bonus pays regardless of whether that hand beats the dealer's hand.\n\nProbability of Queen high or better is 69.59%\n\nSome venues have added a wager called Prime in United Kingdom casinos and the game is known as Prime Three Card Poker. The Prime wager is optionally placed before cards are dealt and pays on the color of the player cards. If all three cards are the same color the payoff is 3 to 1. However when included with the dealer hand if all six cards are the same color then the payoff is increased to 4 to 1.\n\nAnother variation is \"six card bonus\", in which the players are given a payout based on the best five-card poker hand that can be made using any combination of the player's three cards and the dealer's three cards. Payoff ranges from 5 to 1 for three of a kind to 1000 to 1 for royal flush. Payoffs are paid regardless of whether any other bets pay.\n\n"}

The \"robot\" has a shoulder, arm and head that is higher than the actual performer's head (up to 8 feet in total). The part above the \"robot\" chest is a remote control mechanism. The operator in the body can manipulate the upper part of the \"robot\" through the control panel in the chest of the body to complete various instructions.
