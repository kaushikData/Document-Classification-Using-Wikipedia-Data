Made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was produced by Bernard Smith and John Ford, from a screenplay by Janet Green and John McCormick, based on the short story \"Chinese Finale\" by Norah Lofts. The music score was by Elmer Bernstein and the cinematography by Joseph LaShelle. This was the last feature film directed by Ford, ending a career that spanned approximately fifty years.\n\nIn rural China, in 1935, all but one of the white residents of a remote Christian mission post are women. The strict Miss Agatha Andrews (Margaret Leighton) is the head of the mission, assisted by the meek Miss Argent (Mildred Dunnock). Charles Pether (Eddie Albert) is a mission teacher who always wanted to be a pastor; his peevish, panicky, self-centred and domineering middle-aged wife Florrie (Betty Field) is pregnant for the first time. Emma Clark (Sue Lyon) is the only young staff member, whom Miss Andrews treats as if she was her daughter.\n\nThe mission is elated to learn that a much-needed doctor is arriving. However, they are shocked to discover that Dr. Cartwright (Anne Bancroft) is a New York woman who smokes, drinks alcohol, swears, wears pants and short hair, disdains religion and sits before grace. She and Miss Andrews are soon at odds. Emma, who has led a very sheltered life, is fascinated by the newcomer, much to Miss Andrews's dismay.\n\nAfter she has settled in, Dr. Cartwright urges Miss Andrews to provide money to send Florrie Pether to a modern facility, as her age means that giving birth is high risk, but Andrews refuses.\n\nMeanwhile, there are rumors of atrocities committed by the militia of Mongolian warlord Tunga Khan (Mike Mazurki). Miss Andrews is certain that the mission will be safe, as they are American citizens. After a nearby, even poorer British mission is sacked by Tunga Khan, Miss Andrews reluctantly accepts survivors Miss Binns (Flora Robson), Mrs. Russell (Anna Lee) and Miss Ling (Jane Chang), but only for a short time, as she is unwilling to harbor those of any other denomination for long.\n\nImmediately after the arrival of the survivors, a cholera outbreak erupts. Dr. Cartwright quickly takes command, treating all the Chinese of the area. Miss Andrews's initial hostility to her subsides when Emma gets sick and she implores Dr. Cartwright to save her life. After the emergency is over and Emma is well again, the relationship between Andrews and Cartwright starts to soften. but deteriorates when Cartwright shows up drunk in the dining room with a bottle of whiskey, and tries to make all the pious women drink as well.\n\nOne night, Charles and Cartwright see a fire on the horizon and hear gunfire. The next morning, the Chinese soldiers of the nearby garrison evacuate in a hurry, as Tunga Khan and his men are believed to be approaching. Miss Andrews is still convinced the mision is untouchable, but Charles is now determined to be assertive. He and Kim, an English speaking male Chinese mission staff member, drive out to investigate the situation, while urging everyone else to be prepared to leave the mission, despite Miss Andrews's opposition. After a while, they hear the car's horn, but once the gate is opened, bandits on horseback charge in firing their guns and quickly take over the mission. Before being executed by the bandits, Kim tells the women Charles was murdered when he tried to rescue a woman being assaulted by Tunga Khan's men. Then Miss Ling, coming from a powerful Mandarin family, is taken away to act as Tunga Khan's young wife's servant, while the seven white women are herded into a shed.\n\nThey watch as Tunga Khan has every Chinese in the mission executed, women and children included, to Emma's shock. Tunga Khan comes into the shed and tries to take Emma. Realizing that they are mostly American women, he decides to ask for a ransom.\n\nWith Miss Andrews panicking and Florrie in labor, Dr. Cartwright asks for her desperately needed medical bag. Tunga Khan offers to exchange it for her sexual submission to him. The doctor agrees, and helps Florrie give birth to a baby boy. After Cartwright goes to fulfill her end of the bargain, an increasingly deranged Andrews vilifies her, calling her \"whore of Babylon\". The others, however, understand the sacrifice the doctor has made and why.\n\nIn the evening, the Mongols gather in a circle and organize wrestling matches for entertainment, with Dr. Cartwright watching the spectacle at Tunga Khan's side, as his new concubine. When the lean warrior (Woody Strode) who had been ogling Cartwright all evening steps into the ring to face the winner of a bout, Tunga Khan insists on accepting the challenge himself and breaks the man's neck.\n\nCartwright manages to convince Tunga Khan to let the other women go, including Miss Ling. Before Miss Argent leaves, she sees the doctor hide a bottle that she had earlier called poison. She urges Cartwright not to do what she is planning, but to no avail. With the others safely away, Cartwright, now in a geisha outfit, goes to Tunga Khan's room and secretly poisons two drinks. She subserviently offers a cup to Tunga Khan, as she utters, \"So long, ya bastard.\" After Tunga Khan drinks, he immediately keels over dead. Then, after a moment's hesitation, Cartwright drinks from the second cup.\n\n\nThe film also appeared in several lists. These include:\n\n\"Cahiers du cinéma\" voted it the 6th best film of 1966 and Andrew Sarris rated it the third-best of 1966 (only being beaten by \"Blow-up\" and \"Gertrud\").\n\nThe film is currently ranked #847 on the \"They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?\" (TSPDT) list of the 1000 greatest films of all time. The list is based on a poll of 1,825 film critics, scholars, and cinephiles, as well as a culling of over 900 existing \"greatest film\" lists.\n\nThe original story, \"Chinese Finale\", was presented as an episode of \"Alcoa Theatre\" in March 1960 with Hilda Plowright as Miss Andrews and Jan Sterling as Dr. Mary Cartwright.\n\nJohn Ford considered both Katharine Hepburn and Jennifer Jones for the role of Dr. Cartwright, and Rosalind Russell lobbied for the part, but eventually Patricia Neal was cast. Ford began the film on 8 February 1965 on the MGM backlot, but after three days of filming, Neal had a stroke. Anne Bancroft took over the role of Dr. Cartwright but Ford was unhappy with Bancroft and called her \"the mistress of monotone\". Ford originally considered Carol Lynley for the role played in the film by MGM contract star Sue Lyon, whom the studio insisted on. Shooting finished on April 12, only six days behind schedule.\n\nFord chose Otho Lovering to edit the film; they had first worked together on \"Stagecoach\" (1939). Lovering edited most of Ford's feature films in the 1960s.\n\nThe film was not released until 1966.\n\nAs Ford was a devout Catholic, the film shows the difference between the claim of being moral and the act of morals; the stark contrast between compassion and sacrifice to the austere holier-than-thou philosophy.\n\n"}

The opening night featured TV writer Steven Moffat (Doctor Who, Sherlock) and comedian Frank Skinner, a Doctor Who fan, compered by Scottish comedian Fred MacAulay.

Moffat conceded that the Doctor can only regenerate 12 times (Capaldi is the 12th) but did not reveal how, or if, he intended to get round this in future. He also stated that he would be surprised if Capaldi did not play the part in his native Scottish accent.\n\nAccording to the website of Ad Lib founder Stuart Snaith, he is in discussions about developing the format for television, as well as taking it live to London and America, and returning to Edinburgh in 2014.\n"}
{"id": "623203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=623203", "title": "Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation", "text": "Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation\n\nThe Adult Industry Medical Associates P.C. (formerly Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation), also known simply as AIM or AIM Medical, was an organization that tested pornographic actors for HIV and other STDs on a scheduled basis.\n\nTests for the sex industry actors were done at the Foundation's offices in San Fernando Valley, Sherman Oaks, and Granada Hills. Each month, about 1,200 actors were tested for HIV, with results as early as 14 days after infection. This test is effective 10 days after potential infection, and anytime thereafter (HIV-1 DNA, by PCR) as compared to the alternative HIV test (HIV ELISA) which requires a six-month waiting period to be effective. Other tests include such STDs as chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis.\n\nAIM went out of business in 2011 after a lawsuit regarding violation of patient privacy. \n\nSince the 1980s, outbreaks of HIV/AIDS within the community of erotic actors caused a number of deaths. In response to this threat AIM was founded in 1998 by former adult entertainer Sharon Mitchell, who had left the industry in 1996 to pursue credentials in public health counseling and sexology.\n\nThe Foundation helped set up a system in the U.S. wherein erotic actors in the adult film industry are tested for AIDS every 30 days. All on-camera sexual contact is logged, and a positive test result triggers the contacting and re-testing of all sexual partners during the previous three to six months. The Foundation provides secure means of sharing results via their web servers so that results cannot be forged. Prior to AIM, there had been STD testing programs in lifestyle communities, including Kerista Commune, More University, and Rajneeshpuram. These approaches had mixed results and were less systematic and regular.\n\nThis system resulted in low rates of HIV transmission, and hence low rates of infection, among erotic actors: reportedly, not a single HIV test in an active adult industry performer had been positive in the four-year period prior to 2004.\n\nIt was in 2004 that AIM assisted in the sex-film-industry shutdown, a quarantine that lasted fewer than 60 days. A male performer, Darren James, had tested positive for HIV in April and, to prevent another HIV outbreak, an urgent search was initiated for his potentially infected partners. A total of four more performers, Bianca Biaggi, Jessica Dee, Lara Roxx, and Miss Arroyo were diagnosed with the virus by the end of the testing rounds, including one unrelated case in New York. James had apparently had contact with 12 women since his initial negative HIV test in March upon his return from a Brazilian film shoot.\n\nIn 2009, the Los Angeles Public Health department and the \"Los Angeles Times\" claimed there were 16 unreported cases of HIV among adult film actors. AIM Health Care Foundation reported that these cases were actually members of the general public or people applying to work in the adult film industry that had not yet actually worked in films due to their initial test being positive.\n\nOn October 12, 2010, the Foundation reported that an actor or actress had been infected with HIV. The name and gender of the person was not released to the public. Vivid Entertainment and Wicked Pictures shut down porn production temporarily to avoid spreading of the virus. Although Wicked Pictures has a mandatory condom policy, the company shut down to wait for the quarantine list.\n\nIn early 2011, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation publicly raised questions about AIM clinics' licensing situation, resulting in a shutdown. Later that year, the foundation reopened under private ownership, but this was short-lived.\n\nIn 2006, AIM started offering online services for selecting, scheduling, and paying for tests in affiliation with local clinics and laboratories in many cities via the SxCheck (alternatively AIM Check) website. With secure online access to test results, faking of paper test results was prevented, since clients could select to privately share the results with others online, by email, or by SMS.\n\nAIM Medical's patient database was the source of a massive 2011 data leak containing confidential personal information, including the real names of over 12,000 pornographic actors and their STD test results, which was distributed via the Porn Wikileaks website. AIM closed its offices and filed for bankruptcy in May 2011 as a result of a privacy lawsuit challenging AIM's handling of the patient records.

It was founded by Gursimran Khamba and Tanmay Bhat who were later joined by Rohan Joshi. The group maintains a YouTube channel that shows their comedy sketches and parodies on topics such as politics, Indian culture, and society, and the Hindi film industry. Initially, the group produced podcasts and from 2013, they started using YouTube as a medium to share their comic work. It is one of the most viewed, India-based channel on YouTube. Joshi said that the reason for their use of YouTube was that they simply did not have funds for advertisements and other promotional materials, and instead relied upon social media to promote their work.\n\nOn October 8th 2018, founders Khamba and Bhat were forced to step away from AIB amid sexual harassment allegations. \n\nIn 2014, AIB teamed up with actress Alia Bhatt to make a 10-minute sketch called \"Genius of the Year\", which made fun of Bhatt's \"Koffee with Karan\" interview. Directed by Shakun Batra, the video also had spoofs of her movie songs.\n\nAs of May 2018, the group had amassed over 379 million views on their videos and had 3.1 million subscribers on YouTube. In December 2014, AIB organized a roast show, \"All India Bakchod Knockout Championship\" featuring Karan Johar as the host with Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor as subjects of the roast. The event is claimed to have raised over 40 lakh rupees for charity organisations such as Being Human and Vogue Empower (which works for women empowerment). They also perform regular stand-up acts across the globe.\n\nAIB also has an advertisement wing called Vigyapanti, which was started in early October 2015. It was kicked off by the release of an online video titled \"Creep Qawwali\", which was an advertisement for the start-up dating portal, \"Truly Madly\".\n\nAIB started a news comedy series called \"On Air With AIB\" on the Star Network in October 2015. The 20-episode show (10 in English and 10 Hindi equivalents) was released on Hotstar first, followed by weekend airing on STAR World India and Star Plus. They later returned with a second season on Hotstar.\n\nAIB also conducts screenwriting workshops under the banner AIB First Draft.\n\nAIB's collaborators include Abish Mathew, Kaneez Surka, Varun Thakur, Mallika Dua and Sumukhi Suresh among others. \n\nOn Air with AIB is a typical news comedy show that aims to find comedy in tragedy. Hosted by Rohan Joshi, Tanmay Bhat, Ashish Shakya and Gursimran Khamba, the show featured interviews, sketches and an examination of systemic issues that the country faces. The show has been co-hosted and written by Zakir Khan.\n\nSeason 2 of On Air with AIB is released only on Hotstar.\n\nSeason 2 started on 6 March 2017.\n\nIn 2013, AIB uploaded a satirical video called \"Rape: It's Your Fault\", starring Kalki Koechlin and Juhi Pande. The video went viral with over 6 million views, and started conversations about the way that rape victims in India are treated in the media and by law enforcement.\n\nAIB has been highly critical of Facebook's Free Basics program, on the grounds that it violates net neutrality. In 2015, the group made three videos, all of which went viral, published on YouTube, urging people to write to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to keep India's internet neutral towards contents and content providers and providing a substantial boost to the pro-net neutrality SaveTheInternet.in campaign. Later, TRAI supported net neutrality and ruled against differential data pricing based on content which resulted in ending zero-rating platforms in India including Free Basics and Airtel Zero.2016, they uploaded a satirical video called \"The Demonetisation Circus\" based on the Modi government's decision to demonetise banknotes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000. The video exposed the facilities faced by the common public and the attitude of citizens towards their brethren in a satirical manner. \n\nAkhilesh Tiwari, president of Balaji telefilms in Mumbai, filed a written complaint at Sogogot fire station on February 2015 for alleged use of good abusive language in the AIB knockout. The Mumbai police initiated a film into this complaint against the participants, ranging from Director Karan Johar to actors Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh. An edited photo of the event was uploaded on facebook on 28 January 2015, covering the event that was held on December 28. The government of Maharashtra ordered an inquiry against event organizers and participants.\n\nBollywood actor Aamir Khan criticized the group's roast event. He said ‘I completely believe in freedom of speech but as creative persons we have to understand that we all have a certain responsibility towards society.’ In response, Anurag Kashyap posted a link on his Facebook page showing Khan defending the DK Bose song from the movie \"Delhi Belly\", a film that Khan produced. Khan had said, \"I have already informed my audiences that it is an adult film. Please do not go with your kids and those who have a problem with this kind of language shouldn't come either. I try my best to inform the audiences beforehand. Then they can decide themselves. If the audience is adult, they can decide themselves. So from my end I do all these things for my fans.\" AIB had provided a statutory warning at the beginning of the video describing the 18+ offensive nature of the content of the video. To ensure that people get the message, they made their ‘roast master’ Karan Johar repeat the warning.\n\nOn 4th October 2018, stand-up comedian and popular YouTuber Utsav Chakraborty, who works a freelancer with the comedy group All Indian Bakchod, has been accused of sending women lewd messages and photos via social message apps. The allegations against Utsav blew up when a Twitter user named Mahima Kukreja put up a Twitter post, accusing the comedian of sending her an unsolicited photo of gentalia and then pleading with her not to make his act public as it would \"ruin\" his career. . Most of the comedians within his circle knew about his behaviour of harassing minor girls including Tanmay Bhat but opted to keep quiet and work with him..\n\nOn 8th October 2018, Gursimran Khamba gave clarification on some sexual harassment allegations reported by an unknown girl. She accused Khamba of sexually assaulting her. Khamba, on the other hand, denied the allegation, claiming that the relationship was consensual. As a result of these allegations against AIB members, AIB's HR team announced that Tanmay Bhat would be stepping away from the business immediately, and Khamba would take a leave of absence.\n\n\nAIB on YouTube\nUdd Gaye | Bacardi AIB on DownloadAnySong\n"}

The revue contained satirical sketches and witty or poignant musical numbers, several of which became standards, including \"Heat Wave\", \"Easter Parade\" and \"Harlem on my Mind\". The sketches were loosely based on the news and the lives and affairs of the rich and famous, and other people of the day, such as Joan Crawford, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Noël Coward, Josephine Baker, and Aimee Semple McPherson.\n\nThe revue was a successor to the creators' \"Face the Music\" and was Marilyn Miller's last stage appearance before her death. It was also the first Broadway show to give an African-American star, Ethel Waters, equal billing with whites.\n\nMoss Hart said that he and Irving Berlin did not want to write the typical revue with \"blackout sketches\" and musical numbers, and they had the idea of doing a topical revue \"right off the front pages of the newspapers.\" Berlin deferred his own fees as composer, lyricist, and theater owner, keeping the cost of the show to a \"restrained\" $96,000.\n\nEach of the 21 scenes was preceded by a related newspaper headline, and the sketches poked fun a wide variety of subjects, including the marital woes of Barbara Hutton, Gandhi, and British royalty; the weather report was turned into a song (\"Heat Wave\"); President and Mrs. Hoover leaving the White House, with the President giving his cabinet a Bronx cheer; \"Supper Time\", an African-American woman's lament for her lynched husband; John D. Rockefeller refusing to accept Radio City Music Hall as a birthday gift; commercials interrupting the singing during a Metropolitan Opera broadcast (P.D.Q. Bach later did this); a hotel staff falling under the influence of Noël Coward; and a Supreme Court decision that says musicals cannot end with reprises, resulting in a new number, \"Not For All The Rice In China\" (satirizing Barbara Hutton's relationship with Alexis Mdivani), as a finale.\n\n\n† \"Omitted from 1998 revival\"\n\nThe revue opened on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre on September 30, 1933 and became a hit, running for 400 performances, which was rare during the Great Depression. It was staged by Hassard Short with choreography by Charles Weidman. The musical starred Helen Broderick, Marilyn Miller, Clifton Webb and Ethel Waters, and featured José Limón as the lead dancer. The London-based version of the show, retitled \"Stop Press\", opened on February 21, 1935 at the Adelphi Theatre.\n\nIn 1934, Dorothy Stone took over the roles played by Miller.\n\nThe Drama Department presented the revue at the off-Broadway Greenwich House Theater from June 2, 1998 through June 14, 1998. Directed by Christopher Ashley with musical staging by Kathleen Marshall, the cast included Kevin Chamberlin, Judy Kuhn, Howard McGillin, Paula Newsome, Mary Beth Peil and B. D. Wong. Reviews were extremely positive. The show has had a number of other revivals both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"Boom Blox\", and was released on 19 May 2009 in North America and in Europe on 29 May 2009. The game features more than 400 levels, and players are able to download new levels and upload their own custom-created levels to share online. Its development began after the completion of its predecessor, and it was formally announced on 28 January 2009. As with the original game, this sequel was also designed by film director Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Boom Blox Bash Party\" resembles the original's, but features new mechanics. It also has less emphasis on the shooting mode, which the developers commented was their least favorite mode of play in \"Boom Blox\". It was created as part of a deal between Electronic Arts and Steven Spielberg to make three original properties, though it does not count as one of the three original properties. As of April 2012, EA has shut down the online servers, meaning players can no longer upload and download user created games.\n\n\"Boom Blox Bash Party\" features similar gameplay to its predecessor. It features a new slingshot mechanic; the shooting mechanic is less prominent than in the first game. The game includes new environments (such as underwater and outer space), new block shapes (such as cylinders and ramps), and more extensive multiplayer.\n\n\"Boom Blox Bash Party\" originally allowed players to upload levels, as well as download levels made by other players and Electronic Arts. Uploaded levels had to be reviewed by Electronic Arts, with any inappropriate content filtered out. However, a player could download any levels made by someone on their Wii Friends list. \"Boom Blox Bash Party\" did not feature Friend Codes, a common method of online play in Wii and Nintendo DS games. Some of the levels uploaded by EA include levels from the original \"Boom Blox\". The ability to upload and download levels ended on April 13, 2012 when EA shut down all of the servers.\n\n\"Bash Party\"'s development was announced on 18 November 2008 by \"Variety\". It was announced for a Spring 2009 release as \"Boom Blox Bash Party\" on January 28, 2009 by EA Casual. The game was developed by Electronic Arts and Steven Spielberg, just like its predecessor. It was a part of a 2005 deal between EA and Spielberg to make three original properties. It was conceived as soon as the original game was completed. Spielberg kept meeting with EA on \"Boom Blox\" on new ideas; producer Amir Rahimi commented that there was so much enthusiasm that \"he could hardly stop them from doing a sequel.\" A feature which was cut in \"Boom Blox\" was not included in this game either. It was a head-tracking system, which would allow the player to use two Wii Remotes to control the game's camera with his or her head. Because the developers didn't receive the development hardware in time to implement it, Wii MotionPlus compatibility is not included.

The player controls the ghost using the computer mouse and makes him blow at a bubble. The objective is to guide a bubble throughout a number of halls in a haunted house. If the bubble hits any walls or obstacles, then it will pop and the player loses a life. Obstacles include lit candles, electricity and fans. These can be all controlled by the ghost, who can wander around the level freely and blow at things - such as the bubble to add speed, the candle to put out the flame, or switches to turn them on or off.\n\nThe ghost is controlled using the mouse: moving the mouse moves the ghost. A press on the left button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the left. A press on the right button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the right. A press on a keyboard key (Shift) makes the ghost blow.\n\nThe game is made of 35 halls (levels). Each time the player makes the bubble exit a hall, he wins 1000 points + left bonus. Action on animation may add 5000 points to the player. The bonus is re-initialized at every new hall. A new bubble is added to the player account each time the bubble exits towards the top of the hall.\n\nThe original \"Bubble Ghost\" was created by Christophe Andreani (design, programming) on an Atari ST computer. The game has been adapted for other computers throughout the world.\n\nSome years later, ERE Informatique was bought by Infogrames. Infogrames published a new version of \"Bubble Ghost\" with updated graphics, \"Bubble +\" (\"Bubble Plus\").\n\nA Nintendo Game Boy version was published in 1990. It was the first French game adapted for the Game Boy. \n\nThe original concept of \"Bubble Ghost\" was reused and modified in 2008 in the game \"Soul Bubbles\" for the Nintendo DS. \n\nSome graphic parts of the \"Bubble Ghost\" halls have a specific meaning:\n\nHall #4: An advertisement for the French telematics server Pinky by Godefroy Troude, and a wink to the video game \"Mercenary\" by Paul Woakes published by Novagen.\n\nHall#5: The face of the author slightly modified.\n\nHall#11: The face of the author appears with glasses (if the ghost is blowing in the ear, glasses disappear) and a wink at the video game \"The Pawn\" published by Rainbird.\n\nHall#15: Another wink to the video game \"Mercenary\" by Paul Woakes published by Novagen.\n\nHall#28: Two more winks to the video game \"The Pawn\" published by Rainbird.\n\nThe game was programmed in C (editor and compiler: Megamax C) and 68000 assembly language on an Atari 1040 ST computer. The graphics were made with the Degas Elite drawing software. The digital sound of the introductory page of the game (\"Welcome to Bubble Ghost\") was built using ST Replay. This is the author's voice. The other sound effects use the synthesizer inside the Atari ST.\n\nHere are some notes from the author when creating the game:\nFollowing French magazines have published \"Bubble Ghost\" review:\n\nFollowing US magazine has published \"Bubble Ghost\" review:\n\nFollowing French magazines have published \"Bubble +\" (\"Bubble Plus\") review:\n\n"}

It is a work of importance for its quality, and its revelation of the interaction of classes and races in Havana, Cuba.\n\nThe first version of the novel \"Cecilia Valdés o la Loma del Angel\" was published in Havana in 1839. After several revisions, the definitive and extended version was published in New York City in 1882. It has never been out of print in Spanish, and have been translated into several English editions (as \"Cecilia Valdes\" or \"Angel Hill\"). It is widely regarded as the best Cuban novel of the 19th century.\n\nThe story takes place in colonial Cuba around 1830. The young and beautiful light skinned mulatta, Cecilia Valdés, is the illegitimate daughter of powerful land magnate and slave trader, Cándido de Gamboa. Leonardo de Gamboa is his legitimate son. Leonardo falls in love with Cecilia, not realizing that she is his own half-sister, and they become lovers. At the same time, a poor black musician, José Dolores Pimienta, is also hopelessly in love with Cecilia. Cecilia rejects Pimenta's advances and conceives Leonardo's son.\n\nHowever, love between Leonardo and Cecilia does not last. He abandons her and becomes betrothed to a white upper class woman, Isabel Ilincheta. Cecilia turns to the faithful Pimienta to plan revenge. On the day of his wedding, Leonardo is assassinated on the steps of the cathedral by Pimienta who acts on the instigation of Cecilia. Pimienta is executed, and she is thrown in prison.\n\n\"Cecilia Valdés\" reveals the intricate problems of race relations in Cuba. There are the elite social circles of Spanish-born and creole whites; the growing number of mulattos, of which Cecilia is one, and the blacks: some slaves, some freed men. The blacks are also divided between those who were born in Africa and those who were born in Cuba, those who worked on the sugar plantation and those who worked in the households of the wealthy in Havana. Cecilia Valdés is a canvas displaying the sexual, social, and racial interaction of the Cubans of the day.\n\nThe zarzuela is in two acts with music by Gonzalo Roig. The libretto was by Agustin Rodríguez and José Sánchez-Arcilla, based on the novel \"Cecilia Valdés, o la Loma del Angel\" by Cirilo Villaverde. The storyline is about a tragedy of manners, love and revenge, in colonial Cuban society of the early 19th century.\n\n\nIn Villaverde's novel (completed in 1882), the melodramatic plot serves as a background for social life in Cuba, with slavery, injustice, crises and personal tragedies, following colorful presentation in detailed characterization and description, even to the point that plot itself loses its pace at times, long before reaching its climax, as if author had lost interest in his story and wanted to finish it as fast as possible.\n\nIn Roig's zarzuela, however, dramatic element is more exposed, more consistent and in swift action, presented as an interesting unrolling story pointing toward inevitable climax, which shows great talent and theatrical experience on the part of the composer, the piece containing mixture of traditional Cuban music, with all its genres, forms and vivid rhythms and dances, interlaced in good balance with predominantly romantic in style music of the Western tradition, particularly in melody and orchestration.\n\n\nA film based on the novel was produced in Cuba in 1982. The film stars Daisy Granados as Cecilia Valdés and Imanol Arias as Leonardo de Gamboa.\n\n\n"}

The game may be later adapted on the playground for early elementary students. The object of this game is to walk in a circle, tapping on each player's head until one is finally chosen; the chosen player must then chase the picker to avoid becoming the next picker.\n\nA group of players sit in a circle, facing inward, while another player, who is \"it\", walks around tapping or pointing to each player in turn, calling each a \"duck\" until finally calling one a \"goose\". The \"goose\" then rises and tries to tag the \"it\", while the \"it\" tries to return to and sit where the \"goose\" had been sitting before. If \"it\" succeeds, the \"goose\" becomes the \"it\" and the process begins again. If the \"goose\" tags the \"it\", the \"goose\" may return to their previous spot and the original \"it\" restarts the process.\n\nA variation described in the 1919 book, \"Entertaining Made Easy\" by Emily Rose Burt, has children standing in a circle, joining hands. The daisy picker goes around the outside, saying \"Daisy in the dell, I don't pick you … I do pick you.\"\n\n\"Duck, Duck, Gray Duck\" is a variation, consistent with the original Swedish translation, only played by Minnesotans. The core gameplay difference is that the picker taps the heads of the other players while duck calling (ex: blue duck, red duck, purple duck, etc. or more commonly just duck) and then calls \"gray duck\" or, less commonly, “duck duck gray duck” in place of \"goose\". In some regions and variations, the caller may change the direction in which they run.\n\n\"Drip, Drip, Drop\" is another version played by children mostly in warmer climates. One player who is \"it\" goes around the circle with a container of water and \"drips\" a small amount on each person's head. They will then select someone in the circle to \"drop\" the entire container on top of them. This player will then try to tag the \"it\" before the \"it\" sits in the spot of the person who got \"dropped\" on. If \"it\" is tagged then they will remain \"it\" for another round.\n\nA similar, common Afrikaner game is called \"vroteier\", meaning rotten egg. Instead of saying anything or pointing at anybody a token of some kind (usually a handkerchief) is carried by the one who is \"on\" going around the circle of sitting players. The token is then dropped behind one of the sitting players who are not allowed to look behind themselves, but can feel with their hands on the ground behind them. If the one behind whom the token has been dropped, discover it, they jumps up and chase the one who dropped the token. If the player who was \"on\" is caught and tagged, they will go sit in the center of the circle and become a rotten egg (vroteier) and the player who did the chasing becomes the next one to be \"on\". If the player who was \"on\" was chased all the way around the circle, they go and sit in the place of the player behind whom the token was dropped and that player is then the next one to be \"on\". If the player behind whom the token has been dropped does not become aware of it and the \"on\" player went all the way around the circle and catch the player on the ground with the token still behind them, the player so caught becomes another rotten egg to sit in the center. The \"on\" player remains \"on\", pick up the token again and repeat the process. The game can continue until there is only one person left who is not a rotten egg or more usually when the \"rotten eggs\" get tired of sitting in the center and demand to play another game.\n\nA similar game to Vroteier is known as \"Rumaal Chor\" in Hindi speaking regions of India and by other names in rest of Incia. A \"rumaal\" or handkerchief is thrown by the picker and the players have to constantly search behind them using their hands to search for the handkerchief.\n\n"}

While additional material was completed by Brian Denham, Mark Sparacio and Kelly Mellings based on the script by Ken Lillie-Paetz, the story remains unfinished.\n\nIn the first two issues, two pages were printed incorrectly, leaving the lettering out entirely. In issue 1, this didn't affect the plot. But did affect giving some insight to the main character of Dr. Murchison (who was not introduced until page 17 of issue 1).

It provides funds for the development, production and distribution of feature films, feature documentaries, short films, TV animation series and TV drama series.\n\nThe Board originally ran from 1980 to 1987. During this period it produced or co-produced \"Eat the Peach\", \"Anne Devlin (film)\", \"The Outcasts (1982)\", and \"Angel\". After its closure, the success of several externally funded Irish films, such as \"My Left Foot\", \"The Crying Game\" and \"The Commitments\" motivated local lobbyists to push for its re-establishment, which occurred in 1993.\nThe current Board was reconstituted under the Chairmanship of Lelia Doolan in 1993 by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht Michael D. Higgins who said “The whole reasoning behind my decision to develop the industry by means of a two-pronged approach — namely, the reactivation of the Irish Film Board and my proposals in relation to independent television production contained in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993 — is precisely to exploit the technical facilities available in Ireland at present and the imaginative and creative skills which exist in that industry which have been underemployed”\n\nFís Éireann/Screen Ireland\n\nOn 10 April 2018, at a press conference for the publication of Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027 (published as part of Project Ireland 2040) Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Josepha Madigan T.D., announced that from 18 June 2018, the agency would become known as Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland. The decision to change the name of the agency was announced in 2015, by then-Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys T.D., who said that the name-change “recognises the body’s increasing interests beyond the world of cinema and reminds us how, in this digital age, “film-makers” now rarely work in the medium of “film.” \n\nThe Board from 1993 to 2004 supported an indigenous industry which produced over 100 feature films many of which gained much success both critically and commercially. Irish film talent was recognized internationally and industry collaboration of Irish producers, writers and directors was well underway producing such work as \"Ailsa\" (1993), \"I Went Down\" (1997), \"About Adam\" (1999), \"Disco Pigs\" (2000), \"Bloody Sunday\" (2002), Intermission\" (2003), \"The Magdalene Sisters\" (2003), \"Omagh\" (2004), \"Man About Dog\" (2004), \"Adam & Paul\" (2004), \"Breakfast on Pluto\" (2005), \"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\" (2006) \"Once\" (2007), \"Garage\" (2007), \"The Secret of Kells\" (2009), \"His & Hers\" (2009) \"The Guard\" (2011), \"Albert Nobbs\" (2012), \"What Richard Did\" (2012), \"The Stag\" (2014), \"Calvary\" (2014), \"Song of the Sea\" (2014), \"The Lobster\" (2015), \"Brooklyn\" (2015), \"Room\" (2015) and other nationally and\ninternationally acclaimed films.\n\nNotable Irish box office successes for Irish film include \"Intermission\" which grossed over €2 million at Irish box office in 2003, \"Man About Dog\" which in 2004 grossed over €2.5 million at the Irish box office, \"The Guard\" which grossed over €18 million at the international box office and \"Brooklyn\" which has earned over €2 million at the Irish box office and €11 million at the US box office as of December 2015.\n\nIFB-funded productions to have featured at major international awards include \"Six Shooter\" (Best Live Action Short Film, Academy Awards 2006), \"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\" (Palme d’Or, Cannes Film Festival 2006), \"Once\" (Best Original Song, Academy Awards 2008), \"The Secret of Kells\" (nominated for Best Animated Feature, Academy Awards 2010), \"\" (Exceptional Merit in documentary Filmmaking, Emmy Awards 2013), \"Song of the Sea\" (nominated for Best Animated Feature, Academy Awards 2015), \"The Lobster\" (Jury Prize, Cannes Film Festival 2015), \"Room\" (People’s Choice Award, Toronto International Film Festival 2015), \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\", and \"The Breadwinne\"r among many others. \n\nFrom 1994–2004 there were high levels of international film production choosing Ireland as a location for filming as a result of the Irish tax incentive for film and television Section 35, which became Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidated Act, in 1999. Ireland was innovative in introducing a film production tax incentive making Ireland more competitive for film production than its international competitors. As a result of the high levels of incoming production into Ireland, the craft and skills base of Irish crews improved exponentially, and was then also available to work on Irish films. Major international films shot in Ireland during this period include \"Braveheart\" and \"Reign of Fire\".\n\nIn recent years Ireland has become the base for a number of high-end international TV dramas including \"The Tudors\" (2007-2010), \"Ripper Street\" (2012 – 2016), \"Penny Dreadful\" (2014 – 2016), \"Vikings\" (2013 – present), \"Into the Badlands\" (2017 – present), and \"Nightflyers\" (2018 – present).\n\nThe agency did not initially have a policy of funding Animation. In 1991, however, a group of animators and animation students established the \"Anamú Animation Base\", promoting the growth of independent Irish animation. Along with other groups, Anamú successfully lobbied for the film board to support animation projects. From the late 1990s, the film board has provided substantial support to Ireland's animation industry.\n\nThe current board was appointed in 2017, chaired by Dr Annie Doona, the President of Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Desigan and Technology (IADT) where the National Film School is located. The board consists of producer Katie Holly, the managing director of Blinder Films; Larry Bass, founder and CEO of ShinAwil Productions; Mark Fenton, founder and CEO of Masf Consulting; Rachel Lysaght, founder and lead creative producer of Underground Films; Kate McColgan, producer and managing director of Calico Productions and Marian Quinn, writer, director and founder of Janey Pictures.\n\nFís Éireann/Screen Ireland (FÉ/SI) is under the aegis of Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The annual budget for FÉ/SI is decided by Dáil Éireann and had a total capital budget of €14.03 million in 2015.

{"id": "44924530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44924530", "title": "Gamda Koor Sabra", "text": "Gamda Koor Sabra\n\nGamda Koor, also known as Sabra was an Israeli diecast toy company that specialized in 1:43 scale cars. Most of these seem to have been original offerings, not seen elsewhere and \"not secondary tooling\". The toy company Cragstan marketed Gamda Sabras as \"Detroit Juniors\" for the American Market.\n\nGamda was a toy brand name of the parent firm Habonim in Kibbutz Kfar HaNassi (Village of the President) located in Northern Israel, north of the Sea of Galilee and just adjacent to the border to the Golan Heights (Bickford 2013). The name 'Gamda' means 'midget' or 'dwarf' in Hebrew (thus 'Midget' toys)(Zohar 2005). In the 1967 Six Day War with Syria the factory was damaged and repairs were needed - production soon resumed (Model Marque 2010). Koor was a company name added later (see next section). The latter name 'Sabra' was applied to the mid-1960s diecast line of mostly American cars and was a uniquely nationalistic Israeli concept. This word for cactus signifies an Israeli Jew born anywhere in the historical land of Palestine. It is interesting that the name Sabra was also given to the Israeli real car brand from the mid-1960s. Thus the toy brand Gamda Sabra could be translated as \"Israeli-born midget toys\".\n\nIn 1962, the company started recasting old British D.C.M.T. (Lone Star Toys) dies of tractors, trucks and military vehicles (Bickford 2013; Johnson 1998, p. 81; Rixon 2005, p. 36). Gamda vehicles were produced in two series - transport (Jeepsters, Daimler, an American Buick, Ford Prefect, a Standard Vanguard delivery truck, buses, milk trucks, petrol tankers, etc.) or military (Jeeps, tanks, trucks, and trailers, etc.). One of the more popularly seen was a wheeled tank / armored car. One early Gamda offering that has become in demand is a bus in the livery of the Egged Ta'avura Cooperative, which was the main transportation agency in Israel. The bus has been known to sell for more than $1,000 (Zohar 2005).\n\nIn about 1966, Gamda partnered with another firm, Koor, which was owned by the Histradrut, the Israeli trade union (Schellekens 2003). This formed a company called Gamda Koor Export (Bickford 2013). The new company mainly existed to introduce a new line of mainly American automobiles aimed at foreign markets. At the time, export taxes had been lowered, helping Israeli businesses to break into international markets (Model Marque 2010). These were called Sabra Super Cars and were mainly unique tooling of vehicles not made by other European model makers. Most Sabras were manufactured between 1969 and 1972, but some perhaps a tad earlier (Richardson 1999, p. 161). \nThere were 24 models in the series and they were numbered from 8100 to 8123 (Schellekens 20003). Models included a 1965 Plymouth Barracuda, a 1966 Charger, a 1965 Chrysler Imperial convertible (Corgi Toys also offered a convertible Imperial, see comparison below), a 1966 Buick Riviera, a 1965 Corvette Coupe (not split window, but the convertible hardtop), a 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle station wagon, a 1966 Olds Toronado, a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado, a 1967 Cadillac Coupe deVille, a 1967 Pontiac GTO, a 1968 Pontiac Firebird, a 1967 Chevy pickup and tow truck, a 1965 Ford Mustang, a Ford GT, a 1967 Ford Torino, a 1966 Chevrolet Impala coupe, a 1967 Camaro, a 1967 Ford Thunderbird, a Volkswagen Beetle and a Jeep Willys. Models were often available in a stock, police, or taxi livery. Some of these, like the Barracuda, Charger, Torino and GTO are more rare and sought after.\n\nUnique to an Israeli product, models were often seen with United Nations markings, Israeli Army and Israeli Defense Force markings, the Star of David and Hebrew lettering (Rixon 2005, p. 37). Marketing emphasized Israeli desires to be accepted as a mainstream toy producer (if not a world class country) in the international market (Celebrate Rosh 2013; Zohar 2005). Markings on the cars were commonly transfer decals and not stickers. The Chevelle wagon was offered in UN (United Nations), IDF (International Defense Force), Israeli Army, Hassadah Medical ambulance, postal, Red Cross ambulance and fire chief liveries while the Impala was seen in several police guises and a couple of different taxi (monit) versions (Model Marque 2010; Rixon 2005, 37). The Jeep appeared with UN lettering. \n\nThe Charger could be had with the United Nations globe and wreath seal on the doors, while the Eldorado and Riviera were available as Israeli Ministerial cars with doors displaying the shield with the menorah. Some of the cars like the Corvair, Camaro and Riviera were even described on packaging as a \"tourist bureau car\" or \"Israeli President Car\". Some cars, especially the Beetle, came with 1970s style 'hippie' flower decals, but the Bug also came in a German (surprisingly, not Israeli !) police version.\n\nEarly Gamda Koor Sabra cars were marketed in a clear plastic box with a red 'garage door' to one end. The model in the box was secured on a yellow plastic base that incorporated a petrol pump at one end and a flap to hold the garage door closed. Clear boxes of the editions for the international market were backed with a white, red, and yellow card that said \"Sabra Super Car\" and included a collector coin and detail slip translated into twelve languages (Rixon 2005, p. 37; Celebrate Rosh 2013). Later cars had a darker blue card (Moncrief 2012). Later cars came with a cut-out puzzle for added play value (Moncrief 2012).\n\nLater, toy maker Cragstan wanted a piece of the diecast market that Corgi and Dinky had captured and enlisted Gamda Koor models for its international (and specifically American) sales. These models also used the garage door box, but often with a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme on the backing card and down the side of the box. Cragstan called its Sabra Super Cars, \"Detroit Seniors\". The Cragstan and Detroit Senior names were also molded into the plastic chrome bases of these cars. There were few differences between Sabra and Cragstan castings. One could be seen on the Chevelle wagon. The Chevrolet bow tie was shown on the sides behind the front wheel well, but on the Cragstan version it is missing. The Cragstan cars went for $1.49 in the US market, but did not bear the standard Israeli police, army and post symbols (Bickford 2013).\n\nThe Sabra line-up was unique in that many cars done by Gamda Koor in 1:43 scale were not attempted by manufacturers anywhere else (Goranson 2008). The Charger, Barracuda, Corvair, Impala, Cadillac and Riviera do not seem to be second-hand tooling from any other European manufacturer. Considering the uniqueness of the tooling and the Israeli presentation, the Sabra line comes off as fascinating and distinct in the world of miniature diecasts. Though the execution of the cars could have been better, the overall character and raison d'etre of these cars was lost on a famed Christie's auction house book whose authors simply called the Sabra cars \"...on the whole, not good\" with no other contextual comments (Richardson 1999, p. 161).\n\nThe Chrysler Imperial convertible, at first glance, appears to be a casting from Corgi Toys (no. 246), but even cursory inspection shows they are quite distinct. The Corgi is smaller and a more customary 1:43 scale while the Gamda is larger, probably about 1:40. Lines and trim are distinct - the Corgi has a crease line on hood and 'boot' missing from the Gamda, but the side profile of the Gamda appears more accurate. The metal of the Gamda body completely surrounds the windshield, while the Corgi is all plastic. Instead of having all features open, as the Corgi does, only the trunk opens on the Gamda, which was strange, but common on Sabra cars.\n\nThe Olds Toronado may be similar to the Tekno version, but considering the above, is probably not Tekno tooling. The Charger, Impala, Thunderbird and the Imperial are similar in that all have only trunks that open. The Barracuda, Riviera, Toronado, Corvair, Corvette, and Mustang all have opening doors. The Impala was, intriguingly, made in a two-door and a four-door version - the four-door appeared to just have an additional pillar added with four doors 'etched' (making the fit rather tight) in the metal. \n\nThe fidelity of the shapes to the real cars was good, but not excellent. Perhaps the Riviera's and Barracuda's proportions are the best, while the Charger looks a bit stretched. The roof of the Corvette is a bit squarish and the opening doors on the Corvair look rather roundish compared to body panels they are supposed to match. Body lines are not smooth, with sometimes gravelly and uneven edges. Many of these cars have front and rear bumpers that are part of diecast plastic bases. Being such, many times the bumpers do not match up well with the diecast metal bodies, leaving gaps, as with the Barracuda shown above. (Goranson 2008). Wheels were simple and unadorned indented silver metal discs with protruding axle ends. Some later cars had plastic five-spoke 'star' chrome wheels.\n\n"}

The basic rule is that the player scoops goldfish from a pool with a paper scooper called a \"poi\"\" and puts them into a bowl with the \"poi\". This game requires care and speed as the \"poi\" can tear easily. The game is over when the \"poi\" is completely broken or incapable of scooping properly. Even if one part of the \"poi\" is torn, the player can continue the game with the remaining part.\n\nAt \"ennichi\" or summer festival stalls, the game is not a competition. Participation typically costs around 100 yen and players can take the scooped goldfish home in a special bag provided by the stall keeper. The game is unlimited, so players can scoop until their \"pois\" are completely broken. If they cannot scoop any goldfish, the stall keeper may be kind enough to give them one or two free goldfish. Each stall usually has its own rules. For example, there are some stalls where players can get a stronger \"poi\" if they pay more. Other stalls give players special presents if they scoop a lot. In some variations, there are also medaka (Japanese killifish) that are faster and harder to catch than goldfish. Usually, for every four goldfish, there is one medaka, so in \"ennichi\", if you catch one, it counts as four goldfish.\n\nAt the National Goldfish Scooping Championship, players follow official rules that are different from the rules listed above.\n\nThe things necessary to scoop goldfish is a pool in which goldfish swim, a \"poi\", a bowl to keep the scooped goldfish, a special bag in which to take goldfish home, and the goldfish themselves.\n\nUsually, the goldfish are placed in a small plastic pool about 1m² and 20 cm (8\") depth.\nThe \"poi\" consists of a round plastic frame with a hand grip, and paper on the frame. The \"poi\" paper can break easily when put into water, so players should not move the \"poi\" too quickly. There are different classes of \"poi\" paper. is weaker, and is stronger. In some stalls, staff have unbreakable \"poi\" which consist of a net to scoop goldfish instead of paper.\n\nThe bowl is usually made of plastic in a semi-sphere shape with a capacity of about 1 gallon.\nThis is used to store the scooped goldfish.\n\nIf players get goldfish, they can take them home in special bags provided by the stall keeper.\nThe varieties of goldfish often used in goldfish scooping are \"Koaka\", \"Demekin\", and \"Anekin\".\nSee Goldfish.\n\nThis game started in the late Edo period, around 1810. In those days, \"pois\" were made with nets, and it was a game played by children. \"Pois\" came to be made with paper and stalls were started in the Taishō period, around 1910.\n\nThe game became more and more popular, and the National Goldfish Scooping Championship began in 1995. Today it is so popular that stalls can be found at many \"ennichi\" 縁日 \"summer festivals\" in Japan.\n\nVarious scooping game variants are found, including , , which features small jelly-like rubber balls, , which features bouncy balls, and , which features small plastic figurines in the shapes of various cartoon characters, particularly manga and anime.\n\nThe is the biggest official competition managed by the National Goldfish Scooping Association and Yamatokōriyama city in Nara Prefecture (Yamatokōriyama is famous for producing goldfish). It is held on the third Saturday and Sunday in August every year. In 2007, the 13th championship was held and 1116 people participated in it. It consisted of three sections:\n\nThere are area trials and the first and second in every section can participate in National Championship. Extraordinarily in the Nara trials, 60 people in the child section, 80 people in the ordinary section and 40 groups in the group section can participate. The rules are detailed and include the size of goldfish, poi and pool, and the number of umpires. Contestants compete for the number of goldfish scooped in three minutes. If the paper of \"poi\" is completely broken, the game is over and the score is the number of goldfish scooped until then.\n\nIn the tenth championship (2004) a player scooped 61 goldfish in three minutes in the semifinal. (This is a new high and that comes to the average of one goldfish per three seconds.) However she came in at the very bottom in the final.\n\nIn 2011, 2,400 players competed. The team title went to 3 players who scooped 173 goldfish.\n\n"}
{"id": "1848935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848935", "title": "Guaguancó", "text": "Guaguancó\n\nGuaguancó () is a subgenre of Cuban rumba, combining percussion, voices, and dance. There are two main styles: Havana and Matanzas.\n\n\nOther instruments may be used on occasion, for example spoons, palitos (wooden sticks striking the side of the drum), and tables and walls played like drums.\n\nRumba clave is the key pattern (guide pattern) used in guaguancó. There is some debate as to how the 4/4 rumba clave should be notated for guaguancó. In actual practice, the third and fourth stroke often fall in rhythmic positions that do not fit neatly into music notation. Triple-pulse strokes can be substituted for duple-pulse strokes. Also, the clave strokes are sometimes displaced in such a way that they don't fall within either a triple-pulse or duple-pulse \"grid\". Therefore, many variations are possible.\n\nThe guagua pattern (also known as palitos, or cáscara) contains all of the strokes of clave.\n\nThe following nine-measure excerpt is from the guaguancó “La polémica\" by Los Muñequitos de Matanzas (1988). This passage moves between the main modes of playing (A,B,C). The A section is the basic \"lock\" or \"ride\", as it is known in North America. It spans one clave (measure). An alternate phrase (B) is also one measure in length. Cross-beats, the basis of the third section (C), contradict the meter. By alternating between the lock and the cross, the quinto creates larger rhythmic phrases that expand and contract over several clave cycles. The great Los Muñequintos quintero Jesús Alfonso (1949–2009) described this phenomenon as a man getting \"drunk at a party, going outside for a while, and then coming back inside.\"\n\nThe term guaguancó originally referred to a narrative song style (coros de guaguancó) which emerged from the coros de claves of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rogelio Martínez Furé states: \"[The] old folks contend that strictly speaking, the guaguancó is the narrative.\" The guaguancó song often begins with the soloist singing meaningless syllables, which is called the \"diana\". According to Larry Crook, the diana is important because it \"... also contains the first choral refrain. The lead singer provides a phrase or motive for the choral sections, or they may present new, but related material. Parallel harmonies are usually built above or below a melodic line, with thirds, sixths, and octaves most common.\" Therefore, the singer who is presented with singing the diana initiates the beginning of the guaguancó. He then may proceed to improvise lyrics stating the reason for holding the present rumba ('decimar'; span.: to make ten-line stanzas), During the verses of the song the quinto is capable of sublime creativity, while musically subordinate to the lead vocalist. There are natural pauses in the cadence of the verses, typically one or two measures in length, where the quinto can play succinct phrases in the \"holes\" left by the singer. Once the chorus (or montuno section) of the song begins, the phrases of the quinto interact with the dancers more than the lead singer.\n\nGuaguancó is a couple dance of sexual competition between the male and female. The male periodically attempts to \"catch\" his partner with a single thrust of his pelvis. This erotic movement is called the vacunao (‘vaccination’ or more specifically ‘injection’), a gesture derived from yuka and makuta [dances], symbolizing sexual penetration. The vacunao can also be expressed with a sudden gesture made by the hand or foot. The quinto often accents the vacunao, usually as the resolution to a phrase spanning more than one cycle of clave. Holding onto the ends of her skirt while seductively moving her upper and lower body in contrary motion, the female \"opens\" and \"closes\"{ her skirt in rhythmic cadence with the music. The male attempts to distract the female with fancy (often counter-metric) steps, accented by the quinto, until he is in position to \"inject\" her. The female reacts by quickly turning away, bringing the ends of her skirts together, or covering her groin area with her hand (botao), symbolically blocking the \"injection.\" Most of the time the male dancer does not succeed in \"catching\" his partner. The dance is performed with good-natured humor—David Peñalosa.\n\nVernon Boggs states that the woman's \"dancing expertise resides in her ability to entice the male while skillfully avoiding being touched by his vacunao.\" See: \"Guaguancó performed by Los Munequitos De Matanzas\". Arcata Theatre, Arcata, CA 21 July 1992. The pattern of quinto strokes and the pattern of the man's dance steps are at times identical, and at other times, imaginatively matched. The quinto player must be able to switch phrases immediately in response to the dancer’s ever-changing steps. See: rumba dancer steps in tandem to quinto cross-beats at 3:09. \"Yambú\" by Conjunto Clave y Guaguancó. Víctor Quesada \"Tatín\" on quinto.\n\n"}

A musical tone is characterized by its duration, pitch, intensity (or loudness), and timbre (or quality). The notes used in music can be more complex than musical tones, as they may include aperiodic aspects, such as attack transients, vibrato, and envelope modulation.\n\nA simple tone, or pure tone, has a sinusoidal waveform. A complex tone is a combination of two or more pure tones that have a periodic pattern of repetition, unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe Fourier theorem states that any periodic waveform can be approximated as closely as desired as the sum of a series of sine waves with frequencies in a harmonic series and at specific phase relationships to each other. The common denominator frequency, which is also often the lowest of these frequencies is the fundamental frequency, and is also the inverse of the period of the waveform. The fundamental frequency determines the pitch of the tone, which is perceived by the human hearing. In music, notes are assigned to tones with different fundamental frequencies, in order to describe the pitch of played tones.\n\n\n"}

They later went into the business of minstrel troupe ownership with a refined, high-class approach that signaled the final stage in the development of minstrelsy as a distinct form of entertainment.\n\nIn 1877, Primrose and West were playing with a minstrel troupe owned by J. H. Haverly. That year, they both quit when their demands for more pay were not met. They formed their own company, which largely copied Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels with its elaborate sets and visual spectacle. The troupe proved so successful that in 1879, \"The Clipper\" gave them a front-page story, treatment normally reserved for famous actors and actresses.\n\nIn 1881, the pair became familiar with Sam Hague's British Minstrels, then on a U.S. tour. Primrose and West adopted Hague's techniques of ultra-refinement: Ballet and high-class music played by a large orchestra replaced low comedy and African American-themed song and dance as the main focus, and sets and costumes came to mimic fancy European powdered wigs and eveningwear. Only the (sometimes) blackfaced endmen kept the new troupe from severing its ties to minstrelsy completely. George Thatcher, one of the troupe members who became a partner of Thatcher, Primrose & West (and later had his own troupe), explained later that \"We were looking for novelty, and for a change tried white minstrelsy.\" When Milt Barlow left the troupe in 1882, Primrose and West did away with plantation and blackface material completely. In its place, audiences witnessed such upper-class pursuits as fox hunting, lawn tennis, and yacht racing. Primrose and West had a hit, and they came to be called \"The Millionaires of Minstrelsy\".\n\nStill, traditional blackface entertainers disliked the new approach. Lew Dockstader remarked that Primrose and Westhad refined all the fun out of it. Minstrelsy in silk stockings, set in square cuts and bag wigs is about as palatable as an amusement as a salad of pine shavings and sawdust with a little salmon, lobster, or chicken... What is really good is killed by the surroundings.Nevertheless, Primrose and West's approach caught on, and the blackface act continued only with minor troupes and as a regular fixture of vaudeville.\n\nGeorge Primrose was mentioned in song as \"Georgie Primrose\" during the 1954 movie \"White Christmas\".\n\n"}

It is one of the Rams group of card games that are distinguished by allowing players to drop out if they think they will fail to win the required number of tricks. An unusual feature of Ramsen is the presence of four permanent trump cards that rank just below the Trump Sow (often erroneously called the Trump Ace). It should not be confused with the contract of \"Ramsch\" in games like Skat or Schafkopf, nor with the related game of Rams which is also called \"Ramsen\" in Austria, but is played with a Piquet pack, does not have permanent trumps and has a different card ranking.\n\nRamsen appears to be at least 170 years old, there being a reference in an 1844 south German anthology to it being one of the card games that is \"fun\" and in which \"one does not have to think too much\". In 1877, the game is described as one of several which is \"popular with ordinary folk\" in Bavaria. \n\nRamsen is still taught and played in Bavaria today, for example, in Memmingen and Markt Rettenbach. It is described by Sirch as being suitable for adults and children alike.\n\nRamsen is a one of the Rams family of card games, the distinguishing feature of which is that players may choose to drop out of the current game if they think they will be unable to win any tricks or a minimum number of tricks.\n\nRamsen is a plain-trick game in which the aim is to win as many tricks as possible and be the first to complete the 2 crosses used for scoring. It may also be played for small stakes.\n\nRamsen is played with a 32-card, Bavarian pattern, German-suited pack with the suits of Acorns, Leaves or Grass, Hearts and Bells.\n\nThe ranking order of the cards within the plain suits is: Sow > King > Ober > Unter > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7. An unusual feature of Ramsen is the presence of four permanent trump cards that rank just below the Trump Sow:\n\n\nThus the ranking order of the trump suit (T = trump, A = Sow, etc.) is: TA > 9 > 7 > O > U > TK > TO > TU > T10 > T9 > T8 > T7.\n\nThe dealer shuffles the pack and rearhand cuts. Rearhand may keep (\"schlecken\", literally \"lap up\") the bottom card of the top stack, but will then only be dealt 4 cards. Otherwise players are dealt 5 cards as one packet of 3 and one packet of 2. The next card is flipped to determine the trump suit and the remainder placed face down next to it as the talon.\n\nEach player, in clockwise order beginning with forehand, may now exchange cards from the hand for cards in the talon. In addition, the dealer may exchange with the trump upcard. If rearhand has \"schleckt\" when cutting the pack, he may not exchange.\n\nEach player now reviews his cards and opts to \"play\" or \"pass\". If a player has exchanged, he must play. The reason a player may want to pass - and therefore not participate in the current deal - is that, if he takes no tricks, he is penalised by having to complete an additional cross (i.e. by taking an extra 5 tricks) in order to win the game.\n\nForehand leads to the first trick or, if he has passed, players play in order of positional seniority, beginning with forehand. Players must follow suit (\"Farbzwang\"), must play a trump if unable to follow suit (\"Trumpfzwang\") and, in doing either, must head the trick if possible (\"Stechzwang\"). If a player cannot follow suit or trump, he may throw in any card.\n\nBefore the game, two crosses (X X) are drawn for each player. For every trick won, a bar is drawn at the end of one of the arms of the crosses; for the 5th trick a bar is drawn horizontally across the middle of the cross (see diagram right). The first player to complete 2 crosses is the winner. If a player takes no tricks, he gets an extra cross to complete.\n\n\n"}

Blackwood in 1963, the house is passed to Christopher Milton after Mr. Blackwood is accused of murdering his wife. A couple of days later, Mr. Blackwood dies of a sudden heart attack though some in the town start rumors that he might have committed suicide. The police decide to close the case seeing there is no further evidence left. Shortly after acquiring the house, Milton inexplicably disappears in 1970 leaving no visible trace.\n\nThe player assumes the role of the house's next inhabitant, Michael Arthate, an author seeking seclusion to work on his next book. He moves in only to find that the house still echoes its horrible past quite literally as \"scratches\" are heard all around, particularly in the basement and fireplaces, and soon becomes more interested in researching the house's history than his writing.\n\nIn the end, it is revealed the scratches were being caused by Robin, the deformed son of James and Catherine, who was locked in the basement. Michael flees the house after this discovery, finishes his novel, and becomes a prolific novelist as a result from his encounter.\n\nOriginally, the player was supposed to use an amulet to kill Robin, turning him back into a human. They would themselves die if they weren't able to figure the puzzle out. Lead developer Agustin Cordes said the ending was \"completely unfair in terms of design,\" and it was subsequently abandoned.\n\nIn the Director's Cut edition of the game, a sidequest called \"The Last Visit\" continues the narration from where Michael had fled. A reporter is sent to uncover the mysteries of Blackwood Manor before it will be destroyed. The place has become a scene of ruin; full of looting, vandalism, and graffiti. The reporter ultimately discovers Robin, who chases him until Milton appears at the manor to speak with Robin. Robin leaps onto Milton and presumably kills him as the reporter escapes. Blackwood Manor is then demolished and the reporter notes that the mystery of a mask found inside the home remains unsolved.\n\nJames Thomas Blackwood: An eccentric gentleman, Mr. Blackwood had always been a prominent figure in Rothbury, his hometown since his childhood, being one of the most successful construction engineers in the region.\n\nCatherine Lydia Blackwood: James Blackwood's enigmatic wife, an English teacher at a local school in Rothbury.\n\nChristopher Edward Milton: An intimate friend and long-time doctor to the Blackwood family.\n\nEva Mariani: Miss Mariani, an Italian immigrant and aspiring professional photographer, was the Blackwood family's maid for several years.\n\nWilliam Bailey: Mr Bailey, a now-retired police chief, was in charge of the investigation of the death of Catherine Blackwood in the early 1960s. He was convinced of Mr Blackwood's guilt, but was never able to convict him.\n\nMichael Arthate: Michael is an up-and-coming writer. Sales of his acclaimed first novel, \"Vanishing Town\" (a reference to \"Dark Fall\"), left him with enough wealth to acquire an imposing Victorian mansion, a long-time dream of his.\n\nJerry P. Carter: An old friend of Michael, and a successful real estate agent.\n\nBarbara Stiles: Michael hired Barbara as his assistant to aid him with fan mail and to contact magazines around the world, offering them his short stories.\n\nRobin Blackwood: The son of James and Catherine Blackwood who was kept hidden from the public due to his deformities.\n\n\"Scratches\" uses a first person perspective to navigate around the house. Using only a mouse, the player can access various rooms and other places in order to solve the mystery of both Blackwood and Milton's disappearances. It features music and special sound effects by the now defunct Cellar of Rats, which contribute to the fearsome ambience experienced at the mansion, crypt, greenhouse and church.\n\nThe game is heavily influenced by the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and several direct references to Lovecraft works make their appearances in \"Scratches\". There are in-game references to the Necronomicon, De Vermis Mysteriis, Lovecraft's story \"The Mountains of Madness,\" as well as one critics of Michael's book being called R'yleh. Michael states in the game he had just moved to Rothbury from Providence, Rhode Island-the hometown of Lovecraft.\n\n\"Scratches\" was first released in North America on March 8, 2006 through game publisher Got Game Entertainment. However, Nucleosys had plans to release several international versions of the game worldwide.\n\nA German version of the game has been available since March 2006 (published by Rondomedia), as has the Italian version \"Graffi Mortali\" (published by Power Up). A Greek version of the game is also available.\n\nA Russian version of the game has been available since May 2006 (published by Russobit-M).\n\nThe Spanish version of the game (\"Rasguños\") was announced but was never completed.\n\nNucleosys in 2007 released a \"Director's Cut\" version of Scratches, which includes an alternate ending and two more hours of gameplay. In addition to remastered sound, graphics and more.\n\nThere were plans to create a Directors Commentary with a few additional features but as a result of Nucleosys shutdown, it will not be released.\n\nVersions for Linux and Mac OS X were planned, but were never released before the demise of the developer.\n\nGlobally, \"Scratches\" sold more than 150,000 units by March 2007. By 2012, sales had reached roughly 250,000 units.\n\nScratches received mixed reviews but overall achieved an average to high score from most review sites. Most notably GameSpot gave the game a 3.9 and IGN gave it a 7.7, emphasising the game's mixed reviews.\n\nAfter Nucleosys went out of business, Agustín Cordes would go on to found Senscape, who are currently developing the horror game \"Asylum\" after a successful Kickstarter crowd funding campaign.\n\n"}
{"id": "20043356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20043356", "title": "Silver Streak (comics)", "text": "Silver Streak (comics)\n\nSilver Streak is a fictional superhero character created by Joe Simon that first appeared in \"Silver Streak Comics\" #3 (cover-dated March 1940), from Lev Gleason Publications. He is believed to be the second-ever comic book superhero whose primary power is speed; All-American Publications' The Flash preceded him by two months. However, Silver Streak beat out National Allied Publications' Johnny Quick (who debuted in 1941) as the first superhero whose two powers were speed and flight. Silver Streak has a kid sidekick called \"Mercury\" (soon changed to \"Meteor\"); he is also assisted by a hawk named \"Whiz\".\n\n\"Silver Streak Comics\" was originally published by Arthur Bernhardt’s Rhoda Publications, and the title was inspired by Bernhardt's car, a Pontiac Silver Streak. With issue #3, the title was taken over by Lev Gleason Publications and Silver Streak himself first appeared. \n\nSilver Streak appeared in \"Silver Streak Comics\" until issue #19 (March 1942); the title itself ended with #22, and was renamed \"Crime Does Not Pay\". Also during this run, Silver Streak appeared in Lev Gleason's \"Daredevil\" #1.\n\nIn 1945, Silver Streak appeared in the one and only issue of \"Dime Comics\", and then in the 23rd and final issue of the briefly revived \"Silver Streak Comics\". Since then, this character has fallen into the public domain. In 2008, he appeared in issue #141 of \"The Savage Dragon\", along with a score of other Golden Age heroes.\n\nIn 2008, Silver Streak appeared in flashbacks in issue #0 of Dynamite Entertainment’s \"Project Superpowers\", a title that uses mostly public domain Golden Age characters. In the one-shot \"Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude\". He later appeared in the related Dynamite miniseries \"The Death-Defying ’Devil\".\n\nEditor Erik Larsen's \"Next Issue Project\" (Image Comics) published \"Silver Streak Comics\" \"#24\" (Dec. 2009). Silver Streak = appeared in one story, written and illustrated by Paul Grist.\n\nIn 1940, a taxicab driver (name unknown) was hypnotized by a mysterious swami (name unknown) into working for him as a race car driver; all of the swami’s previous drivers had been killed by giant insects, sent by a mad scientist named Dr. Katan. The cab driver was killed as well, but the swami used his mystical powers to bring him back to life, after which he gave the resurrected driver an injection of a “secret fluid” that gave him super-speed and the power of flight. Motivated by a strong desire to make the world a better place, he donned a colorful costume and fought against crime, Nazi spies, and The Claw, calling himself “Silver Streak” after the race car he was killed in. He had changed costumes a few times over the years, but one detail that remained constant was the arrowhead-shaped emblem on his chest with the shape-fitting “SS” inside it. (Curiously, most of his costumes had no silver coloring anywhere on them.)\n\nHe later learned that anyone who receives a transfusion of his blood gains super-speed; he gave this gift to a pet hawk named Whiz, and to a kid sidekick named Mickey O’Toole who first called himself \"Mercury\" but quickly changed it to \"Meteor.\"\n\nIn \"Silver Streak Comics\" #5 (June, 1940), Jack Cole, who by this time was writing and drawing the character's adventures, directly addressed the readers and explained the hero’s motivations:\n\nAt some point after World War II, Silver Streak and other heroes were imprisoned in the mystical Urn of Pandora by the misguided Fighting Yank. Decades later the Urn was broken and the heroes released; Silver Streak emerged (wearing a red and silver costume similar to his original one) just in time to aid his former ally The Death-Defying ’Devil against a terrorist attack. Exactly what part this hero will play in the modern world remains to be seen.\n\nThe Metahuman Press serial \"Living Legends\" has introduced a new version of Silver Streak. This character is an Asian female, native to the fictional city of Riccapoor, home of The Claw.\n\n"}

It is available on Android, iOS, Kindle, and Windows Phone platforms and uses the Unity game engine. Players take the role of young graffiti artists who, upon being caught in the act of applying graffiti to (\"tagging\") a metro railway site, run down railroad tracks to escape from an inspector and his dog. As they run, they grab gold coins out of the air while simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects, and can also jump on top of the trains to evade capture. Special events, such as the Weekly Hunt, can result in in-game rewards and characters.\n\n\"Subway Surfers\" was released on 24 May 2012 with updates based on seasonal holidays. Since January 2013, updates have been based on a \"World Tour\" theme, which updates the setting of the game every three (or four, usually for seasonal holidays) weeks.\n\nIn 2017, \"Subway Surfers\" was the most downloaded game across the globe.\n\nIn March 2018, \"Subway Surfers\" became the first game on the Google Play Store to cross the one billion downloads threshold. In May 2018, \"Subway Surfers\" crossed the two billion download mark.. App Annie reported \"Subway Surfers\" as the #2 downloaded game of all time in iOS App Store.\n\nIn addition to the mobile game, SYBO Games introduced the \"Subway Surfers\" animated series and \"SUBSURF\" lifestyle brand.\n\n\"Subway Surfers\" is an endless runner video game. The game starts by tapping the touchscreen, while the character sprays graffiti on a train. The inspector and his dog start chasing. While running, the player can swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles especially moving trains, poles, tunnel walls and barriers. By swapping rapidly as speed increases, more points can be acquired. A crash results in a game over. The player can collect various items such as coins, score multipliers, sprinting sneakers, jetpacks, magnets, gift boxes and scooters. A scooter provides combustion by launching up the player, while a jetpack has ability to fly for 10 seconds. Items, such as a hoverboard, allow avoiding collisions lasting about 30 seconds. Daily Challenges and Weekly Hunts give rewards for unique movements throughout gameplay. Missions have various tasks measured by player accuracy. Up to 14 characters are unlocked via in-game purchase and collecting specific items, but the character \"Dino\" is only unlocked by connecting a Facebook account.\n\n\"Subway Surfers\" received decent reviews. Critics praised the game's visual style and entertaining gameplay, but criticized it for its monotonous world and unresponsive controls. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the game 71 out of 100 based on 8 reviews.\n\nDan Griliopoulos of \"Pocket Gamer\" gave the game a score of 5 out of 10, praising the game's fun gameplay and free access, but criticizing the game's controls and parsimonious game design.\n\nGamezebo's Dant Rambo scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing \"It makes little attempt to stand out from other endless runners, but it's hard not to appreciate the polish of \"Subway Surfers\". The controls are responsive, the gameplay is addictive, and it doesn't try and force you into spending cash on in-game items.\"\n\nOther reviewers were not as critical. \"148Apps\" and \"TouchArcade\" gave the game 4/5. Reviewers from \"The Apps Depot\" and \"AppleNApps\" were impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5.\n\nOn June 1, 2018, a series of animated shorts debuted on SYBO Games' YouTube channel. \nThe 10 x 4 minute episodic series is scripted by Brent Friedman and Francesca Marie Smith and produced by Sander Schwartz.

{"id": "5286022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5286022", "title": "Superman (comic strip)", "text": "Superman (comic strip)\n\nSuperman was a daily newspaper comic strip which began on January 16, 1939, and a separate Sunday strip was added on November 5, 1939. These strips ran continuously until May 1966. In 1941, the McClure Syndicate had placed the strip in hundreds of newspapers. At its peak, the strip, featuring Superman, was in over 300 daily newspapers and 90 Sunday papers, with a readership of over 20 million.\n\nDuring the \"National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications\" court case, the District Court ruled that McClure Syndicate failed to place the copyright notice on some of the strips and thus those strips are in the public domain.\n\nThe daily strip was host to many storylines, unique from the regular Superman comic series. The early years consisted of Siegel-era Superman stories, many of which have yet to be republished. The strips contained the first appearance of a bald Lex Luthor, the first appearance of Mr. Mxyzptlk and the first telephone booth costume change in comics. Other stories of note include Superman saving Santa Claus from the Nazis, World War II-era stories of Superman protecting the American home front and Clark Kent marrying Lois Lane. The artwork includes runs by famed Superman artists Wayne Boring and Curt Swan.\n\nMr. Mxyzptlk was first created to appear in the \"Superman\" #30 (September 1944) story, \"The Mysterious Mr. Mxyztplk\". But due to the publishing lag time, the daily strip team of writer Whitney Ellsworth and artist Wayne Boring saw what had been created for issue #30, and were able to use him first in the daily strip story “The Mischievous Mr. Mxyzptlk” published from February 21, 1944 to July 19, 1944. So Mr. Mxyzptlk was not created for, but first published in the \"Superman\" daily strip. And while published second, Mr. Mxyztplk was first created for \"Superman\" issue #30 and first written by Jerry Siegel and drawn and inked by Ira Yarborough.\n\n\"Superman\" appeared in the newspapers again in 1978, with the newspaper strip \"The World's Greatest Superheroes\", which was retitled in his name in 1982 and lasted until 1985. Between these two comic strip series, Superman appeared in almost 12,000 unique newspaper strips.\n\nOver the years, there have been a number of different writers and artists on the \"Superman\" newspaper strips. Originally, the strip was drawn by Joe Shuster. As Superman became more and more popular and the workload kept increasing, Shuster turned over many duties to his studio assistants. Paul Cassidy was the first in a line of ghost artists on the strip and took over the inking and detail work in 1939. In September 1940, Leo Nowak replaced Cassidy on the strip. Other assistants during this time included Dennis Neville, John Sikela (beginning in 1940), Ed Dobrotka (beginning in 1941), Paul J. Lauretta, and Jack Burnley (beginning in 1941). Sikela and Dobrotka often traded penciling and inking duties between each other. Lauretta primarily inked and did backgrounds on the strips. Burnley eventually left to work on his own comic book, \"Starman\", but did return to pencil the \"Superman\" Sundays in 1943. The \"Superman\" strips during this early period of shop work was a team effort with multiple artists working on different parts of the same strip.\n\nThis early period ended with the start of World War II. Jerry Siegel, the main writer, was drafted in 1943. Early that same year, Leo Nowak and John Sikela were drafted as well. In 1943, Stan Kaye took over the inking. Wayne Boring, who had been another early assistant to Joe Shuster, left the Shuster studio in 1942 to directly draw the daily strip for DC. Boring and Kaye dominated the daily strip’s artwork throughout most of the 1940s. The two also provided art for the Sunday strip between 1940 and 1966.\n\nIn the middle of 1949, Win Mortimer took over the daily strip from Wayne Boring. Stan Kaye continued inking Mortimer’s work until Kaye temporarily left, and Mortimer inked his own work until he left DC in 1956 to publish his \"David Crane\" strip. Curt Swan took over the daily strip on June 18, 1956, along with Stan Kaye. Swan continued on the strip until November 12, 1960.\n\nAs for the stories in the \"Superman\" strips, Jerry Siegel originally wrote them until he was drafted in 1943. Whitney Ellsworth, who had begun on the strip in 1941, continued until 1945. Jack Schiff began his writing on the strip in 1942 and worked on the strip off and on until 1962.\n\nAlvin Schwartz first started writing for the \"Superman\" strip in October 1944. Between 1947 and 1951, Schwartz was the only writer on the \"Superman\" strip, and he continued on the strip until 1958. Bill Woolfolk wrote one story for the dailies in 1953.\n\nIn 1959, Bill Finger started scripting stories, and he worked through the series' end in 1966. During this final period, Jerry Siegel resumed his duties writing some stories.\n\n\"Lois Lane, Girl Reporter\" was a newspaper comic strip and topper to the \"Superman\" comic strip, featuring Superman's supporting character Lois Lane. \"Lois Lane\" accompanied the \"Superman\" Sunday strip in the \"Cleveland Plain Dealer\", running irregularly between October 24, 1943, and February 27, 1944; a total of twelve \"Lois Lane\" topper strips were produced. \n\nMcClure Syndicate, concerned and fearing newspapers would cancel the popular \"Superman\" strip if it could not appear regularly and on time, appealed to DC to instead create a spin-off strip, \"Lois Lane, Girl Reporter\", for McClure to use as a filler material for newspaper syndication.\n\n"}
{"id": "16728403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16728403", "title": "Swing (jazz performance style)", "text": "Swing (jazz performance style)\n\nIn music, the term swing has two main uses. Colloquially, it is used to describe the sense of propulsive rhythmic \"feel\" or \"groove\" created by the musical interaction between the performers, especially when the music creates a \"visceral response\" such as feet-tapping or head-nodding (see pulse). The term is also used more specifically, to refer to a technique (most commonly associated with jazz but also used in other genres) that involves alternately lengthening and shortening the pulse-divisions in a rhythm.\n\nLike the term \"groove\", which is used to describe a cohesive rhythmic \"feel\" in a funk or rock context, the concept of \"swing\" can be hard to define. Indeed, some dictionaries use the terms as synonyms: \"Groovy ... denotes music that really swings.\" The \"Jazz in America\" glossary defines it as \"when an individual player or ensemble performs in such a rhythmically coordinated way as to command a visceral response from the listener (to cause feet to tap and heads to nod); an irresistible gravitational buoyancy that defies mere verbal definition.\"\n\nSwing has been called \"the most debated word in jazz\". When jazz performer Cootie Williams was asked to define it, he joked, \"Define it? I'd rather tackle Einstein's theory!\" When Louis Armstrong was asked on the Bing Crosby radio show what swing was, he said, \"Ah, swing, well, we used to call it syncopation—then they called it ragtime, then blues—then jazz. Now, it's swing. Ha! Ha! White folks, yo'all sho is a mess.\" Benny Goodman, the 1930s-era bandleader nicknamed the \"King of Swing\", called swing \"free speech in music\", whose most important element is \"the liberty a soloist has to stand and play a chorus in the way he feels it\". His contemporary Tommy Dorsey gave a more ambiguous definition when he proposed that \"Swing is sweet and hot at the same time and broad enough in its creative conception to meet every challenge tomorrow may present.\" Boogie-woogie pianist Maurice Rocco argues that the definition of swing \"is just a matter of personal opinion\". When asked for a definition of swing, Fats Waller replied, \"Lady, if you gotta ask, you'll never know.\"\n\nTreadwell stated:\nStanley Dance, in \"The World of Swing\", devoted the two first chapters of his work to discussions of the concept of swing with a collection of the musicians who played it. They described a kinetic quality to the music. It was compared to flying; \"take off\" was a signal to start a solo. The rhythmic pulse continued between the beats, expressed in dynamics, articulation, and inflection. Swing was as much in the music anticipating the beat, like the swing of a jumprope anticipating the jump, as in the beat itself. Swing has been defined in terms of formal rhythmic devices, but according to the Jimmie Lunceford tune, \"T'aint whatcha do, it's the way thatcha do it\" (say it so it swings).\n\nIn swing rhythm, the pulse is divided unequally, such that certain subdivisions (typically either eighth note or sixteenth note subdivisions) alternate between long and short durations. Certain music of the Baroque and Classical era is played using \"notes inégales\", which is analogous to swing. In shuffle rhythm, the first note in a pair may be twice (or more) the duration of the second note. In swing rhythm, the ratio of the first note's duration to the second note's duration can take on a range of magnitudes. In traditional jazz, swing is typically applied to eighth notes. In other genres, such as funk and jazz-rock, swing is often applied to sixteenth notes.\n\nIn most jazz music, especially of the big band era and later, the second and fourth beats of a 4/4 measure are emphasized over the first and third, and the beats are lead-in—main-beat couplets (dah-DUM, dah-DUM...). The \"dah\" anticipates, or leads into, the \"DUM.\" The \"dah\" lead-in may or may not be audible. It may be occasionally accented for phrasing or dynamic purposes. The first note of each pair is often understood to be twice as long as the second, implying a triplet feel, but in practice the ratio is less definitive and is often much more subtle. \n\nThe instruments of a swing rhythm section express swing in different ways from each other, and the devices evolved as the music developed. During the early development of swing music, the bass was often played with lead-in—main-note couplets, often with a percussive sound. Later, the lead-in note was dropped but incorporated into the physical rhythm of the bass player to help keep the beat \"solid.\" Similarly, the rhythm guitar was played with the lead-in beat in the player's physical rhythm but inaudible. The piano was played with a variety of devices for swing. Chord patterns played in the rhythm of a dotted-eight—sixteenth couplet were characteristic of boogie-woogie playing (sometimes also used in boogie-woogie horn section playing). The \"swing bass\" left hand, used by James P. Johnson, Fats Waller, and Earl Hines, used a bass note on the first and third beats, followed by a mid-range chord to emphasize the second and fourth beats. The lead-in beats were not audible, but expressed in the motion of the left arm. Swing bass piano also put the first and third beats a role anticipatory to the emphasized second and fourth beats in two-beat figures. As swing music developed, the role of the piano in the ensemble changed to emphasize accents and fills; these were often played on the lead-in to the main beat, adding a punch to the rhythm. Count Basie's style was sparse, played as accompaniment to the horn sections and soloists. The bass and snare drums started the swing era as the main timekeepers, with the snare usually used for either lead-ins or emphasis on the second and fourth beats. It was soon found that the high-hat cymbal could add a new dimension to the swing expressed by the drum kit when played in a two-beat \"ti-tshhh-SH\" figure, with the \"ti\" the lead-in to the \"tshhh\" on the first and third beats, and the \"SH\" the emphasized second and fourth beats. With that high-hat figure, the drummer expressed three elements of swing: the lead-in with the \"ti,\" the continuity of the rhythmic pulse between the beats with the \"tshhh,\" and the emphasis on the second and fourth beats with the \"SH\". Early examples of that high-hat figure were recorded by the drummer Chick Webb. Jo Jones carried the high-hat style a step further, with a more continuous-sounding \"t'shahhh-uhh\" two beat figure while reserving the bass and snare drum for accents. The changed role of the drum kit away from the heavier style of the earlier drumming placed more emphasis on the role of the bass in holding the rhythm.\n\nHorn sections and soloists added inflection and dynamics to the rhythmic toolbox, \"swinging\" notes and phrases. One of the characteristic horn section sounds of swing jazz was a section chord played with a strong attack, a slight fade, and a quick accent at the end, expressing the rhythmic pulse between beats. That device was used interchangeably or in combination with a slight downward slur between the beginning and the end of the note. Similarly, section arrangements sometimes used a series of triplets, either accented on the first and third notes or with every other note accented to make a 3/2 pattern. Straight eighth notes were commonly used in solos, with dynamics and articulation used to express phrasing and swing. Phrasing dynamics built swing across two or four measures or, in the innovative style of tenor saxophonist Lester Young, across odd sequences of measures, sometimes starting or stopping without regard to place in the measure.\n\nThe rhythmic devices of the swing era became subtler with bebop. Bud Powell and other piano players influenced by him mostly did away with left-hand rhythmic figures, replacing them with chords. The ride cymbal played in a \"ting-ti-ting\" pattern took the role of the high-hat, the snare drum was mainly used for lead-in accents, and the bass drum was mainly used for occasional \"bombs.\" But the importance of the lead-in as a rhythmic device was still respected. Drummer Max Roach emphasized the importance of the lead-in, audible or not, in \"protecting the beat.\" Bebop soloists rose to the challenge of keeping a swinging feel in highly sophisticated music often played at a breakneck pace. The groundbreakers of bebop had come of age as musicians with swing and, while breaking the barriers of the swing era, still reflected their swing heritage.\n\nThe subtler end of the range involves treating written pairs of adjacent eighth notes (or sixteenth notes, depending on the level of swing) as slightly asymmetrical pairs of similar values. On the other end of the spectrum, the \"dotted eighth – sixteenth\" rhythm, consists of a long note three times as long as the short. Prevalent \"dotted rhythms\" such as these in the rhythm section of dance bands in the mid-20th century are more accurately described as a \"shuffle\"; they are also an important feature of baroque dance and many other styles. Rhythms identified as swung notes most commonly fall somewhere between straight eighths and a quarter-eighth triplet pattern.\n\nIn jazz, the swing ratio typically lies somewhere between 1:1 and 3:1, and can vary considerably. Swing ratios in jazz tend to be wider at slower tempos and narrower at faster tempos. In jazz scores, swing is often assumed, but is sometimes explicitly indicated. For example, \"Satin Doll\", a swing era jazz standard, was notated in time and in some versions includes the direction, \"medium swing\".\n\nSwing is commonly used in blues, country, and jazz, and often appears in other genres such as rock, funk, and hip-hop. Much written music in jazz is assumed to be performed with a swing rhythm. Styles that always use traditional (triplet) rhythms, resembling \"hard swing\", include foxtrot, quickstep and some other ballroom dances, Stride piano, and 1920s-era Novelty piano (the successor to Ragtime style).\n\n\n\n"}

It is the most popular legal form of gambling in Thailand.\n\nAround 19.2 of 67 million Thais played the government lottery, spending 76 billion baht (US$2.3 billion) in 2014, according to the Family Network Foundation's Secretary Wanchai Boonpracha. Unlike in most countries, where the government licenses and monitors the lottery business, the Thai GLO itself prints and sells the tickets to wholesalers. The strict laws that forbid other gambling activities results in the GLO pocketing 28% of lottery profits for state use.\n\nAs the government lottery is a public concern and is a source of state revenue, it was made a state enterprise with a legal identity. The Government Lottery Office Act B.E. 2517 was enacted on 11 September 1974, and became effective on 1 October 1974.\n\nLottery tickets were first issued in the reign (1868–1910) of King Rama V. At that time the king granted the Royal Bodyguard permission to operate a lottery on the occasion of his birthday in 1874. Lotteries were then held intermittently until 1933 when they became a standard government revenue source. Over the years the price of lottery ticket has climbed from one baht to its present official price of 80 baht, although that price has been seldom observed, a surcharge invariably being added.\n\nThe military government that took power in May 2014 has made lottery reform one of its priorities. Starting 16 June 2015, the military government has mandated that the price of a lottery ticket will not exceed 80 baht. Starting 1 August 2015, what is commonly called the \"jackpot\" or bonus first prize of 22 or 30 million baht will be eliminated.\n\nIn Thailand, women play the lottery more than men by a small margin (52.6 against 47.4%). Lottery gamblers tended to be drawn from working age brackets: 21–30 years (28.2%), 31–40 years (30.2%), and 41–50 years (21.8%). Almost two-thirds of lottery gamblers in Thailand (61.3%) were in low income bracket, earning almost a quarter less than the average monthly salary.\n\nUntil October 2015, from the GLO printing press to the ticket consumer, Thai government lottery tickets were bought and sold in a multi-tiered market. The GLO sold lottery tickets to national wholesalers, commonly referred to as \"brokers\". Brokers then sold on to the nation's 14,760 registered retail vendors who in turn sold to the public.\n\nIn September 2015 the government announced a new paradigm for the sale of lottery tickets. Lottery vendors will be able to buy lottery tickets directly from GLO under a scheme to reduce the high price of lottery tickets. Direct purchase is available only through Krung Thai Bank. Vendors must first register with the GLO and must open bank accounts for payment of their purchases. The new arrangement will go into effect with the 16 October 2015 drawing. Vendors are allowed to purchase from 5–50 books at the price of 70.40 baht for a pair of tickets. Each book includes 100 ticket-pairs. What is not clear how this will reduce the price of lottery tickets as under the old scheme vendors paid the same price (70.40 baht) to ticket wholesalers. The new scheme will increase the number of lottery tickets for sale by 7-8 million.\n\nFor decades, the Thai public blamed brokers, the so-called \"five tigers\" (as tigers only \"eat and sleep\"), for monopolising the lottery trade and for causing overpricing problems. The GLO, doing nothing to dispel this myth, maintained that five groups controlled the distribution of lottery tickets to local vendors throughout the country. However, in late-2014 ThaiPublica used the freedom of information act to force the GLO to divulge information about ticket allocation. The results show that the Thai public was misled about the existence of the \"five tigers\" in that there are many more than five, and that the biggest tiger of all is the GLO Foundation, a purpose-made mechanism designed to oversee the allocation of money to charities.\n\nAs of 25 December 2014, of the 74 million lottery tickets printed for the bi-weekly lottery, 22.74 million or 30.7% of them were allotted to 10 organisations. The GLO Foundation is the biggest recipient, having a fixed quota of 9,213,500 tickets. Other fixed ticket quotas as of that date were:\n\nIn May 2015 the GLO board adjusted the lottery price structure under which 60% of the revenue earned by the GLO is allocated for prize money. The revenue sent by the GLO to the treasury will be cut from 23% to 20% with the difference go to the GLO as management fees. Three percent will be allocated to set up a fund for social activities, 2% as a discount for foundations, associations, and organizations, and 12% as a discount for retailers or lottery vendors.\n\nUnder this new arrangement, retail agents will receive a quota of five books of lottery tickets (one book contains 100 tickets) at a cost of 70.40 baht per lottery ticket. Foundations, associations, and organisations will retain their quotas at the cost price of 68.80 baht per ticket.\n\nMaj Gen Apirat Kongsompong, chairman of the GLO board. said that, under this new pricing, retailers will make a profit of 9.60 baht per ticket and they will make 10,000 baht profit each month from two fortnightly draws. He has said that selling lottery tickets \"...is not a job...\" and should be treated as supplementary career. Vendors should find a second job to make extra earnings.\"If they have to find something to do in their village, they should...be a farmer.\"\n\nSeveral Thai governments, including the present one, have proclaimed their intent to supplement the existing distribution system with automated lottery ticket machines. The proposal is contentious, opposed by, among others, moralists who contend that it would corrupt Thai children. Vanchai Ariyabuddhiphongs, a management professor at Bangkok University who studies the gambling issue, questions whether the machines would corrupt Thai children given how prevalent gambling already is. \"Thai people are Buddhists, which means they're supposed to observe the five precepts,\" said Vanchai, including abstaining from alcohol and sexual misconduct. \"But they drink a lot, gamble, frequent brothels. Come to Bangkok, there are massage parlors all over, which are brothels in disguise. I don't really buy the moral argument here.\"\n\nLottery tickets are sold to national wholesalers who then sell them on to local retailers. Tickets are available only from retail agents. Lottery vendors can be found roaming markets, streets, and villages carrying their signature slim wooden ticket briefcases. There are also lottery ticket stands outside shops such as Tesco Lotus and Big C. Lottery tickets come in \"ticket-pairs\". The official cost of a single ticket is 40 baht, but lottery tickets can only be purchased in ticket-pairs, making the official retail price 80 baht.\n\nIn practice, the official price is almost always marked up. Street vendors might ask 120-130 baht for a ticket-pair. At stands outside shops 100 baht is a common price. Prices can vary by ticket-pair. Unpopular numbers are cheaper—85, 90, or 95 baht—while lucky Buddhist number combinations cost more. As is often the case in Thailand, lottery ticket prices above the 80 baht threshold are negotiable.\n\nSince last summer's lottery reforms, it has been illegal to inflate ticker-pair prices above the 80 baht threshold. Though marked-up prices from street vendors are still commonplace, the ongoing crackdown has created significant difficulties to ticket sellers.\n\nThere are two types of Thai lottery tickets. The first is the Thai Government Lottery (TGL) ticket. The second is the Thai Charity Lottery (TCL) ticket. These titles are printed at the upper left of each ticket. Aside from the names, the two differ only in their first prize payouts and the amount of tax to be paid on winnings. TGL tickets have a first prize of three million baht, a bonus prize of 30 million*, and are taxed at 0.5%. TCL tickets have a first prize of three million baht, a bonus prize of 22 million*, and are taxed at 1%.\n\nThai lottery tickets, whether TGL or TCL, are pre-printed, include a number of anti-counterfeiting features, and can only be purchased in \"ticket-pairs\". Each individual ticket is priced at 40 baht, and the ticket-pair at 80 baht. Single tickets are not sold, only ticket-pairs.\n\nEach ticket in a ticket-pair is identical except for:\n\nOn the verso of each ticket is the schedule of prizes, ancillary information, and conditions.\n\nTen \"guests\" unaffiliated with the lottery attend each drawing to act as official witnesses. Drawings are held at GLO headquarters on the first and sixteenth of every month. Should either of these dates fall on a holiday, the draw is postponed to the next day. All drawings are televised from 15:00 to 16:00 on the day of the draw. The following procedure is followed:\n\n\n\nFirst prize for all six correct numbers is 2 million baht (TGL) or 3 million baht (TCL) per ticket. As tickets are sold in pairs, the published prize amount is doubled. Doubling applies to all prizes except for the 22 million and 30 million baht bonus prizes. There are five second prizes of 100,000 baht, ten third prizes of 40,000, fifty prizes of 20,000 for fourth, one hundred 10,000 baht prizes for fifth and a 50,000 baht consolation prize for the six-digit winning number plus or minus one.\n\nLottery drawings on the first and sixteenth of each month are televised on National Broadcasting Services of Thailand and Spring News starting at 14:30 on Spring News and 15:00 on NBT also simulcast on Radio Thailand Domestic Service. in 2016 the draw also simulcasted on Thairath TV starting from 14:00. Towards the end of the show, just before 16:00, the winning numbers are displayed. Results are posted on The Government Lottery Office website.\n\nPrizes must be claimed within two years of the draw date. Prizes of less than 20,000 baht are paid in cash by a lottery retail vendor. A one or two percent commission is deducted from gross winnings. For prizes of more than 20,000 baht, the winning ticket and its holder must be present in person at the government lottery office in Nonthaburi where a cheque will be issued. All winnings are subject to tax: 0.50% on the Thai Government Lottery and 1% on the Thai Charity Lottery.\n\nAccording to the act creating the GLO, the proceeds received by the Government Lottery Office from the sale of lottery tickets shall be allocated as follows:\n\nThe lottery generates four billion baht a year for the Thai Red Cross, charities, community projects, and scholarships, and keeps many people, often disabled, employed as ticket sellers.\n\nThe GLO is a member of the (WLA) and of the Asia Pacific Lottery Association (APLA).\n\nUnderground lottery or \"huaytaidin\" (, ) dealers around the country operate lotteries estimated at four to five times the size of the official lottery, according to Associate Professor Dr Sungsidh Piriyarangsan, Dean of the College of Social Innovation RSU. Underground lotteries are based on numbers drawn in the official lottery. These dealers offer better prizes, credit purchases, and more betting options. As a small underground lottery business can be started with just a notebook and a pen, they are ubiquitous, and an effective crackdown is impossible.\n\nSo prevalent are Thai underground lotteries, they flourish even in Thai expatriate communities abroad.\n\nUnderground lotteries, illegal but tolerated, are played by nearly one-third of a population. The lottery is such an important part of Thai life that the country's leading university, Chulalongkorn, has a researcher devoted to studying it. A survey published in 2011 by the researcher, Noppanant Wannathepsakul, found that 20 million people played the underground lottery in Thailand, out of a population of 65 million. Underground lotteries are more popular than the official lottery partly because the chances of winning are better, at one in 100. The main official prize is much larger, but its odds are one in one million. The unofficial lottery is part of the vast Thai underground economy, beyond the reach of the tax authorities and not counted in official economic statistics. It is also a rich source of petty corruption. Mr Noppanant estimates that the police get 11 billion baht, or US$362 million, in bribes and protection money from the underground lottery every year.\n\nThe Thai search for winning lottery numbers is insatiable and bewildering to outsiders. Thais often pick numbers derived from news events or oddities they observe: the number of bananas on a stalk or the appearance of a two-headed fish, cats with strange markings, or the pattern a snake leaves in the dirt. Various websites and soothsayers help interpret these events, with rats viewed as a one, water a two, snakes a five (large) or six (small) and anything related to royalty a nine. Many Thais believe that calamity can beget good fortune, and that tragedy may give rise to powerful ghosts who offer guidance on winning numbers. Newspapers report the license plate numbers of cars involved in gruesome accidents. Lottery aficionados note the highway route numbers where accidents took place, tally the casualties, and play the numbers. Nothing is seen as too macabre to be a source of good luck.\n\n\n"}

In \"DK III\", Ray Palmer restores 1,000 of the inhabitants of Kandor to full-size, but they immediately begin to terrorize the Earth. Batman sets out to assemble his former allies against the invaders.\n\nThe series is accompanied by a series of one-shots which fill in events between issues. They are written and drawn by Frank Miller, which continues his experimentation with noir-style writing and divisive art style.\n\nOn April 24, 2015, DC Comics announced that Frank Miller was co-writing a sequel to \"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\" with Brian Azzarello titled \"The Dark Knight III: The Master Race\" and that it would be an eight-issue limited series and will be the third installment in a trilogy that began with \"The Dark Knight Returns\". However, a ninth issue was published on June 7, 2017.\n\nAndy Kubert and Klaus Janson provide art for the main story while the tie-in stories are illustrated by a rotating team of artists including Frank Miller himself, John Romita Jr. and Eduardo Risso.\n\nNumerous guest artists have contributed variant covers for each issue also.\n\nThree years have passed following the deaths of Lex Luthor and Dick Grayson/The \"Joker\". Bruce Wayne has not been seen since. In the Batcave, someone unseen shatters a display case and removes the Batsuit from therein.\n\nOn the streets, a suspect is chased by Gotham City police officers but saved when Batman appears to attack their pursuit vehicles.\n\nIn a jungle setting, Wonder Woman battles a 4-legged minotaur while her infant super-son, Johnathan, rides in a papoose on her back. Upon returning to the Amazons' new city, she learns that her truant daughter Lara is visiting Superman, father to her and consort to Diana.\n\nSuperman is now mysteriously iced over, seated on a throne in his rebuilt Fortress of Solitude. Lara speaks to him absently about the Kryptonian relics on display, including the Bottle City of Kandor. Upon looking closely at it, she discovers a distress signal.\n\nBack in Gotham, Commissioner Ellen Yindel ponders the derelict bat signal. Her career is mired by the media frenzy surrounding the Batman sightings and a new Mayoral spokesperson trying to put words in her mouth. She answers a call reporting Batman's imminent arrest.\n\nThe ensuing chase results in Batman surrounded and abandoning a motorcycle. After considerable resistance, the cops manage to beat Batman down with night sticks. Disregarding the surprise of a female Batman, Yindel joins the arrest, unmasks her, and demands the whereabouts of Bruce Wayne. Revealed, Carrie Kelley claims the original Batman is now dead.\n\n\"Dark Knight Universe Presents: The Atom\" #1: Dr. Ray Palmer finishes a sparring session with a reptile specimen in his lab. He regrows to normal human size and reads news cards about the Kelly arrest, worrying about the implications. The sounds of intruders prompt him to arm himself. One, he finds, is a miniaturized man we will come to know as Baal. The other is Lara who has come calling to see if Palmer can restore the inhabitants of Kandor to full size.\n\nThe beaten and bloodied Carrie Kelley is manhandled into a police vehicle. When prompted, she madly repeats her claim that \"Bruce Wayne is dead\" three times. She is incarcerated as a Jane Doe and Commissioner Yindel spends a month interrogating her, with mixed success. Carrie claims the aging Bruce Wayne finally succumbed to battle injuries after years of holding on. But when asked about his final resting place, Carrie only makes a sick joke and chides her about her anti-Batman beliefs.\n\nBack at his laboratory, Ray Palmer fills in Lara about the horrible consequences of his earlier attempts to resize Kandor. Baal joins the conversation through a wall-mounted speaker. Lara super hears a summons from her mother and flies away in the blink of an eye. Baal and Ray continue talking, leaving off with Baal frowning when Ray makes a reference to God.\n\nFollowing some media commentary, Yindel takes reports on the lack of protestors or resistance to Carrie's legal situation, implying that the Mayor is manipulating opinions. Yindel remotely oversees Carrie's prison transport. At a strategic point en route, Carrie whistles to trigger a non-lethal missile strike on the transport. The Batmobile (still refit to tank form per \"Dark Knight Returns\") advances on the transport. A waiting force of squad cars and drones scrambles to surround the Batmobile. As it continues to shoot police vehicles, Yindel orders a drawbridge raised to cut off its escape route. Police corner the Batmobile against the drawbridge, but find no one inside. Its afterburner fires, propelling it over the drawbridge. Carrie, who has wedged herself in the undercarriage, escapes when the Batmobile lands on the other side of the river.\n\nIn a desert, Ray attempts his Kandor restoration project involving cables connected to the bottle and a chest-mounted beam projector. After a blinding flash, the area is populated by full-sized Kandor citizens. However, Ray is shocked to see that some of their number are freshly dead and many more wear the raiments of a cult soon revealed to be twisted, fanatical, and polygamous. The regrown Baal introduces their leader as Quar. Quar redirects the beam on Palmer. Palmer shrinks to a tiny height and Baal steps on him. Quar orates about their new home and power. He picks up the bottle city, whose inhabitants no longer include any of his followers, and obliterates it with heat vision.\n\nIn the Batcave, Carrie disembarks from the Batmobile and approaches the Batcomputer terminal. Bruce Wayne stands there with a crutch and turns to look at her with an unreadable expression.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: Wonder Woman #1: Super mother/daughter friction as Lara returns to the new Amazon city, late for a sparring session with Wonder Woman. Lara laments her upbringing in secret near-isolation while Diana focuses on the upside of having a defiant daughter; she'll fight for her own in life. Lara complains that combat training is needless given her potentially unrivaled super powers. Diana attacks harder in an effort to enliven Lara's performance. All the while, super baby Johnathan remains in the papoose, possibly not even awake. Diana speaks of her fighting Amazonian heritage and thrusts a sword at Lara. Lara allows the sword to break on her chest, counters that she prefers her father's heritage, and flies away.\n\nNow released from Kandor, the Kryptonians led by Quar make an announcement to the world, asking that they be acknowledged as gods or face destruction. Faced with this ultimatum, but recognising that he is too weak to face such a threat himself, Bruce takes Carrie to the Fortress of Solitude to inspire Superman back into action, who since \"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\" has left himself to freeze in the Fortress. When they reach the Fortress, Bruce strikes Clark with a sledgehammer to rouse him. Clark awakes to Carrie saying that Kryptonians are involved. While Superman agrees to help, Quar and his followers breach the Pentagon, demanding an answer to their ultimatum. The monitors around the room go black and Bruce (in his Batsuit) declares:\"Go to Hell\". At that moment Superman arrives but is shocked to see his daughter Lara now aiding Quar, declaring him a traitor to his own race.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: Green Lantern #1 Hal Jordan: Learning of the Kryptonians' arrival on Earth, Hal travels back to try to make them stand down, but when they realise that he is nothing more than a man with a ring, they blast his hand off with heat-vision and leave him to fall to the ground.\n\nSuperman stands his ground but refuses to fight back as Lara pummels him all across the world to the Fortress of Solitude. Quar cocoons Superman in black matter and orders his legion of Kryptonians to sink the Fortress into the ocean, and Superman with it. He then gives out an order to Gotham City demanding that they hand over the Batman or what happened in Moscow will happen to Gotham. As the city falls into chaos, Bruce orders Carrie on a special mission, giving her some sort of pill and her new Batgirl costume. Wonder Woman, meanwhile, stands alone on Themyscira in the rain, ignoring the call to action from Bruce. As Ellen Yindel waxes on the worth of the people of Gotham and that of the GCPD, Bruce in his Batman garb appears behind her and tells her to stop trying to drown out the needs of her people.\n\nMeanwhile, Ray Palmer, revealed to still be alive, is sinking into a subatomic universe when he suddenly grabs hold of an atom, realizing that he might be able to fix his mistake.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: Batgirl #1: In the middle of the riots in Gotham City, Carrie Kelly fights her way to the Gotham piers wearing her new Batgirl costume. She casts a pill given to her by Bruce into the bay as she is about to be overtaken. At that moment Aquaman reaches out from the water and grabs the item she had thrown in, riding on the back of a whale. Carrie jumps on top next to Aquaman and he tells her to hold her breath as he holds her close.\n\nWith Gotham City under attack, Batman's followers bring Flash to the Batcave, but Batman is worried he can't fix Flash's broken legs. Meanwhile, Carrie Kelly, Aquaman and his army have found Superman in the Arctic. Aquaman gives Carrie Kelly a golden needle saying it's the only thing that will free Superman, which she does. Back in Gotham, Batman prepares to fight Quar and his legions. Superman brings Carrie back to the Batcave, where Flash is now attached to a computer to interfere with the weather. Using power from the Bat-Signal, Flash makes it rain synthetic kryptonite, weakening the Kryptonians and causing them to fall from the sky by the hundreds. Batman, Superman (clad in a kryptonite-resistant suit of armor), and the people of Gotham bring the fight to them.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: Lara #1: Lara begins to connect with Baal, who tries to impress her by having his version of \"fun\" and impressing upon her that it is not wrong to have a lot of it. Baal picks up a car and uses it to make sexual advances towards her. Near the end, they engage in a kiss and Lara begins her journey of love.\n\nThanks to the synthetic kryptonite, Batman, Superman, the GCPD and the citizens of Gotham are able to hold off the Kryptonians. The weakened Quar is held off by the Sons of Batman, who hit him with a barrage of bullets and an RPG. Lara and Baal return from their outing around the world after the kryptonite rain has fallen and are surprised to see the situation with the downed Kryptonians. Baal begins to kill the citizens and burns a squadron of Batboys to death with his heat vision. Carrie attacks Baal with the Batmobile, which he destroys. Baal grabs Carrie by the cape and hurls her through the air. Miraculously, she is able to land unharmed. When she is cornered by Baal, Carrie uses her slingshot and shoots him with a kryptonite pebble directly in the eye. Baal retreats, screaming in pain. As the Kryptonians retreat, Superman suggests pursuing them to destroy them once and for all, but Batman persuades him to let them go and so they can \"lick their wounds\". Quar uses his heat vision and hits Batman in the back, burning a hole through his chest. After he collapses, Superman removes Batman's helmet. Bruce makes Clark promise not to take him to a hospital and seemingly dies.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: World's Finest #1: Carrie Kelly and two members of the Sons of Batman watch over Gotham City. Lara Kent appears and confronts them. Lara asks Carrie if she was the Batman's \"Chosen One\". Carrie responded with a punch but fractures her right hand. Wonder Woman arrives to confront Lara and the two fight until she subdues Lara. Realizing that her daughter is injured, she offers her hand and tries to persuade Lara that she is still her daughter after all, but an emotional Lara declines and leaves the scene.\n\nThe story continues with the GCPD led by Commissioner Ellen Yindel and Carrie Kelly cleaning up the city. Yindel asks Carrie if what they fought for was worth it since a lot of people died during the battle. Carrie responded by telling Yindel to fix the Bat-signal so they can keep in touch. Meanwhile, the kryptonians were able to regain their strength and Quar persuaded Lara Kent to capture her brother, Jonathan Kent as their hostage. At Themyscira, Wonder Woman was able to sense the planned siege when she confronted Lara while attempting to kidnap Jonathan Kent and the Kryptonians realized that the Amazonians were just waiting on them and were ready to attack. Meanwhile, the unknown location Superman went into is revealed to be the Lazarus Pit. Superman plunges Batman's body into the pit and Bruce Wayne comes out alive, physically younger, and in his prime once again. Bruce attacks Superman due to the effects of the pit but Superman calms him down at the end.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: Strange Adventures #1: Hal Jordan continues to search for his lost hand with the Green Lantern Power Ring attached to it. Meanwhile, Hawkman and Hawkgirl watches over and were having second thoughts if they will help him. Hal reaches an unknown village in the middle of the desert and found the Power Ring in possession of one of the men in the village with the help of a beggar whom he gave his drinking water at the village's entrance. The man tried to sell the ring with Hal bribing him with a bar of gold, but the man asked for more. Hal, out of options and aware that he is powerless, took a risk to get the ring back and was cornered with goons. With Hawkman and Hawkgirl's help, Hal retrieves the ring and his powers.\n\nAt the Batcave, Carrie and the Flash, deal with Batman's death, with Carrie still hopeful that Bruce is still alive. Batman, now rejuvenated by the Lazarus Pit, appears with Superman. They received a transmission from Wonder Woman in Themyscira seeking assistance, as the Kryptonians declared war against the Amazons. Superman arrives to check on Diana but the Flash warns Wonder Woman and Superman that Quar and the remaining Kryptonians, who ingested nuclear bombs, are all in one location and have started a countdown.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: Detective Comics #1: GCPD Commissioner Ellen Yindel together with two members of the SWAT team are investigating an area where they got a lead from a victim that claims to be still alive. They found mutilated body parts treated as a trophy and were attacked by former members of the mutants that are dressed up like the Joker calling themselves the Joker Boys. The SWAT team members were killed and Yindel got beaten up. It turns out that Bruno has taken over the group and she called in the police to be able to kill Yindel herself. The Joker Boys were about to slice Yindel on a table but Batman and Batgirl arrived to save her. Bruno and Yindel were caught up in a struggle and both sustained gunshot wounds. With Yindel about to lose her consciousness, it shows that she is about to accept that Batman will always be there to protect Gotham no matter what.\n\nBatman and Carrie race to the Kryptonians who continue the countdown. During this, Batman manages to swarm them with bats, causing them to inadvertedly attack one another. Discouraged, most of the Kryptonians attempt to leave Earth only to be killed by Quar. Batman and Carrie attempt to attack but are stopped by Superman, who goes in his stead. After being berated and assaulted by the remaining Kryptonians, Superman surprises them by systematically taking them out, revealing to Batman that Superman had been holding back his true fighting ability all this time. Defeated, the Kryptonians attempt to go nuclear, revealing that they are planted on a fault line which will rip the planet apart. However, Dr. Ray Palmer manages to fix and reverse the effects of his shrink ray, causing him to grow and most of the remaining Kryptonians to shrink, negating their explosives effects to nothing more than mere firecrackers. Quar, going nuclear as well, attempts to run, but he is taken by Lara and sent to the sun where he detonates.\n\nTwo months later, Superman seemingly has disappeared. Batman comes to grips with his extended life. Carrie has altered her batsuit to mimic Batman's and rechristens herself \"Batwoman\". Batman grows to accept her as an equal as opposed to a sidekick. It is also revealed that Lara survived the encounter with Quar.\n\nDark Knight Universe Presents: Action Comics #1: While Batman, Batwoman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash, and the Atom all continue their duties to fight crime and protect humanity, Superman, under his guise as Clark Kent, begins to teach Lara what it means to be human.\n\nThe first issue of the miniseries was the bestselling comic in the month of November, selling 440,234 copies.\n\n\"DK III\" was initially advertised as the conclusion to the \"Dark Knight\" series that began with \"The Dark Knight Returns\", but in November 2015 Frank Miller announced he planned to produce a fourth miniseries to conclude the story. \"I thoroughly applaud what [Brian Azzarello] [is] doing,\" he said \"But now that he's doing [\"DK III\"], it's now a four-part series. I'm doing the fourth.\"\n"}
{"id": "54508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54508", "title": "The Dozens", "text": "The Dozens\n\nThe Dozens is a game of spoken words between two contestants, common in black communities of the United States, where participants insult each other until one gives up. It is customary for the Dozens to be played in front of an audience of bystanders, who encourage the participants to reply with increasingly egregious insults in order to heighten the tension and, consequently, make the contest more interesting to watch. It is also known as \"blazing\", \"hiking\", \"roasting\", \"capping\", \"clowning\", \"ranking\", \"ragging\", \"rekking\", \"crumming\", \"sounding\", \"checkin\", \"joning\", \"woofing\", \"wolfing\", \"sigging\", or \"signifying\", while the insults themselves are known as \"snaps\".\n\nComments in the game focus on the opposite player's intelligence, appearance, competency, social status, and financial situation. Disparaging remarks about the other player's family members are common: especially mothers (\"yo′ mama...\")—to the extent that those outside the African-American community often use the specific term \"yo momma jokes\" incorrectly to refer to the Dozens. \n\nCommentary is often related to sexual issues, where the game is then referred to as the \"Dirty Dozens\".\n\nAccording to sociologist Harry Lefever and journalist John Leland, the game is almost exclusive to African Americans; other ethnic groups often fail to understand how to play the game and can take remarks in the Dozens seriously. Both males and females participate, but the game is more commonly played among males of varying social status.\n\nThe importance of mothers in African and African-American families is at the heart of the game: insulting someone else's mother is sure to inflame the passions of the other player. Like athletic sports and other games across cultures, the Dozens serves as a substitute for physical aggression, advancing the goals of social competition while sparing both sides the injury and economic hardship associated with violence. In any event, The Dozens is a contest of personal power: wit, mental acuity, self-control, and toughness.\n\nThe first academic treatment of the Dozens was made in 1939 by Yale-based psychologist and social theorist John Dollard, who described the importance of the game among African-American males, and how it is generally played. Dollard's description is considered pioneering and accurate. The Dozens is a \"pattern of interactive insult\" evident among all classes of African Americans, among males and females, children and adults.\n\nUsually two participants engage in banter, but always in front of others, who instigate the participants to continue the game by making the insults worse. Frequently used topics among players who \"play the Dozens\" or are \"put in the Dozens\" are one's opponent's lack of intelligence, ugliness, alleged homosexuality, alleged incest, cowardice, poor hygiene, and exaggerations of physical defects, such as crossed eyes.\n\nDollard originally wrote that he was unaware of how the term \"Dozens\" developed, although he suggested a popular twelve-part rhyme may have been the reason for its name. He only speculated on how the game itself grew to such prominence. Other authors following Dollard have added their theories. Author John Leland describes an etymology, writing that the term is a modern survival of an English verb—\"to dozen\"—dating back at least to the fourteenth century and meaning \"to stun, stupefy, daze\" or \"to make insensible, torpid, powerless\".\n\nAmuzie Chimezie, writing in the \"Journal of Black Studies\" in 1976, connects the Dozens to a Nigerian game called \"Ikocha Nkocha\", literally translated as \"making disparaging remarks\". This form of the game is played by children and adolescents, and takes place in the evening, in the presence of parents and siblings. Commentary among the Igbo is more restrained: remarks about family members are rare, and are based more in fanciful imaginings than participants' actual traits. In contrast, during the game in Ghana, which is also commonly played in the evenings, insults are frequently directed at family members. Amiri Baraka independently concluded that the Dozens originated in Africa and states that they are a surviving adaptation of \"African songs of recrimination.\"\n\nAuthor and professor Mona Lisa Saloy posits a different theory, stating in \"African American Oral Traditions in Louisiana\" (1998): \"The dozens has its origins in the slave trade of New Orleans where deformed slaves—generally slaves punished with dismemberment for disobedience—were grouped in lots of a 'cheap dozen' for sale to slave owners. For a Black to be sold as part of the 'dozens' was the lowest blow possible.\"\n\nParticipants in the Dozens are required to exhibit mental acuity and proficiency with words. In his memoir \"Die Nigger Die!\" (1969), H. Rap Brown writes that the children he grew up with employed the Dozens to kill time and stave off boredom, in the way that whites might play Scrabble. Brown asserts playing the game is a form of mental exercise. Sociologist Harry Lefever states that verbal skill and wit is just as valued among African Americans as physical strength: \"Verbal facility is thus a criterion that is used to separate the men from the boys\".\n\nAccording to author John Leland, the object of the game is to stupefy and daze one's opponents with swift and skillful speech. The meaning of the words, however, is lost in the game. The object of the game is the performance.\n\nRemarks in the Dozens can be expressed in rhyme or general language. More simplistic forms are found among younger children:\n<poem>\nParticipant 1: \"I hear your mother plays third base for the Phillies.\"\nParticipant 2: \"Your mother is a bricklayer and stronger than your father.\"\nParticipant 1: \"Your mother eats shit.\"\nParticipant 2: \"Your mother eats shit and mustard.\"\n</poem>\nAdolescents incorporate more sexual themes in their versions, often called the \"Dirty Dozens\". The language also becomes more playful, with participants including rhymes:\n<poem>\nI was walking through the jungle\nWith my dick in my hand\nI was the baddest motherfucker\nIn the jungle land\nI looked up in the tree\nAnd what did I see\nYour little black mama\nTrying to piss on me\nI picked up a rock\nAnd hit her in the cock\nAnd knocked that bitch\nAbout a half a block.\n</poem>\nMany forms of the Dozens address sexual situations or body parts:\n<poem>\nIf you wanta play the Dozens\nPlay them fast.\nI'll tell you how many bull-dogs\nYour mammy had.\nShe didn't have one;\nShe didn't have two;\nShe had nine damned dozens\nAnd then she had you.\n</poem>\nThe Dozens can be played \"clean\" or \"dirty\". In some examples, the insults can take the form of one-liners that rhyme, e.g.:\n<poem>\nYour hair is so nappy 'cause King Kong's your pappy\n</poem>\nIn other instances, they appear as straight one-liners without any rhyme, thus:\n<poem>\nYo mom so stupid it takes her an hour to cook Minute Rice\nI saw yo mom kicking a can down the street and asked her what she was doing, she said movin'!\nYo mom so fat she wears a phone booth for a beeper!\nYo mom so fat she bleed gravy!\nYo momma so fat the restaurant in her town have a sign: \"Occupancy of this room limited to 120 persons—OR YO MOMMA.\"\n</poem>\nA variety of explanations have been offered for the popularity of the Dozens. Its development is intertwined with the oppression African Americans encountered, first as slaves and later as second-class citizens. John Dollard viewed the Dozens as a manifestation of frustration aggression theory, a theory that he helped develop. He hypothesized that African Americans, as victims of racism, have been unable to respond in kind towards their oppressors, and instead shifted their anger to friends and neighbors, as displayed in the strings of insults.\n\nIn 1962, folklorist Roger Abrahams explained the Dozens not only as a reaction to racism, but also as a mostly male behavior in a society dominated by women, hence the concentration on targeting opponents' mothers. Abrahams believed the Dozens to be exaggeratedly masculine behavior that is unable to be expressed except in short bursts where a participant attacks his opponent's mother in order to cause him to reply in kind and attack his \"own\" mother.\n\nBoth Dollard's and Abraham's views have been criticized for not properly considering the context in which the Dozens is used. Folklorist Alan Dundes asserts that by basing their approach on psychoanalytic theory, neither Dollard nor Abrahams considers that the Dozens may be native to Africa, although Dollard does not rule it out. Dundes points out that, in addition to similar forms of verbal combat found in Nigeria and Ghana, where many African Americans have ancestral roots, Bantu and Kisii boys have been observed dueling verbally by attacking each other's mothers.\n\nThe game is also viewed as a tool for preparing young African Americans to cope with verbal abuse without becoming enraged. The ability to remain composed during the Dozens is considered a hallmark of virtue among many African Americans. Two sociologists write, \"In the deepest sense, the essence of the dozens lies not in the insults but in the response of the victim. To take umbrage is to be considered an infantile response. Maturity and sophistication bring the capability to suffer the vile talk with aplomb at least, and, hopefully, with grace and wit.\"\n\nNonetheless, many such contests do end in fights. Abrahams states that when African Americans reach a certain age, between 16 and 26, the game loses much of its appeal and attempts to enter into sparring contests often result in violence. John Leland writes that the loser of the Dozens is the one who takes his opponent's words at face value, therefore ending his own performance in the back-and-forth exchange.\n\n\nInternational:\n\n"}

It follows a team of Muslim-American comedians as they tour the American South and Southwest performing free stand-up comedy shows, and engaging in community activities, with an aim to \"reach out to Middle America\" and counter Islamophobia.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of television and radio clips of comments from figures such as Frank Gaffney, Herman Cain, Ann Coulter, Bryan Fischer, Pat Robertson, Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Bill Maher, and Donald Trump expressing fear of Islam, or mistrust of Muslims.\n\nFarsad and Obeidallah explain what motivated them to attempt to change the negative perception of Muslims in America: for Farsad it was claims that Obama was a secret Muslim (with its implication that being Muslim was in itself something negative); and for Obeidallah it was the virulence of the opposition to the \"Ground Zero Mosque\".\n\nIn Columbus, Georgia, they visit a gun show and perform in a bar.\nThey perform in Gainesville, Florida.\n\nIn Lawrenceville, Georgia, they set up a \"Ask a Muslim Booth\" in the town center. At the Islamic Center of Columbus (also known as Masjid Al-Jannah), they stop to have iftar. At AMF Peach Lanes in Columbus, they invite community members to \"Bowl with a Muslim\".\n\nAfter performing in Birmingham, Alabama, they invite passers-by to play \"Name That Religion\" where they try to guess if a quote read to them came from the Old Testament, New Testament, or the Koran.\n\nIn Tupelo, Mississippi, they attempt to get on an American Family Association radio show. After being denied their request to get on the air, they drop in on the AFA headquarters and have an audience with the General Manager Dr. Buster Williams.\n\nBack in Lawrenceville, they visit Bulls-Eye Indoor Range & Gun Shop to shoot guns.\n\nIn Murfreesboro, Tennessee, they visit the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro (the site of a controversy beginning in 2010) and perform at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nIn Tucson, Arizona, they perform at El Casino Ballroom.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, Utah, they perform at The Complex, and in front of the Salt Lake Temple they hold a sign inviting passers-by to \"Hug a Muslim\".\n\nMuslim comedians whose performances are featured in the film include Dean Obeidallah, Negin Farsad, Maysoon Zayid, Aron Kader, Omar Elba, Preacher Moss, Kareem Omary. Non-Muslim comedians featured include Scott Blakeman.\n\nThe following celebrities, pundits, activists, and religious figures are featured in the film discussing anti-Muslim bigotry in America and/or commenting on the power of comedy:\n\nThe film premiered at the Austin Film Festival where it received the \"Comedy Vanguard Audience Award\".\n\n\"The Muslims Are Coming!\" was released in select cities in September 2013 including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Seattle and New Brunswick. It became available on 24 September 2013 through iTunes, Amazon downloads and video on demand. It was released on Netflix on 21 January 2014.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" and the \"Chicago Tribune\" named it as a film to catch in fall 2013.\n\n\"The Austin Chronicle\" made it a critic's pick, calling the film: \"...really effing funny.\"\n\n\"The Muslims Are Coming!\" received a mixed reception from film critics. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports the film as holding an overall 53% positive approval rating based on 15 reviews, and a rating average of 5.2 out of 10. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 48 based on 9 reviews, classified as a \"Mixed or average\" reviewed film.\n\nFrank Scheck, in \"The Hollywood Reporter\", wrote that \"[a]lthough not wholly successful in its sociological aspirations, the film does provide both considerable laughs and food for thought. [...] The film wanders at times into trivial territory [...] And it delves into all-too-familiar terrain[...] But it nonetheless makes its important points in entertaining fashion, and the onscreen commentary by a gallery of figures [...] is both thoughtful and funny.\" Nick A. Zaino III of \"The Boston Globe\" felt that the film was \"at its best when the comedians talk to real people outside the controlled environment of a stage.\"\n\nJordan Hoffman in the \"New York Daily News\" called it a \"mild, moderately interesting road documentary\", and stated that \"[t]he unfortunate thing is ... these folks aren’t all that funny. [...] Viewers outside the tristate area may have their minds blown. The rest of us may be only mildly amused.\" Ben Sachs, writing in the \"Chicago Reader\", observed that \"evidently, mediocre stand-up can be surprisingly effective in promoting ethnic and religious tolerance. For better and for worse, this feels less like a feature film than a stretched-out \"Daily Show\" segment.\"\n\nPeter Rainer of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" gave the film a C- grade saying \"[t]he comedy routines are so-so (though the falling-in-the-aisles reaction shots tell another story) and the comics’ patchwork odyssey often derails into irrelevancies\". Writing for \"The New York Times\", Miriam Bale gave the film two and a half stars out of five, and said that \"this well-intentioned 'docu-comedy' (as the filmmakers label it in publicity notes) is not very funny.\"\n\nDean Essner of \"Slant Magazine\" gave the film gave the film one and a half stars out of four, calling it \"a film that wastes a fascinating premise on its main characters' obsession with reducing everything to a joke, the attempted humor is neither ground- nor barrier-breaking.\n\nAnnlee Ellingson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" commented that the directors' \"try to keep it light, even a little cheesy, in the face of at-times infuriating anti-Muslim attitudes — an approach that best serves their goal of giving America 'this big Muslim hug.'\"\n\n"}

Its principal researchers were David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon.\n\nThe Media Group at the CCCS selected the BBC television current affairs programme \"Nationwide\" to study the encoding/decoding model, a part of reception theory, developed by Stuart Hall. This study was concerned with \"the programme's distinctive ideological themes and with the particular ways in which \"Nationwide\" addressed the viewer\". This first part of the study was published by Brunsdon and Morley in 1978.\n\nMorley conducted qualitative research with various participants from different educational and occupational backgrounds. He observed different responses to a clip of its budget special to see whether they would construct dominant, oppositional or negotiated readings (the three categories of readings proposed by Hall).\n\nManagement groups produced dominant readings, while teacher training students and university arts students produced negotiated readings. Trade union groups characteristically produced oppositional or negotiated readings. Black college students, however, \"fail[ed] to engage with the discourse of the programme enough to reconstruct or redefine it\".\n\nThe initial conclusion was that decodings cannot be traced solely to socioeconomic position, since members of the sample occupying the same class location produced different readings. However, Sujeong Kim's statistical re-analysis of the project's findings suggests that this may be an underinterpretation: according to Kim, the results show that 'audience's social positions ... structure their understandings and evaluations of television programmes in quite consistent directions and patterns.' For example, Kim observes that middle class viewers produced negotiated readings of one particular programme, while working class viewers produced dominant or oppositional readings dependent on their gender and race.\n\n</div>\n\n"}

{"id": "2703156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2703156", "title": "Thumb tip", "text": "Thumb tip\n\nA thumb tip is a magician's prop designed to fit over and appear to be the magician's thumb used for vanishing, producing, or switching small objects. A classic effect is to have a silk handkerchief or other small object pressed into the top of the left fist. After pushing it well in with the right thumb, the left fist is opened to show the silk has disappeared. Alternatively, a lit cigarette, liquid, salt or other small objects can be made to disappear in a similar manner.\n\nA similar effect would be to cause a handkerchief or other small object to appear in the left fist after previously showing it empty. The right hand approaches the left and after a brief pause pulls out the silk handkerchief bit by bit from the fist.\n\nThese appearances and disappearances are achieved by a small flesh-colored imitation thumb tip, usually made of plastic, rubber or painted metal, which fits loosely over the thumb. Space exists between the thumb and the tip into which a small object can be concealed. \n\nFor the vanish, the tip is already in the left fist. The handkerchief or cigarette is pressed into the tip with the fingers and then finally the right thumb, which comes quickly out of the hand with the tip on, and the object inside, between the tip and thumb. While the audience is looking at the fist, the performer has chance to misdirect and dump the tip and contents in a pocket, perhaps under cover of putting the hand in the pocket to obtain some \"magic dust\" to sprinkle on the left fist. Alternatively, the tip may be kept on the thumb for an indeterminate amount of time, using techniques of misdirection and shading to keep it invisible to the audience. \n\nAn appearance is achieved in a similar manner, but this time, the tip begins on the right thumb with the object already inside. To avoid detection, the tip may be kept down behind the right hand, or it may be pointed directly at the audience while the hand is in motion; done properly, it appears as though the right hand is empty. The left hand is openly shown to be empty, and is made into a fist. The right thumb is inserted into the left fist, while simultaneously the thumb and right fingers pull the concealed object out of the tip, which remains in the left fist. While the audience is misdirected looking at the object, the performer may turn to his left and dump the tip into his pocket leaving him clean.\n\nSilk is often used because it will compress into a small space in the tip. Thumb tips and finger tips can be obtained at magic dealers. While the explanation is simple, the use and handling of the tip requires quite some skill and practice to perfect. Ultimately, the beauty of the illusion, as with most magic, will depend on the skill of the performer, both in the handling and as an actor.\n\nMagicians have used modified thumb tips to accomplish different effects.\n\nA thumb tip with a slit in the tip can be used like a dye tube to apparently change the color of a silk . In this case, a colored silk is preloaded into the tip. The magician steals the tip into the left fist, then pokes a white silk into the tip while alternately pulling the colored silk out from the other end.\n\nA thumb tip with a small suction cup attached to the tip can be used to create the illusion of floating small objects . In this effect, the tip remains on the magician's thumb while the suction cup is affixed to a small object with a smooth surface (such as a light bulb or empty aluminum can), effectively attaching the object to the thumb. With the fingers spread, the thumb moves the object in such a way that it appears to be floating independently of the hands.\n\nA thumb tip can be prepared with a wick protruding slightly from the end, soaked with lighter fluid . This enables the magician to \"pick up\" a flame, apparently with his or her fingers.\n\nMentalists may use a thumb tip with a piece of pencil lead at the end which can be used to secretly write on a piece of paper, similar to a swami gimmick.\n\nA thumb tip embedded with magnets can be utilized in performance to effect a magnetic compass to move.\n\n"}

It depicts the town of Wimborne as it was at the time the model was originally made in the 1950s, and captures the essence of a typical market town of rural England at that time.\n\nThe concrete model, built at 1/10 scale, features 120 buildings including 108 shop fronts and a 15 ft (5m) high Minster. The shop windows accurately show the goods the shops were selling in the post war years.\n\nOriginally built on a site just to the north-west of the actual Wimborne Minster church, it became run-down in the 1980s, and a group of volunteers set up a charity and were given an area of 0.4 hectare (1 acre) of Green Belt land off King Street to restore the attraction. Although such use of Green Belt land would normally have been deemed inappropriate development, the District planners considered that the model's retention in the town was a 'special circumstance'. The Council has since permitted over 245 square metres of temporary classroom buildings incorporating a visitors centre, cafe/gift shop, toilets etc. together with play cabins associated with the children's play area.\n\nAdditional attractions have been added in recent years, including a model railway based on Thomas the Tank Engine, which was opened by Christopher Awdry.\n\nToday the model town is still run by volunteers, and is visited by thousands of people every year.\n\n"}
