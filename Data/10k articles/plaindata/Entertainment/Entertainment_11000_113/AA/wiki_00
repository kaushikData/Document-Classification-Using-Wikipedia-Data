Many breakdance moves can begin from the 2-step position. This move sets up the direction of movement and builds up momentum when dancing. This move allows the dancer to stay low and in contact with the ground, which places him in an optimal position for performing other dance moves. This move is launched from the third step of the basic 6-step and involves the dancer hopping with a crouched leg over the other straightened leg while simultaneously rotating the dancer's body over the swinging leg in a twisting movement similar to a swipe. The move leaves the dancer in a position similar to the fourth step of the 6-step, but facing 180 degrees in the opposite direction. When dancing 2-step is often used as a move by itself or as a transition into other moves such as powermoves, freezes, toprock and much more.\n\nAs the name implies, there are a total of two steps in this dance move. A standard version begins in a push up position. \n\nOnce you have these steps down you should combine steps two and three and do the moves simultaneously.\n\nThe 2-step is a move based on the 6-step.\nThe 2-step can be down on the knuckles of the hand as well as the palm.\n\n"}

It was originally developed as an auxiliary scoring method, but more recently it has been used as a tie-breaking system. It was probably first used in the 1932 Bitterfeld tournament. It was designed to replace the Neustadtl score .\n\nThe method is to give each player a raw score of one point for each win and a half point for each draw. When used as an alternate scoring system, each player's Buchholz score is calculated by adding the raw scores of each of the opponents he played and multiplying this total by the player's raw score . When used for tie-breaking among players with the same raw score, no multiplying is necessary and the sum of the raw scores of the opponents played is used to break ties . When used as a tie-break system, it is equivalent to the Solkoff system.\n\nThe major criticism of this system is that tie-break scores can be distorted by the set of opponents that each player plays (especially in early rounds). To avoid this problem a version of Buchholz, the Median-Buchholz System is sometimes used. In the Median-Buchholz System the best and worst scores of a player's opponents are discarded, and the remaining scores summed.\n\n\n\n"}

From the earliest years of the twentieth century until the early 1960s, the dance hall was the popular forerunner of the discothèque or nightclub. The majority of towns and cities in the West had at least one dance hall, and almost always featured live musicians playing a range of music from strict tempo ballroom dance music to big band, swing and jazz. One of the most famous dance hall musicians was Glenn Miller.\n\nOther structural forms of dance halls include the dance pavilion which has a roof but no walls, and the open-air platform which has no roof or walls. The open air nature of the dance pavilion was both a feature and a drawback. The taxi dance hall is a dance hall with a specific arrangement, wherein the patrons hire hall employees to dance with them.\n\nStarting in the early 1930s, The Savoy, a dance hall in Harlem (a black neighborhood in New York City) was the first truly integrated building in the United States — for both the dancers and the musicians. \"We didn't care about the color of your skin. All we wanted to know was: Can you dance?\"\n\nThe early days of rock n' roll were briefly played out in dance halls until they were superseded by nightclubs.\n\nTexas has a high concentration of community dance halls, the largest number of them built by German and Czech immigrants.\n\nIn Sweden and Finland, open air dance pavilions have been used mostly in summer, but especially in Finland some have also been built to be used throughout the year. Especially formerly the dance pavilions were often built at sites with beautiful landscape, for example by the lakes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35291063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35291063", "title": "Drama theory", "text": "Drama theory\n\nDrama theory is one of the problem structuring methods in operations research. It is based on game theory and adapts the use of games to complex organisational situations, accounting for emotional responses that can provoke irrational reactions and lead the players to redefine the game. In a drama, emotions trigger rationalizations that create changes in the game, and so change follows change until either all conflicts are resolved or action becomes necessary. The game as redefined is then played.\n\nDrama theory was devised by Professor Nigel Howard in the early 90s and, since then, has been turned to defense, political, health, industrial relations and commercial applications. Drama theory is an extension of Howard's metagame analysis work developed at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1960s, and presented formally in his book \"Paradoxes of Rationality\", published by MIT Press. Metagame analysis was originally used to advise on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT).\n\nA drama unfolds through \"episodes\" in which \"characters\" interact. The episode is a period of \"preplay communication\" between characters who, after communicating, act as players in a game that's constructed through the dialogue between them. The action that follows the episode is the playing out of this game; it sets up the next episode. Most drama-theoretic terminology is derived from a theatrical model applied to real life interactions; thus, an episode goes through phases of \"scene-setting\", \"build-up\", \"climax\" and \"decision\". This is followed by \"denouement\", which is the action that sets up the next episode. The term 'drama theory' and the use of theatrical terminology is justified by the fact that the theory applies to stage plays and fictional plots as well as to politics, war, business, personal and community relations, psychology, history and other kinds of human interaction. It was applied to help with the structuring of Prisoner's Dilemma, a West End play by David Edgar about the problems of peace-keeping.\nIn the build-up phase of an episode, the characters exchange ideas and opinions in some form or another and try to advocate their preferred \"position\" – the game outcome that they are hoping to see realised. The position each character takes may be influenced by others' positions. Each character also presents a \"fallback\" or \"stated intention\". This is the action (i.e., individual strategy) a character says it will implement if current positions and stated intentions do not change. Taken together, the stated intentions form what is called a \"threatened future\" if they contradict some character's position; if they do not – i.e., if they implement every position – they form what is called an \"agreement\".\n\nWhen it is common knowledge among the characters that positions and stated intentions are seen by their presenters as 'final', the build-up ends and the parties reach a \"moment of truth\". Here they usually face \"dilemmas\" arising from the fact that their threats or promises are incredible or inadequate. Different dilemmas are possible depending on whether or not there is an agreement. If there is an agreement (i.e., stated intentions implement every position), the possible dilemmas resemble those found in the prisoner's dilemma game; they arise from characters distrusting each other's declared intention to implement the agreement. If there is no agreement, more dilemmas are possible, resembling those in the game of chicken; they arise from the fact that a character's threat or its determination to stick to its position and reject other positions may be incredible to another character.\n\nDrama theory asserts that a character faced with a dilemma feels specific positive or negative emotions that it tries to rationalize by persuading itself and others that the game should be redefined in a way that eliminates the dilemma; for example, a character with an incredible threat makes it credible by becoming angry and finding reasons why it should prefer to carry out the threat; likewise, a character with an incredible promise feels positive emotion toward the other as it looks for reasons why it should prefer to carry its promise. Emotional tension leads to the \"climax\", where characters re-define the moment of truth by finding rationalizations for changing positions, stated intentions, preferences, options or the set of characters. There is some experimental evidence to confirm this assertion of drama theory (see P. Murray-Jones, L. Stubbs and N. Howard, 'Confrontation and Collaboration Analysis: Experimental and Mathematical Results', presented at the 8th International Command & Control Research and Technology Symposium, June, 2003—from whose site it can be downloaded.\n\nSix dilemmas (formerly called paradoxes) are defined, and it is proved that if none of them exist then the characters have an agreement that they fully trust each other to carry out. This is the fundamental theorem of drama theory. Until a \"resolution\" meeting these conditions is arrived at, the characters are under emotional pressure to rationalize re-definitions of the game that they will play. Re-definitions inspired by new dilemmas then follow each other until eventually, with or without a resolution, characters become players in the game they have defined for themselves. In game-theoretic terms, this is a 'game with a focal point' – i.e., it is a game in which each player has stated its intention to implement a certain strategy. This strategy is its threat (part of the threatened future) if an agreement has not been reached, and its promise (part of the agreement), if an agreement has been reached. At this point, players (since they are playing a game) decide whether to believe each other, and so to predict what others will do in order to decide what to do themselves.\n\nThe dilemmas that character A may face with respect to another character B at a moment of truth are as follows.\n\n\nDrama-theorists build and analyze models (called \"card tables\" or \"options boards\") that are isomorphic to game models, but unlike game theorists and most other model-builders, do not do so with the aim of finding a 'solution'. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will re-define the model itself – i.e., the game that will be played. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.\n\nThe relation between drama theory and game theory is complementary in nature. Game theory does not explain how the game that is played is arrived at – i.e., how players select a small number of players and strategies from the virtually infinite set they could select, and how they arrive at common knowledge about each other's selections and preferences for the resulting combinations of strategies. Drama theory tries to explain this, and also to explain how the 'focal point' is arrived at for the 'game with a focal point' that is finally played. On the other hand, drama theory does not explain how players will act when they finally have to play a particular 'game with a focal point', even though it has to make assumptions about this. This is what game theory tries to explain and predict.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The show originally began as a progression from Kempenaar's film blog \"Cinemascoped\". He and his friend, Sam Van Hallgren (then Sam Hallgren), who had become a regular contributor to \"Cinemascoped\" began brainstorming when interest in the blog began to wane. What resulted was a film-talk podcast. While the whole concept of podcasting at the time was relatively new, Kempenaar had gotten the idea from an article appearing in \"Wired\", and he and Van Hallgren decided to give it a try. The fledgling show began production in 2005, initially under the title Cinecast, but was changed to \"Filmspotting\" in 2006 due to a conflict over the name. Shortly after, the show was picked up by Chicago's NPR affiliate station, WBEZ.\n\n\n\nIn the spring of 2008, Kempenaar and Robinson were given teaching positions at the Graham School of General Studies (part of the University of Chicago) for a one-semester film course, focusing on the films of Michael Curtiz and Howard Hawks. The course, proving a success, was cause for the pair to be subsequently invited back by the university to teach further courses in each of the following three school years. The below table offers a brief summary of these classes:\nThe show starts with a review of a recently released film, followed by listener feedback. After the feedback segment is \"Massacre Theater\", a weekly contest that has the hosts performing short scenes of dialogue from various films, with a prize going to one listener who correctly guessed which film it was from. On rare occasions, the hosts will perform the scene with guests, with one notable episode including Kempenaar performing a scene from The Professional with Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, who were being interviewed to promote their film Hot Fuzz.\n\nEach episode ends with the \"Top Five\" segment, which sees each host picking their top five movies that pertain to a certain topic for the week. The segment was initially inspired by similar scenes in \"High Fidelity\" and the Nick Hornby novel it was based on. These picks exclude certain \"pantheon\" choices, which are films such as \"The Godfather\" or \"Citizen Kane\" that have been forever excluded from future lists for being too \"obvious\". They also have their own personal \"penalty box\" films, which temporarily excludes films that one host has picked too often.\n\nOlder episodes included a segment where the hosts each highlighted an overlooked film on DVD to recommend to the listener. However, that segment was later removed from the main show and placed in their short-lived video podcast, \"Cinecast A/V\". The segment was then moved to their weekly e-mail newsletter \"The Dope Sheet\" before that was also discontinued.\n\nOn occasion, particularly when Adam and/or Josh are away from the \"Filmspotting\" studio, or when there is a special edition of the show, guest hosts are sometimes featured. Included among them are Chicago Tribune film critic, Michael Phillips, Matt Singer of IndieWire and Alison Wilmore (formerly of the Independent Film Channel) -- the latter two hosting a spinoff podcast called \"Filmspotting: Streaming Video Unit (SVU)\"\n\nFor the \"Movie Marathons\", the hosts review six to eight movies from a particular genre or director that they haven't already seen. At the end of their six- to eight-week marathon, they present awards for best film, best director, best actor, etc., for that marathon, naming the award after something related to the genre or director they've just covered.\n\nThese marathons, and their associated awards, have been, in order:\n\nThe Palme d'Or marathon culminated in a screening of Afterschool at the Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago on December 12, 2009 followed by a Q&A with writer/director Antonio Campos and featured actor Michael Stuhlbarg. \"Afterschool\" was an Un Certain Regard selection at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDuring breaks in the show, \"Filmspotting\" primarily features music from artists on the Chicago label Bloodshot Records, in addition to artists from Messenger Records, and, even more rarely, Merge Records. The guitar-driven theme song is \"This Machine\" by now-defunct Chicago band Age of the Rifle.\n\nThe last \"Cinecast\" show was the two-part 100th podcast on May 12–13, 2006, after which the name changed to \"Filmspotting\". The specific reason for the change was not discussed, but there is a company called CineCast that produces pre-show advertisements in theatres. Adam and Sam originally said the show would be renamed \"The Cinema Show,\" but then solicited suggestions from listeners. Contenders included \"Cinecrack\", \"Cinediction\" and \"Burn, Hollywood, Burn,\" but the hosts announced their final selection on the 8 May 2006 show (Cinecast #98): \"Filmspotting.\" Listener Nicholas Correnti from Florida State University Film School suggested the name Filmspotting and won $50 worth of DVDs for his part in renaming Cinecast.\n\n"}

Frank Fenter was also instrumental in introducing and breaking Rhythm and Blues music across Europe, with such artists as Otis Redding and Sam and Dave. He went on in the 1970s to be a co-founder, co-owner, partner and Executive Vice President of Capricorn Records, the label identified with Southern Rock, led by The Allman Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie and Elvin Bishop. In 2014, Frank Fenter was posthumously Inducted into The Georgia Music Hall of Fame.\n\nFrank Fenter was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and moved to London, England, in 1958, at the age of 22, initially determined to become an actor. Fenter's acting career included a feature role in the BBC's 1963 The Big Pull; in 1964, he produced, co-wrote and acted in Africa Shakes, the first South African rock movie, which featured Fenter's music act Bill Kimber and the Couriers. The movie was the first to have an interracial cast in Apartheid South Africa. \n\nWhile doing part-time acting, Fenter began to book bands around London in the early 1960s, including The Rolling Stones, The Animals and Manfred Mann, long before they had recording contracts. Fenter got his first big break in the music industry in 1964, when he joined Chapell Music Publishing Co.; he went on to head Liberty-Imperial Record Publishing and later ARC/Chess Music.\n\nIn 1966, Frank Fenter was chosen by Atlantic Records partner Nesuhi Ertegun to head the label in the United Kingdom. Within six months, Frank Fenter was the Managing Director in charge of Atlantic Records' operations in all of Europe. Fenter was responsible for making Atlantic Records \"the most important American label in promoting British music\", according to the late Ahmet Ertegun, co-founder and Chairman of Atlantic Records and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, who went on to say, \"We wound up with quite a lot of British bands, due in large part to the fact that we had put Frank Fenter in charge of all Atlantic Records activity in Europe\" In Frank Fenter's capacity and role as Managing Director of Atlantic Records European Operations, he played a vital role in having brought Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records and helped discover and sign such British progressive-rock groups as Yes and King Crimson.\n\nAccording to Ahmet Ertegun, Frank Fenter was also \"instrumental in breaking Rhythm and Blues music throughout Europe\", having brought the legendary \"Hit the Road Stax\" tour abroad in the spring of 1967; the tour included the acts Otis Redding, Sam and Dave and Booker T and the MGs. At the start of the European tour, according to renowned producer, Tom Dowd, Fenter suggested he record the live concerts and, with Frank Fenter's direction, Stax Records, a label affiliated with Atlantic Records, experienced a sales jump, with seven of the eleven albums recorded live on the European tour received gold certifications.\n\nIn 1969, Frank Fenter and brothers Phil Walden and Alan Walden, former co-managers of Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, and other Stax artists, formed Capricorn Records with a distribution deal from Atlantic Records. Working with Phil Walden and Jerry Wexler, Frank Fenter negotiated the Capricorn deal with his mentor, Ahmet Ertegun Frank Fenter and Phil Walden envisioned a new kind of record company structure that would be vertically integrated. Capricorn Records would have loosely held subsidiary companies that encompassed all facets of the music business, including artist management, with Phil Walden and Associates; a booking agency, the Paragon Agency; a music publishing house, No Exit Music; and artist merchandising, with the Great Southern Company.\n\nFrank Fenter took the helm of Capricorn Records while Phil Walden focused on artist management where they together pioneered and popularized the music genre known as Southern Rock. At the height of Capricorn Record's success, Fortune magazine, the business periodical, went on to recognize Fenter as a \"Promotional Genius\". Singly or together, the two partners discovered and signed such recording artists as The Allman Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop, Wet Willie, Sea Level, The Dixie Dregs, Jonathan Edwards, Billy Thorpe, Stillwater and Alex Taylor and eventually made Capricorn Records one of the most successful independent recording companies in America.\n\nCapricorn Records declared bankruptcy in late 1979, but, in 1983, Capricorn Records was restructured and ready to forge a comeback, however, in the middle of negotiating a distribution deal with Mo Ostin, the Chairman of Warner Bros. Records, Fenter died of a heart attack in the Capricorn office; and with his death, the deal with Warner Bros. fell apart.\n\nFrank Fenter died in Macon, Georgia, at the age of 47.\n\n"}

The prohibition dates back to the Gambling Act 1935. The Playing Cards Act prohibits private ownership of more than 120 playing cards without approval of the government. Nevertheless, illegal gambling in casinos (Thai: บ่อนการพนัน) and other forms of gambling still exist in Bangkok and some provincial towns.\n\nGambling has long been a feature of Thai society. Local Siamese partook in more than 100 well known gambling games. Some gambling forms such as betting on cockfights, bullfights and boat races are native to Siamese culture.\n\nThe late-19th century marked a significant increase in the level of gambling in Siam. People started to gamble more frequently and a variety of games were introduced from foreign traders and immigrants, and gambling started to hit the mainstream. It was during that period that the Huay lottery was introduced from China and became popular in Siam.\n\nOver the course of decades the Government of Thailand allowed legal gambling dens. During the reign of King Rama III, the Government of Thailand promoted legal gambling dens as a source of revenue. These legal dens were then closed down to dampen criminal activity and bankruptcy related to gambling. During the reign of King Rama V gambling was forbidden in the south and all the remaining gambling venues were closed on 1 April 1917.\n\nA gambling act was first passed in 1930 and revised in 1935. During the premiership of Khuang Aphaiwong, the ministry of finance was assigned by the government to legalize gambling in Pran Buri District, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province and became an official promoter of gambling. However, this period of legalization of casinos did not last long. Under attack from the media and public, the government abandoned the attempt to earn additional revenue from casinos and prohibited gambling once again.\n\nDespite laws against gambling, illegal casinos are widespread in Thailand. The first large-scale gambling houses were established in Ayutthaya by the government in the late-17th century or early-18th century as a result of the steady growth of Chinese population. During the 19th century the number of gambling houses grew in tandem with the population of Chinese immigrants. To promote the settlement and taxation of the Chinese population in Thailand, the Thai government turned a blind eye to gambling among Chinese immigrants. As a result of this inadvertent endorsement, local Siamese were encouraged to gamble as well. After the gambling act was first passed in 1930 casinos were banned completely and gambling was prohibited in Thai society.\n\nThe lottery was introduced to Thailand by Chinese immigrants in 1820. Commonly known to the local as \"huay\", the term is a direct translation of Chinese word \"huā\" (Chinese:花) :flower. In the beginning \"huay\" was mainly played among the community of Chinese immigrants in Thailand. It was then officially established during the reign of King Rama III to stimulate the circulation of currency as well as to generate national revenue.\n\nIn the reign of King Rama VI, the government introduced lottery draws as a device for tax collection. In 1939 the government of Luang Phibun Songkram set up the Lottery Bureau to organize a regular monthly draw in Thailand. It was then extended to twice a month in 1989. Draws normally happen twice a month on the 1st and 16th. There are a total of thirty-eight million tickets per round. 28 percent of the sales value of the lottery ticket is retained as government revenue, 12 percent in administration and management and 60 percent is returned to players as prizes.\n\nFootball is the most recent form of illegal gambling in Thailand. As a result of technology such as online transactions, satellite TV, Internet, and mobile phone betting systems, football gambling has become widely spread among the population of Thailand. During the 2010 South Africa World cup, over 1,700 people were arrested for gambling offences.\n\nThere has long been proscription against gambling within Thai society. In Buddhism, gambling is one of four vices which lead to ruin. In Thai this concept is known as \"abaiyamuk\" (อบายมุข), the \"portals of hell\". For the layperson, gambling is something to be avoided if one wishes to be free from suffering. Thai people often cite an old proverb \"Ten lost to fire is not equivalent to one lost in gambling\" which reflects the variety of social problems associated with gambling in Thai culture. This may include violent crime, financial problems, and gambling addiction. Despite the prohibition, gambling still remains a major part of Thai life. Thais often gamble in various ceremonies and festivals. According to Alan Klima's study of funeral casinos in present-day Thailand, gambling is used as an attraction for people to keep the deceased spirit company.\n\nThere are only a few psychological services available to those addicted, the such as Ministry of Public Health's Center of Gambling Studies. For Thais, gambling—lotteries, casinos, football betting and other variants—are viewed as entertainment. Very few seek treatment from medical professionals as Thais often view gambling as a social problem rather than a medical issue.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3990044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3990044", "title": "Gross out", "text": "Gross out\n\nGross out describes a movement in art (often comic), which aims to shock and disgust the audience with controversial material such as toilet humour, nudity, or any sexual topic.\n\nGross-out is a subgenre of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully \"tasteless\" or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity, unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or Schadenfreude. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24. One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie \"edgy\" and to generate media attention for it.\n\nIn the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious Production Code and its replacement with the MPAA film rating system in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions. Noteworthy examples include 1972's \"Pink Flamingos\" (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by John Waters, and 1974's sketch comedy film \"The Groove Tube\". As these films emerged from the counterculture movement and gained a measure of audience success, they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the lost \"Nell's Eugenic Wedding\" starring Fay Tincher and Tod Browning.\n\nThe label \"gross-out movie\" was first applied by the mainstream media to 1978's \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", a comedy about the fraternity experience at US colleges. Its humor included not only explicit use of bodily functions (like projectile vomiting), but also references to topical political matters like Kent State shootings, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war, and the civil rights movement. It was a great box office success despite its limited production costs and thus started an industry trend. Since then, gross-out films increased in number, and became almost the norm for American comedy films. Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as \"Superbad\", \"Porky's\", \"American Pie\" or \"Eurotrip\"), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as \"There's Something About Mary\", \"The Hangover\" or \"Wedding Crashers\").\n\n\"The Tom Green Show and Jackass\" and its UK cousin, \"Dirty Sanchez\", were the pioneers of \"gross out television\". The shows featured dangerous stunts, nudity, profanity, and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on MTV, and progressed to feature-length movies. \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\", Rugrats, Rocko's Modern Life, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, and \"Animaniacs\" transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen animation largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as \"South Park\", \"Family Guy\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Futurama\", \"Rick and Morty\", Regular Show, American Dad! and \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\nGross-out theater is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the Edinburgh Festival. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous British theaters.\n\nThe prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama \"Trainspotting\" by bestselling playwright and author Irvine Welsh; the controversial New York musical \"Urinetown\" by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous anarchistic schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre \"Restart\" by Komedy Kollective; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the iconic theatrical gorefest \"Bloody Mess\".\n\nControversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer Basil Wolverton invented his trademark \"spaghetti and meatballs\" style of artwork.\n\nVarious artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were Damien Hirst, known for encasing mutilated, rotting cattle in formaldehyde, and making art of endangered marine species such as sharks in formaldehyde tanks, and Tracey Emin, whose exhibit of an unmade bed featured used tampons, condoms and blood-stained underwear.\n\nGross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as hip hop and hard rock, where shock value helps create marketable notoriety. Bands include Blink-182 famous for including breast and fart jokes in their songs, while bands such as Cannibal Corpse and Agoraphobic Nosebleed write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.\n\nProbably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of GG Allin. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.\n\nSometimes the line between truth and urban myth is blurred by the sensationalist sections of the media. For example, Frank Zappa never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving Ozzy Osbourne biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).\n\nSimilar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a single from indie/garage rock band, The Vines.\n\n"}

Plans for a modern irrigation system are moribund due to lack of funds.\n\nMainly affluent Afghans and foreigners frequent the course. The 2005 entrance fee for The Kabul Golf Club (http://www.kabulgolfclub.org) is 750 Afghani ($15 US Dollars) and a year membership is $300 (15,000 Afghani). The club is run by Mohammad Afzal Abdul (also called Mohammed Bashir), its director and golf pro, who worked as a caddy at the course as a young man before fleeing into exile in Pakistan. Business has dropped off since opening as international agency staffing has declined.\n\nOriginally six holes, the course opened in 1967 during the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah, was closed in 1978, and reopened in 2004. During these three decades it has undergone several changes. It was relocated to its present site in 1973 after the king was overthrown in a coup d'état and completely closed following a 1978 communist coup. It was reopened in 1993 but closed again in 1996 when the Taliban regime banned sports. After the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the course was used as an area for military training in the removal of land mines. In the process of restoration to its present state, three Soviet tanks and a multiple rocket launcher were removed by a nonprofit agency.\n\nIn 2004 the Kabul Golf Club was reopened again. During the intervening seven years little has changed. Play on the golf course has been sporadic, and at the mercy of the local security situation. Beginning in 2011, a fund-raising effort has been underway with the goal of restoring the golf course and related facilities. Funds are also being sought to subsidize operations until the war is over, assuming the organization will eventually become a viable business.\n\n"}

The name alludes to the light bluish glare of a black-and-white cathode ray tube TV screen as well as some traditional Russian expressions relating to friendly visits: заглянуть на огонек (\"zaglyanut na ogonyok\") – \"to drop in on a light\", i. e. to visit someone after seeing a light in their window; посидеть у огонька (\"posidyet' u ogon'ka\") – to have a sit by the fire.\n\nThe show featured popular artists and various prominent Soviet people: \"udarniks\", Heroes of Socialist Labor, cosmonauts etc., who sat by the tables in a \"TV cafeteria\", singing songs, playing sketches, boasting, celebrating the holiday. The idea of the show was that they \"dropped in on a light\" to every Soviet family to share the festive table beyond the TV glass.\n\nThe best-known was the New Year's Little Blue Light (, \"Novogodniy Goluboy ogonyok\"), aired on every New Year's Eve as a part of the late Soviet tradition: the \"Little Blue Light\" followed the New Year's speech by the General Secretary of the Communist Party with congratulations to the Soviet people followed by the Kremlin midnight chimes and the State Anthem of the Soviet Union, which was, in turn, preceded by the 1975 film comedy \"Irony of Fate\".\n\nThe \"Little Blue Light\" was devised by film director Aleksey Gabrilovich, and the first show was aired on 6 April 1962 as a weekly Saturday broadcast. After some time it became a monthly show, and later it was only aired on major holidays.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the \"Little Blue Light\" was revived in Russia.\nThe trademark \"Little Blue Light\" is now owned by Russia 1, the television network, where it is still seen today. \n\nIn the 1980s the typical New Year's LBL episode lasted an hour and a half, today the telecast begins at 12:05 am MST and lasts for a whole 3 hours.\n\n"}

The tax credit was signed into law by Gov.

However, because most productions filming in Pennsylvania do not incur a tax liability in the state, the credits are fully transferable, which means they can be sold to a company or individual in the state who does have a tax liability. In order to qualify for the tax credit, the production must incur 60% of its total production expenses within Pennsylvania. The credit also applies to individual television shows that are 15 minutes or longer and intended for a national audience.\n\nWatchdogs, including the Pennsylvania Common Cause criticized lobbyist Leslie McCombs for failing to properly register as a lobbyist for Lions Gate Entertainment while lobbying on behalf of the tax credit.\n\nA 2009 report from the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee in the Pennsylvania General Assembly found that the tax credit supported 4,000 jobs and produced $4.5 million between 2007 and 2008.\n\nDuring the 2009 Pennsylvania budget impasse, the tax credit was in danger of being repealed.

The script, written by Anubhav Sinha and Kanika Dhillon, originated as an idea that Anubhav Sinha got when he saw a television commercial and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a motion sensor-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more powerful than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 2010 and took place in India and the United Kingdom and was overseen by an international crew. The post-production involved 3-D conversion and the application of visual effects, the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among Indian films. With a budget of , inclusive of publicity costs, \"Ra.One\" was the most expensive Indian film at the time of release surpassing the budget of \"Enthiran\". The producers spent out of a marketing budget, which involved a nine-month publicity campaign, brand tie-ups, merchandise, video games and viral marketing.\n\nThe film faced controversies involving plagiarism, content leaks and copyright challenges. Consequently, \"Ra.One\" was theatrically released on 26 October 2011, the beginning of the five-day Diwali weekend, in 2D, 3D and dubbed versions, with three international premieres being held between 24 & 26 October 2011. The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011, and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations.\n\nUpon release, \"Ra.One\" received mixed reviews, with critics praising the visuals and music, but criticising the script and direction. Commercially, the film became the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 domestically, the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 worldwide, and broke a number of opening box office records, though it managed to sustain at the box office after its extended opening weekend. As the film earned more than Rs 170 crores it was considered a Box office Hit and a superhit film as the distributors recovered their investment. The film subsequently won a number of awards for its technical aspects, notably one National Film Award, one Filmfare Award and four International Indian Film Academy Awards.\n\nAanusmita Sharma (Shahana Goswami), an employee of London-based company Barron Industries, introduces a new technology that allows objects from the digital world to enter the real world using the wireless transmissions from multiple devices.\nShekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who also works at Barron Industries, has delivered a number of commercial failures; an irate Barron (Dalip Tahil) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek (Armaan Verma), and upon the request of his wife Sonia (Kareena Kapoor), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be more powerful than the protagonist. His colleague, computer programmer Aanusmita uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Shah Rukh Khan) (Technically \"Good One\" and in Hindi \"Jeevan\", which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically \"Random Access Version One\" and in Hindi \"Ravan\", an ancient demon king) is made faceless. Another colleague, her boyfriend, Aakaashi (Tom Wu), implements the characters' movements. The game, named \"Ra.One\", contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device – the \"H.A.R.T\" (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.\n\nWhen \"Ra.One\" undergoes final tests, Aakaashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID \"Lucifer\" and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Aakaashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Aakaashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Aakaashi is murdered by Ra.One meanwhile, and Ra.One assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.\n\nSonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Aanusmita of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world. Having killed Aakaashi's mother viciously at her house and assumed and accepted Aakaashi's guise to mask his intentions, Ra.One chases Prateek and Sonia on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that she needs him.\n\nSubsequently, Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model (Arjun Rampal), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form (having previously impersonated Aakaashi) to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning local train. The train crashes into the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus, but G.One saves Sonia and others in time. To save Prateek, he returns to the virtual world and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached, leaving Ra.One helpless; furious, the latter creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: \"If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you\". The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, absorbs Ra.One's remains and disappears.\n\nSix months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where Prateek manages to restore G.One to the real world.\n\nThe major characters of \"Ra.One\" were played by protagonists Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor and primary antagonist Arjun Rampal. Supporting roles were played by Tom Wu, Shahana Goswami and child artist Armaan Verma. The film featured cameo appearances by Rajinikanth playing the \"Enthiran\" character Chitti, Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra, the latter two being characters in a dream sequence. Additional minor roles were played by Dalip Tahil and Satish Shah, and an important voice-over was provided by Amitabh Bachchan. Khan performed both as Shekhar and G.One. The titular character Ra.One was enacted by three actors – Tom Wu (Aakaashi), Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor (Sonia Subhamaniam), signifying the character's shape-shifting ability.\n\nKhan was the first actor to be cast in the film. Three actors had initially been considered for the lead female role; Kapoor was ultimately chosen because she insisted on playing the part. Rampal accepted the role of Ra.One after Sinha expressed a strong desire to cast him in the film. Wu was contracted to the film in July 2010, and Goswami was cast one month later. Bachchan agreed to be a part of the film after being requested by Khan and Sinha. Several cast members prepared extensively for their roles; Rampal and Kapoor followed special diets to lose weight, and Verma learnt capoeira. Khan and Verma performed their own stunts, and Kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance.\n\nHowever, the cast did encounter problems during production. Khan faced difficulties with his superhero suit and prosthetic makeup, and injured his left knee. The decision to cast Rampal was met with scepticism due to \"questionable acting abilities,\" a statement Sinha criticised. In addition, Rampal encountered back problems (which were treated by the time production began), prompting speculation of a possible replacement by Vivek Oberoi. Jackie Chan had initially been approached for the role of Aakaashi, but he declined the offer. Rajnikanth suffered from health problems which caused a delay in the filming of his cameo appearance. Dutt faced a scheduling conflict with \"Agneepath\" (2012), which was later resolved.\n\n\nAccording to director Anubhav Sinha, the idea of \"Ra.One\" originated when he saw an advertisement on television which showed children remotely controlling a human. He was attracted to the concept and wrote a script based on it. Sinha then approached Khan, who liked the story and decided to produce the film under his production company Red Chillies Entertainment. Sinha was apprehensive of retaining Khan's support after the former's previous film \"Cash\" (2007) became a commercial failure, but Khan reportedly \"remained unchanged\".\n\nShahrukh Khan felt that the film possessed significant commercial potential, in addition to being a fulfilment of his \"childhood dream\" to be a superhero and to fly. He stated that he wanted to \"make a film that gives me the right to deserve the iconic status that I've got for 20 years.\" He also said that he wanted to make a film dedicated to father-son relationships, which were, in his opinion, \"neglected\" in Bollywood. Khan's idea was to make a simple family drama which expanded into an action film. He declined to make the film in English to increase its appeal for Western audiences, feeling that \"cracking Hollywood on their terms\" was unnecessary. Both Khan and Sinha credited their children for providing encouragement, and regularly \"approving\" the film's execution.\n\nRed Chillies Entertainment continued to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of \"Ra.One\". After providing the visual effects for \"My Name Is Khan\" (2010), the studio focused solely on \"Ra.One\" and did not take up any other films. Khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film, including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar, but they declined; eventually, Sinha was made the film's director. To prepare the film's premises and characterisation, Sinha spent several months viewing video clips, digital art portals and comic books. Sinha and Khan also watched around 200 superhero films from all over the world. The storyboards were designed by Atul Chouthmal, who was contracted after he met Khan at Yash Raj Studios. While the former began work on the storyboards, the producers hired a storyboard artist from Hollywood. Chouthmal revealed that Khan and the other artist differed on their visions of the film, and so he was brought back. Before filming, Khan reportedly took tips from actor Kamal Hassan regarding the production of large-scale films, having been impressed by Hassan's \"Dasavathaaram\" (2008).\nThe title of the film received significant media attention due to it being the name of the antagonist rather than the protagonist. The move was considered innovative, and noted as a sign of the \"rising importance of the villain in Bollywood.\" According to Sinha, the title had not been planned as such, and was ultimately chosen because \"Ra.One\" \"sounded cooler\" than \"G.One\". Khan was advised to name the film after his own character; he declined to do so, citing the inter-dependence between good and evil. He also called Alfred Hitchcock as his inspiration, and pointed out that the antagonists in films like \"Sholay\", \"Mr. India\" and \"Sadak\" were better remembered than the protagonists.\n\nThe crew of \"Ra.One\" featured both Indian and overseas personnel. Nicola Pecorini served as the director of photography, with V. Manikandan providing assistance. Andy Gill and Spiro Razatos were hired as the stunt supervisors, and Nino Pansini was hired as the stunt cinematographer. Sabu Cyril and Marcus Wookey were responsible for the production design. The film's producer was Bobby Chawla, but Gauri Khan later stepped in after the former suffered a brain haemorrhage. Filming took place at a number of studios, notably Filmistan Studios, Film City and Yash Raj Studios in India and the Black Hangar Studios in the UK.\n\nPrincipal photography was initially set to begin in Miami, but the idea was abandoned due to budget constraints. The first phase of filming began in Goa on 21 March 2010 and continued until May. The second and third phases took place in London with the entire cast, beginning in July 2010 and ending in August. The next phase was split into two schedules; the first schedule commenced at Filmistan Studios in the first week of September 2010, while the second schedule began in December 2010 and took place over a seven-day period. The remaining portions were filmed in July 2011 at Film City. A cameo appearance and a music video were filmed in the weeks leading up to the release, the former at the Whistling Woods Studios in Mumbai.\n\n\"Ra.One\" featured three major action sequences, which were filmed in sets and real locations across Mumbai and London. The cinematography borrowed ideas from video games, such as rapid transitions between first-person and third-person perspectives. Procedures such as bullet time were also incorporated into the film. The production design was closely associated with the lighting and cinematography to facilitate smooth filming. However, filming faced a number of difficulties including increasing costs, delays and safety constraints. In addition, differences between Khan and Sinha caused tensions on the sets.\n\nAs with the filming crew, the post-production crew of the film included both Indian and overseas personnel. Prime Focus carried out the film's 3-D conversion, with London-based colorist Richard Fearon performing the color grading. Red Chillies VFX partnered with a number of visual effects studios around the world, and undertook the incorporation of the visual effects under the supervision of Jeffrey Kleiser. Nvidia provided the information technology–based software utilised for the effects, while Edwark Quirk supervised over the computer-generated imagery used in the film. Resul Pookutty was responsible for the film's sound design.\nThe idea for converting the film to 3-D was put forth during filming, and was implemented in July 2011 due to a revived interest in 3-D films. The process required 2,600 artists to convert 4,400 shots of the film. The sound design involved bridging the real and the virtual world, and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the Dolby Surround 7.1 system. Incorporating the visual effects began in April 2010, and was preceded by extensive research. 1,200 artists worked for 2½ years to complete the visual effects work. A number of complex procedures were executed, including cubical transformations and the design of the faceless form of Ra.One.\n\nDespite precautions, the post-production faced significant delays owing to the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in the completion of the visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.\n\nThe body suits worn by Khan and Rampal were designed by Robert Kurtzman and Tim Flattery, and made by a team of specialists based in Los Angeles. Sinha spent around three months conceptualising the costumes, watching various superhero films to design a costume not created already. He then wrote a 23-page document with his sketches and details of what he wanted, and gave it to the designers to work upon. To create the suit, Khan was required to enter a small chamber where a warm latex-like liquid was released up to his neck and allowed to solidify, forming the mould which was then peeled off his body. The suit was joined by a concealed zipper and subsequently modified. Computer-generated embellishments such as light beams and electricity were added to the suits after Khan expressed dissatisfaction with the initial rushes of the film. A total of 21 costumes were made for the film, with each suit reportedly costing .\n\nKhan's suit was made of reinforced latex, coloured steel-blue and fitted with micro-computer circuitry. Rampal's suit was made of three-inch thick solid rubber, and was red in color. Both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact. Wearing the suits created a number of difficulties for the actors. It took 20 minutes to put on the suits and 40 minutes to remove them. In addition, the non-porous nature of the suits created intense heat inside, causing excessive perspiration despite the presence of special air conditioning ducts. Khan later felt that the suits' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day; digital adjustments to the suits brought \"all the efforts to naught.\"\n\nManish Malhotra designed the look and the costume of Kareena Kapoor for the song \"Chammak Challo\", which received widespread media coverage. Kapoor wore a red \"sari\" draped in the style of a \"dhoti\". Since the release of the song, the costume was termed a \"fashion rage,\" becoming popular in India and some overseas countries. Fashion experts applauded the costume and Kapoor's ability to carry it off \"stunningly,\" though certain experts dismissed the naming of the \"sari\" color.\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Ra.One\" was composed by Vishal-Shekhar, with the lyrics being written by Atahar Panchi, Vishal Dadlani and Kumaar. A. R. Rahman provided the background score for a single sequence. Sinha announced that R&B singer Akon and the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra would be a part of the soundtrack; the former lent his vocals for \"Chammak Challo\" and \"Criminal\", while the latter performed in \"Bhare Naina\". The composers obtained the official license to use Ben E. King's \"Stand By Me,\" on which they based the song \"Dildaara.\" The soundtrack contains fifteen tracks, including seven original songs, four remixes, three instrumentals and an international version of \"Chammak Challo\". The music rights were bought by T-Series for . The Hindi version of the soundtrack was released on 12 September 2011; the Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 10 October 2011, featuring six tracks each.\n\nIn India, the Hindi version of \"Ra.One\" was released across more than 4,000 plus screens worldwide- 3,100 screens in 2,100 theatres, breaking the record for the widest Bollywood release previously held by \"Bodyguard\" (2011). The Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 275 prints and 125 prints respectively. A week before the release, multiplex owners throughout India decided to allot 95% of the total available screen space to the film. Overseas, \"Ra.One\" was released in 904 prints. This including 600 prints in Germany, 344 prints in the USA, 200–300 prints in South Korea, 202 prints in the UK, 79 prints in the Middle East, 75 prints in Russia, 51 prints in Australia, 49 prints in Canada and 25 prints in New Zealand and Taiwan. In early October 2011, a partnership deal was being finalised by the distributors to allow the film to be released in China across 1,000 prints. In addition, the film was released in Pakistan and non-traditional territories like Brazil, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hong Kong. The 3D version was released in 550 screens across the world. \"Ra.One\" was noted for the extensive use of digital prints, reportedly making up 50–60% of the total release; in India, the film was exhibited in over 1,300 digital theatres, breaking the record previously held by \"Bodyguard\". The wide digital release was implemented to lower distribution costs, make the film accessible to a wider audience and reduce piracy. However, despite the measures taken, pirated versions of \"Ra.One\" were available on the Internet within hours of the film's release.\n\nThe producers of \"Ra.One\" spent out of a marketing budget, of this was utilised for internet promotions alone. The film's first theatrical poster was released in December 2010, and was followed by the release of two teaser trailers during the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. The first theatrical trailer premiered three months later. Khan and Sinha undertook a multi-city tour during which they unveiled a 3,600 feet-long piece of fan mail to collect audience messages. The official website of \"Ra.One\" was launched on 31 May 2011, and an official YouTube channel for the film was subsequently unveiled. On 20 October 2011, Khan held a live chat with fans on Google Plus, the first time an Indian film personality had done so. Rampal's look in the film, which had been kept secret, was revealed in late October 2011.\n\nThe film's marketing utilised merchandise and games to facilitate the creation of a franchise. Khan marketed merchandise related to the film, which included toys, tablets and apparel. On 14 October 2011, a gaming tournament featuring games like \"Call of Duty\" was conducted in Mumbai and telecast live on YouTube. Red Chillies Entertainment partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe to create \"Ra.One – \"The Game\",\" a game for PlayStations which was released on 5 October 2011. The producers further collaborated with UTV Indiagames to design a social game titled \"Ra.One Genesis\", with an independent plot based on G.One, in addition to designing digital comics based on the film's characters.\n\nIn May 2011, the first rushes of \"Ra.One\" were shown to the cast of Khan's other home production \"Always Kabhi Kabhi\" (2011). Subsequently, the film was screened for test audiences to study and gauge the film's appeal across different age groups. A few days prior to the theatrical release, Khan arranged a special screening of the film's final cut in Yash Raj Studios, where he invited close friends, his family and the film's crew. Between 24 and 26 October 2011, \"Ra.One\" had international premieres in Dubai, London and Toronto, all of which were chosen due to their international significance and large South Asian populations. The premiere in Dubai was held on 24 October 2011 at the Grand Cinemas, Wafi. A high-profile dinner and charity auction followed, where Khan raised AED30,000 (approximately US$8,200) to build a workshop for children with special needs. The premiere included three simultaneous screenings of the film, for which tickets were placed on sale for the public. The premiere in London took place at the O Cineworld the following day, and the premiere in Toronto took place at the TIFF Bell Lightbox on 26 October 2011.\n\n\"Ra.One\" was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification on 14 October 2011 to receive its viewership rating. The Board raised strong objections to the film's action scenes, fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts. The police and the Indian Railways security force had made similar objections to the train-based stunts in the film, claiming that youngsters would \"blindly imitate them\" and hence put their lives at risk. The film was finally passed with a 'U' certificate without cuts, but under the condition that prominent disclaimers were shown, stating that the stunts were computer-generated and should not be imitated. The British Board of Film Classification rated the film 12A for \"moderate fantasy violence\". In March 2012, a \"Mid-Day\" report alleged that \"Ra.One\" had received a favourable rating, pointing out that the producers had violated the rules by meeting the Board officials during the screening.\n\nThe film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to \"\" (1991), the \"Batman\" series, \"Iron Man\" (2008), \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" (2010) and \"\" (2010). Khan denied the allegations, saying, \"I got inspired from a lot of superhero movies but the movie is original. In fact, \"Ra.One\" will be the first superhero-based movie in the world in which the superhero lives in a family.\"\n\nA few days before the release, screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that \"Ra.One\" resembled a concept that he had developed several years before. Patnaik appealed to the Bombay High Court to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit. The court, observing \"prima facie\" evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film. However, Patnaik challenged the court's decision and demanded that the producers give him credit and not cash. Sinha later claimed that he alone had developed the film's story.\n\n\"Ra.One\" also faced cybertheft and hacking issues. On 3 June 2011, three days after its launch, the official website of the film was hacked by suspected Pakistani cyber criminals who stated that the act was in revenge for a similar attack on a Karachi press club website. The hackers defaced the homepage and left a note threatening the Indian Press Club. Despite precautions, the song \"Chammak Challo\" was leaked several months before the official release of the soundtrack. Khan clarified that the leaked song was a \"rough version\" of the actual song, and that the person responsible for the leak was being looked for. He subsequently refuted claims that the leak had been engineered as a publicity stunt.\n\nThe television broadcasting rights for \"Ra.One\" were bought by Star India for a then-record sum of , surpassing \"3 Idiots\" (2009). The Indian television premiere of \"Ra.One\" took place on 21 January 2012 on STAR Gold, garnering a 28% market sharefor the channel and a TVR of 6.7. Star India subsequently syndicated the television screening rights to Disney XD, where it premiered on 2 June 2012. In May 2012, International Media Distribution announced that \"Ra.One\" would be televised on Comcast and Cox, as a part of the celebrations of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Discovery Channel tied up with Red Chillies Entertainment to produce a one-hour program titled \"\"Revealed: The Making of Ra.One\",\" which aired on the channel on 30 March 2012. The program discussed the making of the film in detail, including the visual effects and the challenges faced while filming.\n\nEros International released the DVD of \"Ra.One\" on 13 December 2011 across all regions in one-disc and two-disc packs complying with the NTSC format. The DVD of the film contained alternate endings. Initially, Khan had wanted to add alternate endings to the theatrical release itself, but later deemed it risky. The DVD version was made interactive as well. VCD and Blu-Ray versions of the film were also released.\n\nUpon release, \"Ra.One\" received mixed reviews from critics in India and generally positive reviews overseas. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 67% of 21 critics gave \"Ra.One\" a positive review, with an average critic rating of 5.6/10, granting the film a \"Fresh\" consensus. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean from film reviews, \"Ra.One\" holds a rating of 60% based on eight reviews, signifying \"mixed or average reviews.\"\nPositive reviews described the film as an ambitious initiative and a technological success, with some critics thinking that \"Ra.One\" had put Indian films on par with Hollywood. The visual effects received near-universal praise, though dissenting opinions stated that they were \"all over the place\". The action sequences were also widely praised. Other aspects of the film received more polarising opinions, and one very positive review was criticised for \"over-rating\" the film. Mixed views were opined regarding the plot's gaming concept, with some critics deeming it \"far-fetched\" and others lauding the \"gaming-style aesthetics\". Similarly, some critics called the emotional scenes \"fulfilling\" while others felt them to be \"lacking in connect with the audience\".\n\nThe story was negatively received by several critics, with a number of them deeming it to be disappointing and lacking in originality; one critic praised the original idea but criticised its \"Bollywoodization\". The direction was criticised in a number of reviews, though a few critics praised Sinha's pacing of the film and the execution of the action sequences. Some critics pointed to the presence of scenes which were not child-friendly, despite \"Ra.One\" being promoted as a children's film. Particular reviews criticised the lack of character development and the film's \"incoherently hackneyed morality\". A few critics panned the film as a whole, describing it as a \"mess\"; one review commented, \"It's convenient to say that if you have no expectations from the film, you wouldn't be disappointed.\"\n\nAfter its release, \"Ra.One\" received numerous nominations and awards in India and abroad, a majority of them for its technical aspects. The film notably won the National Film Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Special Effects, and four International Indian Film Academy Awards. The film also received several business awards for its marketing and distribution. On the other hand, the film received negative (\"dishonorable\") awards as well. \"Ra.One\" won the titles of Worst Film and Worst Director at the Golden Kela Awards, and also won the Worst Film award at the Ghanta Awards.\n\nThe budget of \"Ra.One\" was the subject of significant speculation prior to its release. A number of estimates placed the budget between and . It was universally accepted that the film was the most expensive Bollywood film of all time, with certain sources stating that the film was the most expensive Indian film ever. The original budget was revealed to be after promotional expenses. Khan stated that he had \"worked very hard\" to finance the film without borrowing money, and reportedly hosted a just to finance the film. \"Ra.One\" earned from pre-release revenue sources, setting a new record for Bollywood films.\n\nThe extensive marketing campaign greatly increased audience expectations of the film. \"Ra.One\" set records for the level of pre-release buzz for a Bollywood film, and also topped a number of polls gauging the most awaited Bollywood films of the year. Anticipation for the film was equally high among the trade analysts, with some commenting that the film would pass the mark in one week and the mark in over three weeks. Advance bookings commenced on 20 October 2011 on a limited scale, and expanded later. While initial ticket sales were low, they picked up considerably near the release date. A few days prior to the release, the advance booking was described as \"phenomenal,\" with an overall advance booking rate of 20–25% across the country. A number of advantages of the film's release were pointed out, such as the festive season and higher 3D ticket prices, though there had been doubt regarding the timely release of the 3D version.\n\nIn India, \"Ra.One\" debuted at the beginning of the five-day Diwali weekend, and subsequently broke the Diwali opening day record. The film then set the records for the biggest single-day net revenue and the biggest three-day opening weekend earned by a Bollywood film, breaking the previous records held by \"Bodyguard\".\n\nSubsequently, the film began to suffer significant drops in its collections, with its five-day extended weekend and nine-day extended week coming second to the records of \"Bodyguard\". The film faced an 84 percent drop in collections in its second week and fell a further 90 percent in its third week, the latter primarily due to the release of \"Rockstar\". The dubbed versions showed similar trends. The Tamil and Telugu versions together earned around nett.\n\nIn overseas markets, \"Ra.One\" earned the highest three-day and five-day opening weekends among the Bollywood releases of 2011; by its second weekend, the film had become the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 in overseas markets, but the collections suffered drops throughout. In general, families and children formed the major portion of the film's audience, and the 3D version is regarded as a success.\n\nReports of a planned sequel of \"Ra.One\" began surfacing prior to the film's release, though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown. Both Khan and Sinha admitted to formulating plans for a sequel, though the former noted that it would be \"presumptuous\" to start the sequel before the first film's release. Khan later refuted the speculations, saying that a sequel was unlikely due to his other commitments. After \"Ra.One\" won a National Award, an \"overjoyed\" Khan said that the film's world could be further explored. He stated that the sequel, if made, would be titled \"G.One\" and not \"Ra.Two\", and that he would make it \"faster, bigger and better\" than \"Ra.One\". Khan was reported to be looking for a script, without a fixed release date. In April 2012, Mushtaq Sheikh said that the pre-production of the sequel had begun. A number of reports stated that Kareena Kapoor would not be a part of the sequel.\n\nDespite Khan's enthusiasm for the idea of a sequel, the film industry expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker Rajkumar Gupta commented, \"It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier.\" Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, \"It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made.\" Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel \"a bad idea.\" Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, \"If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was.\" Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, \"Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment of your time and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?\"\n\n"}

A special \"Signature Series\" Sharper Image edition was released, sporting a metallic red color. Furthermore, a special \"Bulldog\" version, sporting a re-sculpted head and painted on eyes, was created for sale at RadioShack stores.\n\nIn 2007, after the release of new robots, RoboPets were repackaged to include Mini RoboPets. The Mini RoboPets wind-up and walk. \n\nRoboPets are extremely Fragile, Legs easily fall off or the plastic chips and breaks over time.\nGearboxes were easily Jammed up.\nOn the First edition of roboPet the legs were protected just by springs so the legs would fall off\n\nLike the other WowWee products to date, the Robopet can be programmed. It has 9 remote-control accessible tricks and 5 direction functions (forward, backward, left, right, and stop) which can be sequentially placed into a 20 step program. \n\nIt also features \"Good Dog\" and \"Bad Dog\" buttons which either encourages or discourages it from performing recent \"tricks\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3411908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3411908", "title": "Samsara (2011 film)", "text": "Samsara (2011 film)\n\nSamsara is a 2011 American non-narrative documentary film, directed by Ron Fricke and produced by Mark Magidson, who also collaborated on \"Baraka\" (1992), a film of a similar vein. \"Samsara\" was filmed over five years in 25 countries around the world. It was shot in 70 mm format and output to digital format. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and received a limited release in August 2012.\n\nThe official website describes the film, \"Expanding on the themes they developed in \"Baraka\" (1992) and \"Chronos\" (1985), \"Samsara\" explores the wonders of our world from the mundane to the miraculous, looking into the unfathomable reaches of humanity's spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, guided meditation.\"\n\n\"Samsara\" is directed by Ron Fricke and produced by Mark Magidson. The pair had collaborated on \"Baraka\" (1992) and reunited in 2006 to plan \"Samsara\". They researched locations that would fit the conceptual imagery of saṃsāra, to them \"meaning 'birth, death and rebirth' or 'impermanence'\". They gathered research from people's works and photo books as well as the Internet and YouTube, resources not available at the time of planning \"Baraka\". They considered using digital cameras but decided to film in 70 mm instead, considering its quality superior. Fricke and Magidson began filming \"Samsara\" the following year. Filming lasted for more than four years and took place in 25 countries across five continents. Three years into filming, the pair began assembling the film and editing it. They pursued several pick-up shoots to augment the final product.\n\nThe crew used three 70 mm cameras for filming; two cameras manufactured by Panavision and one specialty time-lapse camera designed by Fricke. While the scenes were captured on 65 mm negative film, they were output to Digital Cinema Package (DCP), a digital output. Magidson described the process, \"We're doing a combination of what we think is the best of both technologies, the best way to image capture and then the best way to output. Once we get into the digital environment, we're able to refine the imagery, we're able to save shots that we'd have to otherwise trash really for various reasons.\" Where they cut their negatives for \"Baraka\", the negatives for \"Samsara\" were scanned then worked on digitally. The pair used the Telecine process to format the film to ProRes for the editing process and used Final Cut for editing.\n\nThe crew filmed from a bird's-eye view a scene of pilgrims surrounding the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. A 40-floor building was recently constructed next to the mosque that surrounded the Kaaba, so the filmmakers were able to film the pilgrims with permission of the building's owner.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Michael Stearns, Lisa Gerrard, and Marcello De Francisci. Stearns collaborated with the filmmakers on \"Baraka\" and \"Chronos\", and Gerrard also collaborated with them on \"Baraka\". Unlike \"Baraka\", \"Samsara\" was edited without music, and the composers worked on numerous sequences as separate pieces. The filmmakers then connected the sequences. Magidson explained of the pieces, \"It's a piece of music you can listen to as music as well that interprets their feelings to know that imagery in that sequence visually, so they're kind of interpreting it musically.\" The scoring process lasted between six and seven months.\n\nFricke and Magidson emphasized avoiding a particular political view in assembling the film. Fricke said, \"We just try to keep it in the middle and then we form little blocks of content and then we set them aside until we had enough. We did all of this without music or sound effects. We just let the image guide the flow and then we started stringing the blocks together.\" Nicolas Rapold of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Samsara's lack of a specific message is \"a departure from similarly expansive, globally conscious nonfiction films in vogue now, like the critically acclaimed work of Michael Glawogger ('Workingman's Death,' which depicts the same sulfur mines as 'Samsara') and Nikolaus Geyrhalter ('Abendland') that also serve as probing sociological critique.\"\n\n\"Samsara\" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2011. In March 2012, Oscilloscope Laboratories acquired the rights to distribute \"Samsara\" in the United States. The film had a limited release in two theaters on , 2012. By its fifth weekend (September 14–16), \"Samsara\" had expanded to 60 theaters and achieved the highest-grossing documentary release of 2012. On , distributor Oscilloscope Laboratories announced that at $1.8 million in box office earnings, \"Samsara\" had become the highest-grossing film in Oscilloscope's (relatively short) history.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 77% based on reviews from 77 critics and reports a rating average of 7 out of 10. It reports the critics' consensus that \"it's a tad heavy-handed in its message, but Samsara's overwhelmingly beautiful visuals more than compensate for any narrative flaws.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 65% based on 23 reviews, reflecting \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\nKenneth Turan, reviewing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", called \"Samsara\" \"as frustrating as it is beautiful.\" Turan expressed frustration that the filmmakers did not name the more obscure locations, such as the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center in the Philippines. The critic also took issue with some of the film's \"disconcerting\" images. Turan concluded, \"Some of the connections made are too obvious, like following images of ammunition with a portrait of a severely wounded veteran, while others are completely elusive. Shots of the devastation Katrina left behind in New Orleans are beautifully spooky, but does it say anything useful to follow that with images of Versailles? The makers of 'Samsara' want to free our minds, but their technique makes us their prisoners more often than not.\"\n\nIn the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert awarded \"Samsara\" a full four stars, writing that it provided \"an uplifting experience\" through its use \"of powerful images, most magnificent, some shocking, all photographed with great care in the highest possible HD resolution.\" Ebert extolled the film's capturing of images of what may eventually be lost to humanity and noted that there were also images that could reflect the reason for these losses. Katie Walsh, writing for indieWire's \"The Playlist\", applauded \"Samsara\"s \"technical achievements\" and noted that the film used the \"intellectual montage\" technique. Walsh said the film was similar to \"Man with a Movie Camera\", but took \"the idea to new global and spiritual heights.\" She said of the film's entirety, \"While one can discuss the technical prowess of these shocking and beautiful images, it doesn't do justice to the spiritual cinematic power of this work.\"\n\n\"Samsara\" was filmed in nearly one hundred locations across 25 countries over the course of five years. Some locations include: Angola, Brazil, China, Denmark, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel/Palestine, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Mali, Myanmar, Namibia, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and United States.\n\nAngola\n\nEgypt\n\nEthiopia\n\nGhana\n\nMali\n\nNamibia\n\nChina\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIsrael\n\nPalestinian territories\n\nJapan\nJordan\nMyanmar\n\nPhilippines\nSaudi Arabia\nSouth Korea\nThailand\nTurkey\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nItaly\n\nBrazil\n\nUnited States\n\n\n"}

With the fanbase described by some people as an ironic liking towards the series, there have been several sexually explicit memes based on the title character. The most notable example is a 2013 metameme centered on a video called \"Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life,\" which is based on a post originating on 4chan's /b/ board. Fans of Shrek are known as \"Brogres\", a take on the name \"Bronies\", the teen and adult fans of the show \"\". A \"Shrek Filmmaker\" movement of Source Filmmaker animators making videos based on the Internet's obsession towards the character has also occurred. According to \"New York\", Shrek was \"one of the patron saints of the elaborate and complex culture of Dank Memedom.\"\n\nThe 2001 film \"Shrek\", based on William Steig's novel of the same name, garnered acclaim from critics and won an Oscar, while \"Shrek 2\" (2004) was, at the time, the highest-grossing animated film ever at the North American box office. However, Dave Sims of \"The Atlantic\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"The Wire\" marked the second film as the start of the decline in quality and commercial success of the franchise, writing that none of the sequels was remembered due to the jokes' relying on \"cheap topical gags and flimsy celebrity cameos.\" He noted that \"the joke of Shrek's mediocrity was then filtered through the Internet's many weird joke filters, which end up in a weird mix of sincerity and surrealism.\" While fans had been creating and posting their own comics and pictures of Shrek depicted outside of the films on DeviantArt ever since \"Shrek\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2001 release, \"it took about 11 years for the Internet's Shrek obsession to go from cute to cult-like\" as \"The Daily Dot\" wrote.\n\nShrek's official Facebook page was launched by DreamWorks on December 1, 2009, and was used to promote the products and spin-offs of the franchise, with the title character \"speaking\" to his fans through posts. These posts were very popular, garnering 1,000 to 2,000 more views than the typical promotional post at the time. \n\nIn 2010, the year of the release of \"Shrek Forever After\", a comic on DeviantArt titled \"Shadow begs Shrek” was posted by user camera, and paired Shrek with Shadow the Hedgehog, a character from the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series. A Kotaku writer stated that a possible reason for the pairing was that both characters \"tried to act like they were too cool for 'kid stuff.' Too sophisticated, too edgy. They were made for each other—and approximately one billion people between the ages of 12 and 34.\" It went viral, and what followed was several memes, including what \"The Week\" journalist Scott Meslow described as \"awful puns, half-assed Photoshops, bizarre fan fiction,\" most of them sexually explicit, and a horror game revolving around Shrek stalking the player through a swamp. There have been lists compiling online Shrek fan art, including a January 2014 list by Chloe Cole of the CollegeHumor site Dorkly of \"The Most Upsetting Shrek and Shadow Fan Art On the Internet\", and official Smosh website writer Daniel Dominguez's list of \"20 Uncomfortably Sexual Pieces Of Shrek Fan Art\", published in November 2013.\n\nMay 2012 marked the launch of ShrekChan, a 4chan-esque imageboard for fans of Shrek to satirically and occasionally seriously comment on anything related to the \"Shrek\" series. Fans of \"Shrek\" are nicknamed \"brogres\", which is a take on the name of the young adult fans of \"\" known as . The board had garnered 500,000 visitors as of March 22, 2014. In 2013, Shrek's online popularity went to what \"The Daily Dot\" described as a \"whole new demented level\" with a fanmade video called \"Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life.\", an adaptation of a story posted on 4chan describing a sexual encounter between a nine-year-old boy and Shrek after the boy's father reprimands him for his Shrek obsession. A metameme based on this was posted on 4chan's paranormal board on January 31, 2013, which led to many \"deranged illustrations\" posted online influenced by the post. Many duplications of the video were also uploaded, with the video and its replicas garnering over 90 million views as of May 2016.\n\nOn March 25, 2014, the video was a \"Cartoon Brew pick\", and the award was number 13 on their \"Top 20 Stories of 2014\" published on the site. The video was also put by Gizmodo writer Ashley Feinberg's list of the \"11 of the Weirdest Videos on YouTube\".\n\nIn 2014, ShrekChan was shut down with a message from the board's founder: The Shrek meme is dead, and it's time to stop trying to keep this going. It is inevitable and it has to happen at some point in time. Many of you who truly love the Shrek movies may think that shutting down ShrekChan is a bad idea, but I hope that you may find another website to discuss the love for Shrek.\n\nA \"Shrek Filmmaker\" movement in which Source Filmmaker animators made videos based on the Internet's obsession with \"Shrek\" was described by a \"PC Magazine\" journalist as \"One of the craziest and funniest underground Source Filmmaker movements\". The videos involve the character placed in \"glitchy worlds of horrifying imagery and Smash Mouth references.\" These videos have included parodies such as \"Shrek It Ralph\" and \"Shreking Ball\", as well as the crossover with R. L. Stine's series of novels \"Goosebumps\" \"Shrek Gets Spooked\", which had close to two million views by October 2015.\n\nIn November 2018, comedy group 3GI, organizer of Shrekfest, released a shot-for-shot parody remake of the film \"Shrek\" made by a crew of over 200 artists, titled \"Shrek Retold\".\n\nPurposely-bad fan art and animation of \"Shrek\" and loyalty towards the song \"All Star\" by pop rock group Smash Mouth, which played in the first film of the series, are also considered traits of the Internet's obsession towards Shrek. Sims wrote that one possible reason of Shrek's Internet fanbase was that the franchise was a depiction of \"everything that was initially exciting and then quickly patronizing\" about the early 2000s, saying that \"It's symbolic of so many things we briefly loved before quickly realizing their emptiness.\" He also said that with many other memes, Occam's razor is a factor: \"Shrek has a funny, stupid face, and putting that face in a weird place provokes a cheap laugh.\" The online appreciation of Shrek has also been described as ironic. Know Your Meme's former researcher Amanda Brennan described it as a \"subversion of brony culture, again taking something relatively childish with good intentions and flipping it to an ironic appreciation.\" Sims shared a similar sentiment by noting that, like other memes, it was \"one giant agreed-upon joke. No one ever admits that the \"Shrek\" series is a cinematic masterpiece, even though DreamWorks drove it into the ground as hard as it possibly could.\"\n\nAlan Hanson, a contributor for The Awl who made fun of ShrekChan and similar fansites, found the darker side of the Internet's obsession towards Shrek: A lot of Shrek content is him making awful faces, being very leery. Children's movies and fairytales are already inherently very dark, and Shrek on its own tries to show the even darker side of that, so it's almost the natural progression to get into the real \"swamp\" of Shrek, the \"Drek\" as they say. If Shrek is love, Drek is everything that's not Shrek/love. He described a fan's apartment as a \"swamp,\" which \"is lovely because it's your place, made of the things that comfort you, even if they're gross and unliked by others.\" He said that a person who is against loving Shrek can be called a \"Farquaad. Then it gets pretty derogatory past that, lot's [sic] of f-words and n-words unfortunately.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2669944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2669944", "title": "Singapore Flyer", "text": "Singapore Flyer\n\nThe Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. Described by its operators as an observation wheel, it opened in 2008, construction having taken about 2½ years. It carried its first paying passengers on 11 February, opened to the public on 1 March, and was officially opened on 15 April. It has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each able to accommodate 28 passengers, and incorporates a three-storey terminal building.\n\nThe Flyer has an overall height of and was the world's tallest Ferris wheel until the High Roller, which is taller than the Flyer, opened on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, US, on 31 March 2014. The previous record holder, the Star of Nanchang, in Jiangxi, China, is tall, although its diameter wheel is larger than the Flyer's wheel.\n\nThe Singapore Flyer was first conceived in the early 2000s by Patrick MacMahon of Melchers Project Management, a subsidiary of German company Melchers. Formal planning commenced in 2002. A new company, Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd, was formed as the developer, with Melchers Project Management holding a 75% stake, and the remainder held by Orient & Pacific Management.\n\nThe project was formally announced and endorsed on 27 June 2003 by the Singapore Tourism Board with the signing of a memorandum of understanding, formalising the understanding between the developer and tourism board with regard to the land-acquisition process. Under this agreement, the tourism board was to purchase the plot of land in Marina Centre from the Singapore Land Authority, and lease it to Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd for 30 years with an option to extend the lease by another 15 years. The land was to be rent-free during the construction phase of the project. In July 2003, Jones Lang LaSalle was appointed as the real estate advisor. Takenaka and Mitsubishi were selected as the main contractors, and Arup as the structural engineer.\n\nEarly designs showed a tall wheel similar to the London Eye, drawing criticism that it lacked originality. The developers pointed out that the design was not finalised and was merely for conceptualisation purposes, though the final project changed little from the early designs. Subsequently, the project was to grind almost to a halt when the developer faced difficulties in sourcing funds to build the wheel. Original plans to complete the wheel by the end of 2005 were thus postponed indefinitely, and there were reports (denied by the Singapore Tourism Board) that the tourism board has set an ultimatum date of 31 March 2005 for the developer to iron out its financial issues and to keep the development going.\n\nBy September 2005, the project was revived when funds were successfully sourced from two German banks. Collin William Page, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO, was to provide equity to a maximum of S$100 million, with a further S$140 million coming from HypoVereinsbank. With this injection of S$240 million, the largest single foreign investment in the Singaporean entertainment industry, construction was slated to begin by the end of the month. The stakeholders then were AAA Equity Holdings, Melchers Project Management, and Orient & Pacific Management.\n\nIn August 2007, Florian Bollen, Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd chairman, raised his stake in the Singapore Flyer from 60% to 90% through acquisition of Melchers Project Management's 30% stake. The deal was done via AAA Equity Holdings, a private investment vehicle headed by Bollen. Orient & Pacific Management, which spearheaded the project development management, owns the remaining 10%.\n\nThe development has a gross building area of approximately , built on a site along the Marina Promenade. Designed by Arup and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries with a capacity of up to 7.3 million passengers a year, the normally constant rotation of the wheel means that a complete trip lasts approximately 32 minutes.\n\nThe Flyer's 28 air-conditioned capsules are mounted outboard of the rim of the wheel structure, providing continuously unobstructed views. Each capsule has a floor area of and is capable of holding 28 passengers, or up to five wheelchairs and 15 other visitors when booked in advance for use by disabled guests.\n\nThe wheel initially rotated in a counter-clockwise direction when viewed from Marina Centre, but on 4 August 2008 this was reversed on the advice of Feng shui masters.\n\nWheelchair ramps and lifts, handicapped toilets, and a dedicated parking lot for the disabled are also provided.\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony was held on 27 September 2005, with Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development, as guest of honour. The spindle was fitted on 13 December 2006, and the outer rim was completed on 9 April 2007. Installation of the passenger capsules began on 3 August 2007 and was completed on 2 October 2007.\n\nThe Flyer opened in 2008. During Chinese New Year, corporate 'inaugural flights' were held from 11 to 13 February, tickets for which sold out for S$8,888 (US$6,271), an auspicious number in Chinese culture. The first public rides were on Valentine's Day, 14 February, the soft launch on 1 March, and the official opening on 15 April, at which prime minister Lee Hsien Loong was guest of honour.\n\n\nIn March 2010, Great Wheel Corporation, a consultant for the Singapore Flyer, was one of several companies named in a report alleging embezzlement, lodged with the prosecutor's office in Berlin, Germany. Transfers of €3 million to companies in the Virgin Islands and UK, and monthly payments of €40,000 from the Berlin wheel's project company, Great Berlin Wheel, to its linked company Great Wheel in Singapore, are questioned. A prosecutor's office spokesperson said: \"We understand there were false contracts concerning non-existing deals, and these contracts were made to take the money for private concerns.\"\n\nFlorian Bollen is chairman of both Great Wheel Corporation, registered in Singapore as GWC Holdings, and Singapore Flyer Pte Ltd. A spokesperson for the Singapore Flyer said: \"The giant observation wheel in Berlin is separate from the Singapore Flyer and it is separately owned and operated. Great Wheel Corporation is also a separate entity from the Singapore Flyer. Any investigations relating to the Berlin wheel and Great Wheel Corporation have no effect on and no relationship with the Singapore Flyer's operations and finances.\"\n\nOn 28 May 2013, the Singapore Flyer announced that it was in receivership. Accounting firm Ferrier Hodgson has been appointed as the receiver and manager of the company's charged assets. Ferrier Hodgson said it is looking into identifying investors to manage and enhance the Singapore Flyer, and will ensure smooth operations at the Flyer throughout the receivership.\n\nOn 2014, Merlin Entertainments, the British firm behind the famous London Eye and Legoland theme parks abandoned its talks to acquire the S$240-million tourist attraction located in the city of Singapore. The discussions between the receiver, Ferrier Hodgson and Merlin Entertainments were reported to have begun but the talks between the two parties had broken down. The Singapore Tourism Board reportedly said that discussions are still ongoing with other stakeholders, although it declined to confirm if the talks were with another potential buyer. This crumpled the future for the observation wheel, which have gone through financial difficulties since 2010. \n\nOn 28 August 2014, Straco Leisure Pte. Ltd. announced the acquisition of Singapore Flyer. Straco Leisure Pte. Ltd. is 90% owned by Straco Corporation Limited, a Singapore listed company that operates tourist attractions in China such as the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium and Underwater World Xiamen. The remaining 10% is owned by WTS Leisure Pte. Ltd., one of the largest private tour bus operators in Singapore.\n\n\n"}

All three games in the series tell the story of young Ernie Eaglebeak, a student at the prestigious Sorcerer University, as he progresses through his studies, learning the arcanes of magic, taking part in student life, and meeting beautiful women.\n\nThe games take place in a fictional world called Peloria, which appears like a modern society, however magic has the place of science. Peloria is mostly occupied by the Fizzbuttle Ocean with islands where the player travels throughout the game.\n\nThe player character is Ernie Eaglebeak, a teenager just out of high school living in the town of Port Gecko, pining for his sexy neighbour Lola Tigerbelly and struggling in a seriously bad relationship with his stepfather, Joey Rottenwood. A break-through in his miserable life comes when he gets accepted by the Sorcerer University, a prestigious university of magic. After a dashing escape from Rottenwood's custody, Ernie makes his way to SU and enrolls as a freshman.\n\nThe player learns magic, explores the university, reads the (rapidly deteriorating quality of) student newspaper, and can watch the University's (comedically pseudoscientific) lectures which provide some backstory concerning the mythology of Peloria. In the meantime, Ernie is interested to know females such as the university president's daughter Gretchen Snowbunny or Hillary, the young wife of his ancient advisor Otto Tickingclock. Suddenly SU gets attacked by mysterious foes who kidnap Tickingclock and take away the Sorcerer's Appliance, a powerful magical device which could become extremely dangerous in inappropriate hands. Ernie has to recover the device.\n\nEquipped with his spell book and a magical guided surfboard, Ernie sets out on a mission to several islands on the Fizzbuttle Ocean in search for items that will aid him in getting into the sinister Fort Blackwand. And everywhere on the way he finds places where the Great Attachments required by the Sorcerer's Appliance to operate used to be located, but are gone now.\n\nThe islands visited are:\n\nThe player can learn spells and obtain items during his quest until Ernie can take on the challenge of the fort and confront the mastermind behind the theft of the Sorcerer's Appliance, who turns out to be Joey Rottenwood, his own stepfather. In a climactic final showdown Ernie manages to shut down the Appliance's self-destruct system by burying it, along with Rottenwood, under a pile of whale dung, and frees all the prisoners, including his presumed-dead real father.\n\nAt the epilogue, everybody returns to the University, where Ernie gets scolded for irresponsibility, given a hefty bill and abandoned by Lola, but he still gets to advance a year.\n\n\"Spellcasting 101\" is a text adventure game. However, much like all other games of this sort produced by Legend it runs in graphics mode (up to EGA) and takes advantage of certain EGA capabilities. While the traditional type-your-command approach is still possible, one can also assemble commands from words displayed in lists on the screen by clicking on them with the mouse; second, a graphical representation of the present location is also displayed on the screen and certain operations can be performed by clicking on different parts of the image as well. Finally, a compass rose is visible on the screen at all times, which in addition to enabling movement by clicking on it shows valid movement directions for the present location.\n\nUnlike many text adventure games, \"Spellcasting 101\" uses sound - with sound card support for music and sound effects played over the internal speaker using the RealSound technology.\n\nSimilar to the famous earlier risqué work of Meretzky, \"Leather Goddesses of Phobos\", \"Spellcasting 101\" offers two gameplay modes of differing levels of sexual content. In the default, \"nice\" mode the females Ernie encounters have to be satisfied by such means as entertaining them, performing chores and so on, whereas in the \"naughty\" mode, such situations are resolved by sexual intercourse; the latter also replaces some of the images displayed by the game with more graphic (albeit not pornographic) versions.\n\nSome of the sexual content is also present in \"nice\" mode and sometimes is important to gameplay. For example, at one point of the game, in preparation of a party Ernie receives a spell from a fellow student whose purpose is to increase bust size, and promptly uses it to transform a stone bust into a makeshift ladder.\n\nThe game features a two-part copy protection system, with the first one involving filling in the gaps in Ernie's enrollment records with information from the registration form and class schedule enclosed with the game, at the time of him enrolling at the university, and the second using the enclosed map to obtain co-ordinates for various locations Ernie must visit on the Fizzbuttle Ocean. The word list interface makes breaking the copy protection by trial and error possible.\n\nErnie Eaglebeak is the protagonist. A somewhat nerdy young man in his late teens, he wants to become a sorcerer and win the heart of Lola Tigerbelly. Although inexperienced, he is a good magician, whose passion for the arcane arts is rivaled only by his enormous sex drive. Unlike another Don Juan of the gaming world, Larry Laffer, most of the time he succeeds at his advances, with his \"one true love\" being seemingly the only woman he's never managed to get into bed.\nMost other characters tend to get Ernie's name wrong, in which he is resembled by another adventure game protagonist, Guybrush Threepwood.\n\nLola Tigerbelly is Ernie Eaglebeak's long-time neighbour and one true, secret love. The feeling is not mutual though, as the secrecy aside she is much more interested in athletic, jock-like and \"rich\" types than in her nerdy neighbor. She likes shopping and is very shallow, although beautiful.\n\nJoey Rottenwood is Ernie Eaglebeak's stepfather. He passionately hates Ernie and makes his life as miserable as possible, up to the point of having him be essentially a prisoner at his own home, living in a locked room with a straw mat for bed and a chamberpot for other needs, and planning to thwart Ernie's plan to enroll at the Sorcerer University. Initially portrayed as a run-of-the-mill drunkard hating Ernie just for being another man's son, Rottenwood eventually turns out to be the arch-villain of the game, having sworn revenge against the Sorcerer University after being kicked out for cheating, and his attitude towards Ernie is a result of a prophecy he had once heard stating that young Eaglebeak would foil his plans.\nThere is much more to Joey Rottenwood than meets the eye. In spite of his superficially bad temper and a tendency to drink too much he appears to have almost infinite patience. Planning his revenge took him 30 years, not to mention the fact he went through the trouble of faking Ernie's father's death and marrying Ernie's mother to keep an eye on Ernie. Moreover, despite his abrupt departure from SU, Joey appears to possess quite good knowledge of magic. Much like Biff Tannen from the Back to the Future trilogy, he has a tendency to have his plans thwarted by getting buried under large amounts of dung.\n\nGretchen Snowbunny is a daughter of the SU president Aaron Snowbunny.

She has a habit of having sex with her dinner guests once her husband has fallen asleep.\n\nFollowing the closure of Infocom, designer Steve Meretzky began to work as a remote contractor for other game companies. During this period, Legend Entertainment founder Bob Bates contacted him about the possibility of developing a direct spiritual successor to Meretzky's Infocom title \"Leather Goddesses of Phobos\", because of that game's commercial success. Meretzky felt that this was an unwise decision, and talked Bates into applying the comedy of \"Leather Goddesses\" to fantasy fiction, rather than repeating the earlier game's science fiction theme. \"Spellcasting 101\" was the result of these discussions. The game's interface derived from Bates' work on the canceled Infocom game \"The Abyss\", in development at the time of Infocom's closure. Legend subsequently chose to build on this foundation in its own games.\n\nMeretzky personally disliked the interface of \"Spellcasting 101\". He noted in retrospect, \"The impetus for the interface was not a particular feeling that this was a good/useful/friendly/clever interface for playing adventure games, but rather a feeling that text adventures were dying, that people wanted pictures on the screen at all times, and that people hated to type.\"\n\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" named \"Spellcasting 101\" as the 11th funniest game ever.\n\n\n"}

The largest waves are usually seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. Some of the spots for surfing in India are Mangalore, Manipal, Kapu Beach and Murdeshwara in Karnataka, Mahabalipuram, Kovalam (Covelong) and Manapad in Tamil Nadu, Kovalam Kovalam and Varkala in Kerala, Little Andamans and Lakshadweep.\n\nStand up paddling and surfing as in the current form was not a familiar sport to Indians, until recently when things started to change, starting with the coastal villages and the coastal communities. \"The kids here are born and brought up around these waters and this sport comes too easily to them,\" says Madhumathi of Bay of Life Surf School\n\"You power the board. It does not need any mechanism\", And once you start paddling, you will be introduced to the vast eco-system that is right in your backyard. There are mangroves, schools of dolphins; we've even spotted a whale shark once- says Madhumathi Ravi \n\nThe first surf camp in India happened in 2011 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, organised by Bay of Life in association with The Surfing federation of India marked the beginning of surfing as a popular, organised sport in the country.\n\n\"There are, it must be said, big pluses and minuses about surfing in India. The greatest plus point right now about grabbing your surf board and heading to the ocean anywhere in the country, is that you will not have too much company. That was a key factor that attracted Ed Templeton and his wife Sofie, the co-owners of Surf & Soul in Varkala. \"The surf was good, the water warm, and the most attractive part was that there was nobody else in the water. Where else in the world do you get that?\" says Ed.\n\nOn most days the waves are likely to be quite gentle—anywhere between 2 ft and 5 ft. The waters are good enough for most surfers. You can go stand up paddling any time of the year. The best time for surfing is between September and November and then again in March, April and May. June, July and August are only suitable for professionals.\n\nIndia's beaches does not have a consistent life guard program except few regions like Goa or Kovalam in Chennai (run independently by Bay of Life Chennai) hence it's better you surf with a buddy at all times.\nTry already explored surf spots first:\nIt's sensible to first cover familiar surf spots in India before attempting to search for new ones. This way you get familiar to Indian environments, currents and local knowledge before attempting remote locations.Watch out for Currents:\nIt's better to familiarise yourself with rips and currents pertaining to the surf spot by asking around and talking to fellow surfers, local fishermen of that area.\nLocal Culture and Activities: \nMake sure you dress appropriately for different beaches in India, some regions are more orthodox than the others. Drinking on the beach, dressing provocatively might sometime invite unwanted trouble. \nWatch out for that fishing boat!\n\nSurfing Federation of India is the governing body for surfing in India.

The tawaifs excelled in and contributed to music, dance (mujra), theatre, and the Urdu literary tradition, and were considered an authority on etiquette. Tawaifs were largely a North Indian institution central to Mughal court culture from the 16th century onwards and became even more prominent with the weakening of Mughal rule in the mid-18th century. They contributed significantly to the continuation of traditional dance and music forms\n\nThe patronage of the Mughal court before and after the Mughal Dynasty in the Doab region and the artistic atmosphere of 16th century Lucknow made arts-related careers a viable prospect. Many girls were taken at a young age and trained in both performing arts (such as Kathak and Hindustani classical music) as well as literature (ghazal, thumri) to high standards. Once they had matured and possessed a sufficient command over dancing and singing, they became a \"tawaif\", high-class courtesans who served the rich and noble.\n\nThe \"tawaif's\" introduction into her profession was marked by a celebration, the so-called \"missī\" ceremony, that customarily included the inaugural blackening of her teeth.\n\nIt is also believed that young nawabs-to-be were sent to these \"tawaifs\" to learn \"tameez\" and \"tehzeeb\" which included the ability to differentiate and appreciate good music and literature, perhaps even practice it, especially the art of ghazal writing. By the 18th century, they had become the central element of polite, refined culture in North India.\n\nThese courtesans would dance, sing (especially ghazals), recite poetry (shairi) and entertain their suitors at mehfils. Like the geisha tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose among the best of their suitors.\n\nSome of the popular tawaifs were Begum Samru (who rose to rule the principality of Sardhana in western UP), Moran Sarkar (who became the wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh), Wazeeran (patronised by Lucknow’s last nawab Wajid Ali Shah), Begum Hazrat Mahal (Wajid Ali's first wife who played an important role in the First War of Independence), Umrao Jaan (1981), Gauhar Jaan (a notable classical singer who sang for India's first-ever record), and Zohrabai Agrewali.\n\nThe annexation of Oudh by the British in 1856 sounded the first death-knell for this medieval institution. It soon was not favoured by the British, and the women were branded as prostitutes to defame them. Social reformers opposed them as social decadence. The institutions survived until India's Independence. Some of the famous Tawaifs include :\n\n\nThey used to be the only source of popular music and dance and were often invited to perform on weddings and other occasions. Some of them became concubines of maharajas and wealthy individuals. With the emergence of movies and record industry, they lost popularity.\n\nThe image of the tawaif has had an enduring appeal, immortalized in Bollywood movies. Films with a tawaif as a central character include \"Devdas\" (1955), \"Sadhna\" (1958), \"Pakeezah\" (1972), \"Amar Prem\" (1972), \"Umrao Jaan\" (1981), \"Tawaif\" (1985), \"Pati Patni Aur Tawaif\" (1990), \"Devdas\" (2002), and \"Umrao Jaan\" (2006) and documentary film, \"The Other Song\" (2009). Other films depict a tawaif in a supporting role, often in situations where a man in a loveless marriage goes to her.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The María Guerrero Salon is the theatre's main hall. Its 456 m (4,900 ft) stage features a 12 m (39 ft) rotating circular platform and can be extended by a further 2.7 m (9 ft). The Guerrero Salon can seat 860 spectators, including 512 in the galleries. A secondary hall, the Orestes Caviglia Salon, can seat 150 and is mostly reserved for chamber music concerts. The Luisa Vehíl Salon is a multipurpose room known for its extensive gold leaf decor.\n\nThe Cervantes Theatre of Buenos Aires owes its existence, in part, to the 1897 relocation to Argentina of Spanish theatre producer María Guerrero and her company, who popularized professional stage theatre in Argentina. A commercial success at the Teatro Odeón, her adaptations of classics in Spanish literature took her to theatres nationwide. Following the opening of a number of large, ornate opera houses and stage theatres in Argentina, Guerrero and her husband, Fernando Díaz de Mendoza, set aside a share of their fortune in 1918 for the creation of their own grand theatre house. The project caught the attention of both local high society and the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII, who collaborated with its construction by commissioning artisanal fixtures, material and elements of stagecraft for the theatre, built accordingly in Spanish baroque style and named in honor of Spain's legendary novelist and dramatist, Miguel de Cervantes. \nThe Cervantes Theatre was inaugurated on September 5, 1921, with a production of Lope de Vega's \"La dama boba\" (\"The Foolish Lady\"). The proliferation of theatres in Buenos Aires and the advent of the radio in Argentina soon eroded the Cervantes' audience base, however, and in 1926, the couple was forced to auction the institution. Lamenting this turn of events, National Music Conservatory Assistant Director Enrique García Velloso pesuaded President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear (whose wife, Regina Pacini, had been an opera chanteuse and was an avid patroness of the arts), to create the National Stage Theatre at the ailing Cervantes. The theatre also became home of the National Comedy Theatre in 1933. A massive fire in 1961 nearly destroyed the Cervantes, a misfortune leading to the aging house's extensive modernization, including the construction of a 17-story annex. The main hall itself was rebuilt according to its original specifications and the renovated institution was reopened in 1968. Tireless advocacy on the part of Lito Cruz (one of the best-known figures in Argentine cinema and theatre) led to Congressional passage of a National Theatre Law in 1997, providing yearly subsidies for the art and for the designation of the Cervantes itself as an official entity.\n\n"}

{"id": "4195398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4195398", "title": "The Mountain Road", "text": "The Mountain Road\n\nThe Mountain Road is a 1960 war film starring James Stewart and directed by Daniel Mann. Set in China and based on the 1958 novel of the same name by journalist-historian Theodore H. White, the film follows the attempts of a U.S. Army major to destroy bridges and roads potentially useful to the Japanese during World War II. White's time covering China for \"Time\" magazine during the war led to an interview with former OSS Major Frank Gleason Jr., who served as head of a demolition crew that inspired the story and film. Gleason was later hired as an (uncredited) technical consultant for the film.\n\nThe film is a rather somber treatment of World War II and includes themes that were taboo for Hollywood during the war years, such as tensions between allies and racism among American troops. The protagonist is a frustrated and morally conflicted U.S. officer unsure about the value of his mission. For these reasons, \"The Mountain Road\" is often labeled anti-war. But it was made with the cooperation of the Pentagon, and it is much more respectful of the military as an institution than are the well-known anti-war films of the 1960s and '70s.\n\nAs a World War II combat veteran, Stewart had vowed never to make a war movie, concerned they were hardly ever realistic. \"The Mountain Road\" was the only war movie set during World War II in which he starred as a combatant. Stewart, however, had been featured in a wartime short, \"Winning Your Wings\" (1942) and in a civilian role in \"Malaya\" (1949). Harry Morgan, another cast member in \"The Mountain Road\", later said he believed that Stewart made an \"exception for this film because it was definitely anti-war.\"\n\nIn 1944, engineer Major Baldwin (James Stewart) is ordered to blow up an airfield as well as strategic roads and bridges to help American troops in China retreat from the Japanese army. General Loomis (Alan Baxter) is reluctant to send Baldwin due to his inexperience as a commander, but relents. Baldwin, accompanied by reluctant conscripts, Sergeant Michaelson (Harry Morgan), Prince (Mike Kellin), Lewis (Eddie Firestone), Miller (Rudy Bond) and Collins (Glenn Corbett), the demolition team's translator, Baldwin finds out from Colonel Li (Leo Chen), the Chinese commander that the Japanese are about to capture a munitions dump. Colonel Kwan (Frank Silvera) is assigned to the team but before they can embark, Madame Sue-Mei Hung (Lisa Lu), the American-educated widow of a Chinese officer, joins them, with Baldwin gradually becoming attracted to the widow.\n\nBaldwin blows up a bridge and pushes a truck over a cliff to keep on pace, trying to reach the munitions dump before the Japanese. Sue-Mei and Baldwin are at odds over his cavalier treatment of the Chinese when he resorts to blowing up a mountain road, leaving thousands of local Chinese refugees trapped. After stopping at a village because Miller is ill, Collins tries to give out the surplus food the team has brought, but is trampled to death by starving villagers. Baldwin is furious and resolute in trying to complete his mission, finally successful in blowing up the munitions storage, but when one of his trucks is stolen by Chinese bandits, Miller and Lewis are also killed. Baldwin exacts revenge by rolling a gas barrel into the bandits' outpost and setting the village on fire. Baldwin asks Sue-Mei to understand why he had to act that way, but there is no reconciliation between them as the gulf of two divergent cultures is too great and she leaves him. Although recognizing his retribution was fundamentally excessive and brutal, Baldwin radios his report to headquarters, and is praised for fulfilling his mission.\n\nActor and screen credits:\n\nAlthough the Japanese invaders were the feared antagonists, they never appear, as \"The Mountain Road\" diverges from the typical World War II actioner in dealing with a more sensitive sub-plot, delving into the cultural misunderstanding and racial prejudice between American soldiers and their Chinese allies. White's original story had a serious message that stemmed from his extended sojourn in China, first as a freelance reporter in 1938 and shortly after as correspondent for \"Time\" magazine. White found his stories depicting the corruption of the Nationalist government and warning of the growing threat of Communism being rewritten by Chinese government officials with the cooperation of editors at his magazine. When he left his post and returned to the United States, in 1946, White and colleague Annalee Jacoby, wrote a best-selling nonfiction book \"Thunder Out of China\", describing the country in wartime. His follow-up novel, \"The Mountain Road\" also reflected his interest in a China in turmoil.\n\nDuring planning, a number of actors and production staff were \"penciled in\" including Marlon Brando and Robert Mitchum in the male lead role with Chinese actress Dora Ding as the female lead, James Wong Howe to be the director of photography, and even adding Don Rickles, then making a name as a \"second banana\" in films. Lisa Lu, who played \"Madame Sue-Mei Hung\", in her first major role, recruited P. C. Lee, Leo Chen, Richard Wang and C. N. Hu, faculty members from the Chinese Mandarin Department, Army Language School, to appear in the film.\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 9, 1959 with location filming taking place at Arizona locations. The set for the Chinese village was erected on the Horse Mesa Dam Road, 40 miles east of Phoenix; another set was erected in the vicinity of Superstition Mountain. The Fish Creek Hill Bridge on the Apache Trail was revamped to resemble the Chinese wooden bridge that is blown up in the action and the temple set, ammunition and supply station as well as the airfield were erected in Nogales. The battle scenes were filmed at the Columbia Ranch in Burbank, California. The extreme heat at the locations caused frequent cases of heat prostration among the cast and crew. Production wrapped on August 20, 1959.\n\nAlthough a minor film in James Stewart's repertoire, \"The Mountain Road\" was received favorably, if considered somewhat puzzling. \"The New York Times\" reviewer, Howard Thompson noted, \"Even with its final, philosophical overtones, this remains a curiously taciturn, dogged and matter-of-fact little picture—none too stimulating ... bluntly, and none too imaginatively.\" \"Variety\" focused on Stewart's role, \"As played by James Stewart, the American major holds the film together.\"\n\nWhite himself had mixed feelings about the film. In his memoirs he describes seeing it at a theater in Times Square where a group of teen-agers sitting behind him cheered the explosions and the \"mad American destruction\" of the village. Then their leader said \"The hell with it. That's the best part of the picture. The rest is crap.\" White wrote that he came to agree, saying that he had written the ending based on his experience as a reporter at the time, \"refusing to acknowledge guilt in Asia. . . . \" But by the time he wrote his memoirs, he had come to feel that the \"reality of the twenty-five-year-long American record in Asia was that of genuine good will exercised in mass killing, a grisly irony which White could master neither in film nor book. Asia was a bloody place; we had no business there; novel and movie should have said just that at whatever risk.\"\n\n\"The Mountain Road\" is available on VHS tape (1.33 : 1 P&S), but not released on DVD. It has also been televised on the American GetTV network.\n\n"}
{"id": "4070265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4070265", "title": "ToonTalk", "text": "ToonTalk\n\nToonTalk is a computer programming system intended to be programmed by children. The \"Toon\" part stands for cartoon. The system's presentation is in the form of animated characters, including robots that can be trained by example. It is one of the few successful implementations outside academia of the concurrent constraint logic programming paradigm.\n\nIt was created by Kenneth M. Kahn in 1995, and implemented as part of the ToonTalk IDE, a software package distributed worldwide between 1996 and 2009. Since 2009, its specification is scholarly published and its implementation is freely available.\n\nBeginning 2014 a JavaScript HTML5 version of ToonTalk called ToonTalk Reborn for the Web has been available. It runs on any modern web browser and differs from the desktop version of ToonTalk in a few ways. ToonTalk programs can run on any DOM element and various browser capabilities (audio, video, style sheets, speech input and output, and browser events) are available to ToonTalk programs. Web services such as Google Drive are integrated. ToonTalk Reborn is free and open source.\n\nBeyond its life as a commercial product, ToonTalk evolved via significant academic use in various research projects, notably at the London Knowledge Lab and the Institute of Education - projects Playground and WebLabs, which involved research partners from Cambridge (Logotron), Portugal (Cnotinfor and the University of Lisbon), Sweden (Royal Institute of Technology), Slovakia (Comenius University), Bulgaria (Sofia University), Cyprus (University of Cyprus), and Italy (Institute for Educational Technology of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche). It was also source of academic interest in Sweden, where Mikael Kindborg proposed a static representation of ToonTalk programs and in Portugal, where Leonel Morgado studied its potential to enable computer programming by preliterate children.\n\nToonTalk was influenced by the Janus computer programming language and the Actor model. The main communication abstraction in ToonTalk is the bird/nest pair. When you (the programmer or a robot) give a thing to a bird, she flies to her nest and puts the thing in it, then returns. If one or more things already occupy the nest, the bird puts the new one underneath the others.\n\nA ToonTalk program is a sequence of rules, where each rule has a head and a tail. The head is a pattern that can be matched against the argument, which must be a tuple. In ToonTalk's presentation, a rule appears as a robot, a program as a team of robots, and a tuple as a box that can have any number of holes or compartments in which things may be placed. The alphabet of things includes number pads, text pads, other boxes, robot teams, birds, nests, and things from some other categories. A process consists of a box with a team of robots working on it. If none of the patterns matches the box, the process suspends. Otherwise, the first rule that matches, fires. The end of the tail of the rule can either destroy the process, or continue it with the same team. In case the pattern calls for something other than an empty nest where an empty nest is present, the process suspends until some bird should place something on the nest (usually as a result of the actions of other processes). A nest with something on it matches the pattern as though the nest were not there, just the (top) something. The actions in the tail also manipulate the something rather than the whole nest. Consequently, a nest can be used to program a future.\n\nToonTalk can be given an imperative reading or a declarative reading. If we ignore certain constructs designed to facilitate I/O, we can see ToonTalk as not having any shared access to mutable memory. The bird/nest mechanism resembles the communication in the Actor model, but with the additional power to be able to pass nests around and for a process to hold more than one nest (which is also true in Janus). A difference between communication in the Actor model and in ToonTalk is that ToonTalk preserves the order of the messages; however, ToonTalk can also provide an indeterministic merge of message streams.\n\n"}

Since its inception, Vatican Radio has been maintained by the Jesuit Order. Vatican Radio preserved its independence during the rise of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Following the outbreak of World War II, a week after Pope Pius XII ordered the programming, Vatican Radio broadcast the news that Poles and Jews were being rounded up and forced into ghettos.\n\nToday, programming is produced by over two hundred journalists located in 61 different countries. Vatican Radio produces more than 42,000 hours of simultaneous broadcasting covering international news, religious celebrations, in-depth programs, and music. The current general director is Father Federico Lombardi, S.J.\n\nOn 27 June 2015, Pope Francis, in a \"motu proprio\" (\"on his own initiative\") apostolic letter, established the Secretariat for Communications in the Roman Curia, which absorbed Vatican Radio effective 1 January 2017, ending the organization's 85 years of independent operation.\n\nVatican Radio began broadcasting with the callsign HVJ on two shortwave frequencies using 10 kilowatts (kW) of power on 12 February 1931, with the pontificial message \"Omni creaturae\" of Pope Pius XI. Also in attendance was Guglielmo Marconi and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who would become Pope Pius XII Its first director was physicist Giuseppe Gianfranceschi, who was also the president of the Accademia dei Nuovi Lincei.\n\nIn 1933, a permanent microwave link was established between the Vatican Palace and the summer residence of the papacy, Castel Gandolfo.\n\nIn 1936, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recognized Vatican Radio as a \"special case\" and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On 25 December 1937 a Telefunken 25 kW transmitter and two directional antennas were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.\n\nFollowing a December 1939 report from Cardinal August Hlond of Poznań detailing the oppression of the Catholic Church in Poland, Pope Pius XII decided, among other measures, to use Vatican Radio to provide \"information regarding the condition of the church in Poland.\" The German broadcast on 21 January 1940 compared German activities to \"what the Communists imposed on Spain in 1936\"; the English service noted the attacks on the Church were not limited to the Soviets.\n\nDuring World War II, Vatican Radio's news broadcasts were (like all foreign broadcasts) banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.\n\nWhile some critics have said Pope Pius XII was too quiet regarding the Holocaust, Jacques Adler examined the transcripts of wartime broadcasts over the Vatican Radio. Adler argues that it exposed Nazi persecution of the Church and opposed collaboration with Nazism. It appealed to Catholics to remain true to their faith's injunctions: to defend the sanctity of life and the unity of humankind. In so doing the Pope pursued a policy of spiritual resistance to Nazi ideology and racism.\n\nIn 1948, services expanded to 18 languages.\n\nBecause of space purposes, the Holy See acquired a 400-hectare area located 18 kilometres north of Rome at Santa Maria di Galeria (GC: ). The Italian Republic granted the site extraterritorial status in 1952.\n\nIn 1957, a new broadcasting center was placed into operation, with a Philips 100 kW shortwave transmitter, two 10 kW shortwave transmitters, and one 120 kW mediumwave transmitter, with 21 directional and one omnidirectional antenna. The next phase involved two 100 kW transmitters aimed at Africa and Oceania, a 250 kW mediumwave transmitter for Europe, and a 500 kW transmitter for the Far East and Latin America.\n\nRadio Vaticana was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.\n\nIn the 21st century, Vatican Radio has experimented with digital transmission technologies (DRM, T-DAB, T-DMB) and has used electronic newsletters, podcasts, and other new technologies to distribute its programming. Vatican Radio and CTV began their own YouTube channel in 2010, operating in four languages, and operates six Twitter accounts.\n\nIn May 2009 it was announced that Vatican Radio would begin broadcasting commercial advertisements for the first time in July. The decision was made so as to meet the radio's rising costs, namely 21.4m euros a year. All advertisements would have to meet \"high moral standards\". Vatican Radio stopped transmitting short- and medium-wave broadcasts to North America, South America, and Europe on Sunday 1 July 2012. The Vatican Press Office closed Vatican Information Service in August 2012.\n\nIn 2014 Michael Gannon, from Ireland, became the first person with Down Syndrome to work at any Vatican office, which he did as an intern at Vatican Radio.\n\nAs of 2016, Vatican Radio had a staff of 355 people who produce more than 66 hours of daily programming in 45 languages on air, and 38 languages on the website. Programs are broadcast via short wave, medium wave, FM and satellite.\n\nVatican Radio has been losing between €20 and €30 million annually. With its absorption into the Curia's Secretariat for Communications on 1 January 2017 Vatican Radio director Msgr. Dario Viganò has indicated that he plans to pare down short-wave radio operations and institute cost control measures in the service's other broadcast operations.\n\nOn 24 March 2017, Vatican Radio made its final English-language shortwave transmission to Asia after 59 years of service. Vatican Radio's English Service for Asia has then continued online.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the station made experimental television broadcasts. However, apart from a brief experimental revival in the 1950s, it was not until the 1990s that a regular 'satellite' television service began. The programs of TV2000 include programming from Vatican Television Center.\n\nThe signals are transmitted from a large shortwave and medium-wave transmission facility for Radio Vatican. The Santa Maria di Galeria Transmitter was established in 1957 and it is an extraterritorial area in Italy belonging to the Holy See. Vatican Radio's interval signal is a well-known sound on shortwave radio.\n\nThe most interesting aerial is the one for the medium wave frequency 1530 kHz, which consists of four 94 metre high grounded free standing towers arranged in a square, which carry wires for a medium wave aerial on horizontal crossbars. The direction of this aerial can be changed.\n\nThe Santa Maria di Galeria transmitter site is the subject of a dispute between the station and some local residents who claim the non-ionising radiation from the site has affected their health and a study by cancer specialist Dr. Andrea Micheli has suggested that electromagnetic radiation from the antennas has caused excess risk of leukaemia and lymphomas in children. These claims are not accepted by the station and are not peer reviewed.\n\n\n\n"}

She would come to prefer doing male roles exclusively, saying that \"I felt that I could express myself better if I were dressed as a boy.\"\n\nUnder her father's management, Vesta toured extensively in 'the provinces', as towns and cities outside London were known. While she appeared on stage at St George's Hall in Nottingham most frequently – her father was the chairman of the hall – she also performed in other towns such as Birmingham, Hull, Leicester, Derby and Liverpool. Successful from the outset, by age 11 her salary supported her parents and siblings as well.\n\nThe first decade of her career saw her billed most often as 'the Great Little Tilley'. The gender ambiguity of her name was causing problems for audiences, however, so she and her manager father were asked to come up with another. She was billed as Vesta Tilley for the first time in April 1878, when performing at the Royal Music Hall in Holborn, London. \"Vesta\" referred to both the Roman goddess of hearth and home, and a brand of safety matches; \"Tilley\", a diminutive of Matilda, was what she was called as a child.\n\nEarly on, Vesta performed the songs of Sims Reeves and songs written for her by her father. These included sentimental pieces such as 'Poor Jo', where she played the character of a workhouse child. Other sentimental songs would follow, such as 'Squeeze Her Gently', 'The Pet of Rotten Row', and 'Strolling along with Nancy', songs made popular by Reeves.\n\nAs she grew older, she followed in the footsteps of other male impersonators, performing songs where she portrayed young men behaving either embarrassingly or badly. Among these characters were the titular 'Burlington Bertie' and a clerk on holiday at the seaside ('The Seaside Sultan'). These were intended to be comical and allowed the audience to laugh at the inflated egos of these characters. Equally comical was the play on her identity as a woman and the subject matter of many of her songs. 'When the right girl comes along', 'Following in Father's Footsteps', 'I'm the Idol of the Girls' and 'It's Part of a Policeman's Duty' are a few examples.\n\nAside from the misbehaving boys, she also played a number of military characters, particularly during the Boer War and the First World War.\n\nShe also played the principal boy in a number of pantomimes. She played the role of 'Pertiboy' in 'Beauty and the Beast' at the Birmingham Theatre Royal during the 1881–82 season; she later appeared there in 1885-86 in the title role of 'Robinson Crusoe'. She was best known for her role as the eponymous 'Dick Whittington'; a role she reprised throughout her career. Notably, she also appeared in the Drury Lane pantomime for the 1882–83 season production of 'Sinbad' (in the role of Captain Tra-la-la) and 1890–91 season's production of 'Beauty and the Beast', where she played the prince.\n\nA true professional, she would spend months preparing the new character types she wanted to represent on stage. These roles had a slightly mocking edge, furthering her popularity among the working class men in her audience. She was wildly popular among women as well, who viewed her as a symbol of independence. Newspaper reports of her performances emphasised how popular she was throughout the country, drawing capacity crowds in England, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Wales. Often, people were turned away from the theatre as all space, including standing room, had been allocated. In some cases, theatre proprietors were able to ('obliged to' in their parlance) raise ticket prices for her week-run in their theatre. As at the time ticket prices were set regardless of the performers arriving that week, Tilley's ability to sell out even when prices were raised indicates her immense popularity.\n\nAs a celebrated vaudeville star, she laid the foundation stone of the Camberwell Empire and Sunderland Empire Theatre in 1906. The Sunderland Empire survives and has a bar named in her honour across the road from the venue.\n\nHer career reached the US as well, and in 1912 she performed at the first Royal Variety Performance as 'The Piccadilly Johnny with the Little Glass Eye': \"The most perfectly dressed young man in the house\".\n\nTilley's popularity continued during the First World War, when she and her husband ran a military recruitment drive, as did a number of other music hall stars. In the guise of characters like 'Tommy in the Trench' and 'Jack Tar Home from Sea', Tilley performed songs like \"The Army of Today's All Right\" and 'Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier'. This is how she got the nickname 'Britain's best recruiting sergeant' – young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show. \n\nShe was prepared to be a little controversial. Famously, for example, she sang a song \"I've Got a Bit of a Blighty One\", about a soldier who was delighted to have been wounded because it allowed him to go back to Britain and get away from extremely deadly battlefields.\n\nTilley performed in hospitals and sold war bonds.\n\nThere were a number of other stars at the time who were women cross-dressed as men, including Bessie Bellwood, Ella Shields, Hetty King, Millie Hylton and Fanny Robina. Once she became a household name, Tilley made an effort to underline her femininity off stage, to protect herself against criticism and allow her to continue to push boundaries in her career. She wore the latest fashions off stage, glamorously clad in fur and jewellery, as befitted her role. Another way she reinforced her feminine image was through her ongoing involvement with children's charities in the towns and cities where she performed (she had no children of her own).\n\nVesta's farewell tour took a year to complete between 1919 and 1920. All proceeds were given to a local children's charity in the city where the performances took place, with a guarantee of £500 per city, Tilley making up the difference if necessary. She made her final appearance at the Coliseum Theatre, London, at the age of 56. When she gave up the stage, one of the main reasons she gave was that her husband wanted to become an MP, and her profession was not really respectable enough for such a milieu; arguably, she was too well known and outshone him as a public figure, which was a concern. For the rest of her life she lived as Lady de Frece, moving to Monte Carlo with her husband upon his retirement from politics.\n\nShe married Walter de Frece at Brixton Register Office, south London, on 16 August 1890.\n\nHer husband was knighted in 1919 for his own services to the war effort, with Tilley becoming Lady de Frece. He was elected Conservative MP for Ashton-under-Lyne in the 1920s and then for Blackpool.\n\nHer autobiography, \"Recollections of Vesta Tilley\", was published in 1934. Vesta Tilley died in London in 1952, aged 88. Her body was buried alongside her husband, at Putney Vale Cemetery and a black granite memorial marks the spot.\n\n"}
