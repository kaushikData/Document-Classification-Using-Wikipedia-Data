It was certified gold in 1994. It is the third installment of the \"Alive\" series. The recording of \"Alive III\" took place over multiple dates (in Cleveland, Detroit and Indianapolis) during the band's 1992 tour in support of \"Revenge\".\n\nIt was the first live album the band had released since 1977's \"Alive II\", and the first live recordings released since 1984's \"Animalize Live Uncensored\" concert film. The recording of \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" was actually recorded at one of the band's soundchecks, but had the crowd overdubbed in the song to make it appear as if it is \"live,\" which led to speculation that many other songs on \"Alive III\" could be overdubbed, just as was done on the first two in the series. \n\nThe album is the only live Kiss album released during the group's non-makeup era, excluding \"Kiss Unplugged\", released later in 1996. During the recording of \"Alive II\", Kiss did not want to duplicate songs from \"Alive!\", although some songs from \"Alive III\" are duplicate songs from their previous live albums. For example, \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" was performed on \"Alive!\" and again on \"Alive III\", but was not featured on \"Alive II\". It is also the first Kiss live album to feature a different lineup to the previous two, which featured the original lineup.\n\nThe liner notes of \"Alive III\" include a family tree showing the various Kiss lineups from 1973–1993, as well as bands that the then-current and former members of Kiss were in. It was designed by the band's Japanese fan club. Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi, for whom Eric Singer drummed in 1986–87, is misnamed Tommy. The notes also mistakenly claim that \"Watchin' You\" is from \"Kiss\", and \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" from \"Dressed to Kill\". The re-release of \"Alive III\" (as part of the \"Kiss Alive! 1975–2000\" box set) contains an additional track, \"Take It Off\", matching the original international CD and US vinyl versions of the album.\n\n\"Alive III\" was certified Gold by the RIAA on October 27, 1994.\n\n\"Canny power pop given a merciless headbanging,\" decided Jeremy Clarke in \"Q\". Kerrang! magazine listed \"Alive III\" eleventh best album of 1993.\n\nBruce Kulick's climactic version of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" was ranked seventh on the \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" list \"Top 10 National Anthem Guitar Solos\", before Ace Frehley's version and after Joe Satriani's.\n\n\"Take It Off\" was a bonus track on the Japanese, European and South American CD releases and the US vinyl release. This version of the album would later be included in the \"Kiss Alive! 1975–2000\" CD box set.\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\n\n"}

The second entry in the \"Assault Suits series,\" it is a prequel to the first game, \"Target Earth\". The game was localized and published overseas by Konami. The story follows Jake Brain who pilots a giant mecha who fights in a war engulfing the entire world.\n\nThe game takes place in the future, during a time when Earth's fossil fuels have begun to dwindle. There is a massive war taking place all over the earth for control of these resources, as well as for territorial rights on the moon. The two warring governments, the Axis and Federation, have the ability to go into space and create giant space stations and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nJake is the game's protagonist. He is a soldier drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp and pilots a Federation Assault Suit. In the prologue text he states he only fights because he is a soldier, not concerned with patriotism or politics. Survival for a soldier means defeating the enemy.\nThe Suit has a humanoid shape, with arms, legs, torso, and head. It is equipped with a variety of weapons and other special accessories, giving it full land and minor air capabilities. \n\nJake and his platoon, which operate from the warship Versis are tasked with destruction of Bildvorg, the most powerful mech of the Axis forces. The various missions in the game lead up to the completion of this objective. (It is piloted by Major Beldark, whom Jake meets first in mission 4 and would later meet Jake once before the final boss). Versis sends out 2 other suits, one is unnamed and another is named Apollo in stage 4, who is killed offscreen by one suit that is really fast (Beldark). Ironically in that mission the player saves an enemy suit entering the Earth's atmosphere, whereas Beldark kills Jake's ally Apollo soon after.\n\nAlthough \"Cybernator\" was released after \"Target Earth\", Cybernator takes place a decade before \"Target Earth\".\n\nIn \"Assault Suit Valken 2\", Jake makes a cameo appearance as a 30-year-old veteran soldier who assists in battles as an NPC.\n\nThe game has two endings. The bad ending can be acquired if the player fails any mission in the game, failing to stop Arc Nova from falling and/or allowing the enemy space shuttle escape in the 5th mission. In this ending, the Versis is critically damaged and most of her crew are killed, including Crea (Jake's partner and superior), which leaves Jake devastated in the credits. The game over screen also states you have not completed your mission.\nIf the player succeeds on the side missions, the Versis survives and Jake returns to the carrier, the war is over and Jake and Crea embrace each other on the Versis' deck as the Cybernator suit falls to pieces.\n\nThe game was produced by Toshiro Tsuchida. After the game, he joined G-Craft and worked on the game Front Mission.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Masanao Akahori, and was later rearranged on a ROMpler synthesizer (the same synthesizer used to provide the SNES samples played back on the SPC700) and released as a CD in Japan.\n\nThe original Japanese releases featured artwork done by Satoshi Urushihara.\n\n\"Cybernator\" was the subject of censorship during its localization. The Japanese version features written dialog accompanied by a portrait of the speaker, but these portraits were removed during localization. There is also a scene absent in which the president of the enemy forces, whose banner is that of the European Union, after realizing that his nation has been defeated, commits suicide. Also some written dialog is taken out, which shows the soldier rescued in the fourth level being in the robot fought before the final boss. However the few human enemies in game remain (That are miniscule in scale vs machines throughout the game) with no censorship when they are killed.\n\nThe instruction manual of the English version is also filled with inconsistent information. For example, the sixth mission takes place in the Alps where Versis tries to fly over the mountains to reach the Allied front lines, but according to the manual, the player's aim is to raid the enemy commander's mountain retreat. Another inaccurate information would be concering the laser weapon, the strongest the player will receive in the game minus the cheat weapon the Napalm Flamethrower. It states the laser takes a long time to recharge yet it actually recharges at least as fast as the vulcan's reload, unlike the vulcan the laser recharges to full load automatically without needing to expend its power/ammo first if you stop firing it.\n\nThe instruction manual also states the suit to be a colossal 5 storeys tall and 5tons (Which is seriously underweight for a machine that tall), contrary to promo material stating it to be 4storeys tall.\n\nThe game received a port to the PlayStation 2 in 2004 in both Europe, Australia and Japan, under the title \"Assault Suits Valken\". \n\n\"Cybernator\" was released on the Virtual Console in PAL regions on December 7, 2007, and in North America on December 17, 2007, both for the Wii and in North America on August 7, 2014 and in PAL regions on February 26, 2015, both for the Wii U. \n\nIn 2014, the game was re-released in Japan through the game distribution service EGG.\n\nThe game received a favorable review from \"Famitsu\" magazine which gave it a 32 out of 40 score.\n\nIn 1996, \"Next Generation\" stated that \"Cybernator\" \"was the game that introduced many U.S. gamers to classically Japanese design values - not only because it was a class title looks-wise, but also because it overflowed with action and atmosphere.\" The April 1996 issue of Super Play magazine listed Cybernator as the 19th best Super Nintendo title.\n\n\n"}

The serial storyline follows events that occur between the close of season 2 and the beginning of season 3 of the re-imagined \"Battlestar Galactica\" TV series.\n\nThe first webisode was released on September 5, 2006, with two subsequent webisodes posted to the site each week through October 5 to lead into the season 3 premiere. The original title of this series was to be \"Battlestar Galactica: Crossroads\" but \"Crossroads\" was later used as the title of the third-season finale instead.\n\nThe series was produced as a promotional event to promote \"Battlestar Galactica\", and as such generates no residuals for its writers. The WGA has called for the boycott of all un-residualed webisodes by writers and producers (though the WGA does not represent producers) from working on them.\n\nThe webisodes are only available for viewers from the United States, to the dismay of many fans worldwide; the decision to restrict the webisodes to the US has forced international fans to use peer-to-peer networks to get content which is supposedly free. The webisodes were later reposted on various free video hosting sites, such as YouTube but have since been removed at \"the request of copyright owner NBC Universal because its content was used without permission\". In late 2006, with Australia's Network Ten broadcasting of the third season of \"Battlestar Galactica\" on Ten HD, \"The Resistance\" webisodes were made available to the Australian public (Region 4) on the network's website but have since been taken down.\n\nThe webisodes were released on disc 2 of the Region 1 season three DVD set, with the option to play each episode individually or all together with title cards separating the chapters. The webisodes were included in the Region 2 set (since 2014 edition) and in the Region 4 DVD set (Season 4, Part 1), and are present on all Blu-ray versions.\n\nThe series documents the events on New Caprica after the invasion by the Cylons at the end of the second season. It shows the activities of the resistance to Cylon occupation, and collaborators for the Cylons.\n\nThe resistance is headed by Colonel Saul Tigh, formerly XO of \"Galactica\", and highest-ranking military officer on New Caprica. He is joined by new parents Chief Tyrol and Specialist Cally, former \"Galactica\" crewman Jammer, and Caprica resistance fighter Jean Barolay.\n\nThe series begins on the 67th day of Cylon occupation. It is learned that among the Cylons' first acts of occupation was the building of a detention center. The Cylons have also started recruiting for a human New Caprica Police (NCP) force. Former \"Galactica\" pilot Duck, whom Jammer has been courting for the resistance, condemns the NCP as collaborators but is reluctant to get involved with Tigh's group because he is newly married. As the series progresses, Duck's wife Nora is killed in a Cylon attack on a temple where Tigh and his team were storing weapons.\n\nAlthough the tragedy kills 10 people, Tigh sees the opportunity to win support over to the resistance. Jammer is torn about the event, since he believed storing weapons in a temple was a sin. He is taken to a private meeting with an Aaron Doral Cylon, where he is asked to support the Cylons' plan for peace, by reporting on any more resistance movement.\n\nAfterwards, Jammer is given a chip (to report Resistance activity) and along with other resistance operatives, attends the baptismal of Nicholas Tyrol. Colonel Tigh has started plans to manufacture explosives near a hospital due to increased size of the resistance. It is discovered that in an act of revenge, Duck has joined the New Caprica Police as a spy for the resistance. Meanwhile, it is assumed that Jammer has become a Cylon collaborator - both men, ironically, becoming the very things they resisted earlier.\n\nBradley Thompson, who co-wrote the webisodes, explained in a post on Scifi.com that the webisodes were not created as 10 individual standalone-stories, but were written as one truncated episode (~26 minutes long as opposed to the normal 40 minute run-time), filmed, and then cut into 10 segments. As such, the entire \"webisode series\" is one \"story\" and individual webisodes are not necessarily viewable on their own or out of sequence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40856754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40856754", "title": "Bdelygmia", "text": "Bdelygmia\n\nBdelygmia, deriving from a Greek word meaning \"filth\" or \"nastiness\", is a technique used in rhetoric to express hatred of a person, word or action through a series of criticisms. Bdelygmia often appears as an \"abusive description of a character\" or \"by strong and inappropriate critique\". It is synonymous with abominatio. It is believed that since common people do not belong to major decision-making groups, they cannot easily be swayed to feel a certain way. Violence in rhetoric, according to Lynette Hunter, arose because of this notion. It has become the dominant form of commentary on social media sites and is often described as \"verbal violence\" because of its hateful nature.\n\nBdelygmia is consistent with an appeal to pathos. If an individual is trying to move their audience emotionally, he or she must express the same emotion toward a view or individualin this case, hatred. Distinction is made between hatred and criticism. In comparison with other rhetorical devices, bdelygmia is not considered a very sophisticated appeal to emotion. As an appeal to pathos, effective bdelygmia employs strong language and knowledge of the intended. However, if gone about in the wrong way, employing bdelygmia in rhetoric can have severe repercussions, making the speaker seem intolerant and offensive. Rhetoric is used by politicians to instigate discourse between two opposing groups. Bdelygmia has a commonplace in political rhetoric because of the strong emotions evoked by the topics politicians often debate upon.\n\nAccording to Lynette Hunter, one of the reasons rhetoric emerged in Athens around 500 BC was as a way to manage physical violence: \"[R]hetoric instigates violence; impels people into the cycle of brutality that once started becomes self-justifying.\"\n\nOne of the most prominent uses of bdelygmia in society today has been portrayed through cyberbullying. An individual who expresses hatred for another person or criticizes them in a negative way is using bdelygmia to bully them. Lynette Hunter implies that individuals who do not wish to resort to physical violence use a rhetorical device such as bdelygmia to try to attack someone through the delivery of words.\n\nWhen people disagree with one another, they often try to associate their opposition with negative connotations. Lynette Hunter describes rhetorical violence in politics as a way to persuade people through the negative criticism of another rather than through physical force – when, for example, one party, through their criticisms and/or expressions of hatred or criticism, persuades a group to believe that the other party is treacherous.\n\n\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" is an iconic piece of literature that uses the rhetorical device of bdelygmia to portray the main character, Mr. Grinch, as a terrible person. The lyrics not only allow the audience to understand that the Grinch is a bad person, but they use words such as \"foul\" and \"nasty\" [?to attribute with the Grinch].\n\nAnother example of bdelygmia in popular culture is found in the movie \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\". When Clark Griswold finds out he will not get his expected bonus, he goes on a rant stating, \"I want to look him straight in the eye and I want to tell him what a cheap, lying, no-good, rotten, four-flushing, low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed, ignorant, blood-sucking, dog-kissing, brainless, ****less, hopeless, heartless, fat-***, bug-eyed, stiff-legged, spotty-lipped, worm-headed sack of monkey **** he is. Hallelujah. Holy sh**. Where's the Tylenol?\" By offering a long string of criticisms about his boss, Griswold appeals to the audience to also feel negatively towards him.\n"}

The film marked the feature filmmaking debut of both O'Flaherty and Kojo Pictures. The South Australian Film Corporation provided approximately 10 per cent of the $1.5m budget, while the rest came from private investors.\n\n\"Beautiful\" was the first film in Australia to receive the new (at the time) 40% Producers Rebate from the Federal Government. The film received a poor response, taking only $56,000 at the Australian box office in its short cinema release.\n\nIt was invited to screen at the 12th Shanghai International Film Festival, in June 2010, and later sold \"to France and all French-speaking European territories ... Japan ... Poland, Middle East, Russia, Mexico and HBO Eastern Europe.\"\n\nIn the fictional Adelaide suburb of Sunshine Hills, three teenage girls have disappeared: Jenny Wells (found in a dumpster with her body cut open), Teresa Fields (found impaled and hanging from a clothesline), and Amanda Howatt, who disappeared three days earlier.\n\n14-year-old Danny Hobson (Sebastian Gregory) is a loner, who lives with his police officer father Alan (Aaron Jeffery) and stepmother Sherrie (Peta Wilson). He is obsessed with his 17-year-old neighbour, Suzy Thomson (Tahyna Tozzi). They become friends and she tells him about the girls and the mysterious owners of number 46. She sends him to take some photos with his camera. They walk to number 46, where Suzy tells Danny that a woman is always staring out the window.\n\nWhile walking down the street, Danny's bouncy ball lands in the backyard of number 46. He introduces himself to the house's owner, a mysterious woman named Jennifer (Asher Keddie), who asks him to leave her alone. At night, he hides in a bush and sees a car approach the house. The driver, Jennifer's boyfriend, gets out and stares at Danny, who takes a photo of him.\n\nDanny develops the photos and takes them to Suzy, who recognises the boyfriend from a police newsletter. They read through several newsletters and Suzy identifies the man as Max Forster (Socratis Otto), a convicted rapist. Danny begins to suspect Jennifer is being held against her will in the house by Max. Danny goes to meet Jennifer and she shows him a bracelet which is important to her. He immediately recognises the bracelet as one belonging to his mother, whom he never met. He accuses her of being his mother.\n\nDanny has a dream where Suzy is abducted. He wakes up to learn that she has been kidnapped from her bedroom. Alan interrogates Danny, who says he and Suzy only talked about the girls and number 46. Alan and some fellow officers investigate number 46, but find nothing suspicious. Danny receives a phone call from Suzy, who tells him that Max kidnapped her and that he knows Danny sent the police to his house. Danny must come to the house if he wants to see Suzy alive.\n\nDanny steals Alan's gun and goes to the house, where Jennifer takes him to the backroom, where Max is waiting for him. He tells him that he got out of jail and doesn't want to be sent back. He threatens to keep Danny in the house and take pornographic photos of him, but Danny shoots him in the head. Jennifer runs in and Danny asks her why she left. She denies being his mother and during a scuffle, he shoots her. Alan, who suspected Danny of going to the house, arrives and finds the mess. He tells Danny that Jennifer isn't his mother: his mother died when he was a baby, presumably in an accident caused by Alan. He demands that Danny leave. As Danny leaves, Alan shoots himself.\n\nDanny returns home and begins to mourn Alan's death with Sherrie. He sees Suzy in her front yard and Sherrie says that Suzy was never kidnapped. He realises she set him up and suspects her of making up the rumours about the girls, therefore causing everything. Danny and Sherrie leave Sunshine Hills forever.\n\nThe final scene is narrated by a monologue from Suzy's mother (Deborra-Lee Furness), who says that Alan killed Danny's mother. She goes onto mention a rumour that Alan, Max and Jennifer were Satanists and killed the girls as sacrifices. It is revealed that Suzy pretended she was raped in number 46, but refuses to discuss it. The audience realise that most people believe Suzy's story, but not the truth. She mentions another rumour about Danny being found dead in a nearby paddock. She says that she only stays in Sunshine Hills because she talks. The movie ends with her saying that she is going to protect Sunshine Hills.\n\n\n\"Beautiful\" divided critics in Australia.\n\nWhile praising the \"strong visuals\" and \"strong soundtrack\", Fiona Williams of SBS Films said \"Beautiful\" was \"another disappointing footnote in a submission for better script development in Australian filmmaking. It’s a good idea that’s been undercooked and overdone.\"\n\nJim Schembri of The Age panned the film as a \"dreadfully limp thriller\". He diagnosed the problem as \"the age-old one that bedevils too many Australian films - the movie cannot decide what type of movie it wants to be.\"\n\nThomas Caldwell of Cinema Autopsy described the film as \"derivative\", while mentioning Blue Velvet, American Beauty, Happiness and Donnie Darko. He also took issue with its \"horribly written dialogue\".\n\nAnnette Baille of Filmink Magazine praised the film for being \"a truly transportive cinema experience - beautifully photographed, cleverly written and performed with precision - the only thing more intriguing than \"Beautiful's\" plot is what its gifted writer/Director will do next.\"\n\nDavid Griffiths of Mediaresearch.com said: \"Beautiful is a stunning film that should silence the critics who are ringing the death bell for the Australian film industry\".\n\n\"Beautiful\" grossed $56,101 at the box office in Australia.\n\nThe iconic lawn chair scene, pictured above, is a homage to Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\". According to footage in the DVD extras, the scene was shot at a house near the corner of Greenwood Grove and Meadowbank Rise (), Urrbrae, South Australia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "609748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=609748", "title": "Brock (Pokémon)", "text": "Brock (Pokémon)\n\nBrock, known as in Japan, is a fictional character in the \"Pokémon\" franchise owned by Nintendo. In the \"Pokémon\" video games, he is the Gym Leader of Pewter City and mainly uses Rock-type Pokémon. In the anime series, Ash comes across a man that is later revealed to be Brock's father. He explains that Brock wanted to become a Pokémon Master but due to his father leaving, Brock had to take care of his many, many siblings and could not leave. This is why he became a gym leader, to stay close to his family. His father comes back and states he will take care of the family. Brock left his position as a Gym Leader to travel alongside Ash Ketchum and became a revered Pokémon Breeder. He later cultivates his skill in medicine. As of the latest Japanese episode, Brock is at Pewter City to train to be a Pokémon Doctor. He has also appeared in several Pokémon manga series, including \"Pokémon Adventures\" and the \"Ash & Pikachu\" manga.\n\nBrock is considered the most mature, wise, and level-headed of the main characters. He often acts as an older brother and caretaker to the other characters and a voice of reason in disputes. He will usually place others before him and will help and support his friends even against his better judgment or at his own expense. While he is not shown to battle often, he can understand the situations and strategies in any Pokémon battle, and often explains them to the other characters (and to the viewer), probably because he was once a Gym Leader. Brock always carries books and maps with him, and thus is usually the character who knows where the group is headed and what they can do when they get there, though in \"Advanced Generation\", this role was mostly taken over by the Pokénav. He also carries a lot of other supplies, such as potions and cookware, as well as practical tools like a brush and pocket knife. He is a domestic, and grooms not only his Pokémon but also those of his friends with whom he travels. He handles all the cooking and cleaning for his friends.\n\nBrock is the tallest of main characters, and the closest to looking like an adult. Next to actual adult characters, however, it is clear that he is still a teenager. Not counting temporary outfits, he has worn three different outfits over the span of the anime, all of which have had the colors orange, green, and brown, with blue shoes. His goals have played a passive role in his character's activity and development. Unlike other characters, who aspire to achieve and excel in competitive fields like Pokémon Training and Pokémon Contests, his aim to become a great Pokémon Breeder is a quiet one and thus does not get showcased frequently. His other goal is to find a girlfriend as seen when he tries to ask Nurse Joy or Officer Jenny out or any other pretty girl he sees. There is also a running gag in the anime where Brock comes on too strong to a girl he finds pretty and Misty will pull his ear, dragging Brock away and making a comment in the process. Brock's most notable feature is that his eyes naturally appear closed. He also has tan skin, notably darker than the skin of any other major character in the series.\n\nHe has been referred to by the full name Brock Harrison since 2003, including a 2006 interview with K-Zone Australia, voice actor Eric Stuart.\n\nBrock often acts like a father figure to his friends that he travels with, giving them advice and keeping them out of trouble and well taken care of while they're away from their homes. In some ways, Brock may be Ash's best and favorite friend, and vice versa, as Brock has been with Ash in every season except for and and beyond. He guides Ash and makes sure that he does not get into any danger. The two of them very rarely fight and get along quite well. They often team up with one another to beat Team Rocket and other opponents. Ash and Brock are very close and are rarely seen apart from each other, much like Ash and Pikachu.\n\nBrock is the Gym Leader of Pewter City in the fictional region of Kanto. He specializes in Rock-type Pokémon, and the player may battle him in \"Pokémon Red\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", \"FireRed\", \"LeafGreen\", \"HeartGold, SoulSilver\", \"Pokémon Stadium\", and \"Pokémon Stadium 2\". It has been confirmed that Brock, along with Misty and Blue, return in \"Pokémon Black 2\" and \"White 2\" as tournament opponents.\n\nIn the \"Pokémon\" anime, Brock aspires to be the greatest Pokémon Breeder, and gives up his title of Gym Leader after Ash Ketchum wins his first Indigo League Gym Badge from him. He is first seen taking care of his nine siblings. After Ash loses to Brock the first time, a stranger offers to help make his Pikachu stronger. Pikachu (after being hooked up to a local hydro-power station) becomes stronger and manages to defeat Geodude, but Onix remains too strong. Onix has Pikachu in a body bind; however, Pikachu's previous electric attack ravaged the gym, which set off the sprinklers, weakening Onix. Ash declines the badge on the grounds that he unfairly beat Brock, but Brock later catches up to him and presents to him the badge, saying that he wants Ash to fulfill his dream of becoming the best. The stranger that first helped Ash reveals himself to be Brock's father, Flint. Brock is now free to train himself, and joins Ash and Misty on their journey in Kanto. In the original Japanese version of the anime, Flint's wife was described to have joined him in abandoning their children sometime before these events occurred. In the American version, this was changed to Flint telling Ash that Brock's mother died. However, Brock's mother appears alive and well in later episodes.\n\nSince then, he travels with Ash and Misty on their many adventures. In the Orange Islands series, he leaves the team to join Professor Felina Ivy and was replaced by Tracey Sketchit, but mysteriously returns to Pallet Town when Ash wins the Orange League Championship. Rejoining Ash and Misty, Brock travels to Johto, where he continues to help Ash and Misty. Upon the conclusion of the Silver Conference, the three part ways, and Brock heads back to Pewter City. There (in an episode of \"Pokémon Chronicles\") he discovers his estranged mother Lola (\"Mizuho\" in the original), who, because she is a Water Pokémon Trainer, has ruined the reputation of the Gym he defended so dearly by turning it into a Water-type gym. By defeating his mother, he restores the Gym's reputation. He then leaves all his Pokémon (except Forretress) to his younger brother Forrest before departing for the Hoenn region, where he catches up with Ash and his two new friends, May and Max. The group travels across Hoenn and then returns to Kanto to participate in the Battle Frontier. The group then parted ways once again until Brock met up with Ash in Sinnoh in the next season. Brock also appears in a composed of arc of at least two episodes of the \"\" series.\n\nDuring this time, Brock 's father, Flint (\"Munō\" in the original, who was also Brock 's predecessor as Gym Leader), ran off again, and his brother Forrest (\"Jirō\" in the original) has taken the role of Gym Leader in Pewter City, as well as the responsibility of caring for his eight younger siblings. Brock is the oldest of ten children, with five brothers and four sisters.\n\nBrock is always well-equipped, and is often the voice of reason when the rest of the team get into an argument. He is also hardworking and is always willing to help others. Coupled with his experiences in taking care of others, Brock prepares food and does most chores for the main characters. Brock is also exceptionally good at making food for Pokémon. Brock shows the typical \"clean freak\" personality when he sees messiness, which has even prompted him to start cleaning immediately on at least one occasion. Brock parts ways with Ash one final time after the Sinnoh League to go forth and achieve his new goal of becoming a Pokémon Doctor.\n\nThe book \"The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture\" described Brock's portrayal in the anime as a mentor figure, providing an authoritative voice for Ash in the series. It additionally noted him as representing the concept of early maturity in Japanese stories, in his acceptance of a position of independence and his strong interest in women. The book \"Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon\" cited him as a heavily popular character in the United States, with boys identifying themselves with the character, expressing a desire to be \"friends with characters that are known to be good or considerate friends\". The book additionally noted a contrast to other characters in the series, in that Brock is drawn with \"thinly drawn eyes and slightly darker skin tone\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4267483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4267483", "title": "Charles Pooter", "text": "Charles Pooter\n\nCharles Pooter is a fictional character, the supposed author and leading character of George and Weedon Grossmith's comic novel \"The Diary of a Nobody\" (1892). Pooter is a middle-aged and middle-class clerk in the City of London, with ideas above his station. Apart from taking himself very seriously, he is an extreme example of self-importance, with the unhappy result that he is much snubbed by those he considers beneath him. He has a wife called Carrie and a son called Lupin, the latter unsuitably engaged to the distressingly inferior Daisy Mutlar.\n\nThe Pooters live at The Laurels, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway, London, in a nice six-roomed residence, not counting basement, with a front breakfast-parlour, a little front garden, and a flight of ten steps up to the front door. A nice little back garden runs down to the railway, which causes no nuisance, other than the cracking up of the garden wall. The exact location of the real \"Laurels\" had always been a subject of speculation, but in 2008 journalist Harry Mount claimed to have found the original in Pemberton Gardens, a road that cuts from Upper Holloway Road to Junction Road in Archway. Pooter's intimate friends Cummings and Gowing always let themselves in at the side entrance, thus saving the housemaid the trouble of going to the door. He sometimes drinks Madeira.\n\nThe character has spawned the word Pooterism (Pooterish, Pooteresque), which means taking oneself far too seriously: believing that one's importance or influence is far greater than it really is.\n\nA 1984 edition of \"The Diary of a Nobody\" published by Elm Tree Books included new illustrations by artists Paul Hogarth and Philip Hood, the latter providing a colour caricature of Pooter in the style of the Victorian publication \"Vanity Fair\" at the suggestion of the publisher. This showed Pooter in a typical pose carrying business documents while painting the bath with red enamel paint. Based on the illustrations by Weedon Grossmith, Hood's was the first attempt by an artist to create a detailed and realistic portrait of Charles Pooter.\n\n"}
{"id": "68402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68402", "title": "Chess opening", "text": "Chess opening\n\nA chess opening or simply an opening refers to the initial moves of a chess game. The term can refer to the initial moves by either side, White or Black, but an opening by Black may also be known as a defense. There are dozens of different openings, and hundreds of variants. \"The Oxford Companion to Chess\" lists 1,327 named openings and variants. These vary widely in character from to wild tactical play. In addition to referring to specific move sequences, the opening is the first phase of a chess game, the other phases being the middlegame and the endgame.\n\nOpening moves that are considered standard (often catalogued in a reference work such as the \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\") are referred to as \"book moves\", or simply \"book\". Reference works often present move sequences in simple algebraic notation, opening trees, or theory tables. When a game begins to deviate from known opening theory, the players are said to be \"out of book\". In some opening lines, the moves considered best for both sides have been worked out for twenty to twenty-five moves or more. Some analysis goes to thirty or thirty-five moves, as in the classical King's Indian Defense and in the Sveshnikov and Najdorf variations of the Sicilian Defense. Professional chess players spend years studying openings, and continue doing so throughout their careers, as opening theory continues to evolve. Players at the club level also study openings but the importance of the opening phase is smaller there since games are rarely decided in the opening. The study of openings can become unbalanced if it is to the exclusion of tactical training and middlegame and endgame strategy.\n\nA new sequence of moves in the opening is referred to as a \"\". When kept secret until used in a competitive game it is often known as a \"prepared variation\", a powerful weapon in top-class competition.\n\nWhether they are trying to gain the upper hand as White, or to equalize as Black or to create dynamic imbalances, players generally devote a lot of attention in the opening stages to the following strategies:\n\nApart from these ideas, other strategies used in the middlegame may also be carried out in the opening. These include preparing pawn breaks to create counterplay, creating weaknesses in the opponent's pawn structure, seizing control of key squares, making favorable exchanges of minor pieces (e.g. gaining the bishop pair), or gaining a space advantage, whether in the center or on the flanks.\n\nAt higher levels of competition, for many years the main objectives of opening play were to obtain the better position when playing as White and to equalize when playing as Black. The idea behind this is that playing first gives White a slight initial advantage; for example, White will be the first to attack if the game opens symmetrically (Black mirrors White's moves).\n\nSince about the 1950s another objective has gradually become more dominant. According to IM Jeremy Silman, the purpose of the opening is to create dynamic imbalances between the two sides, which will determine the character of the middlegame and the strategic plans chosen by both sides. For example, in the main line of the of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3), White will try to use his and advantage to mount an attack on Black's , while Black will seek simplifying exchanges (in particular, trading off one of White's bishops to blunt this advantage) and counterattack against the weakened pawns on White's ; both players accept different combinations of advantages and disadvantages. This idea was a doctrine of the Soviet school of chess.\n\nA third objective, which is complementary to the previous ones and has been common since the 19th century, is to lure the opponent into positions with which the player is more familiar and comfortable than the opponent. This is usually done by transpositions, in which a game that apparently starts with one opening can reach a position that is normally produced by a different opening.\n\nMost players realize after a while that they play certain types of positions better than others, and that the amount of theory they can learn is limited. Therefore, most players specialize in certain openings where they know the theory and which lead to positions which they favor. The set of openings a player has specialized in is called an opening repertoire. The main elements a player needs to consider in a repertoire are:\n\nA very narrow repertoire allows for deeper specialization but also makes a player less flexible to vary against different opponents. In addition, opponents may find it easier to prepare against a player with a narrow repertoire.\n\nThe main openings in a repertoire are usually reasonably sound, that is, they should lead to playable positions even against optimal counterplay. Unsound gambits are sometimes used as surprise weapons, but are unreliable for a stable repertoire. Repertoires often change as a player develops, and a player's advancement may be stifled if the opening repertoire does not evolve. Some openings which are effective against amateur players are less effective at the master level. For example, Black obtains active play in return for a pawn in the Benko Gambit; amateur players may have trouble defending against Black's activity, while masters are more skilled at defending and making use of the extra pawn. Some openings which are played between grandmasters are so complex and theoretical that amateur players will have trouble understanding them. An example is the Perenyi Attack of the Sicilian Defense (see diagram) which yields an immensely complicated and tactical position that even strong players have difficulty handling, and that is beyond the comprehension of most amateurs.\n\nMajor changes in the rules of chess in the late fifteenth century increased the speed of the game, consequently emphasizing the importance of opening study. Thus, early chess books, such as the 1497 text of Luis Ramirez de Lucena, present opening analysis, as does Pedro Damiano (1512), and Ruy López de Segura (1561). Ruy Lopez's disagreement with Damiano regarding the merits of 2...Nc6 led to 3.Bb5 (after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6) being named for him as the Ruy Lopez or \"Spanish Opening\". Opening theory was studied more scientifically from the 1840s on, and many opening variations were discovered and named in this period and later. Opening nomenclature developed haphazardly, and most names are historical accidents not based on systematic principles. In the early 1930s the nascent FIDE embarked on a project to standardize opening nomenclature, culminating in the publication of a short booklet in 1933, but this had little impact.\n\nThe oldest openings tend to be named for geographic places and people. Many openings are named after nationalities, for example Indian, English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Scotch, Russian, Italian, Scandinavian, and Sicilian. Cities are also used, such as Vienna, Berlin, and Wilkes-Barre. The Catalan System is named after the Catalonia region of Spain.\nChess players' names are the most common sources of opening names.\nThe name given to an opening is not always that of the first player to adopt it; often an opening is named for the player who was the first to popularize it or to publish analysis of it. Eponymic openings include the Ruy Lopez, Alekhine's Defense, , and the Réti Opening. Some opening names honor two people, such as the Caro–Kann.\nA few opening names are descriptive, such as Giuoco Piano (). More prosaic descriptions include Two Knights and Four Knights. Descriptive names are less common than openings named for places and people.\n\nSome openings have been given fanciful names, often names of animals. This practice became more common in the 20th century. By then, most of the more common and traditional sequences of opening moves had already been named, so these tend to be unusual or recently developed openings like the Orangutan, Hippopotamus, Elephant, and Hedgehog.\n\nMany terms are used for the opening as well. In addition to Opening, common terms include Game, Defense, Gambit, and Variation; less common terms are System, Attack, Counterattack, Countergambit, Reversed, and Inverted. To make matters more confusing, these terms are used very inconsistently. Consider some of the openings named for nationalities: Scotch Game, English Opening, French Defense, and Russian Game—the Scotch Game and the English Opening are both White openings (White chooses to play), the French is indeed a defense but so is the Russian Game. Although these do not have precise definitions, here are some general observations about how they are used.\n\n\nA small minority of openings are prefixed with \"Anti-\". These are openings intended to avoid a particular line otherwise available to one's opponent, for example the Anti-Marshall (against the Marshall (Counter) Attack in the Ruy Lopez) and the Anti-Meran Gambit (against the Meran Variation of the Semi-Slav Defense).\n\nChess openings are primarily categorized by move sequences. The beginning chess position offers White twenty possible first moves. Of these, 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, and 1.c4 are by far the most popular as these moves do the most to promote rapid development and control of the center. A few other opening moves are considered reasonable but less consistent with opening principles than the four most popular moves. The Dunst Opening, 1.Nc3, develops a knight to a good square, but is somewhat inflexible because it blocks White's c-pawn; also, after 1...d5 the knight is liable to be driven to an inferior square by ...d4. (Note that after 1.Nf3 the analogous 1...e5? loses a pawn.) Bird's Opening, 1.f4, addresses center control but not development and weakens the king position slightly. The Sokolsky Opening 1.b4 and the King's and Queen's fianchettos: Larsen's Opening 1.b3 and 1.g3 aid development a bit, but they only address center control peripherally and are slower than the more popular openings. The eleven remaining possibilities are rarely played at the top levels of chess. Of these, the best are merely slow such as 1.c3, 1.d3, and 1.e3. Worse possibilities either ignore the center and development such as 1.a3, weaken White's position (for instance, 1.f3 and 1.g4), or place the knights on poor squares (1.Na3 and 1.Nh3).\n\nBlack has twenty possible responses to White's opening move. Many of these are mirror images of the most popular first moves for White, but with one less tempo. Defenses beginning with 1...c6 and 1...e6, often followed by the center thrust 2...d5, are also popular. Defenses with an early ...d6 coupled with a kingside fianchetto are also commonly played.\n\nThe most important scheme of classifying chess openings for serious players is by ECO code, a series of 500 opening codes assigned by the \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\". Although these codes are invaluable for the serious study of the chess opening, they are not very practical for a broad survey of the chess opening as the codes obscure common structural features between related openings.\n\nA simple descriptive categorization of the chess opening is King's Pawn Openings, Queen's Pawn Openings, and Others. Since these categories are still individually very large, it is common to divide each of them further. One reasonable way to group the openings is:\nThe Indian systems (1.d4 Nf6) are the most important of the Semi-Closed Games, and warrant separate treatment.\n\nWhite starts by playing 1.e4 (moving his king pawn two spaces). This is the most popular opening move and it has many strengths—it immediately works on controlling the center, and it frees two pieces (the queen and a bishop). The oldest openings in chess follow 1.e4. Bobby Fischer rated 1.e4 as \"Best by test.\" On the downside, 1.e4 places a pawn on an undefended square and weakens d4 and f4; the Hungarian master Gyula Breyer melodramatically declared that \"After 1.e4 White's game is in its last throes.\" If Black mirrors White's move and replies with 1...e5, the result is an open game.\n\nThe most popular second move for White is 2.Nf3 attacking Black's king pawn, preparing for a kingside castle, and anticipating the advance of the queen pawn to d4. Black's most common reply is 2...Nc6, which usually leads to the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5), Scotch Game (3.d4), or Italian Game (3.Bc4). If Black instead maintains symmetry and counterattacks White's center with 2...Nf6 then the Petrov's Defense results. The Philidor Defense (2...d6) is not popular in modern chess because it allows White an easy space advantage while Black's position remains cramped and passive, although solid. Other responses to 2.Nf3 are not seen in master play.\n\nThe most popular alternatives to 2.Nf3 are the Vienna Game (2.Nc3), the Bishop's Opening (2.Bc4), and the King's Gambit (2.f4). These openings have some similarities with each other, in particular the Bishop's Opening frequently transposes to variations of the Vienna Game. The King's Gambit was extremely popular in the 19th century. White sacrifices a pawn for quick development and to pull a black pawn out of the center. The Vienna Game also frequently features attacks on the Black center by means of a f2–f4 pawn advance.\n\nIn the Center Game (2.d4) White immediately opens the center but if the pawn is to be recovered after 2...exd4, White must contend with a slightly premature queen development after 3.Qxd4. An alternative is to sacrifice one or two pawns, for example in the Danish Gambit.\n\nMany other variations after 1.e4 e5 have been studied; see Open Game for details.\n\nIn the semi-open games White plays 1.e4 and Black breaks symmetry immediately by replying with a move other than 1...e5. The most popular Black defense to 1.e4 is the Sicilian (1...c5), but the French (1...e6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) and the Caro–Kann (1...c6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) are also very popular. The Pirc and the Modern are closely related openings that are also often seen, while the Alekhine and the Scandinavian have made occasional appearances in World Chess Championship games.\n\nThe Sicilian and French Defenses lead to unbalanced positions that can offer exciting play with both sides having chances to win. The Caro–Kann Defense is solid as Black intends to use his c-pawn to support his center (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5). Alekhine's, the Pirc and the Modern are hypermodern openings in which Black tempts White to build a large center with the goal of attacking it with pieces.\n\nOther semi-open games have been studied but are less common; see Semi-Open Game for details.\n\nThe openings classified as closed games begin 1.d4 d5. The move 1.d4 offers the same benefits to development and center control as does 1.e4, but unlike with King Pawn openings where the e4-pawn is undefended after the first move, the d4-pawn is protected by White's queen. This slight difference has a tremendous effect on the opening. For instance, whereas the King's Gambit is rarely played today at the highest levels of chess, the Queen's Gambit remains a popular weapon at all levels of play. Also, compared with the King Pawn openings, transpositions among variations are more common and critical in the closed games.\n\nThe most important closed openings are in the Queen's Gambit family (White plays 2.c4). The Queen's Gambit is somewhat misnamed, since White can always regain the offered pawn if desired. In the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Black plays ...dxc4, giving up the center for free development and the chance to try to give White an isolated queen pawn with a subsequent ...c5 and ...cxd4. White will get active pieces and possibilities for the attack. Black has two popular ways to decline the pawn, the Slav (2...c6) and the Queen's Gambit Declined (2...e6). Both of these moves lead to an immense forest of variations that can require a great deal of opening study to play well. Among the many possibilities in the Queen's Gambit Declined are the Orthodox Defense, Lasker's Defense, the Cambridge Springs Defense, the Tartakower Variation, and the Tarrasch and Semi-Tarrasch Defenses. Black replies to the Queen's Gambit other than 2...dxc4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are uncommon.\n\nThe Colle System and Stonewall Attack are classified as Queen's Pawn Games because White plays d4 but not c4. They are also examples of \"Systems\", rather than specific opening variations. White develops aiming for a particular formation without great concern over how Black chooses to defend. Both systems are popular with club players because they are easy to learn, but are rarely used by professionals because a well-prepared opponent playing Black can equalize fairly easily. The Stonewall is characterized by the White pawn formation on c3, d4, e3, and f4, and can be achieved by several move orders and against many different Black setups. The diagram positions and the move sequences given below are typical.\n\nOther closed openings have been studied but are less common; see Closed Game for details.\n\nThe Indian systems are asymmetrical defenses to 1.d4 that employ hypermodern chess strategy. Fianchettos are common in many of these openings. As with the closed games, transpositions are important and many of the Indian defenses can be reached by several different move orders. Although Indian defenses were championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Soviet players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black. Since then, Indian defenses have been the most popular Black replies to 1.d4 because they offer an unbalanced game with chances for both sides. The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the center and allowing the move Nc3, to prepare for moving the e-pawn to e4 without blocking the c-pawn. Black's most popular replies are:\n\nAdvocated by Nimzowitsch as early as 1913, the Nimzo-Indian Defense was the first of the Indian systems to gain full acceptance. It remains one of the most popular and well-respected defenses to 1.d4 and White often adopts move orders designed to avoid it. Black attacks the center with pieces and is prepared to trade a bishop for a knight to weaken White's queenside with doubled pawns.\n\nThe King's Indian Defense is aggressive, somewhat risky, and generally indicates that Black will not be satisfied with a draw. Although it was played occasionally as early as the late 19th century, the King's Indian was considered inferior until the 1940s, when it was taken up by Bronstein, Boleslavsky, and Reshevsky. Despite being Fischer's favored defense to 1.d4, its popularity faded in the mid-1970s. Kasparov's successes with the defense restored the King's Indian to prominence in the 1980s.\n\nErnst Grünfeld debuted the Grünfeld Defense in 1922. Distinguished by the move 3...d5, Grünfeld intended it as an improvement to the King's Indian which was not considered entirely satisfactory at that time. The Grünfeld has been adopted by World Champions Smyslov, Fischer, and Kasparov.\n\nThe Queen's Indian Defense is considered solid, safe, and perhaps somewhat drawish. Black often chooses the Queen's Indian when White avoids the Nimzo-Indian by playing 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3. Black constructs a sound position that makes no positional concessions, although sometimes it is difficult for Black to obtain good winning chances. Karpov is a leading expert in this opening.\n\nThe Modern Benoni is a risky attempt by Black to unbalance the position and gain active piece play at the cost of allowing White a pawn wedge at d5 and a central majority. Tal popularized the defense in the 1960s by winning several brilliant games with it, and Fischer occasionally adopted it, with good results, including a win in his 1972 world championship match against Boris Spassky. Often Black adopts a slightly different move order, playing 2...e6 before 3...c5 in order to avoid the sharpest lines for White.\n\nThe Benko Gambit is often played by strong players, and is very popular at lower levels. Black plays to open lines on the queenside where White will be subject to considerable pressure. If White accepts the gambit, Black's compensation is positional rather than tactical, and his initiative can last even after many piece exchanges and well into the endgame. White often chooses instead either to decline the gambit pawn or return it.\n\nThe Catalan Opening is characterized by White forming a pawn center at d4 and c4 and fianchettoing his king's bishop. It resembles a combination of the Queen's Gambit and Réti Opening. Since the Catalan can be reached from many different move orders, (one Queen's Gambit Declined-like move sequence is 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3), it is sometimes called the Catalan System.\n\nThe most important Indian Defenses are listed below, but many others have been studied and played; see Indian Defense for details.\n\nOf the defenses to 1.d4 other than 1...d5 and 1...Nf6, the most important are the Dutch Defense and the Benoni Defense.\nThe Dutch, an aggressive defense adopted for a time by World Champions Alekhine and Botvinnik, and played by both Botvinnik and challenger David Bronstein in their 1951 world championship match, is still played occasionally at the top level by Short and others. Another fairly common opening is the Benoni Defense, which may become very wild if it develops into the Modern Benoni, though other variations are more solid.\n\nSeveral other uncommon semi-closed openings have been named and studied, see Semi-Closed Game for details.\n\nThe flank openings are the group of White openings typified by play on one or both flanks.\nWhite plays in hypermodern style, attacking the center from the flanks with pieces rather than occupying it with pawns. These openings are played often, and 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 trail only 1.e4 and 1.d4 in popularity as opening moves.\n\nIf White opens with 1.Nf3, the game often becomes one of the d4 openings (closed games or semi-closed games) by a different move order (this is called \"transposition\"), but unique openings such as the Réti and King's Indian Attack are also common. The Réti itself is characterized by White playing 1.Nf3, fianchettoing one or both bishops, and not playing an early d4 (which would generally transpose into one of the 1.d4 openings).\n\nThe King's Indian Attack (KIA) is a system of development that White may use in reply to almost any Black opening moves.\nThe characteristic KIA setup is 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, and 7.e4, although these moves may be played in many different orders. In fact, the KIA is probably most often reached after 1.e4 when White uses it to respond to a Black attempt to play one of the semi-open games such as the Caro–Kann, French, or Sicilian, or even the open games which usually come after 1.e4 e5. Its greatest appeal may be that by adopting a set pattern of development, White can avoid the large amount of opening study required to prepare to meet the many different possible Black replies to 1.e4.\n\nThe English Opening (1.c4) also frequently transposes into a d4 opening, but it can take on independent character as well including the Symmetrical Variation (1.c4 c5) and the Reversed Sicilian (1.c4 e5).\n\nLarsen's Opening (1.b3) and the Sokolsky Opening (1.b4) are occasionally seen in grandmaster play. Benko used 1.g3 to defeat both Fischer and Tal in the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Curaçao.\n\nWith Bird's Opening (1.f4) White tries to get a strong grip on the e5-square.\nThe opening can resemble a Dutch Defense in reverse after 1.f4 d5, or Black may try to disrupt White by playing 1...e5!? (From's Gambit).\n\nFirst moves other than the king pawn (1.e4), queen pawn (1.d4), or flank openings (1.b3, 1.b4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3, 1.f4, or 1.g3) are not regarded as effective ways to exploit White's first-move advantage and thus are rarely played. Although some of these openings are not actually bad for White, each of the twelve remaining possible first moves suffers one or more of the following defects compared to the more popular choices:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3938188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3938188", "title": "Color guard (flag spinning)", "text": "Color guard (flag spinning)\n\nColor guards can be found in most American colleges, universities, high schools, and middle schools, and independent drum corps. They typically consist of girls but may include boys as well. They use various equipment, including flags, rifles, and sabres, along with dance, to enhance the music of the marching band show. They perform using their facially expressions and connections to the audience and dancing to enhance the meaning and feeling of their show. Usually, marching bands and color guards perform during football games at halftime. During marching band competitions, the guard adds to the overall score of the band and is also judged in a category usually called auxiliary.\n\nColor guards have since evolved into a separate activity known as winter guard, which is an indoor sport usually performed during the winter or spring, where the guard performs unaccompanied by the band to a piece of pre-recorded music indoors. Winter guards compete independently in such circuits as Winter Guard International (WGI) and Tournament Indoor Association (TIA), or Keystone Indoor Drill Association (KIDA).\n\nThere is only one nationally recognized color sorority in the United States. Phi Rho Psi National Color Guard Sorority was founded in 2009 at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas. More information on Phi Rho Psi can be found at their website.\n\nIn a marching band or a drum and bugle corps, the color guard is a non-musical section that provides additional visual aspects to the performance. The marching band and color guard performance generally takes place on a football field. The color guard performs alongside the marching band at football games and most guards regularly compete in competitions during the fall. The purpose of the color guard is to interpret the music that the marching band or drum and bugle corps is playing via the synchronized work of flags, sabres, rifles, the air blade, and through dance. The color guard uses different colors and styles of flags like swing flags and tapered flags to enhance the visual effect of the marching band as a whole. Color guard also may use backdrops to bring color and scenery to the field if the concept of the show is hard to interpret. The number of members in a color guard can range from a single person to over 50 members. This is often dependent on the size of the band, school or corps, the allotted budget, and the talent available among the potential members who try out.\n\nIn drum and bugle corps, there used to be a requirement for a traditional presentation of the colors during the competitive show (called the \"Color Pre\"), but this fell out of favor around the early 1970s. High school marching bands kept it in until the late 70's. A recent example of a Color Pre in show was the 2002 San Francisco Renegades Sr corps, used during \"America the Beautiful\" to open their program, but such a presentation was not a required part of the show.\n\nThere are many different types of spins and tosses that can be done with the flag. Each spin or toss creates a different illusion and can be used for different tempos. Basic color guard moves include Jazz runs (a Jazz dance move used as a graceful way to run across the marching band field or the gym floor), \"right shoulder\" (positioning the flag with the bottom of the pole by your belly button and your right hand by the flag's silk tape) and \"stripping the flag\" (holding the flag silk with your fingers so you won't reveal the color(s) of the flag.) Flag poles and silks both come in different sizes, and there are different shapes and textures for silks, as well. Flags frequently have weights -generally 1 in. carriage bolts or the like- in the bottom and top of the pole to make it easier to toss the flag into the air. However, even with the weights, weather conditions such as wind and rain can affect a flag's spin and disrupt a toss if not correctly taken into account.\n\nOriginally, a military color guard often traveled with a band, who would play patriotic songs. This use continued into the civilian marching bands, and today a marching band's color guard are usually found carrying equipment descending from those of military color guard: flags, banners, mock wooden or plastic rifles, and plastic or metal sabres. Modern guards do use real sabres as well, but without the sharpened point.\n\nOne tradition that contributed to color guards in American marching bands is the Swiss art of flag swinging, or Fahnenschwingen. The 1936 Olympian Franz Hug of Lucern, Switzerland came to America and introduced flag swinging in 1937. Leonard Haug, an assistant band director at the University of Wisconsin, was intrigued. Haug created ten flags representing the schools of the Big Ten Conference. When Haug came to the University of Oklahoma the following year, he became the first to introduce the technique in the Southwest and formed a corps of Big Six Conference flag swingers for the Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band. The 1938 squad was all male, but the group was co-ed within two years. By 1940, O.U. flag swingers were participating at basketball games and creating innovative routines with two flags. The OU color guard may be the oldest existing unit of its kind in American marching bands. As Director of the OU band, Haug wrote a training guide for flag swinging and an article for a swing flag brochure, assisting the spread of the trend to other marching bands.\n\nIn 1965, Haug succeeded in combining the swing flag with a baton. It was an idea on which he had worked for years. He called his invention the \"twirl-flag\" baton. He wrote that it was \"a truly American flag baton idea suitable for solo and corps exhibition.\" It was a 32\" baton with a colored flag at each end that rotated around the shaft to prevent fouling. The invention was first featured by the University of Arkansas marching band at the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1966, and later manufactured by Kraskin Batons of Minneapolis. For all of Haug's efforts, however, the \"twirl-flag\" baton never caught on, but regular flags and batons remained standard for most marching bands.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, much of the impetus for the evolution of the modern color guard came from the arena of competitive drum and bugle corps. Pioneers from these corps traveled to other areas of the country to teach, introducing color guards to more traditional bands. In 1962, Vincent R. DiNino, Director of the Longhorn Band, \"The Showband of the Southwest\", at the University of Texas began the use big 4'x6' flags in the school colors (orange and white) as a group marching with the band at halftime shows at football games. Since flags of that type were not then available from any commercial vendors, his wife, Jane DiNino, sewed the flags. The flag poles were made of lightweight dowel wood purchased at a local lumber yard with flag holders purchased from a local army-navy surplus store. Movies of the Longhorn Band taken by the Athletic Department at the University of Texas captured the first use of big flags by a college marching band. Director DiNino charged a band member, Larry Cullison, with the duty of charting movements of the flags and working the flags into the performance of the band during halftime performances. By 1972, there were 16 big flags in use as a part of the Longhorn Marching Band at the University of Texas. The use of big flags spread throughout the Southwest Conference. The band directors at the University of Memphis (Memphis State), Dr. Tom Ferguson and Art Theil, recruited music major Sam Shaw to start one of the first collegiate color guards in the South, the \"Bengal Lancers\" in 1974. Director of Bands at Northwestern University, John Paynter, was also one of the first to add a color guard to the marching band when he hired Bugle Corp specialist George Parks in 1976. Consequently, color guards spread quickly throughout the country. The visual effect of spinning and shaking flags drew the attention of crowds and quickly caught on. Having visual impact for pieces played when the band stood still added a whole new dimension to the performance. By the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s color guards had been added to most Southwest Conference, Big Ten and Big 8 (Currently Big 12) bands. Once these prominent university bands had color guards, there was widespread inclusion of guards at high schools across the nation in the 1980s and 1990s. The popularity of color guard has grown such that winter guard has gained widespread membership and attention.\n\nColor guard was not always accepted among marching band organizations. As Arthur Williams stated in his 1958 book, \"The College and University Band\", \"If it actually made no difference to your high school or community whether or not you fronted your band with girl majorettes, baton twirlers, flag swingers, pompom girls, and so on, what would you prefer? Favor use of girl majorettes and so on: 52 percent. Prefer no use of girl majorettes and so on: 48 percent.\" The University of Wisconsin, where Leonard Haug first introduced conference flags, has since discontinued the practice of having a color guard.\n\nWinter guard is similar to outdoor color guard (marched with a drum corps or marching band), except the performances are indoors on gymnasium floors through the winter season. The traditional marching band music heard during fall season is replaced with a recording of various musical genres. A common theme in many shows is loss or something that converys great emotion. The gymnasium floor typically is covered by an individually designed tarp (called a floor mat or floor by members) that generally reflects the show being performed on it. Occasionally the floor only acts as a backdrop so that the audience is drawn towards what the members are doing. The members may perform barefoot, but wearing jazz shoes or modern dance shoes is also common. There are several winter guard circuits for participating in competitions during indoor season, including TIA (Tournament Indoor Association), MAIN (Mid-Atlantic Indoor Network), AIA (Atlantic Indoor Association), WGI (Winter Guard International), and many more.\n\nWinter Guard International (WGI) is the \"Sport of the Arts\", in which teams of highly skilled individuals work to create and perform complex sequences of dance, music, and use of special equipment, such as sabres, rifles, and flags, to compete by division. This organization refers to winter guard as the \"Sport of the Arts\" due to the equally athletic and artistic nature of the activity. Co-founded in 1977 by six people, the goal of WGI was to organize and standardize the activity by creating skill levels, scoring systems, venues, and competitions.\n\nToday, groups participating in a WGI event are placed into one of eight categories; Middle School, Regional A, Scholastic A, Independent A, Scholastic Open, Independent Open, Scholastic World, or Independent World. WGI hosts many regional competitions which lead up to the World Championships, a three-day event in which hundreds of winter guard groups come together to compete. WGI Championships is held in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe judging community is a body of professionals who are working to perpetuate the unique experience WGI Sport of the Arts offers. Many are professionally trained in music, dance and theatre and use that knowledge to enhance the performances through one on one critique meetings after performances. Judges applying for WGI approval must complete a home study process, the Judges' Academy, trialing on guards in every class mentioned above, and participate in a continuing education program that encompasses annual study requirements and clinics. WGI judges are knowledgeable of what is expected from each of the above-mentioned classes.\n\n\n10. www.phirhopsinational.com \n\n"}
{"id": "12674389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12674389", "title": "Cronulla sand dunes", "text": "Cronulla sand dunes\n\nThe Cronulla sand dunes, also known officially as the Cronulla Sand Dune and Wanda Beach Coastal Landscape, are an heritage-listed former sand mining, film making, pastoral property and visitor attraction and now nature conservation, open space and visitor attraction located on the Kurnell Peninsula at Captain Cook Drive, Cronulla in the Sutherland Shire local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It is also known as Part of Kurnell Peninsula Headland and Cronulla Sand Hill. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 September 2003.\n\nThe sand dune system which is also referred to as the Kurnell sand dune is estimated to be about 15,000 years old. It was formed when the sea reached its present level and began to stabilise, between 9000 and 6000 BCE. The Georges, Cooks and Towra Rivers flowed to the south-east beneath the present sand dune system near Wanda and joined the ocean at Bate Bay. This resulted in the isolation of Kurnell which was an island from the mainland. The rivers eventually became blocked with accumulating sand and sediment as the sea level rose. As the rivers gradually silted up they were forced into changing their course and were led out to sea via La Perouse rather than continue to maintain an opening in an ever-growing sand barrier near Wanda. This resulted in a tombolo being formed and joined Kurnell with the Cronulla mainland. The deepest part of the ancient river channel now lies below the surface at the southern end of the peninsula, near Wanda Beach.\n\nThe sand hills of Kurnell possess historical, cultural, scientific and natural significance as a place of early European contact with the Gweagal Aborigines. The site has significant Aboriginal signs of habitation, from carvings, ceremonial sites, middens and sites of flaked sharpening stones. The site is of significant interest to the Aboriginal community as many of the other hills and dunes that were inhabited by their ancestors have now disappeared. As the dunes move or drift, most of the sites once occupied by the Aboriginal people have been covered and preserved.\n\nThe original inhabitants on the Kurnell Peninsula were the Gweagal people, a clan of the Tharawal (or Dharawal) tribe who occupied the region for thousands of years. Their tribe spanned the areas between the Cooks and Georges Rivers from the shores of Botany Bay and westwards towards Liverpool. According to a Gweagal elder, \"Dharawal is similar to a state and Gweagal is similar to a shire within the state, Cunnel (Kurnell) is a family village within the shire\". A clan consisted of approximately 20 to 50 people who lived in their own territory. They had no written language and each tribe had its own dialect. They knew how to light fires long before the arrival of white man. Their clothing consisted of a woven hair sash in which they used to carry tools and weapons and sometimes the optional possum-skin coat for the winter season. The Gweagal Aborigines were the northernmost tribe of the Dharawal nation. They fished from canoes or from the shore using barbed spears and fishing lines with hooks in and around Botany Bay and the Georges River. Waterfowl could be caught in the swamplands (Towra Point), and the variety of soils would have supported a variety of edible and medicinal plants. Birds and their eggs, possums, wallabies and goannas were also a part of their staple diet, in which they made fur coats and ceremonial attire. The abundance of fish and other foodstuffs in these heavily timbered waterways meant that these natives were less nomadic than those of Outback Australia. The various middens, rock carvings and paintings in the area confirm this.\nThe Gweagal Aborigines were the guardians of the sacred white clay pits in their territory. Members of the tribe walked hundreds of miles to collect the clay, it was considered sacred amongst the indigenous locals and had many uses. They used it to line the base of their canoes so they could light fires, and also as a white body paint, (as witnessed by Captain James Cook). Colour was added to the clay using berries, which produced a brightly coloured paint that was used in ceremonies. It was also eaten as a medicine, an antacid. Geebungs and other local berries were mixed in the clay and it was eaten as a dietary supplement with zinc. The Gweagal Aborigines made first contact (\"of a hostile nature\") with James Cook and his crew, occupying the area which is now 'Captain Cooks Landing Place Reserve'. Today members of the Tharawal people still live near the Cronulla sand dunes and participate in their traditional Aboriginal art and culture.\n\nThe Kurnell Peninsula, also the site of the Cronulla Sand Dune System was the first landing place for Captain James Cook in Australia. On 29 April 1770, HM Bark \"Endeavour\" landed in Botany Bay and Cook stepped ashore. Shortly after, James Cook looked down from the sand hills at what is now known as Cronulla Beach. The sand dunes were completely covered in vegetation, so Cook made no mention of any sand dunes during his visit to the Kurnell peninsula. Cook along with his crew stayed in Botany Bay for eight days. During his visit he collected botanical specimens, mapped the area and tried to make contact (unsuccessfully) with the indigenous population. When Cook reported back to England he said that the land was suitable for agriculture, it had sandy soil and the area was lightly wooded. Captain Arthur Phillip, arriving with the First Fleet, stepped ashore on 18 January 1788, after following Cook's advice. They began to clear land and dig wells, but a week later decided to abandon the site and sail north to Port Jackson.\n\nLess than 100 years after Cook's landing, most of the original vegetation had been cleared and burnt, larger trees had been ring barked or simply cut down. Thomas Holt who was the first owner of the area (and who also owned most of what is today the Sutherland Shire) planned to use the dunes for farming sheep, this industry failed more or less. To promote grass growth he destroyed as many of the oldest trees as was viable and to his dismay all that regrew was dense impenetrable thorny scrub. By 1868 the forests of blackbutt and ironbark were cut down for houses and bridge construction whilst the remaining vegetation was cleared for grazing. The first land grant was issued in 1815 when a whaler and merchant by the name of James Birnie, was given of land and of saltwater marshes on the Kurnell Peninsula. The grant included Captain Cook's landing place. He called it ‘Alpha Farm’, and built himself a cottage there. In 1801 John Connell, an ironmonger, arrived in Sydney as a free settler. In 1821 Connell was granted at Quibray Bay next to Birnie's grant. When James Birnie was declared insane in 1828 John Connell gained possession of his property. John Connell now had full ownership of the Kurnell Peninsula. Connell erected a new house, which he named ‘Alpha House,’ built on the foundations of Birnie's original cottage.\n\nJames Connell and his two grandsons, Elias and John Laycock, were the first land owners to log the peninsula. They began to harvest timber from the estate in 1835. In the 1840s a canal from Woolooware Bay was built so that logs could be floated into Botany Bay, loaded onto ships and sailed up to Sydney. When John Connell died in 1848, he left his estate to his two grandsons. The first Crown land auctions in the area took place in 1856. It was here that John Connell Laycock bought another . This increased the size of the estate to .\n\nHolt purchased Laycock's entire estate on the peninsula in 1861 for A£3,275. Holt, originally from Yorkshire, sailed into Sydney sometime in 1842. He made his fortune during the gold rushes of the early 1850s. Holt moved to Sutherland and further increased the size of his property to approximately . He erected several mansions, ran his ‘Sutherland Estate’ in the English manner, and travelled into Sydney to manage his business affairs. In 1868, Holt's land was still mostly uncleared virgin bushland. After Holt had cleared most of the timber, he began to plant grass seeds imported from Germany. The Sutherland Estate was divided into eleven portions. It was then divided into 60 smaller paddocks using Brushwood fencing. The fence posts used to divide these lots can still be found in Towra Point, which is also part of the Kurnell Peninsula.\n\nHolt attempted grazing, first with sheep which had to be destroyed when they became infected with footrot, and then with cattle. The land on his estate was not suited for intensive grazing, so after most of the trees were felled, herds of cattle then removed the stabilizing grass cover and exposed the sand dunes underneath. Large expanses of sand had been exposed along the coastline. The dune system that covers an area of , measuring above and below sea level, became unstable and began to move north at a rate of a year. Land clearing and cattle grazing resulted in a degraded landscape, but created the distinctive Cronulla sand dunes of today.\n\nIn December 1885 the train line from Oatley to Sutherland opened. It was extended to Waterfall in 1886, and finally to Kiama in 1888. The area began to attract visitors and day-trippers from Sydney. Popular destinations were Oatley, Como and Waterfall. Horse-drawn coaches began to travel the distance between the railhead at Sutherland to Cronulla on the coast, and in 1911 a steam tram service began operation. This opened up the area to seaside holiday-makers. By the 1920s and 1930s the sand dunes were acknowledge to be a desolate and desecrated landscape and their economic viability was minimal. However, by the 1920s Cronulla had become famous for its surf beaches with uninterrupted golden sand which stretched for along the coast and the bare dunes became synonymous with Cronulla. Though desolate, the large expanses of sand became a popular playground for generations of children.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1930 the sand hills were acknowledged to be a deserted and desecrated landscape, and their economic value was minimal. However, by the 1920s Cronulla had become notable for its beaches with over five kilometres of sand stretched along the coastline. The bare sand dunes became synonymous with Cronulla. Between the 1920s and the 1950s the large expanses of sand became a popular playground for generations of children for activities such as sandboarding. \n\nIn 1933 Sutherland Shire Council declined an offer to set aside between the Cronulla Golf Club and Kurnell as a reserve. In 1937 it declined another offer to buy of sand hills. In the 1930s the Holt family began to remove sand for use in the building industry.\n\nThe desert atmosphere attracted filmmakers. In 1941, the Charles Chauvel movie, \"Forty Thousand Horseman\" about the Australian Light Horse Regiment during World War I and starring Chips Rafferty, was filmed on the sand hills. The site has been used as a backdrop for several Australian movies, such as the epic \"40,000 Horsemen\" (1941), \"The Rats of Tobruk\" and more recently \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\".\n\nOn 11 January 1965, the bodies of two 15-year-old girls, Marianne Schmidt and Christine Sharrock, were found in the sand hills just off of Wanda Beach. They had been beaten, stabbed and sexually assaulted. Despite an extensive police investigation, the killer has never been identified and the case remains one of Australia's most notorious unsolved crimes, known as the Wanda Beach Murders.\n\nIn 1933 the Sutherland Shire Council asked the Government to set aside the between Cronulla Golf Club and Kurnell as a reserve. In April 1937, Haymarket Land and Building Co. offered Sutherland Shire Council of land near the entrance to Kurnell for eight pounds per acre. Most of the councillors wanted to declare the site a National Park. They wanted it to be titled \"the Birthplace of Australian History and Gateway to Captain Cooks Landing Place.\" The dunes at Towra Point were to be included in this park. The Council was evenly split, but Joe Monro, the Council's President [now referred to as the Mayor], argued that because the site \"was nothing but sand it was completely useless\". He decided to vote against the purchase. The sandhills were doomed from that point. The Government couldn't see any reason to establish another National Reserve so near to Captain Cooks Landing Place Reserve.\n\nIn the 1930s the Holt family began its sand mining operations to supply the expanding Sydney building market and continued until 1990 with an estimate of over 70 million tonnes of sand being removed. The sand has been valued for many decades by the Sydney building industry, mainly because of its high crushed shell content and lack of organic matter. The site has now been reduced to a few remnant dunes and deep water-filled pits which are now being filled with demolition waste from Sydney's building sites. Removal of the sand has significantly weakened the peninsula's capacity to resist storms. Ocean waves pounding against the reduced Kurnell dune system have threatened to break through into Botany Bay, especially during the storms of May and June 1974 and August, 1998.\n\nIn 1951 Caltex Oil Company first approached Sutherland Shire Council to build a new oil refinery at Kurnell. It required a site of and initially the Council rejected the proposal. The issues sparked a series of protests from environmental groups and those concerned that the refinery would despoil the Captain Cook Landing Place Reserve. Shortly after, however, the Council withdrew its objection, and what became known as the Australian Oil Refinery Company, a subsidiary of Caltex, opened in 1954. At the same time, the Sutherland Shire Council built Captain Cook Drive to service the refinery. The refinery ceased operation in October 2014.\n\nThe Australian Oil Refinery Company remains the largest single industry on the Peninsula. The Holt Group (owned by the descendents of Thomas Holt) continues to be a major landholder, but large sections of the Peninsula have been progressively sold off to other private interests and, since the 1950s, the area has been heavily industrialised. The removal of sand from the dunes began in the 1930s, but following the post-war building boom, it has been estimated that in excess of 70 million tonnes of sand have been removed. The Australian Oil Refinery, once obscured by towering dunes, is now visible from Cronulla, and a fraction of the original dunes remain.\n\nIndustrialisation of the Kurnell Peninsula continues to be an ongoing problem amongst community groups and environmentalists. Plans for further development at the site has been cause for continual public protest between developers, locals and environmental groups. A proposal to build a chemical plant by the German pharmaceutical company, Bayer in 1986 resulted in public protests, environmental objections and a Commission of Inquiry, chaired by John Woodward. The plan never went ahead on the grounds of both environmental and economic issues.\n\nIn 2004 a major housing development at the Kurnell site just north of Wanda Beach was cleared by the Land and Environment Court after developer Australand appealed Council's rejection of the plan. The court has allowed building on one-third of the 62-hectare site, \"subject to conditions such as safeguarding the environment.\n\nSutherland Shire Council's objections included issues such as the impact on the threatened green and golden bell frog and concerns about two key ecosystem impacts on the sandhills and the freshwater wetland area. The court's commissioners rejected Sutherland Shire's case, ruling in favour of the Australand development. The court also accepted that the Wanda sand hills had to be revegetated to stop the sand from filling up ponds and swallowing up the vegetation in the area. The council spent $650,000 on the case and wanted the area set aside for tourism, environmental conservation and heritage.\n\nIn 2010, after two and a half years of negotiations, approval was granted for the rezoning of of land owned by Australand and Breen Holdings for a major residential housing subdivision of around 420 single dwellings and recreation / sporting areas to include ten community-owned playing fields, a skate park and other facilities worth up to $25 million plus an additional of public open space on top of the existing already committed as open space. Treated water is to be diverted from the nearby sewerage treatment plant to be used for toilet flushing and garden irrigation for all homes in the subdivision and to irrigate the ten new playing fields on the site.\n\nThe Kurnell Peninsular has been the subject of a number of Commission of Inquiries through the 1970s and 1980s. The most recent Commission of Inquiry in 1986 by Commissioner Woodward led to the re-zoning of the Australand site to permit non-residential uses, including tourist facilities, serviced apartments, commercial, recreational and light industrial uses. The area had been subject to sand extraction since the 1950s and the only portion of the land not subject to sand removal was the H2 dune, which is the high dune to the north-east of the site. Its protection as a surviving remnant of the former Cronulla dunes was recommended along with an Interim Conservation Order under the Heritage Act. In 1990 Australand bought Lot 113, DP 777967 from Breen Holdings and the Hooker Corporation. Sand removal ceased in 1990 and the area has been vacant since and remains largely denuded.\n\nOne effect of recent sand extraction on the site has been the creation of a number of artificial ponds or waste dumps which have filled with water. In a number of these, the endangered Green and Golden Bell Frog has established itself and these ponds are now important breeding grounds. In 1996 the Cronulla Dunes and Wetlands Protection Alliance nominated the dune for protection under the Heritage Act.\n\nThe Aboriginal community holds a strong interest in the remaining undisturbed sand dune. The action of the shifting sand has the potential to capture objects, and all traces of Aboriginal objects are necessarily destroyed by sand removal. Therefore, the H2 dune has high potential to reveal archaeological evidence of former Aboriginal occupation such as middens, flaked sharpening stones, carvings and ceremonial sites.\n\nThe Cronulla Sand Dune and adjacent Lucas Reserve and Wanda Beach demonstrate a high level of intactness in terms the modified dunal landscape as it was created following late nineteenth-century grazing activities. They form an intact remnant of historical landscape that no longer exists. The long term conservation of the dunal system and in particular the unvegetated mobile sand dune may require stabilisation and revegetation works.\n\nAs at 29 January 2003, the Cronulla Sand Dune, Lucas Reserve and Wanda Beach as a landscape were of historical and contemporary cultural significance to the Aboriginal community. The dune landscape possesses historic, scientific, cultural and natural significance as a site of early European contact with Aborigines, a place of environmental transformation as a result of European agricultural practices, habitat for the endangered Green and Golden Bell Frog within a modified environment, and a location for significant Australian films. The dune and Wanda Beach possess social significance as a place of recreation and tourism since the late nineteenth century and community activism to protect the dune from sand mining in the later part of the twentieth century. As the last major exposed dune in a landscape degraded by 70 years of sand mining it has land mark and aesthetic qualities that are held in high esteem by the community.\n\nCronulla Sand Dune and Wanda Beach Coastal Landscape was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 September 2003 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nThe site has historic and cultural significance for the Aboriginal community. The Kurnell Peninsular is well known as the place where Captain James Cook first landed on Australian soil in April 1770. It is also the site of first contact between the English and Aboriginal people in NSW. In 1788 it was briefly the site of Captain Arthur Phillip's first settlement until the First Fleet relocated to Port Jackson. As such, the whole peninsular has acquired a special historical and iconic status in the history of European settlement in Australia and the history of contact between the English and Aboriginal communities. The landscape today bears little resemblance to that experienced by local Aboriginal people and first observed by Cook in 1770. What was a predominantly vegetated and lightly wooded landscape has been heavily modified as a result of European agricultural practices. In the late nineteenth century the dunes became popular with tourists from Sydney. This period is associated with the opening of the railway. Between the 1920s and the 1950s Cronulla became a popular holiday destination famed for its beaches and sand dunes. The use of the dunes for recreation has continued to the present day. The Cronulla sand dunes have been used as a location for major Australian Films. The sheer expanse of the dunes was effectively used to convey remote desert regions in films such as the epic 1941 Charles Chauvel film \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\" which starred Chips Rafferty. The film detailed the battles of the Australian Light Horse regiment in Palestine during World War 1. A number of local residents worked as extras in the film. The \"Rats of Tobruk\", \"Thunder in the Desert\", \"Phar Lap\" and \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" also utilised the dunes as a location. Sand removal began in the 1930s, but accelerated from the 1950s onwards to supply sand for the Sydney building market. Sand removal has essentially evacuated the once prominent dunal system from the landscape. The Cronulla Sand Dune above Wanda Beach survives as the last major exposed dune (undisturbed by sand removal) along the coastal strip and, together with the adjacent Lucas Reserve and Wanda Beach, serves to demonstrate the historical, environmental and cultural transformations of the area over the last two hundred years.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nThe site has historic and cultural significance for the Aboriginal community. The Kurnell Peninsular has a strong association with John Connell Laycock (1818 - 1897). Laycock grew up on the Kurnell Peninsular, his free settler grandfather and guardian having acquired almost the entire Peninsular by 1838. The family was actively involved in timber getting, transporting ironbark, turpentine, blackbutt, mahogany and red cedar to Sydney by ship. Laycock, with his brother, eventually inherited these lands and secured further property in the Sutherland district, eventually amassing . Laycock was a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Central Cumberland (1859-1864) and Clarence (1864 - 1866). Laycock also held the title of Quarantine Keeper at Bradley's Head (1878 - 1884). The destruction by fire of his Prince of Wales Theatre and adjoining properties forced Laycock to sell his heavily mortgaged properties to his friend and fellow member of the Legislative Assembly, Thomas Holt.\n\nThe Kurnell Peninsular has strong associations with the Holt family, and in particular Thomas Holt (1811-1888) who acquired the Peninsular in 1861 from John Connell Laycock and began the program of clear felling and grazing that so dramatically altered the landscape. A successful wool buyer and property speculator, Holt acquired over 1.21m hectares of land in NSW and Queensland between 1851 and 1880, making him one of the wealthiest men in the colony. During the 1860s Holt consolidated his landholdings on the Peninsular (which included Captain Cook's landing place). His accumulated holdings represented of what is the present day Sutherland Shire. Holt built several fine homes in Sydney including \"The Warren\" in Marrickville and \"Sutherland House\" in Sylvania (built 1871, destroyed 1918). Holt was a Member of the first NSW Legislative Assembly in 1856 and its first Treasurer June - August 1856). Holt was the Member for Newtown (July 1861 - November 1864) and a Member of the Legislative Council (1868 - 1883). Holt is notable for employing Aboriginals on his Sutherland Estate and for establishing the oyster industry at Kurnell and introducing Buffalo grass to Australia to control sand dune degradation. The Holt family continues to own land on the Kurnell Peninsula via a number of incorporated companies (the Holt Group).\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nThe site has historic and cultural significance for the Aboriginal community. The Cronulla Sand Dune is aesthetically distinctive and is a landmark at both the Local and State levels. From the 1870s the sand dunes at Kurnell were one of the most visible features of the landscape of Botany Bay, recurring in almost all of the panoramas from important view points. They were visible from many parts of Sydney and at one stage the Blue Mountains. The exposed dunal system became a landmark of note for nineteenth-century day-trippers from Sydney who would take the ferry service from La Perouse to Kurnell Bay to see Cook's landing place, the dunes and Cronulla beaches. The dunes, some of which rose to 44 metres in height, and Cronulla Beach were a popular tourist attraction between the 1920s and 1950s when Cronulla was a resort town. The height and sheer expanse of the dramatic dunal system provided a desert location for film production between the 1940s and 1980s. The landmark qualities of the Cronulla Sand Dune, which rises 33 metres at its apex, have been enhanced by the fact that it is the last significant undisturbed dune in what was a massive dune system. The Cronulla Sand Dune together with the adjacent Lucas Reserve and Wanda Beach survives as an important coastal landscape, synonymous with Cronulla.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe site has historic and cultural significance for the Aboriginal community. The Cronulla Sand Dune is of cultural heritage and spiritual significance to the La Perouse Aboriginal community, some of whom are direct descendants of the Aboriginal leaders who met Captain Cook in 1770. The undisturbed dune is of significant interest to the Aboriginal community as many of the other hills and dunes inhabited by their ancestors have been removed or disturbed since sand removal commenced in the 1930s. The community asserts that the area is known as a burial site. As the last major undisturbed sand dune in this area, the Cronulla Sand Dune has been the focus of long-term local and environmental activism. The Sutherland Shire community has been actively seeking the recognition and protection of the Cronulla Sand Dune for almost a decade and it has become a significant reference point for the contemporary Sutherland community. The proposed local heritage listing of the sand dune by Sutherland Council received 642 supporting signatures in 1999. The Cronulla Sand Dune has strong social significance as a place of recreation for residents and tourists alike since the late nineteenth century. The sand dunes, some of which rose up to , were the focus for many local residents and tourists who engaged in sand sledding, hand gliding and horse riding amongst the dunes.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe site has historic and cultural significance for the Aboriginal community. The Cronulla Sand Dune has the potential to yield further information on the Aboriginal habitation of this area. The drifting nature of the dune ensures that it entombs burials and environmental material as it moves. The Cronulla Sand Dune has been acknowledged as having some potential to contain archaeological material such as shell middens, artefacts or burial sites. The water bodies adjacent to the Cronulla Sand Dune are an important breeding ground for the endangered Green and Golden Bell Frog and hence have the potential to yield further scientific information on the Green and Golden Bell Frog. The Cronulla Sand Dune provides evidence of the impacts of agriculture and logging on the dunal landscape, an area of ongoing research in Australia.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe site has historic and cultural significance for the Aboriginal community. The Cronulla Sand Dune is an excellent example of the remnant Cronulla dune system as it existed prior to the commencement of sand removal in the 1930s. The denuded dune demonstrates the effects of timber getting and grazing activities in the nineteenth century and their contribution to the creation of a modified landscape.\nIn its relationship to adjacent Lucas Reserve and Wanda Beach and the surrounding environment degraded by sand removal, the Cronulla Sand Dune serves to demonstrate the scale of environmental transformation that has taken place over the last two hundred years including the creation of habitat for the endangered Green and Golden Bell Frog.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe site has historic and cultural significance for the Aboriginal community. Sand dune systems close to Sydney are rare. Whilst the coastal sand dune communities of Kurnell have been substantially degraded as a consequence of 70 years of sand removal, the surviving unvegetated Cronulla Sand Dune is intact and remains an excellent example of the former dune landscape. The Cronulla Sand Dune in the context of its setting, intactness, aesthetic qualities and social significance is held in high community esteem. The water bodies formed by sand removal surrounding the Cronulla Sand Dune have been identified by NPWS as a significant habitat for the endangered Green and Golden Bell Frog.\n\nThe geology and geomorphology of the area is characterised by an island of outcropping bedrock on the eastern headland and joined to other bedrock outcrops on its western end by a sand spit which forms the main part of the headland. The Peninsula still has quite a view overlapping transgressive barrier dunes and it is believed that they have shifted north from Bate Bay. Older stable parabolic dunes occur on a series of north to south oriented ridges and while most of the vegetation has been cleared, some dry sclerophyll woodland remains.\n\nAmateur and professional athletes on a daily basis push themselves to exhaustion in unforgiving soft-sand conditioning sessions at the Cronulla sandhills. This is to either keep fit, stay in shape or prepare for amateur and, or professional sporting events, like rugby league, rugby union, cricket, soccer and boxing. At inclines of 45 degrees or more, these sandhills rise upwards and all but collapse downwards in hour-long sprint sessions. According to the conditioning coach of the Australian Cricket team Jock Campbell, these sandhills, along with gym programs is the best way to train athletes for endurance work. Working in the sandhills is hard aerobic interval training, and good specific leg training without the shock on knees and ankles.\n\nAt one stage professional cricketers Glenn McGrath, Michael Clarke, Ricky Ponting, Brett Lee and Brad Haddin trained at the sand dunes daily in preparation for international test cricket. Anthony Mundine held a one-hour workout in the sandhills to prepare for his bout with WBA super-middleweight champion Mikkel Kessler. Amateur and professional Rugby league teams, especially those of the NRL also use the sandhills.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41530026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41530026", "title": "Dead Effect", "text": "Dead Effect\n\nDead Effect is a first-person shooter video game developed by inDev Brain and published by BulkyPix for iOS and Android. It was released on September 12, 2013 for iOS, and on October 15 for Android. Initially available in the App Store and Google Play for purchase, the game switched to a freemium model in February 2014, with the inclusion of in-app purchases. On February 20, 2014, the game was greenlit for Steam. An early access version was released for Windows and OS X on April 15, with the game going gold on December 17. The game has received mixed to positive reviews, and has been downloaded over three million times. A sequel, \"Dead Effect 2\" was released on October 29, 2015.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of \"Dead Effect\" are similar to other first person iOS/Android shooters, such as the games of the \"\" or \"N.O.V.A.\" series. In the default setup, movement is controlled by a virtual joystick on the left of the screen, with sight and aim controlled by the player moving their finger across the touchscreen, although there are two shortcut buttons on the left and right of the screen to allow the player to instantly turn 90 degrees to the left or right. Players can use explosives, iron sights, reload, change weapons, shoot and enter slow motion mode using virtual buttons on the right of the screen. Controls can be customized from the main menu, with each icon individually repositionable as the player sees fits.\n\nIn story mode, the player can play as either a male (Gunnar Davis) or a female (Jane Grey), although there is no difference in storyline or weaponry. The game features twelve missions, which the player must complete in sequence, fighting enemies in the form of zombies and completing tasks such as finding codes to open doors. On various levels, the player also encounters bosses. Each level features pods which replenish the player's health, and in later levels, pods can be found which will upgrade the player's stats. Every level also contains secret orbs, which can be shot, and hidden tablets, which can be collected.\n\nIn survival mode, the player must survive for a set amount of time, killing as many enemies as possible. In biohazard mode, the player must defeat waves of enemies. Scores and achievements are tracked through Game Center.\n\nSet in 2045, the game begins with Jane Grey awakening from cryostasis one-hundred-and-seventy-eight days into the flight of the colonization spaceship \"ESS Meridian\". A member of the elite security team, \"Unit 13\", Grey is unsure why the computer has awoken her early, and so sets out to learn what is happening. She soon discovers that the crew of the ship have turned into zombies; detecting unusual activity on board, the computer automatically awakened Unit 13 as per its security protocol. When Grey is able to reactive the comlink on her suit, the computer tells her that there is something wrong with her, but before she can investigate further, she is contacted by Dr. Wagner of the research division. Wagner tells her that the crew have been attacked by a virus that kills and then reanimates them, and that she too is infected, which is why her suit reported health anomalies. Wagner directs her to the med-lab and a computerized medi-bed administers a detox serum.\n\nWagner then tells Grey that the virus is man-made, developed as part of the \"Dead Effect\" project, but was accidentally leaked and infected the entire crew. He also explains that in the absence of the pilot, the ship activated its autopilot, which is programmed to return to Earth. If the \"Meridian\" reaches Earth, the virus will infect the whole of mankind. The only way to stop the ship is to manually shut down the propulsion unit. Grey does so, and Wagner then directs her to his own location, saying they will decide what to do next together.\n\nHowever, when Grey arrives in the lab, Dr. Wagner reveals that she herself is actually part of the \"Dead Effect\" experiment; they are not on a spaceship at all, they are on a massive orbital research centre, and there was no accidental zombie outbreak - the entire exercise was part of Wagner's research into developing mutagens to increase combat stamina (collectible log files clarify that Dr. Wagner is delusional, and that the \"ESS Meridian\" really was a colony ship; Dr. Wagner deliberately mutated the crew and converted the ship into a combat testing ground for his experiments). He tells Grey that she has performed very well, and her results will be archived for future study. He then tries to kill her using a medi-bed, but Grey escapes and vows to hunt him down and kill him.\n\nShe escapes from the lab and goes in search of Dr. Wagner, who has used a virus on himself, turning him into a zombie-like creature with electrical powers. She finds him in the core of the station, and kills him.\n\n\"Dead Effect\" has received mixed to positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and 70.62% on GameRankings, based on eight reviews.\n\nTouchArcade's James Paterson was impressed, scoring the game 4 out of 5. Although he was critical of the lack of originality in the plot, the poor voice acting, the absence of a run ability and no online multiplayer mode, he concluded that \"at its core, \"Dead Effect\" is yet another fun shooter featuring everyone's favorite reanimated beings. You won't find anything new, but it offers a decent challenge, and has some great replayability in survival mode and trying to earn all the achievements. If you're a fan of violent, bloody, horror themed games, you'll find a good distraction in this one.\"\n\nModojo's Chris Buffa also scored the game 4 out of 5. He found the voice acting to be so bad, that it helped the game, by introducing unintended comic elements into an otherwise serious story. He concluded that \"\"Dead Effect\" entertains despite following the same route we've seen in countless zombie games. Bottom line, it's a good start to what should become an even greater experience in the months ahead. Zombies in space? Sure, why not?\"\n\nPocket Gamer's Harry Slater scored the game 7 out of 10, writing \"There may not be much in the way of subtlety in \"Dead Effect\", and it might not rank among the most innovative games on the App Store, but there's a lot of gory, mindless fun here. And sometimes that's all you really want from a game. A big silly shooter with lots of zombies to plough through, \"Dead Effect\" is far from a classic. But it is brainless fun.\"\n\n148Apps' Blake Grundman scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing \"It isn't anything overly special, but it is a passable first person shooter on a platform already littered with far less fruitful attempts. Those looking to indulge their inner B movie lover need look no further.\"\n\n\"MacLife\"s Chris Pereira was less impressed, scoring the game 2 out of 5, and writing \"The weapons, setting, music, and enemies are all uninspired, and the gunplay is too weak to compensate. As a result, \"Dead Effect\" is a thoroughly run-of-the-mill first-person shooter.\" He was critical of the controls, the similarity of the levels, the enemy AI, the dialogue and the voice acting. Although he praised the sound effects, he concluded that \"for every positive element there's something to gripe about on the other end, whether it's the dull upgrade system or unremarkable shooting. \"Dead Effect\" is an uninspired first-person shooter that does nothing original, proving most memorable for its hilariously awful dialogue.\"\n"}
{"id": "142262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142262", "title": "Debbie Does Dallas", "text": "Debbie Does Dallas\n\nDebbie Does Dallas is a 1978 pornographic film starring Bambi Woods. The plot of the film focuses on a team of cheerleaders attempting to earn enough money to send the title character to Dallas, Texas, to try out for the famous \"Texas Cowgirls\" cheerleading squad. The fictional name \"Texas Cowgirls\" was seen as an allusion to the real-life Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Woods had previously tried out for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in real life, but was cut during auditions.\n\nThe film was highly successful, selling 50,000 copies when it made it to videotape, making it the most successful video release of a porn film in its time. It is regarded as one of the most important releases during the so-called \"Golden Age of Porn\" (1969–1984), and remains one of the best-known pornographic films. The film is in the public domain following a US court ruling in 1987 that declared its copyright to be lost.\n\nThe movie spawned a number of sequels and spin-offs including \"Debbie Does New Orleans\", \"Debbie Does Wall Street\", \"Debbie Does Dallas Again\" and the unrelated \"Debbie Duz Dishes\" franchise. It also spawned a 2002 Off Broadway musical, \"\".\n\nDebbie Benton (Bambi Woods), captain of her high school cheerleading squad, has been accepted to try out for the \"Texas Cowgirls\". Her parents disapprove and refuse to pay her fare to Texas. In a bid to help Debbie, her cheerleader friends Lisa (Georgette Sanders), Roberta (Misty Winter), Tammy (Arcadia Lake), Pat (Kasey Rodgers), and Annie (Jenny Cole) decide to accompany her to Texas. With two weeks to raise the money, they swear off sexual activity with their boyfriends and form a company, called Teen Services.\n\nTammy takes a job in the local record store run by Tony (Tony Mansfield). Debbie gets a job at a sports store run by Mr. Greenfield (Richard Balla). Roberta convinces Mr. Hardwick (Eric Edwards) to give her a job at the candle store with Mrs. Hardwick (Robyn Bird). Rikki (Sherri Tart) and Annie agree to wash Mr. Bradly's car.\n\nThe football team is annoyed by a lack of sex. Roberta's boyfriend Rick (David Morris) and his teammates join Roberta and Pat in the showers, where they have group sex. While working for Mr. Greenfield at the sports store, Debbie is talked into allowing Mr. Greenfield to see her breasts for $10 and fondle her breasts for another $10. Then, he sucks them for an additional $20.\n\nRealizing they will not be able to raise enough money by legitimate means, Debbie convinces the other girls to engage in sexual activities for more money. They agree, but only if it is on their terms.\n\nAfter Roberta is caught masturbating around Mrs. Hardwick, Roberta engages in sexual activity with Mr. and Mrs. Hardwick, earning extra money. Rikki and Annie go to see Mr. Bradly (David Suton), to wash his car. Mr. Bradly is not home, but they wash his car anyway. When Mr. Bradly returns home, he asks them in to dry off their wet clothes. They undress for him for $10 each. He performs oral sex on them, and then has anal sex with Annie.\n\nAt the library, Donna (Merril Townsend) flirts with Mr. Biddle, the librarian. Visiting her, her boyfriend Tim (Bill Barry) tries to have sex with her. She fellates him but is caught by Mr. Biddle (Jack Teague). Donna allows him to spank her to prevent him from telling her parents. Hamilton (Peter Lerman) and his friend Ashly (Ben Pierce) are in the tennis club sauna after a tennis game, and Hamilton convinces Lisa to fellate him while Ashly penetrates her.\n\nAt the record store, Tammy has been avoiding Tony's advances; she calls Lisa, who joins them at the record store. Lisa offers Tony \"anything\" and she begins to fellate him, and then Tammy joins in, and he ejaculates on Tammy's breasts.\n\nDebbie dresses as a \"Texas Cowgirl\" and goes to see Mr. Greenfield after hours at the store. She fellates him, and he penetrates her vagina with his finger and performs cunnilingus on her. Then they engage in vaginal sex, first in the missionary position, then doggy style, and then with Debbie on top. They finish in the missionary position, before Mr. Greenfield ejaculates on Debbie.\n\nThe film ends without ever revealing whether or not Debbie ever made enough money for the trip or made it to Dallas.\n\nThe movie was produced and directed by Jim Clark. Some scenes were shot at the Brooklyn College athletic field, and the Pratt Institute library in Brooklyn, New York, without the administration's knowledge or approval. There is an unfounded internet rumor that certain scenes were shot at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, including the library scene. However, that was found to be unlikely after an investigation with alumni, and the president of the \"Debbie Does Dallas\" production company said such a claim \"was purely inconclusive\".\n\nIn New York, an adult theater showing the films was successfully enjoined from showing the film by the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders under the Lanham Act (trademark). The case was \"The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders v. Pussycat Cinema\". In affirming the district court's decision in favor of the Cheerleaders, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit described the movie as \"a gross and revolting sex film\". The Cheerleaders successfully argued that their uniforms were mimicked by the film's producers and used in advertising. The theater argued that uniforms are strictly functional items, but the Second Circuit explained that \"[i]t is well established that, if the design of an item is nonfunctional and has acquired secondary meaning, the design may become a trademark even if the item itself is functional.\" The decision has been criticized on free speech grounds, but the Seventh Circuit has cited it for the proposition that \"confusion about sponsorship or approval, even when the mark does not mislead consumers about the source of the goods,\" may be sufficient to state a claim under Lanham Act 43(a).\n\nIn another 1983 court case in New York, \"United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise\" found the film not to be obscene.\n\nThe 1986 publication of the Meese Report contained graphic descriptions of the film's sex scenes and uncensored excerpts of dialogue, which may have contributed to the report becoming a best-seller.\n\n\"Debbie Does Dallas\" opened at New York's Pussycat Theater in 1978 and was exhibited without a copyright notice. In 1979, the rights-holder M & A Associates entered into an exclusive worldwide video distribution deal with VCX, whereby VCX agreed to pay M & A an advance and make royalty payments on each sale. Upon receiving a print of the film, VCX president Norman Arno contacted M & A president Arthur Weisberg to request copyright protection. Arno also retained the services of attorneys John Lappen and Peter Berger to combat unauthorized copying of the film. Before litigation could commence VCX was required to add copyright notices to all copies of the film and file registration with the United States Copyright Office; however, VCX could not protect the rights by just adding a notice to the video cassette, since one also needed to be added to the theatrical prints. In 1981, Berger informed Weisberg of the need to add a copyright notice to the prints that had been sent to various theaters but Weisberg refused. Because of Weisberg's refusal to address the problem, both Lappen and Berger concluded the copyright had been lost. In 1982, VCX terminated their contract with M & A and ceased making royalty payments, but continued to distribute the film. In 1987 M & A brought a case against VCX in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for breach of contract. VCX argued that the contract was void due to M & A's failure to comply with the Copyright Act of 1976. The court found in favor of VCX, and the judge ruled that \"Weisberg's actions had thrust the film irretrievably into the [United States] public domain.\"\n\nThe film has had numerous sequels and remakes across several decades. The Internet Adult Film Database lists twelve separate films as part of the film franchise spanning from 1979 until 2007. In the 2013 book \"Pornography and Seriality: The Culture of Producing Pleasure\", journalist David Slayden was quoted as saying, \"No other pornographic film has been remade more often than \"Debbie Does Dallas.\"\" The filmography list includes:\nSpinoffs include:\n\nIn 2001, \"\" was created by Susan L. Schwartz for the New York International Fringe Festival. In 2002 it was made into an Off-Broadway musical comedy . Unlike the original movie, the musical did not contain any actual sex or nudity, which caused some disappointment among people, as false hype had been made and the musical's producers did nothing to dismiss it. Since then, the show has been performed around the world, often with racier direction and more explicit choreography. The story, dialogue and characters are fairly faithful to the original film, with musical numbers standing in for sex scenes or added for comic effect. As recent as 2015, the musical version continues to be performed.\n\nIn 2005 a documentary called \"Debbie Does Dallas Uncovered\" was produced and shown on British television.\n\nIn 2006, VCX employed Media Blasters to digitally re-master the movie from the original 35mm film into a \"Definitive Collectors Edition\" 2-Disc set on DVD.\n\nOn April 11, 2007, Vivid Entertainment Group began including the original \"Debbie Does Dallas\" with a new release titled \"Debbie Does Dallas ... Again\" in DVD, Blu-ray, and HD DVD formats. It has also been remade with contemporary porn stars.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4344127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4344127", "title": "Educational Television (Hong Kong)", "text": "Educational Television (Hong Kong)\n\nEducational Television (), shortly known as ETV, is a series of educational television programmes jointly produced by Radio Television Hong Kong and the Education Bureau (formerly the Education and Manpower Bureau / Education Department) of Hong Kong. ETV has been an auxiliary means for teaching the primary and secondary school curriculum on television since the early 1970s. \n\nETV programmes change with the curriculum from time to time, covering a wide spectrum of topics. Programmes are broadcast during daytime non-peak hours on the English channels of TVB and ATV from Monday to Friday, during the 32 weeks of the school year. As the popularity of the Internet has increased, ETV has made its programmes available on the World Wide Web on demand.\n\nETV began with the primary school curriculum and developed gradually. In 1972, the first programme was aimed at Primary 3 students. It extended one level up yearly and covered Primary 6 in 1974. In September 1976, ETV started to cover junior secondary school. It began with Secondary 1 and reached Secondary 3 in 1978. There was no major change in range until 1999. ETV extended to Primary 1 and 2 in junior primary and Secondary 4 and 5 on selected topics in senior secondary school. In 2000, ETV also began to broadcast Teacher Resource Programmes for teachers.\n\nThe programmes are closely tied with the curriculum devised by Hong Kong Government. Most of programmes are in the Cantonese language. In the early days, it covered the primary subjects of Chinese language, English language and Mathematics, and the secondary subjects Social Studies, Health Education (absent in secondary school) and Nature (later renamed to Science). Programme topics are changed weekly for primary school and biweekly for secondary school. The length of a programme is 15 minutes for primary school and 20 for secondary. Later the secondary subjects were merged to General Studies for primary school as the curriculum changed. As Putonghua has become increasingly important in Hong Kong, it was introduced into the Hong Kong curriculum, and ETV now produces programmes in the language. Social Studies for secondary schools was renamed to Personal, Social and Humanities Education.\n\nDuring normal school terms, ETV programmes are broadcast from Monday to Friday (except some long school vacations like public holidays and weekend) on the free-to-air terrestrial television channels such: TVB Pearl and ATV World alternately so that one of the stations broadcasts ETV television programmes in the morning from 08:00 until 12:00 HKT on TVB Pearl and television programmes in the noon from 12:00 until 16:00 HKT on ATV World. In each academic year the two English free-to-air terrestrial television stations such: TVB Pearl and ATV World.\n\nFrom school year 2006-07 to 2011-12, the broadcasting hours for ETV programmes reduced to 2 hours on each channel, which was scheduled from 08:30 until 10:30 HKT on TVB Pearl, and from 14:00 until 16:00 HKT on ATV World.\n\nBeginning from school year 2012-13, the broadcasting hours further reduced to 1 hour on each channel, which is scheduled from 09:00 until 10:00 HKT (Morning session) on TVB Pearl and from 15:00 until 16:00 HKT (Afternoon session) on ATV World.\n\nDue to the expiration of license of Asia Television on the 2nd April 2016, the Afternoon session of ETV programmes is scheduled from 15:00 until 16:00 HKT on RTHK 31A, which simulcast with Digital Channel RTHK 31.\n\nAlthough each programme is broadcast several times a week their broadcast times are not adapted to school class timetables. The government therefore provides necessary television and recording equipment for reception of ETV programmes for government schools and aided schools in Hong Kong. The recorded programmes can then be viewed out of the broadcast time frame as required by the school.\n\nSome programmes are distributed in form of VCDs or interactive multimedia CD-ROMs to schools.\n\nWith the coming of the Internet age, ETV programmes and other materials can be obtained from ETV website eTVonline.\n\n"}

{"id": "49391215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49391215", "title": "Four Favorites", "text": "Four Favorites\n\nFour Favorites was a Golden Age comics series that ran for 32 issues from September, 1941 through December, 1947. It was published by Ace Publications. Upon cancellation the magazine continued as \"Crime Must Pay the Penalty\" for one issue #33, then as \"Four Teeners\" for issue 34. Though the series started as a super-hero comic it abandoned that genre after issue 26.\n\n“Ace's output of a few dozen issues of costume hero interest bursts with generic patriotic energy —- nothing really creative, but still typical of the period and generally written and drawn a cut above better known companies of the era. It took collectors a long time to discover the Ace heroes because most of them were gone well before the end of World War II. Ace became much better known for its pulps (1930s and 40s) and paperbacks (beginning with the classic Ace Double Novels in 1952). Yet the company was a significant second-tier comic book outfit from 1940-56, especially in the romance field from 1949-56.”\n\n“Four Favorites was numbered consecutively for 32 issues. Although the covers are generally not as cool as Lightning, this is your best bet if you want to get all the major Ace heroes in one book. Magno ran through #26; Lash Lightning through #22 (with Lightning Girl in #19-22); The Unknown Soldier in #4-20; The Raven through #4; Vulcan through #3; Captain Courageous in costume in #5-21 except #6; and The Flag in #6. The best issues are the first 18, since you get four full-length super hero stories in every issue of 10 to 16 pages. These 18 issues of Four Favorites are prime Golden Age examples of patriotic heroes.” \n\nThese comics are in the public domain, and various publishers and creators have used them since.\n"}
{"id": "144634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144634", "title": "Free music", "text": "Free music\n\nFree music or libre music is music that, like free software, can freely be copied, distributed and modified for any purpose. Thus free music is either in the public domain or licensed under a free license by the artist or copyright holder themselves, often as a method of promotion. It does \"not\" mean that there should be no fee involved. The word free refers to freedom (as in free software), not to price.\n\nThe Free Music Philosophy generally encourages creators to free music using whatever language or methods they wish. A Free Music Public License (FMPL) is available for those who prefer a formal approach.\nSome free music is licensed under licenses that are intended for software (like the GPL) or other writings (the GFDL). But there are also licenses especially for music and other works of art, such as EFF's Open Audio License, LinuxTag's Open Music License, the Free Art license and some of the Creative Commons Licences.\n\nBefore the advent of copyright law in the early 18th century and its subsequent application to music compositions first, all music was \"free\" according to the definitions used in free software or free music, since there were no copyright restrictions. In practice however, music reproduction was generally restricted to live performances and the legalities of playing other people's music was unclear in most jurisdictions. Copyright laws changed this gradually so much so that in the late 20th century, copying a few words of a musical composition or a few seconds of a sound recording, the two forms of music copyright, could be considered criminal infringement.\n\nIn response, the concept of free music was codified in the Free Music Philosophy by Ram Samudrala in early 1994. It was based on the idea of \"Free Software\" by Richard Stallman and coincided with nascent open art and open information movements. Up to this point, few modern musicians distributed their recordings and compositions in an unrestricted manner, and there was no concrete rationale as to why they did it, or should do it. \n\nThe Free Music Philosophy used a three pronged approach to voluntarily encourage the spread of unrestricted copying, based on the fact that copies of recordings and compositions could be made and distributed with complete accuracy and ease via the Internet. First, since music by its very nature is organic in its growth, the ethical basis of limiting its distribution using copyright laws was questioned. That is, an existential responsibility was fomented upon music creators who were drawing upon the creations of countless others in an unrestricted manner to create their own. Second, it was observed that the basis of copyright law, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts\", had been perverted by the music industry to maximise profit over creativity resulting in a huge burden on society (the control of copying) simply to ensure its profits. Third, as copying became rampant, it was argued that musicians would have no choice but to move to a different economic model that exploited the spread of information to make a living, instead of trying to control it with limited government enforced monopolies.\n\nThe Free Music Philosophy was reported on by diverse media outlets including \"Billboard\", \"Forbes\", \"Levi's Original Music Magazine\", \"The Free Radical\", \"Wired\" and \"The New York Times\". Along with free software and Linux (a free operating system), copyleft licenses, the explosion of the Web and rise of P2P, the cementing of mp3 as a compression standard for recordings, and despite the efforts of the music industry, free music became largely the reality in the early 21st century. Organisations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Creative Commons with free information champions like Lawrence Lessig were devising numerous licenses that offered different flavours of copyright and copyleft. The question was no longer why and how music should be free, but rather how creativity would flourish while musicians developed models to generate revenue in the Internet era.\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai in lead roles while Shernaz Patel, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Monikangana Dutta, Suhel Seth, Swara Bhaskar, and Makrand Deshpande portray pivotal roles. It is jointly produced by Bhansali and UTV Motion Pictures. Sudeep Chatterjee handled Cinematography and editing was done by Hemal Kothari. \n\nThe film narrates the story of a paralyzed magician-turned-Radio jockey files a petition in court seeking permission to end his life. The film was released on 19 November 2010 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, cinematography, and performances, particularly of Roshan, and Rai. \"Guzaarish\" is the third film to feature Hrithik Roshan opposite Aishwarya Rai.\n\nThe film had a good opening at the box office, collecting a net gross of in its opening weekend. The movie netted in its lifetime run and was declared a flop by Box Office India. \n\nThe film received nominations for direction, music and performances of the lead actors, notably Roshan and Rai being nominated under Filmfare Award for Best Actor and Filmfare Award for Best Actress category respectively. As well as both critics and popular choice awards at other functions - see awards sections below.\n\nEthan Mascarenhas (Hrithik Roshan) is a former magician who is a quadriplegic. He becomes the Radio Jockey of an FM Station called Radio Zindagi. His show spreads magic, hope, and laughter through his irrepressible wit and humor to every listener and caller, making it difficult to imagine that this is a man who has been immobilized with a spinal injury for the last fourteen years of his life. Sofia D'Souza (Aishwarya Rai) is his nurse who has been accompanying him for the past twelve years. \n\nOn the fourteenth anniversary of his accident, Ethan decides to file an appeal to the court for mercy killing. Ethan takes the help of his best friend and lawyer, Devyani Dutta (Shernaz Patel), to support his appeal. Devyani understands Ethan's appeal and agrees to his reasoning and decides to support him in his cause. Surprising everyone with her stance, Ethan's mother Isabel Mascarenhas (Nafisa Ali) also supports him in his petition, backing her son's demand. Ethan's physician Dr. Nayak (Suhel Seth) with whom he has consistently persuaded to retract his case, he finally relents to Ethan's appeal when he realizes that the friend in him is much stronger than the medic. In the meantime, a young man named Omar Siddiqui (Aditya Roy Kapur) enters Ethan's life to learn magic from him whom he considers to be the greatest of magicians. Impressed by his love for magic, Ethan agrees to pass on his legacy to Omar.\n\nOn the day of verdict Ethan's plea is rejected by the court, citing the legal code of the country cannot be violated in any circumstance. Ethan spends his time alone in his empty home when Sofia returns. She confesses to Ethan that she got the divorce and tells him that she will help with his mercy-killing, whatever the consequences be as Ethan means more to her. On hearing her words, Ethan realizes how much Sofia loves him. He proposes to her and Sofia agrees.\n\nEthan throws a farewell party for their friends and guests, where Ethan speaks about everyone who has meant very dear to him and finally tells everyone about his and Sofia's love. Ethan says that he will be dying a happy man with no regrets and the heart full of Sofia's love and bids all goodbye. At these words, all the guests, come to his couch and hug him, with Ethan laughing heartily.\n\n\nBhansali first told media about his next directorial venture, when he gave an interview to the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS). In the interview he said that he had decided to call his film, \"Guzaarish\", which is set to be shot in Goa.. Bhansali stated that \"Guzaarish\" is his tribute to the legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar. Sooraj Pancholi worked as an Assistant Director for the first 2 schedules of the film.\n\nBhansali was on the lookout for a mature couple for the portrayal of his lead roles in \"Guzaarish\". After watching her films Dhoom 2 and Jodhaa Akbar (both of which had starred both Rai and Roshan), Bhansali decided that the pair exuded a dignity and elegance much needed for his film. Though Rai had agreed to the script without even reading it, Roshan was all set to say no to the film. Amita Sehgal, Casting Director, roped in other actors including Shernaz Patel, Vijay Crishna, Nafisa Ali, Aditya Roy Kapur and Suhel Seth. Makrand Deshpande was recruited to play an important three-minute cameo in the film on Hrithik Roshan's suggestion. Bhansali said that he had always wanted to work together with Roshan for a very long time as he was impressed by his sincerity as an actor. He added that the script of \"Guzaarish\" gave him the right opportunity to sign him. About the leading lady, Aishwarya Rai, he said that the role suited her to perfection and though she would have accepted his offer, it was important for an actor to be convinced of what he or she is doing. Bhansali stated that if any of the leading cast had refused to sign, he wouldn't have made \"Guzaarish\". He later stated saying, The film was only possible if Hrithik and Aishwarya had acted in it.\n\nBefore starting the filming of \"Guzaarish\", Bhansali visited Ajmer Dargah in Rajasthan for seeking blessings. Bhansali also met the singing legend Lata Mangeshkar, whom he had revealed to be the source of inspiration to him, to seek her blessings before he fully embarked on filming Guzaarish.During the meeting, Mangeshkar told that she was a big fan of Bhansali's films and that she was fortunate to be the source of inspiration behind such a talented director's film. She told the media members that \"..Even I had heard that he makes his singers hear my songs over and over again before making them sing. I've always been a big fan of Sanjay's films, specially \"Black\". I remember watching the Filmfare Awards in the year of \"Black\". Every time the nominations were announced I prayed for \"Black\" to win. And it did. If I'm a source of inspiration to him then I count myself fortunate\".Bhansali candidly admitted that he was very much afraid of meeting Lata since \"..one doesn't hobnob with one's god\". He added that once he reached her home, he \"... just wanted to sit and gaze at her. I realized in person she's as magical as she is in her singing. There's something other-worldly about her, a quality I haven't encountered in anyone else in my life\".\nLike all his other films, Bhansali preferred shooting at a studio. Bhansali says, \"I like to construct sets and then light it up. It is a part of my story telling. My story needs a setting and I like to create that ambiance.\" Hence he chose Filmcity, Mumbai to shoot the movie. Before the actual filming started, Hrithik Roshan spent time with a lot of patients to understand his role better and get into the skin of his character. He revealed that he used to \".. spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things. So if I have benefited from this experience so much, I am sure that when people see the film and understand the character, they will get a lot to learn\".\n\nSince Roshan's character was a paraplegic, Bhansali wanted to give him a natural look. Hence he was instructed by the director not to indulge in his regular workouts since he cannot look fit and trim in the film. He was also asked by the director to spot an original beard unlike the artificial one in his previous film, \"Kites\", so as to give touches of authenticity to his character. The movie is set in Goa, and hence, Bhansali wanted to give a Portuguese touch to his frames. Sumit Basu, the Art Director, created Ethan's House in Mehboob Studio with a very Spanish/Portuguese flavour and the auditorium for magic acts, the court room, Martin's Bar in Yash Raj Studio. Also keeping in mind the costumes Bhansali hired Sabhyasachi Mukerjee as the costume designer, who had worked Bhansali in \"Black\". Mukherjee had earlier worked in the film \"Raavan\" with Aishwarya Rai the same year.\n\nWell known make-up artist, Ojas Rajani of Shankar's 'I' movie fame, was roped in to do Aishwarya Rai's make-up for the movie. \n\nThe film's shooting started on 29 July 2009 at Mehboob Studio, Mumbai. It was announced that the first schedule would be shot in July and August to capture the monsoon melody and romance of the place. It is notable that Bhansali came back to Goa after his first film, \"\" for filming a movie. During the first day of shooting, he made sure that his mother was present on the sets. Sources revealed that his mother was his reason for making films and \".. it is imperative that she be present.\" Hrithik Roshan joined the crew on 22 July. Aishwarya Rai joined the crew during the initial part of August after wrapping up the shoot for Raavan / Raavanan. A specially made-to-order remote-controlled modernized wheelchair was used in the movie for the role of Ethan Mascarenhas.\n\nThe next outdoor session of the film was done in Panjim. The lead actors had stayed at the Taj, Goa. During the day shoot at Divar, the unit's base camp was at an Englishman Jan Bostock's home in Divar island, just off Panjim for 4–5 days. Apparently, the film-maker, who is known for his hot-tempered nature, threw away the continuity sheets of one of the scenes being shot while shooting in the outskirts of Goa when one of his assistant directors made the same mistake twice. Hrithik Roshan sang a Hindi song in the film, after attempting playback singing in his previous movie \"Kites\", in which he had rendered an English song. Bhansali himself personally trained Roshan for the song. Though the director had got the track recorded by another singer so that shooting in Goa could go on uninterrupted, in case Roshan could not complete his recording, his version was finally recorded after four or five takes. Roshan later said in an interview that \"Bhansali was really surprised on hearing it.\"\n\nDuring the filming of the movie, Bhansali also choreographed some of the songs. He used to dance on the sets of \"Guzaarish\" at times to make the moves clear to his actors. Many times he broke into a dance himself to convey the steps that he had in mind. This took most of his crew by surprise. Pony Verma, who was the choreographer for most of the songs in the film, revealed that as soon as Bhansali conceived a song, he would send it to her and then sing it to her as well. During the shooting of the song, a singer and a guitarist were on the sets. The choreography took place to the accompaniment of live guitar strings and song. According to Verma, this novel way of functioning had enhanced the appeal of the song. She added that when \"... the song is playing live, you pick up a lot of nuances on the spot, which really helps the song\". Verma was in full praises for Bhansali who gave her complete freedom over the choreography; she also acknowledged the efforts put in by the lead actress Aishwarya Rai, with whom she had frequent discussion about the feel of the song.\n\nThe third schedule of the film began on 30 October 2009. The grueling schedule lasted till January 2010, at the city's Mehboob Studios. Rumours had it that during the filming of the movie, Bhansali and Roshan got into a tiff over the excessive use of English in the movie. Roshan, whose previous film \"Kites\" was also blamed for having non-Hindi dialogues, did not want to take a risk and lessen \"Guzaarish\"'s appeal. Though there were no comments from either of them, it was learned that the issue was finally sorted out. Bhansali himself put all speculation to rest saying that \".. we (Hrithik Roshan and himself) were actually singing along quite happily.\" Later, towards the completion of the film, both the director and the producers, who realized the need to give the film a mass appeal, reworked certain dialogues in English, which were then dubbed in Hindi.\n\nThe final schedule of the movie was shot in Yashraj Studios from 21 February 2010. Bhansali found that on the other sets where he had shot the film, he was being frequently disturbed by guests, which prevented him from providing the full concentration which the movie demanded. According to the crew \"..Yash Raj Studios was not only classy and had all the facilities but it also doesn't allow guests to come in.\" Taking these factors into consideration Bhansali decided to bury the hatchet with Aditya Chopra over a film title and started shooting in the studios. The schedule included a spontaneous dance song with Aishwarya Rai, choreographed by Bhansali himself.\n\nThe song \"Udi\" was pictured during this session which was choreographed by Longinus Fernandes, whom Bhansali had judged in \"Jhalak Dikhla Jaa\", a popular dance based reality show. Fernandes was already known for his works in \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na\". According to him Bhansali \"..wanted to make the song different and unique. I asked him if we can add a little bit of Spanish to it and give it a raw, earthy feel. He liked the idea, so we gave the whole dance a very rustic look in order to make it look as natural as possible\". The choreographer added that the dance sequence was very distinct in that the audience had never seen Rai doing such steps. He went gaga over the lead actress saying that she danced like a dream. Longinus said in an interview that it \".. did not take her long to learn the dance but it did take her some time to perfect it and to get into the mood of the character\". In an interview Sanjay Leela Bhansali said that in the song Udi, \"..with such few words Sofia manages to say so much. It was my tribute to Waheeda Rahman's character in \"Guide\".\"In a sequence from the film, Ethan explains Omar, that the first magic he had performed was for his mother. Bhansali said that it is inspired from his childhood days. He said, \"I remember my grandmother selling off the last of her silver and storing chillar in large Johnson baby powder tin. Every afternoon she would count that money and put it back. That kurr-kurr of the coins being bought out, counted and put back had to be heard again. The value of those coins doesn't exist anymore but it was an important part of my growing up.\" Since Roshan's character, Ethan, plays a magician in the initial portion of the film, a Ukrainian magician was hired for teaching him magic tricks, after a long search for a professional magician. The magic stunts performed by Roshan and Monikangana Dutta formed the major portion of the film shot in the last schedule.\n\nAmong the many stunts shot there was a particular sequence in which Roshan had to dance using a large transparent ball as a property. The actor said that he had trained the hardest to practice spin in one of the dance sequence. Roshan said, \"I trained for a month. It was not a long piece of dance but there was lot of jazz ballet where I was required to spin as there is a ball in my hand and I am playing with it as well as dancing. None of my songs up till now have spin because I am very bad at it.\" The cinematographer of the movie Sudeep Chatterjee was asked to interpret the script completely so that Bhansali could understand his perception too. Praising his director to be very open and cooperative Chatterjee acknowledged in an interview about Bhansali's penchant for closed spaces. He said that his main challenge was to make the scenes look different though the protagonist is locked in a single room. To make these differences the lighting was adjusted such that one sees the room in twilight, at night, during the day, in early morning. The camera was made always mobile to counter Ethan's stillness. Slightly mobile things were deliberately kept always around Ethan like a fluttering curtain, a fish bowl near Ethan's head which according to the cinematographer mocked at his stillness all the time.\n\nTo enhance the intensity between his characters, Bhansali wanted a correctly intense reference point for Hrithik and Aishwarya's feelings and conversations. Bhansali said that he thought the sentiment of thwarted passion and smothered intensity of star-crossed lovers in Romeo & Juliet expressed his protagonists' inexpressible feelings very well. Hence he included dialogues from Zeffirelli's Romeo & Juliet in Guzaarish. Bhansali insisted on Zeffirelli's version since to him \"..his work is the ultimate tribute to Shakespeare's love story. So many times, I've wanted to do my own version of Romeo & Juliet. But one look at Zeffirelli's film makes me feel I can never equal his beauty grandeur harmony and principal casting.\" Though it was difficult to obtain permission to use the materials, an adamant Bhansali accomplished the feat. He said,\" This was my only chance to pay homage to one of my all-time favourite screen romances.\"\n\nWhen asked about the preparation she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai said in an interview that both herself and the director Bhansali \".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and \"feel\". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like that. I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was.\" About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, \"My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate.\" He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. \"And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors.\"\n\nSabyasachi Mukherjee made a debut in jewelry line with \"Guzaarish\". He had designed the line keeping in mind a multicultural element with a nomadic vibe. Omar Siddiqui played by Aditya Roy Kapur was styled like a struggling French musician. Suhel Seth, who played Ethan's doctor, is presented in stiff suits and Shernaz Patel, Ethan's lawyer is given a look of a Gandhian in cotton saris and three-quarter blouses. The maids are in dumpy dresses. The costume designer says that \"..the clothes are nearly theatrical and they have a mind of their own. If you remove the characters and hang the clothes, they will tell a story. It's like Neverland or the reality version of The Magic Faraway Tree!\". The entire look of Rai consisted of thirty-seven long frocks, four dumpy shoes, maxis, aprons with motifs of cutlery, quirky glasses and jewelry, surreal hairdos and red lips. For the collection, Sabyasachi used precious and semi-precious stones, minakari and filigree and had to work with about 60 skilled workers from West Bengal to complete the line. The price range of rings and earrings starts from Rs. 40,000 and navratan necklaces are priced at Rs. 510,000. On the look of Ethan Mascarenhas, Mukherjee said that the make up and costume was more organic. On a lighter note he added that he wanted his hero to look like Clark Kent and not James bond.\n\nThe DI and VFX for Guzaarish was done by Prime Focus, a global Visual Entertainment Services group, who had previously collaborated with Sanjay Leela Bhansali on many films including 'Black' and 'Saawariya'.The look of the film was designed to move with the narrative. The first scene shows Sophia D'Souza waking up and taking care of Ethan, for which the shafts of light have been enhanced and colors desaturated but the skin tones maintained. From the skies, to the wall colouring, every part of the movie has been enhanced in some way. The VFX team was throughout in the sets right from when the film was being shot.\n\nThe shots which involve visual effects are listed below.\n\n\nThe first look of the film was supposed to be released along with Dharma Productions' \"We Are Family\" on 3 September. Later the trailer was withdrawn from \"We Are Family\". The official reason given for the postponement of the trailer was the time factor as the producers felt that there was a lot of time before the release of \"Guzaarish\", and hence it was decided Guzaarish's first promotional trailer would feature in theaters a month later with Siddharth Anand's \"Anjaana Anjaani\". However the real story was that there were some concerns over a sequence showing Aishwarya Rai puffing away frantically at a cigarette in the trailer. While smoking is not entirely prohibited in Indian films, it is certainly seen to be injurious to health, especially since the one smoking on screen is a global icon playing a nurse. Sources close to the film revealed, \"Aishwarya is not really smoking in Guzaarish. It's a very cute, funny and a very beautiful sequence where she is trying to smoke when she doesn't know how to.\" Irrespective of the context it had been decided that the release date of the first trailer would be postponed.\n\nOwing to the Ayodhya verdict, the release of \"Anjaana Anjaani\" was also postponed to 1 October, which saw the release of another Aishwarya Rai film \"Enthiran - The Robot\". Hence Bhansali decided to have a separate promotional trailer launch on 23 September 2010 at Cinemax, Mumbai. Bhansali acted really tough and rejected as many as 200 designs before settling down for the final one. The first viewing opened to positive responses. The 1 minute, 48 seconds long trailer focused entirely on Hrithik and Aishwarya and was sans dialogue. The trailer was described by the critics as \".. delightful visuals, exhilarating background score, elaborate costumes, and understated but intense emotions - the promo has a signature Bhansali look and feel. It reminds you of \"Black\", it reminds you of \"Saawariya\". Faridoon Shahryar, Content Head Bollywood Hungama website, opined that the first look was \".. sheer poetry, amalgamation of mesmeric music, metaphorical imagery, a tinge of humour, a larger than life settings, and loads of pathos\". Alongside the release of the promotional trailer, posters and downloadable background materials were also spread officially through the internet. During the \"presser\", attended by Aishwarya Rai, Hrithik Roshan, Ronnie Screwvala, Aditya Roy Kapur, Monikangana Dutta, Shernaz Patel, other cast and crew of the movie and Bhansali himself, the director said \".. You go through so much in life, so many things about life are unspoken, hope and joy of living, and I thought it was important to make a film which dealt with a topic like this.\"\n\nA nervous Bhansali, who had met the media after a long time, said he was very afraid of handling a mic after so long. He thanked UTV Chairman Ronnie Screwvala for his unrelenting support. Bhansali made headlines for the day when he said that Aishwarya Rai was \".. his muse, his \"jaan\", and I get terribly excited when I make a film with her because she is very, very special. Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years\". About the lead actor he said, \"I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is\". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, \"The reason behind doing the music of the film is that I think I understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director. Some deep thoughts are my concern, so whatever little music I knew, it was a sort of experiment. But I am happy with what I have done,\".\n\nAishwarya Rai told the press that \"This was a very special film for us. We are glad to share this special piece of work with you before we reveal it to the rest of the world.\" Hrithik Roshan shared with the press that it was \".. true that I have not done anything that has been life altering. This movie has changed my outlook towards work, changed my life. It is so beautiful that 30 years or 40 years from now, I'll look back and smile I had the opportunity to make this film.\"\n\nHrithik Roshan elaborated on his character saying that he was \".. a super character in the film. I have interacted with about 20 such patients who suffer from complete paralysis of the lower half of the body, including both legs which is mostly caused by damage of the spinal cord. They are real life superheroes and I am representing their emotions on screen\". Adding that he never had felt such responsibility towards any other character he had played to date, he told the media that the film did not take any stance on mercy-killing. Roshan said that he was able to identify with Ethan Mascarenhas because, when he was going through the Guzaarish script, he had been nursing a knee problem and doctors told him that the knee will never be okay. According to Roshan, the script \"..energised me so much that I was not depressed about my knee problem anymore\".\n\nFurther trailers of the song sequences \"Udi\", \"Sau Gram Zindagi\", \"Tera Zikr\" and separate \"Making - of\" videos of each songs were released subsequently through various online and television broadcasting outlets. Frequent interviews and pressers were conducted as a part of the promotional strategy.\n\nA controversy regarding the film's plot originated when veteran Indian writer Dayanand Rajan claimed that the plot of the film was plagiarised from his unpublished novel \"Summer Snow\". It's shocking that the main plot, the love story, the hero being wheelchair-bound due to an accident and even the mercy killing are the same as in the movie. The other similarities include a serious accident, in both the scripts, which require the protagonist to begin using a wheelchair and introduce him to the woman taking care of him – it is the nurse who falls in love with Hrithik, while in the novel it is his wife who looks after him. Both scripts having key flashback scenes and the woman supporting mercy killing for the hero. Raajan has dashed off a legal notice to the producers, UTV and Bhansali asking them for an explanation on how their film has so many similarities with his novel but Bhansali's office refused to accept the notice. In late-October, a PIL was filed by Aditya Dewan, a lawyer, in Delhi High Court alleging that \"Guzaarish\" promotes euthanasia or mercy killing, which is illegal, and portrays the legal profession in bad light. He demanded a disclaimer from the producers saying mercy killing is not legal in India and that there is a debate on whether such deaths can be allowed. But the case was dismissed by the court saying the facts averred were inadequate for the court to appreciate and that it cannot be entertained in its present form..\n\nAnother controversy regarding the movie started brewing when the first look of the move was released which showed the lead actor Aishwarya Rai smoking in a car. National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication (India), the body working for tobacco eradication, wrote to actor Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan expressing concern over use of her images smoking a cigarette in the banners of film Guzaarish displayed all over Mumbai. The organization's spokesperson said in a press release that it would issue a legal notice to the actor under the provisions of the anti-tobacco legislation for the alleged advertisement of tobacco smoking in the public. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena also objected to the \" 'insidious' effects of a cigarette smoking Aishwarya Rai Bachchan plastered across posters on BEST buses in the city.\"\n\nAfter the film release in November, Akhil Rajendra Dwivedi, a script writer, sued Bhansali for Rs. 20 million alleging that the director used his script without informing him. Dwivedi claimed that he had registered his script, very similar to that of \"Guzaarish\", in 2005 and had even met Bhansali in 2008. He alleged that the director had loved the script and said that he would get back to Dwivedi in a few weeks time. Dwivedi claimed that Bhansali never reverted and was unreachable for Dwivedi. Salman Khan, a close associate of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, in an award ceremony Super Idols, for felicitating specially abled people, by television channel IBN-7, took potshots at \"Guzaarish\", hinting at its poor box office collection and said that \"Recently a movie released, \"Guzaarish\", oops sorry! and I made a movie on HIV/ AIDS, not even a dog came to watch the movie.\" Later in the same event, he said to one of the winner of the awards, \"I will give you the number of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, you write it down, he has made Black, Khamoshi, made many pictures and made heaps of money but may be it won't come out, but it should come out.\" The comments came as a shocker to many, since Salman was one of Bhansali's favorites and the lead actor in his first movie and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Bhansali reacted saying that \"If such an old and trusted friend can be so insensitive I don't want anything to do with the entertainment industry\".\n\nThe film's storyline is also similar to 2004 Spanish film \"The Sea Inside\", which was based on a true story of a sailor Ramón Sampedro who becomes a quadriplegic following an accident.\n\nSanjay Leela Bhansali, who had famously given a lavish premier of his earlier film \"Saawariya\", decided to do away with a similar event for \"Guzaarish\". Though the movie had released on 16 November in Dubai, it was slated to release in India on the 19th of the same month. Bhansali purposely avoided a gala screening of \"Guzaarish\" apparently due to the bitter experience he had in a similar event of \"Saawariya\". Sources reported that \"..some of the VVIP invitees who told him that he had made another masterpiece (\"Saawariya\") were busy sending out bulk messages against the film during the premiere. Since the \"Saawariya\" premiere took place two nights (on Wednesday rather than Thursday) before its public release the damage done was irreparable. Sanjay decided there and then to never have a premiere of any of his films.\"\n\nThe director had the first screening of \"Guzaarish\" for the cast members and their families on Monday night. Though the lead actor Hrithik Roshan along with wife Sussanne Khan attended the special screening, Aishwarya Rai and her family were conspicuous by their absence. After the screening, the director allowed himself to be convinced to show the film to a few chosen ones. Hence he specially handpicked 30 invitees include the Bachchan family, leading man Hrithik's parents Pinky and Rakesh Roshan, Hrithik Roshan's Father- in-law Sanjay Khan, Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar, Deepika Padukone, Rohan Sippy, Karan Johar, Ashutosh Gowariker, Rajkumar Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Goldie Bhel singer Kunal Ganjawala, film Maker Akbar Khan, fashion designers Sandip Khosla, Manish Malhothra, and Shahid Kapoor. Bhansali told the media, \"What is the sense of inviting people you know are not going to have anything good to say about your film? I am totally against a premiere. At the same time there are people I want to share the film with.\" According to Bhansali he already had got the \"big thumbs-up\" he needed, \"For me, it was more than enough that my mother liked the film. All other opinions, I'll take with a pinch of salt.\"\n\nLater, Aishwarya Rai also requested for a special screening of the movie for her family. According to Rai, this was a special gift to her father, who was celebrating his birthday on the same date. It was also attended by directors Subhash Ghai, David Dhawan, actors Shabana Azmi and Sonam Kapoor.\n\nThe film also received some mixed reactions from critics. \"Filmfare\" rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote, \"\"Guzaarish\" is unabashedly Sanjay Leela Bhansali. In a film where life itself is the villain everything is larger than life, no surprise there. The house is grand, the characters even more so, the laughter is magnificent, the pain operatic and the treatment of all of the above is colossal in a deafening, attention seeking way that leaves no room for subtext or imagination.\" Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5 and believed that the film would be effective if the writing was more organic and the emotions felt more authentic but Bhansali never gives us a chance to invest in these people. Reuters trashed the movie for its over the top performances and stated that the lead actor Hrithik Roshan is the only saving grace of the movie where \"everything else, like Aishwarya Rai's make-up, seems fake and loud, and puts you off. The emotions, the set design, the dialogues, Hrithik Roshan's beard are all out of this world, residing in some alien planet that only Bhansali inhabits.\" \"The Hindu\" reviewer Sudhish Kamath gave a negative review to the movie and heaped praises on the lead actor Hrithik Roshan saying that \"Hrithik Roshan gives one of the best performances of his career as a man trapped in a wheelchair/bad film, desperately craving for freedom..\" As a bottomline he said that \"Guzaarish\" is \"Highly pretentious, boring film with leftover craving-for-your-sympathy melodrama from \"Black\" and unused sets from \"Saawariya\". \"The Times of India\", which gave a 4.5 rating, mentioned that \"Guzaarish\" is an unusual film in many respects\".\n\nAustralian critic and columnist Simon Foster of \"Special Broadcasting Service (SBS)\" gave a 3 star rating in which described it as a \"A melodrama that never says in two words what it can say in ten, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's \"Guzaarish\" balances its blubbery sentimentality with some beautifully realised images to heart-warming and generally likable effect. \"The Sunday Times\" gave a nine star rating and said \"\"Guzaarish\" is a movie about hope, magic and life. \"Khaleej Times\" said \" This wonderful work of art, nuanced and magical in its portrayal, is about dying. But Ethan, as played by Hrithik Roshan in \"Guzaarish\", is so bemused by adversity that he can actually look at his own suffering with dispassionate humour.\" \"Deccan Herald\" noted that only select - audience may find the movie appealing saying that \"the performances stand out. Hrithik Roshan does brings some tears to your eyes and even Aishwarya comes up with an original act. But, as said, the blacks and greys of \"Guzaarish\" might appeal only to Bhansali viewers.\"\n\n\"Guzaarish\" had a good opening at the box office, collecting a net gross of in its opening weekend. The movie went on to collect nett in its first week. The movie netted in its lifetime run and was declared a flop by Box Office India.\n\nSanjay Leela Bhansali made his debut as a film song composer with this movie. The lyrics were penned by A. M. Turaz, Vibhu Puri, and the late Jagdish Joshi. It features playback singers K.K., Rakesh Pandit, Sunidhi Chauhan, Kunal Ganjawala, Harshdeep Kaur and Shankar Mahadevan and was produced under T-Series label. Vibhavari Apte Joshi made her Bollywood debut through this film. She caught the attention of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who noticed her as a participant in Sa Re Ga Ma (aired on a Marathi channel) while she was singing Konkani - Hindi song.\n\nThe official music launch of Guzaarish took place on 22 October 2010, by T-Series. The event was hosted by Aditya Roy Kapur. Actors Aishwarya Rai, Hrithik Roshan, Shernaz Patel, Suhel Seth, Monikangana Dutta, UTV chairman Ronnie Screwvala and Bhansali himself along with the entire music and background team were present in the music launch. Singers Shankar Mahadevan, KK, Kunal Ganjawala, Vibhavari Apte Joshi, and Shail Hada, who had lent their voices to the film's soundtrack gave a stage performance of each of their songs in the album.\n\n\n\n"}

Hate week is a psychological operation designed to increase the hatred of the population for the current enemy of the totalitarian Party, as much as possible, whichever of the two opposing superstates that may be.\n\nDuring one particular Hate Week, Oceania switched allies while a public speaker is in the middle of a sentence, though the disruption was minimal: the posters against the previous enemy were deemed to be \"sabotage\" of Hate Week conducted by Emmanuel Goldstein and his supporters, summarily torn down by the crowd, and quickly replaced with propaganda against the new enemy, thus demonstrating the ease with which the Party directs the hatred of its members. This ease of direction could also be partially attributed to the similarity in the terms \"Eastasia\" and \"Eurasia\" because they are more easily confused. All members of Oceania are expected to show appropriate enthusiasm during Hate Week, as well as the daily Two Minutes Hate. While participation in this event is not legally required, avoiding or refusing to do so is said to make one appear suspicious to the Thought Police, generally resulting in the vaporization of the perpetrator. This ensures that they are against the opposing party and still allied with Big Brother.\n\nHate Week is celebrated in late summer. The events during that time include waxwork displays, military parades, speeches and lectures. New slogans are also coined and new songs are written. The theme of the Hate Week is called the Hate Song. It is mentioned that a unit from the Fiction Department was assigned to make atrocity pamphlets (falsified reports of atrocities committed by Oceania's enemies against her) designed to stimulate Oceania's populace further into enraged frenzy against all enemies. The aggregate effect of Hate Week thus is to excite the populace to such a point that they \"would unquestionably have torn [captured enemy soldiers] to pieces\" if given the opportunity.\n\nHate Week is introduced to the reader for the first time in the second paragraph of the first page of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"; however, at this point in time, readers have no idea what Hate Week is. \"It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.\" \n\n\"Hate week\" has been adopted by theorists and pundits as a comparator for real life efforts to demonize an enemy of the state. Soviet Literary theorist John Rodden notes that \"Hate Week\" depicted by George Orwell's 1984 novel anticipates some of the anti-American events in the Soviet Union that followed. Scott Boulding argues similarities between the dystopian hate week and Stalinist efforts to supplant religion with devotional services to the state. Other theorists have compared American moments of anti-Soviet sentiment to Orwell's \"Hate Week\", as well as other cold war campaigns against puppet states. During Donald Trump's election campaign, and subsequent actions following his tenure in office, have been described by some as fomenting hate in an effort to control his political base. Filmmaker Oliver Stone has told SBS he thinks the U.S. has demonized Russia and Vladimir Putin, saying: \"Do you remember Hate Week, from George Orwell’s 1984? ... I’ve seen a lot of demonisation of foreign leaders in my lifetime. ... The hate against Putin has been steady since 2012–2013, and now it’s gotten heavy, heavy, worse.\"\n"}

Des Pawson was a retail manager for a large stationery firm based in Ipswich and also no mean knot craftsman. Geoffrey Budworth was a Metropolitan Police Inspector and knotting consultant. Des first wrote to Geoff on 8 October 1978. They met before the month was over, and if it was not mentioned then the idea of contacting other knotting enthusiasts was raised by Des in a letter dated July, 1980, when he pressed for a suitable venue and suggested The Maritime Trust. Even then, 1981 went by without further development; and this is a source of regret to them both as it was the centenary of Clifford W. Ashley's birth.\n\nThe object of the Guild shall be the advancement of education by the study of and practice of the\nart, craft and science of knotting, past and present.

He called upon IGKT member Richard Hopkins for his knowledge and experience of how to use the binding and lashing materials available at that time - rawhide, hemp, and flax - and described his contribution to the project as \"invaluable\".\n\nThis involves tying six basic knots - reef knot, sheet bend, sheepshank, clove hitch, round turn and two half-hitches and bowline - against the clock.

{"id": "172824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172824", "title": "Klezmer", "text": "Klezmer\n\nKlezmer (Yiddish: כליזמר or קלעזמער (\"klezmer\"), pl.: כליזמרים (\"klezmorim\") – instruments of music) is a musical tradition of the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe. Played by professional musicians called \"klezmorim\" in ensembles known as \"kapelye\", the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924, came into contact with American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, the American sub-variety was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the 21st century musicians began paying more attention to the \"original\" pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, Yale Strom and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, later immigrants from the Soviet Union, such as German Goldenshtayn, took their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s.\n\nCompared with most other European folk-music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it remains uncertain.\n\nThe term klezmer comes from a combination of Hebrew words: \"kli\", meaning \"tool, or utensil\" and \"zemer\", meaning \"to make music\"; leading to \"k'li zemer\" , literally \"vessels of song\" = \"musical instrument\".\n\nOriginally, \"klezmer\" referred to musical instruments, and was later extended to refer, as a pejorative, to musicians themselves. From the 16th to 18th centuries, it replaced older terms such as \"leyts\" (clown). It was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre. Early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as \"Yiddish\" music, although it is also sometimes called \"Freilech music\" (Yiddish, literally \"Happy music\"). The first recordings to use the term \"klezmer\" to refer to the music were The Klezmorim's \"East Side Wedding\" and \"Streets of Gold\" in 1977/78, followed by Andy Statman and Zev Feldman's \"Jewish Klezmer Music\" in 1979.\n\nKlezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies, reminiscent of the human voice, complete with laughing and weeping. This is not a coincidence; the style is meant to imitate khazone and paraliturgical singing. A number of \"dreydlekh\" (a Yiddish word for musical ornaments), such as krekhts (\"sobs\") are used to produce this style.\n\nVarious musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music. Perhaps the strongest and most enduring is Romanian music. Klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional Romanian music, which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire (e.g., Horas, Doinas, Sirbas, and Bulgars)\n\nThe Bible has several descriptions of orchestras and Levites making music, but after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, many Rabbis discouraged musical instruments. However, the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished, and musicians came forth to fill that niche, klezmorim. The first klezmer known by name was Yakobius ben Yakobius, a player of the aulos in Samaria in the 2nd century CE. The earliest written record of the klezmorim is in the 15th century. It should be noted that it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century Bessarabia, where the bulk of today's traditional repertoire was written.\n\nKlezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue, in particular cantorial music. Even so, klezmorim—along with other entertainers—were typically looked down on by Rabbis because of their secular traveling lifestyle. Klezmorim often travelled and played with Romani musicians (\"lăutari\"), because they occupied similar social strata. They had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically (the extensive klezmer argot in Yiddish includes some Romani borrowings).\n\nKlezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire, but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer. They sometimes played for Christian churches and local aristocracy, and taught some Italian classical violin virtuosos.\n\nLike other professional musicians, klezmorim were often limited by authorities. In Ukraine they were banned from playing loud instruments, until the 19th century. Hence musicians took up the violin, tsimbl (or cymbalom), and other stringed instruments. The first musician to play klezmer in European concerts, Josef Gusikov, played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a \"wood and straw instrument\". It was laid out like a cymbalom, and attracted comments from Felix Mendelssohn (highly favourable) and Liszt (condemnatory). Later, around 1855 under the reign of Alexander II of Russia, Ukraine permitted loud instruments. The clarinet started to replace the violin as the instrument of choice. Also, a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands.\n\nAs Jews left Eastern Europe and the shtetls (see a related article about the artist Chaim Goldberg, who depicted klezmer performers of the shtetl in his paintings), klezmer spread throughout the globe, to the United States as well as to Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. Initially, the klezmer tradition was not maintained much by U.S. Jews. In the 1920s, clarinetists Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein caused a brief, influential revival, but Hankus Netsky has noted that \"few of the performers of this era actually referred to themselves as klezmorim, and the term is found nowhere in any Jewish instrumental recording of the time.\" (The soprano Isa Kremer was a popular exponent of Yiddish song internationally during the first half of the 20th century; notably making several recordings with Columbia Records and appearing often at Carnegie Hall and other major venues in the U.S. from 1922-1950.) As U.S. Jews began to adopt mainstream culture, the popularity of klezmer waned, and Jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-Jewish music.\n\nWhile traditional performances may have been on the decline, many Jewish composers who had mainstream success, such as Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland, continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth (as Gustav Mahler had been). George Gershwin was familiar with klezmer music, and the opening clarinet glissando of Rhapsody in Blue suggests this influence, although the composer did not compose klezmer directly. Some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer, as can the \"freilach swing\" playing of other Jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter Ziggy Elman.\n\nAt the same time, non-Jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material. Dmitri Shostakovich in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life, and quoted several melodies in his chamber masterpieces, the Piano Quintet in G minor, op. 57 (1940), the Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor, op. 67 (1944), and the String Quartet No. 8 in C minor, op. 110 (1960).\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the United States and Europe, led by Giora Feidman, The Klezmorim, Zev Feldman, Andy Statman, and the Klezmer Conservatory Band. They drew their repertoire from recordings and surviving musicians of U.S. klezmer. In 1985, Henry Sapoznik and Adrienne Cooper founded KlezKamp to teach klezmer and other Yiddish music.\n\nThe 1980s saw a second wave of revival, as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments, largely with non-Jews of the United States and Germany. Musicians began to track down older European klezmer, by listening to recordings, finding transcriptions, and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in Eastern Europe. Key performers in this style are Joel Rubin, Budowitz, Khevrisa, Di Naye Kapelye, Yale Strom, The Chicago Klezmer Ensemble, The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band, the violinists Alicia Svigals, Steven Greenman, Cookie Segelstein and Elie Rosenblatt, flutist Adrianne Greenbaum, and tsimbl player Pete Rushefsky. Other artists like Yale Strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in Central and Eastern Europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions, as well as incorporating the Rom (Roma) music element into the Jewish style. Bands like Brave Old World, Hot Pstromi and The Klezmatics also emerged during this period.\nIn the 1990s, musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory. Clarinetist Ben Goldberg and drummer Kenny Wollesen, after playing in Bay Area-based The Klezmorim, formed the critically acclaimed New Klezmer Trio—kicking open the door for radical experiments with Ashkenazi music and paving the way for John Zorn's Masada, Naftule's Dream, Don Byron's Mickey Katz project and violinist Daniel Hoffman's band Davka. The New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars also formed in 1991 with a mixture of New Orleans funk, jazz, and klezmer styles.\n\nInterest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as John Zorn and Don Byron, who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz. Klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave Ska band Streetlight Manifesto. Singer/songwriter Tomas Kalnoky frequently slips in horn licks with Russian and Jewish origins.\nMames Babegenush was formed in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2004 out of strong Scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer, influenced on the klezmer side by masters like Naftule Brandwein, Abe Schwartz and Dave Tarras. Today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer, pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide. The band's most recent album \" Mames Babegenush With Strings\" (2017) was warmly received with 5-6 stars reviews in such magazines as \"Songlines\" and \"fRoots\". \n\nStarting in 2008, \"The Other Europeans\" project, funded by several EU cultural institutions, spent a year doing intensive field research in Moldavia under the leadership of Alan Bern and scholar Zev Feldman. They wanted to explore klezmer and lautari roots, and fuse the music of the two \"other European\" groups. The resulting band now performs internationally. As with this ensemble, groups like Di Naye Kapelye and Yale Strom & Hot Pstromi have incorporated Rom musicians and elements since their inceptions.\n\nA separate klezmer tradition had developed in Israel in the 20th century. Clarinetists Moshe Berlin and Avrum Leib Burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in Israel. In order to preserve and promote klezmer music in Israel, Burstein founded the Jerusalem Klezmer Association, which has become a center for learning and performance of Klezmer music in the country.\n\nAccording to Walter Zev Feldman, the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of Jewish settlement in the Russian Empire. Much of the traditional klezmer repertoire was created by professional klezmer musicians in the style of their region or tradition, and much co-territorial music such as non-Jewish folksongs, especially Romanian music (mainly from Moldavia), as well as Ukrainian music and Ottoman music, and the musics of other minorities living in the same areas as Jews in Southeastern Europe such as Crimean Tatars.\n\nHistorically, young klezmorim learned tunes from their family and their elders in bands. However, there were several times in history where this transmission broke down, including mass emigration, but especially the Holocaust, which destroyed most of Jewish life and culture in Europe. Few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in Europe, one notable exception being Leopold Kozlowski of Poland.\n\nUndoubtedly, much has been lost of the repertoires played in various locations and social contexts—especially wedding repertoire, since although Jewish weddings could last several days, early recording technology could only capture a few minutes at a time. Also, recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region. A few older klezmorim—such as Leon Schwartz, Dave Tarras, and German Goldenshtayn—survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire. Also, some transcriptions survive from the 19th century. Some ethnomusicological work from Jewish Eastern Europe is still available in print, notably the work of Soviet Jewish field researcher Moshe Beregovski.\n\nIn the 21st century, klezmer is typically learned from \"fake books\" and transcriptions of old recordings, although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear.\n\nMost klezmer pieces are for dancing to, from fast to slow tempo:\n\nTypes not designed for dance are:\n\nMost klezmer tunes are in several sections, sometimes with each in a different key. Many songs have alternating sections with major and minor keys. Klezmer music often uses \"folk scales,\" or scales commonly found in folk music, such as the harmonic minor and phrygian dominant. Instrumental tunes often follow the types of chord progressions found in Middle Eastern and Greek music, whereas vocal Yiddish songs are often much simpler, and follow a style and chord progressions similar to Russian folk songs.\n\nFreylekhs are often in the form ABCB, which is rare in music. Having a third distinct section is a relatively unique aspect of klezmer music.\n\nA common ending for songs is an upwards chromatic run or glissando, followed by a slow staccato 8-5-1. They may also end with a Coda, a new melodic line that is accompanied by a change in the percussion rhythm and an increase in tempo.\n\nKlezmer is generally instrumental, although at weddings klezmorim traditionally accompanied the vocal stylings of the \"badkhn\" (wedding entertainer). A typical 19th-century European orchestra included a first violin, a contra-violin (or modified 3-stringed viola also called Groyse Fidl [Yid. Big Fiddle], Sekund, Kontra or Zsidó Bratsch [Hun.]), a tsimbl (cimbalom or hammered dulcimer), a bass or cello, and sometimes a flute. Other instruments such as a piano or an accordion are used too. The melody is generally assigned to the lead violin, while the other instrumentalists provide harmony, rhythm, and some counterpoint (the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola). The inclusion of Jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century led to the introduction of typical military band instruments into klezmer. The clarinet now often played the melody. Brass instruments—such as the French valved cornet and keyed German trumpet—eventually inherited a counter-voice role. Modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th century military bands than the earlier orchestras. The orchestration used by Joel Rubin—one of the most experienced and knowledgeable contemporary klezmer musicians—represents a historically justified link with that of contemporary ethnic music ensembles of Romania and Hungary.\n\nPercussion in early 20th-century klezmer recordings was generally minimal—no more than a wood block or snare drum. The snare drum is the more \"authentic\" of the two. Wood blocks were introduced by modern klezmorim to imitate recordings from the early 20th century that replaced snare drums—which tended to overwhelm the recording equipment of the time—with quieter instruments. In Eastern Europe, percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a frame drum, or \"poyk\", sometimes called baraban. A poyk is similar to a bass drum and often has a cymbal or piece of metal mounted on top, which is struck by a beater or a small cymbal strapped to the hand. In Bulgaria, Serbia, and Macedonia, sometimes the \"paykler\" (drummer) also played in the \"tapan\" style, i.e., with a switch in one hand on a thin tight head, and a mallet in the other, on a thicker, looser head.\n\nSome klezmer revival bands look to loud-instrument klezmer, jazz, and Dixieland for inspiration. Their bands are similar to a typical jazz band, with some differences. They use a clarinet, saxophone, or trumpet for the melody, and make great use of the trombone for slides and other flourishes. When a cymbalom sound is called for, a piano may be played. There is usually a brass instrument ensemble, and sometimes a tuba substitutes for bass. Performers in this style include The Klezmorim, The Klezmatics, The Klezmer Conservatory Band, and The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. Other bands look back to different eras or regions in an effort to recreate specific styles of klezmer—for example, Budowitz, the Chicago Klezmer Band, Veretski Pass, Di Naye Kapelye, and the Hungarian band Muzsikas with its album \"Maramoros: the Lost Jewish Music of Transylvania\".\n\nKlezmer instrument choices were traditionally based, by necessity, on an instrument's portability. Music being required for several parts of the wedding ceremony, taking place in different rooms or courtyards, the band had to relocate quickly from space to space. Further, klezmorim were usually itinerant musicians, who moved from town to town for work. Therefore, instruments held in the hands (clarinet, violin, trumpet, flute) or supported by a neck or shoulder strap (accordion, cimbalom, drum) were favored over those that rested on the ground (cello, bass violin), or needed several people to move (piano).\n\nIn America, this trend has continued into the present day, with hand-held or strap-held instruments like guitars, saxophones, and even harmonicas integrated into klezmer ensembles. For example, the typical American klezmer wedding band uses a portable electronic synthesizer, not a piano.\n\nThe compositions of Israeli-born composer Ofer Ben-Amots incorporate aspects of klezmer music, most notably his 2006 composition \"Klezmer Concerto\". The piece is for klezmer clarinet (written for Jewish clarinetist David Krakauer), string orchestra, harp and percussion.\n\nIn its historic form, klezmer was live music designed to facilitate dancing. Hence, musicians adjusted the tempo as dancers tired or better dancers joined in. Tunes could drag to a near-halt during a particularly sad part, picking up slowly, and eventually bursting into happy song again. (This is also a feature of many Rom and Russian folk songs.)\n\nLike other musicians of their time, and many modern jazz performers, early klezmorim did not rigidly follow the beat. Often they slightly led or trailed it, giving a lilting sound.\n\nKlezmer is usually played in shteygerim, prayer modes of the synagogue. They are closely related to Greek, Turkish, and other \"co-territorial\" modes of Southeastern and Central Europe. The following are the names of these modes; the names are taken from the names of familiar prayers that use that mode (imagine an American composer referring to a piece as \"a Grand Old Flag\" instead of as \"a march\").\n\nAhavo Rabboh means \"Abounding Love\" in Hebrew, and refers to a prayer from the daily morning prayer service (\"shacharis\"). It is built on the 5th degree of the harmonic minor scale, with a descending tetrachord to the tonic being the most characteristic final cadence. It is also called the \"Freygish\", a Yiddish term derived from the German \"Phrygisch\", or Phrygian mode (specifically, the Phrygian dominant scale). It is considered the mode of supplication. Conversely, it can be thought of as a natural minor scale with lowered 2nd, and augmented 3rd degrees. It is similar to the Arabic Hijaz maqam. Much of klezmer music uses the Ahavah Rabboh scale (such as Nigun Rikud, Tish Nigun and numerous freylekhs), although Mi Sheberach is prevalent as well.\n\nMi Shebeirach means \"He who blessed\" in Hebrew, from the \"Mi Shebeirach\" prayer, recited after the honor of being called to the Torah reading. It is also called the \"Ukrainian\", \"Altered Ukrainian\", \"Doina\", or \"Altered Dorian\". It is similar to the natural minor scale, but has raised fourth and sixth scale degrees, and is used often for the doina or dance pieces, like the \"Odessa Bulgar\". When used in combination with the Ahavoh Rabboh scale in the same piece (as in Mayn Shtetl Yas), the Mi Shebeirach section is usually a whole tone below the Ahavoh Rabboh scale (for example, D Ahavoh Rabboh changes to C Mi Shebeirach or vice versa).\n\nAdoyn-y Moloch means \"my Lord reigns\" in Hebrew. It is common in traditional synagogue services (they are the beginning words of many of the Psalms). It is similar to the Western Mixolydian mode and can be thought of as a major scale with a lowered 7th, which is sometimes raised at cadences, but is generally avoided altogether.\n\nMogen Ovoys means \"our forebears' shield\" in Hebrew. It is an older mode from the synagogue, derived from the Friday night prayers. It is similar to the Western melodic minor scale.\n\nYishtabach means \"it shall become superb\" in Hebrew (from the daily morning services). It has a frequent lowering of the 2nd and 5th. It is related to \"Mogein Ovoys\", above.\n\n\n\n"}

The 111 phone service has replaced the various non-geographic 0845 rate numbers and is part of each country's National Health Service: in England the service is known as NHS 111; in Scotland, NHS 24; and in Wales, NHS Direct Wales.\n\nThe transition from NHS Direct (0845 4647) to NHS 111 in England was completed during February 2014 with NHS 24 Scotland (08454 24 24 24) following during April 2014. NHS Direct Wales started a phased roll-out of a similar 111 service in late 2016. As of June 2018, the 111 number is not currently in use across Northern Ireland .\n\nThe service is available 24 hours a day, every day of the year and is intended for 'urgent but not life-threatening' health issues and complements the long-established 999 emergency telephone number for more serious matters, although 111 operators in England are able to dispatch ambulances when appropriate using the NHS Pathways triage system.\n\nNHS Direct Wales continues to operate via 0845 4647, but began a transition to 111 during late 2016. Initially available in Swansea, Bridgend and Carmarthenshire, the service is due for a country-wide roll-out by 2021. The health service of Northern Ireland will be able to introduce its own similar service using the 111 number if it chooses to do so.\nDuring 2007, the Department of Health's \"Our NHS, Our Future\" report identified confusion surrounding access to certain NHS services in England and suggested the introduction of a national, three-digit number for out-of-hours healthcare services could help simplify the situation. Arrangements to identify and secure a suitable non-emergency number for England began in July 2009, with the number 111 allocated by telecommunications regulator Ofcom in December of that year.\n\nIn late August 2010, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government proposed that 111 would replace the existing NHS Direct (084546 47) telephone helpline in England. This suggestion proved controversial as some critics feared that NHS 111 would be a \"cut-price\" replacement for NHS Direct, because NHS 111 would be staffed mainly by telephone advisors whereas NHS Direct had been staffed by nurses. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said that the only major change would be the phone number, and that the service would be provided by existing staff.\n\nIn July 2015 NHS England decided that what was required was an integrated urgent care access, treatment and clinical advice service which would operate over a large area. Clinical Commissioning Groups were told to stop any procurement exercises until revised commissioning standards and supporting procurement advice for integrated services were produced. These service specifications for England were published in 2017.\n\nIn England, the service is accountable at a Clinical Commissioning Group level but was originally commissioned on a regional basis, with a number of service providers. NHS Direct staff provided some of the 111 service during the original launch of the number, with other providers including regional ambulance trusts, and out-of-hours GP providers.\n\nThe lack of clarity as to accountability was criticised in a Deloitte report into the service launch failure by NHS Direct. As of December 2013 all NHS Direct contracts are being serviced by \"stability partner\" organisations such as ambulance trusts or GP co-operative organisations.\n\nThe service operates 24 hours a day. When GP surgeries are closed normally between 6.30pm and 8am, at weekends and at Bank Holidays the service will refer many patients to an out-of-hours service. This can also happen if practices are closed for training purposes.\n\nThe service uses a clinical decision support system which structures the response to a call, which may range from telephone advice to the dispatch of an emergency ambulance. Calls are initially assessed by a call handler and may be passed to a clinician. The service has been criticised for being too cautious and directing too many patients to A&E departments. GPs have complained that the service has not been inspected by the Care Quality Commission and that it may jeopardise the safety of out-of-hours services.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015 the service has handled 24 million calls with an average call length of 14 minutes. 97% of calls made have been answered within 60 seconds. Although 111 is a helpline for non-emergency cases, 10% of calls trigger the dispatch of an ambulance - 93,000 in the 12 months from April 2014 to April 2015. A 2017 article in the \"British Medical Journal\" that studied the performance of the 111 service concluded that patients were \"largely satisfied\" with the service, while \"its success against some key criteria has not been comprehensively proven.\"\n\nThe first NHS 111 trial, in County Durham and Darlington, started on 23 August 2010. Nottingham, Lincolnshire and Luton began trialling the service later that year.\n\nNHS 111 was launched in a limited number of regions in March 2013 ahead of a planned national launch in April 2013. The British Medical Association wrote to the Secretary of State for Health to request that the launch be postponed. Its chair, Dr Laurence Buckman, warned that the service as \"a disaster in the making\", and recommended delaying the full launch for safety reasons. The public sector trade union UNISON also recommended delaying the full launch.\n\nThe initial launch was widely reported to be a failure. On its introduction, the service was unable to cope with demand; technical failures and inadequate staffing levels led to severe delays in response (up to 5 hours), resulting in high levels of use of alternative services such as ambulances and emergency departments. The problems led to the launch being delayed in South West England, London and Midlands (England) and the service was suspended one month after its launch in Worcestershire.\n\nThe NHS 111 service was gradually launched in England over the course of 2013, with the rollout being completed in February 2014. It was announced in October 2013 that NHS Direct would be closed down in 2014. The 111 number was launched in Scotland in April 2014.\n\nThe 111 service is also available via the harmonised European number for medical advice 116 117 under reciprocal agreements made with fellow European countries to simplify and improve public access to recognised 'Harmonised Services of Social Value'.\n\n"}

This webcast would involve Colin Baker playing the Sixth Doctor accompanied by Maggie Stables as Dr Evelyn Smythe, his companion in the Big Finish audio plays.\n\nThe limited bandwidth allowed by broadcasting across the Internet meant that writer and director Gary Russell approached the story with the edict that it would be shorter than many of the Big Finish plays. He decided that the story would therefore run, more or less, in \"real time\", with its complete 60-minute running time being exactly how long the Doctor would be involved within the story. The webcast was accompanied by very limited animation based on illustrations by artist Lee Sullivan.\n\nThe storyline was left without a definitive conclusion, allowing for a possible sequel to be made at a future date. However, the following webcast was a remake of the uncompleted 1979 serial \"Shada\", written by Douglas Adams. When BBCi decided to take the production of the next webcast, \"Scream of the Shalka\", completely in-house, this led to a brief falling out between Big Finish and BBCi, and any plans for a sequel to \"Real Time\" were shelved at that point. This extended to Russell even suggesting that \"Real Time\" be considered non-canon as far as the audio plays were concerned.\n\nAn extended version was released on CD in December 2002 by Big Finish, minus the illustrations/animation that had been included in the webcast but with the addition of further scenes designed to help the plot along, including an opening scene set inside the TARDIS.\n\nCharacter Options released a special figure of the Sixth Doctor in his \"toned down\"\nblue suit as part of its Doctor Who \"Classic\" 5\" action figure series.\n\nA second action figure of the Sixth Doctor in his blue outfit was released in 2016, as part of a set including all 13 incarnations of the Doctor. This version is far more detailed than the first, featuring multiple shades of blue.\n\n"}

He had no formal training in music, but saw that the mandolin needed original music, rather than relying on the transcribed violin music. His compositions and arrangements were well known in his day.\n\nHe was the author of \"Siegel's Special Mandolin Studies\", published by Jos. W Stern and Company, 1901, in which he covered left hand Pizzicato and harmonic duo style.\n\nSiegel recorded with Roy Butin in 1908 on four Victor records, the tunes: \"Southern Fantasy\", \"Estellita Waltz\", \"American Valor March\", and \"In Fairyland\".\n\nHe recorded Edison Diamond Disk record \"Ragtime Echoes\" in 1918 with Marie Caveny, with her on ukulele, and also \"Dance\", \"Mouse Dance\", and \"Medley\".

{"id": "55759200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55759200", "title": "Sketch (music)", "text": "Sketch (music)\n\nIn music, a sketch is an informal document prepared by a composer to assist in the process of composition.\n\nSketches may range greatly in scope and detail, from the smallest snippets to full drafts; concerning Ludwig van Beethoven's sketchbooks, for instance, Dean writes that they \"include every imaginable state between unaccompanied melodic motifs of a few notes to thoroughly worked-out full scores; even his fair copies of essentially ‘finished’ works show the signs of continuing composition.\"\n\nWhether a composer's sketches survive past his or her lifetime depends particular on the composer's own practice and partly on posterity's. Some composers habitually discarded their sketches when a composition was completed (for instance, Johannes Brahms), while others kept their sketches; sometimes in great numbers, as in the case of Beethoven. Mozart kept a great many sketches, but some were given away to friends as keepsakes following his death, and lost.\n\nOne reason for sketches is the fallibility of human memory. But there are more sophisticated reasons to sketch: most of classical music arranges the themes of each movement into a substantial architecture, for instance involving sonata form. The eighteenth century theorists H. C. Koch and J. G. Sulzer, in their written advice to composers, suggested that they should prepare sketches that would lay out how the various themes of the work would be arranged to create the overall structure. Marston adds that Koch and Sulzer's recommendations \"do in fact accord well with what scholars, borrowing from the terminology developed in relation to Beethoven's sketches, call a ‘continuity draft’, a notational form in which [for example] ‘Beethoven can be seen fitting together the more fragmentary ideas made earlier into a coherent whole’ (Cooper, 1990, p. 105).\"\n\nSince the mid-19th century, the study of composers' sketches has been a branch of musicology. Nicholas Marston, writing in the New Grove, lists three reasons why the study of sketches can be of interest.\n\n\nA fourth possibility is also mentioned by Marston, namely that one might appeal to the sketches to support a particular formal analysis (i.e. in music theory) of a finished work. This practice is controversial.\n\nSurviving sketches by Johann Sebastian Bach include:\nThe \"Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach\" contains, among several comparable early versions of compositions that became better known in their later versions, a sketch of what evolved into the first prelude of \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\".\n\nThe body of sketches by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is very substantial. The watermark studies of Alan Tyson yielded among other results the conclusion that Mozart would sometimes leave a work only partially complete (in sketch form) for a number of years, then finish it when an opportunity for performance arose. This in turn has been taken to support the view that Mozart carefully retained his sketches simply as a good business practice, keeping open the possibility of future performances and publication for works not immediately promising in this respect.\n\nThe corpus of Beethoven's surviving sketches is substantial and frequently illustrates Beethoven's method of work, which was often slow and arduous. Commentary on Beethoven's finished works sometimes point to the extremely primitive or unpromising character of the themes as they first appear. For instance, Antony Hopkins pointed out the following sketch material for the Second Symphony, remarking that it \"bears more resemblance to a bugle-call than a symphony.\"<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\tempo 4 = 160\n\\key d \\major \nd'4. a8 d' a d' fis' | a'4. fis'8 d' a d' fis' | a'2 fis'4 d' a1\n</score>He added, \"One wonders why he bothered to commit such banalities to paper at all but it seems to have been an essential part of his creative procedure.\" Hopkins's discussion (pp. 38–39) covers two further sketches, shown below:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\tempo 4 = 160\n\\clef \"bass\"\n\\key d \\major \nd2~ d8 cis d e | d2~ d8 cis d e | fis g a g fis e d fis | g2~ g8 fis g a | g2~ g8 fis g a | g\n</score>\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\tempo 4 = 160\n\\key d \\major \nd\"2. d\"16 cis\" d\" e\" | fis\"2. fis\"16 e\" fis\" g\" | a\"4.. a\"16 fis\"4.. fis\"16 | d\"2~ d\"4.. d\"16 | fis\"4.. fis\"16 d\"4.. d\"16 | b'2\n</score>These can be seen to be gradually evolving toward the actual main theme of the first movement as it appears in the symphony:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\tempo 4 = 160\n\\clef \"bass\"\n\\key d \\major \nd2.\\fp d16 (cis d e) fis2. fis16 (e fis g) a4-. a-. fis-. fis-. d r r2\n</score>\n\nSketches by Franz Schubert include the abandoned third movement of his \"Unfinished Symphony\", and the fragment known as Piano Sonata in E minor, D 769A.\n\nAmong Schubert's symphonies there are several sketches for a symphony in D major. In the first edition of the Deutsch catalogue, these were grouped under , apart from the early . Apart from the completed Third Symphony, D 200, there appear to be at least four independent sets of sketches for a symphonic work in that key:\nAlso the four movements of his Seventh Symphony, D 729, in E major (1821), only survive as sketches.\n\nSchubert's unfinished piano music ranges from rejected sketches of a few bars (e.g. ) to fairly elaborate drafts with several complete movements (e.g. \"Reliquie\" sonata). The sonata exists in two stages of development: the unfinished draft version in D-flat major, and the four-movement E-flat major version which Schubert prepared for publication near the end of his life.\n\nAlso in other genres Schubert produced sketches and drafts, some abandoned, and some later developed into complete compositions:\n\n\n"}

The series is a sequel and continuation of the original 1969–1974 sitcom \"The Brady Bunch\", focusing on its main characters as adults, and was the second such continuation after the short-lived 1981 sitcom \"The Brady Brides\".\n\nAiring on Friday nights, \"The Bradys\" failed in the ratings against the night-leading TGIF lineup on ABC and was cancelled after one month, with the last of six produced episodes airing on March 9, 1990. In its short run, it went through three different theme songs based on that of \"The Brady Bunch\", the last featuring revised lyrics sung by Florence Henderson.\n\n\nIn 1988, CBS commissioned a \"Brady Bunch\" reunion telefilm for their Christmas season programming. \"A Very Brady Christmas\" premiered on December 18, 1988 and drew a then-season high 25.1 rating and 39 share for a television film. The success of the film convinced series creator Sherwood Schwartz that a new Brady family TV series could be a hit, and work began on the show in December 1989. CBS re-aired \"A Very Brady Christmas\" again on December 22, 1989, using it as a promotional tool for the upcoming new show.\n\nRobert Reed, Florence Henderson, Ann B. Davis, Barry Williams, Christopher Knight, Eve Plumb, Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen all returned in their original \"Brady Bunch\" roles, and Jerry Houser and Ron Kuhlman reprised their roles from \"The Brady Brides\". Leah Ayres replaced Maureen McCormick as Marcia because McCormick declined this role.\n\nProduced at the height of the dramedy trend in American television, epitomized by such shows as \"Frank's Place\" and \"Hooperman\", \"The Bradys\" aimed to change direction toward more dramatic storytelling than viewers had been used to in the previous \"Brady\" series.\n\nUnlike the original 30-minute sitcom, \"The Bradys\" was an hour long and featured far more serious plot lines. Among them:\n\n\nDespite the more downbeat tone, the show did feature a laugh track at certain moments.\n\nThe show was put on hiatus with plans to continue sometime later in the year, but production never resumed and \"The Bradys\" was quietly cancelled after six episodes had aired. At the time, it was thought that the audience was simply unwilling to accept the sitcom characters in a more dramatic setting. The situation was further complicated by its time slot. When \"The Bradys\" launched, it was placed on Friday nights at 8:00 PM. This placed it against the comedy hits \"Full House\" and \"Family Matters\",\nwhich comprised the first half of ABC's Friday night \"TGIF\" lineup at the time.\n\nIn Barry Williams' autobiography \"Growing Up Brady: I Was A Teenage Greg\", he stated that when the initial two-hour episode aired, ratings were poor for the first hour, but when the second hour aired, the show won its time slot and the producers believed a change could be beneficial. The second hour, however, was the 9:00 PM hour that long been home to CBS' Friday stalwart, \"Dallas\". Although \"Dallas\" had been slipping in the ratings for several years, CBS was not willing to move the program to accommodate the wishes of \"The Bradys\" crew (although \"Dallas\" eventually did move back one hour to 10:00 PM before the season ended, albeit after \"The Bradys\" left the air). \n\n\"The Bradys\" was the third program of the ′1989-1990 season to fail as a lead-for \"Dallas\". \n\nThis would prove to be Robert Reed's final role of any significance. He fell ill in 1991, suffering from a combination of colon and bladder cancer that was exacerbated by his contracting of HIV, and died in May 1992.\n\nNotes\n\nOn April 3, 2007, the two-hour pilot episode \"The Brady 500\" (a.k.a. \"Start Your Engines/Here We Grow Again\") was released as a bonus feature on \"The Brady Bunch: The Complete Series\" 21-disc DVD box set by CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\n"}

It premiered at Chicago's Northlight Theatre in 2001 and was then produced Off-Broadway in March 2002. Since then it has had numerous productions both in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe story explores a five-year relationship between Jamie Wellerstein, a rising novelist, and Cathy Hiatt, a struggling actress. The show uses a form of storytelling in which Cathy's story is told in reverse chronological order (beginning the show at the end of the marriage), and Jamie's is told in chronological order (starting just after the couple have first met). The characters do not directly interact except for a wedding song in the middle as their timelines intersect.\n\n\"The Last Five Years\" was inspired by Brown's failed marriage to Theresa O'Neill. O'Neill threatened legal action on the grounds the story of the musical represented her relationship with Brown too closely, and Brown changed the song \"I Could Be in Love With Someone Like You\" to \"Shiksa Goddess\" in order to reduce the similarity between the character Cathy and O'Neill.\n\n\"The Last Five Years\" cast album was released by Sh-K-Boom Records in April 2002. A film adaptation starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan was released in February 2015.\n\nCathy is sitting alone lamenting the end of her marriage (\"Still Hurting\"). We shift to meet Jamie. It is five years earlier and he has just met Cathy. Jamie is overjoyed to be dating outside his Jewish heritage (\"Shiksa Goddess\").\n\nCathy and Jamie are in Ohio. It is her birthday and he has come to visit her as she works in a show there (\"See I'm Smiling\"). She is anxious to fix any problems in their marriage but she becomes angry when Jamie tells her he has to go back early to New York. During breaks in the music, we see a younger Jamie, talking to a literary agent about his book.\n\nJamie is moving in with Cathy. He comments on how lucky he is that everything is going right for him; his book is being published and his life with Cathy seems too good to be true (\"Moving Too Fast\"). Elsewhere an older Cathy is making a call to her agent: it seems her career isn't going the way she planned it.\n\nCathy is attending Jamie's book party. She sings about how he ignores her for his writing but she will always be in love with him (\"I'm a Part of That\").\n\nJamie and Cathy celebrate their second Christmas. He tells her a new story he has written about an old tailor named Schmuel and he gives her a Christmas present: a watch, promising to support her as she follows her dreams of acting. (\"The Schmuel Song\").\n\nCathy is in Ohio and writing to Jamie. She describes to Jamie her disappointing life in Ohio among her eccentric colleagues (\"A Summer in Ohio\").\n\nJamie is sitting with Cathy in Central Park. Jamie proposes to her and, for the first time in the musical, they sing together (\"The Next Ten Minutes\"). They get married, exchanging vows to stay together forever.\n\nJamie is facing temptation from other women, especially now his career as a writer has escalated (\"A Miracle Would Happen\"). Cathy, meanwhile, is auditioning for a role(\"When You Come Home to Me\"). She is getting down about the rejection she faces as an actress and complains to Jamie (\"Climbing Uphill\").\n\nJamie speaks to Cathy on the phone, trying to convince her that there is nothing going on with him and his editor, Elise. He wants to celebrate a book review but Cathy refuses to go out.\n\nJamie is fighting with Cathy, trying to get her to listen to him. He accuses her of being unsupportive of his career just because hers is failing. Though his words are harsh, he promises her that he believes in her (\"If I Didn't Believe in You\").\n\nA younger Cathy is in the car with Jamie, who is going to meet her parents. She tells him about her past relationships and hopes not to end up in a small town life like her friend from high school (\"I Can Do Better Than That\"). She asks Jamie to move in with her.\n\nNear the end of the relationship Jamie wakes up beside another woman (\"Nobody Needs to Know\"). He tries to defend his actions and blames Cathy for destroying his privacy and their relationship. Jamie promises not to lie to this woman and tells her that \"I could be in love with someone like you,\" just as he does to Cathy in \"Shiksa Goddess.\"\n\nCathy is ecstatic after her first date with Jamie. She sings goodbye (\"Goodbye Until Tomorrow\"). She proclaims that she has been waiting for Jamie her whole life. Simultaneously but five years forward, Jamie sits in their shared apartment writing laments over the relationship (\"I Could Never Rescue You\"). As Cathy waves Jamie \"goodbye until tomorrow\", Jamie wishes Cathy simply \"goodbye\".\n\nThe musical style draws on a number of musical genres, including pop, jazz, and classical, klezmer, Latin, Rock, and Folk. The orchestration consists of piano, guitar, fretless bass, two cellos, one doubling on celesta and tubular bell, and violin, doubling cymbal.\n\n\nThe show debuted at Northlight Theatre in Skokie, Illinois in 2001, running from May–July 1. The production starred Lauren Kennedy as Cathy and Norbert Leo Butz as Jamie. Kennedy had a previous commitment (a role in \"South Pacific\" in London) and was replaced by Sherie Rene Scott. Scott, therefore, performed the vocals on the cast recording.\n\nThe show opened Off-Broadway at the Minetta Theatre on March 2, 2002 and closed May 5, 2002. Directed by Daisy Prince, Butz and Scott again starred. \nThe production won the 2002 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music and Lyrics, as well as receiving Drama Desk nominations for Outstanding Musical, Outstanding Actor, Outstanding Actress, Outstanding Orchestrations, and Outstanding Set Design. It also received the Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Musical and Outstanding Actor, and the Outer Critics Circle Award nomination for Outstanding Off-Broadway Musical.\n\nThe show was revived in 2013 Off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre for a limited engagement with Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe in the roles of Jamie and Cathy, respectively. Brown himself directed. In March 2015, Kantor and Wolfe reprised their roles in a two-night-only concert production of the show at the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco.\n\nThe show premiered in Paris, France in 2013 presented by American Musical Theatre Live featuring Jonathan Wagner as Jamie and Miranda Crispin as Cathy. \n\nThe show was given its Northern Irish premiere at The Lyric Theatre, Belfast in 2015, running for a limited engagement. It starred Fra Fee as Jamie and Amy Lennox as Cathy. The production was directed by Stephen Whitson.\n\nThe show premiered in Stockholm, Sweden at Teaterstudio Lederman in April 2018. It starred Emil Nyström as Jamie and Cilla Silvia as Cathy. The production was directed by Robin Karlsson, with music direction by Johan Mörk. \n\nOn September 12, 2016, Jason Robert Brown, along with SubCulture, had a one night only benefit for the Brady Center to prevent gun violence. The Town Hall at 123 W 43rd St hosted this event. Cynthia Erivo played Cathy and Joshua Henry played Jamie. Jason Robert Brown conducted the orchestra.\n\nOn October 29, 2016, Samantha Barks and Jonathan Bailey took on the roles of Cathy and Jamie on the West End in London for the first time.\n\nAn adaptation starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan was directed by \"PS, I Love You\" director Richard LaGravenese.

It is best known for such long-produced games as Tiddledy Winks and Game of India, as well as such baby-boomer favorites as Green Ghost and television tie-in board games for such characters and series as Atom Ant, \"The Flintstones\", \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\", \"Perry Mason\" and Tom and Jerry. \n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Charles Raizen took a summer job with a manufacturer of embroidery patterns. Years later, he found a method of transferring images using friction, and circa 1915, the company became the Friction Transfer Pattern Company, first located on 2nd Street, between Avenues C and D, in Manhattan, then at 113-115 University Place. It quickly found that children enjoyed transferring the friction patterns, and the company shifted toward children's products such as Art-Toy Transfer Pictures. In 1917, Raizen bought the company and renamed it Transogram, but using 1915 as the founding date in its company logo (see above). Moving to 200 Fifth Avenue, the company developed the Toy Research Institute in order to test toys with input by a child psychologist, leading to the 1920s tagline that its toys were \"Kid Tested\". The company also began licensing media properties, manufacturing the likes of a \"Little Orphan Annie\" set of clothes pins.\n\nAfter producing toys, play sets and activity items, the company in 1929 produced its first game-like product, Orje, The Mystic Prophet, which one historian calls \"a solitaire fortunetelling pastime\".\n\nIn early 1939, the company announced that its new game Movie Millions would have a marketing push, headed by advertising manager Lee Sheldon, in magazines, trade magazines, newspapers and radio.\n\nIn 1955, Transogram introduced its first TV-series licensed board game, \"Dragnet\".\n\nIn 1960, Transogram was one of seven toy-makers, including Ideal and Parker Brothers, that the Federal Trade Commission accused of violating antitrust law by allegedly soliciting discriminatory advertising allowances from suppliers. \n\nTransogram advertised on television in 1968 for the first time in six years, with a million-dollar campaign centered on Green Glhost and Hocus Pocus, its two glow-in-the-dark games; Kabala, a future-telling game; and the printing kit Inkless Printing. The TV commercials were produced by the advertising agency Smith / Greenland.\n\nFollowing a previous incorporation in New York, the Transogram Company incorporated in Pennsylvania on September 4, 1959. In May 1962, Transogram made an initial public offering of 196,000 shares of common stock from Charles Raizen's private account. It sold for US$10 a share. Raizen retained control with 61.4 percent of outstanding stock. \n\nIn 1966, Transogram's total sales were $18,665,631. In the first six months of 1967, the company posted a loss of $1,191,000 on sales of $4,713,000, down from $6,169,000 in sales during the same period the year before. For the first nine months of 1970, Transogram reported a loss of $2,328,000 on sales of $21,642,000, compared to a loss of $293,000 on sales of $17,938,000 during the same period in 1969. Transogram announced in August 1969 that it had agreed to acquire 81 percent of the stock in Mountain Savings and Loan of Boulder, Colorado, in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of Transogram stock.\n\nThe financial holding company Winthrop Lawrence, controlled by du Pont heir Lammot du Pont Copeland Jr. and Thomas A. Sheehan, bought controlling interest in Transogram in 1969 and installed Joseph Bruna as chief executive officer. On February 26, 1971, Transogram declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing liabilities of $12,067,307 and assets of $3,009,072.

Depending on sources, the term may be given as travesty, travesti, or en travesti. The \"Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English\" explains the origin of the latter term as \"pseudo-French\", although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. \"Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra\" (1876), \"La revue des deux mondes \" (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.\n\nFor social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and \"travesti\" roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the pantomime traditionally contains a role for a \"principal boy\", a breeches role played by a young woman, and also one or more pantomime dames, female comic roles played by men. Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of Victorian burlesque, there were usually one or more breeches roles.\n\nUntil the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the Papal States—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in drag because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.\n\nAs a boy player, Alexander Cooke is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as Agrippina in Ben Jonson's \"Sejanus His Fall\". With the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. Edward Kynaston, whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's \"Epicoene\" and Evadne in Beaumont and Fletcher's \"The Maid's Tragedy\", was one of the last of the era's boy players.\n\nLondon's Shakespeare's Globe theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original Globe Theatre, continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of \"Henry V\" in 1997, while Mark Rylance played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of \"Antony and Cleopatra\".\n\n\"Travesti\" roles for men are still to be found in British pantomime, where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the pantomime dame.\n\nCastrati, adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas – initially in female roles. In the first performance of Monteverdi's \"Orfeo\" in 1607 the roles of Eurydice and Proserpina were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the Papal States, where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.\n\nAn exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits. In Lully's 1686 opera \"Armide\" the hero (Renaud) was sung by a haute-contre (a type of high tenor voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In Rameau's 1733 \"Hippolyte et Aricie\", the hero (Hippolyte) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three Fates and Tisiphone were scored for basses and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's \"Platée\" is also for an haute-contre.\n\nFemale roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's 1890 opera \"Hänsel und Gretel\" was originally written for a mezzo-soprano, but was sung by the tenor Philip Langridge in the Metropolitan Opera's 2009 production directed by Richard Jones. Azio Corghi's 2005 opera \"Il dissoluto assolto\", which incorporates story elements from Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\", casts a counter-tenor in the role of the mannequin of Donna Elvira.\n\nThe portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in Renaissance court ballet and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: \"Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers.\" Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: \"What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?\"\n\nIn the original production of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" in 1890, a male dancer, Enrico Cecchetti, created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.\n\nIn Frederick Ashton's 1948 choreography of \"Cinderella\", Robert Helpmann and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. Ben Stevenson later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet. Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in \"La Sylphide\" and the Widow Simone in \"La fille mal gardée\".\n\nWith the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men. Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in \"travesti\" roles were Mary Anne Keeley who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and the robber Jack Sheppard in Buckstone's play based on his life; Maude Adams who played Peter Pan in the American premiere of Barrie's play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times; and Sarah Bernhardt who created the role of Napoleon II of France in Edmond Rostand's \"L'Aiglon\", played Lorenzino de' Medici in Musset's \"Lorenzaccio\", Pelléas in Maeterlinck's \"Pelléas and Mélisande\" and perhaps most famously played the title role in \"Hamlet\". In the Victorian era, musical burlesques generally included several breeches roles. According to the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", although \"an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency.\" One of the specialists in these roles was Nellie Farren who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including \"Robert the Devil\", \"Little Jack Sheppard\" and \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\". In British pantomime, which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or Principal boy is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.\n\nThe practice of women performing \"en travesti\" in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as castrato singers went out of fashion and were replaced by mezzo-sopranos or contraltos in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of Rossini's 1813 \"Tancredi\" was specifically written for a female singer. However, \"travesti\" mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both Handel and Mozart, sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in \"The Marriage of Figaro\". In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was Richard Strauss, who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in \"Der Rosenkavalier\" and the Composer in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\".\n\nFrom 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the \"corps de ballet\" portraying matadors, hussars, and cavaliers, and even as the prima ballerina's 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France. Although both Fanny Elssler and her sister Thérèse danced \"travesti\" roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man. The French ballerina Eugénie Fiocre, who created the role of Franz in \"Coppélia\", was particularly known for her \"travesti\" performances.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

The resulting dossier contains allegations of misconduct and conspiracy between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Government of Russia during the 2016 election, with campaign members and Russian operatives allegedly colluding to interfere in the election to benefit Trump. It also alleged that Russia sought to damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy, including sharing negative information about Clinton with the Trump campaign. The dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed on January 10, 2017.<ref name=\"Bensinger_1/10/2017\"></ref> Several mainstream media outlets criticized BuzzFeed's decision to release it without verifying its allegations.<ref name=\"Bump_1/11/2017\"></ref><ref name= \"Zurawik_1/11/2017\"></ref>\nIn October 2015, private investigative firm Fusion GPS was contracted by conservative political website \"The Washington Free Beacon\" to provide political opposition research against Trump. In April 2016, attorney Marc Elias separately hired Fusion GPS to investigate Trump on behalf of Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC. The \"Free Beacon\" stopped their backing when Trump became the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee. In June 2016, Fusion GPS subcontracted Steele's firm to compile the dossier. His instructions were to seek answers to why Trump would \"repeatedly seek to do deals in a notoriously corrupt police state\". Clinton campaign officials were reportedly unaware that Fusion GPS had subcontracted Steele, and he was not told the Clinton campaign was the recipient of his research. Following Trump's election as president, funding from Clinton and the DNC ceased, but Steele continued his research and was reportedly paid directly by Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn R. Simpson. The completed dossier was then handed to British and American intelligence services.\nThe media, the intelligence community, and most experts have treated the dossier with caution due to its unverified assertions, while Trump has denounced the report as fake news.<ref name\"Sengupta_4/20/2018\"></ref> However, the intelligence community takes the allegations seriously and is investigating them.\n\nIn May 2018, former career intelligence officer James Clapper stated that \"more and more\" of the dossier had been validated over time. Overall, while some allegations of the dossier have been corroborated,<ref name=\"Sciutto_Perez_2/10/2017\"></ref> others remain unverified.<ref name=\"Lee_12/26/2017\"></ref> Some may require access to classified information for verification.<ref name=\"Berke_6/8/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Truscott_8/18/2018\"></ref>\n\nThe opposition research conducted by Fusion GPS on Donald Trump was completed in two phases with separate funders. The first research phase, from October 2015 to May 2016, was funded by \"The Washington Free Beacon\". The second phase, from June 2016 to December 2016, was separate from the \"Washington Free Beacon\" request and was funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Only the second phase produced the dossier.<ref name=\"Lima_10/27/2017\"></ref>\n\nIn October 2015, before the official start of the 2016 Republican primary campaign, \"The Washington Free Beacon\", an American conservative political journalism website primarily funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired the American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct general opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates.<ref name=\"Vogel_Haberman_10/27/2017\"></ref> The \"Free Beacon\" and Singer were \"part of the conservative never-Trump movement\". For months, Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on his business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016,<ref name=\"Johnson_5/4/2016\"></ref> \"The Free Beacon\" stopped funding research on him.<ref name=\"Shane_Confessore_Rosenberg_1/12/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Borger_1/12/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Robertson_2/7/2018\"></ref>\n\nIn October 2017, the \"Free Beacon\" issued a statement:\nAlthough the source of the Steele dossier's funding had already been reported correctly over a year before, and alluded to by the \"Free Beacon\" in October 2017, a February 2, 2018, story by the Associated Press (AP) contributed to confusion about its funding by stating that the dossier \"was initially funded\" by the \"Washington Free Beacon\", so the AP posted a correction the next day: \"Though the former spy, Christopher Steele, was hired by a firm that was initially funded by the Washington Free Beacon, he did not begin work on the project until after Democratic groups had begun funding it.\"<ref name=\"Tucker_Jalonick_Day_2/3/2018\"></ref>\n\nThe second phase of opposition research was funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, working through their attorney of record, Marc Elias of Perkins Coie.<ref name=\"Entous_Barrett_Helderman_10/24/2017\"></ref> In March 2016, Fusion GPS \"approached Perkins Coie to see if its clients would be interested in paying Fusion\" to continue its existing research on Trump,<ref name=\"Watkins_Merica_Polantz_10/25/2017\"></ref> and in April 2016, Elias hired Fusion GPS to perform opposition research on Trump.\n\nAs part of their investigation, Fusion GPS hired Orbis Business Intelligence, a private British intelligence firm, to look into connections between Trump and Russia. Orbis co-founder Christopher Steele, a retired British MI6 officer with expertise in Russian matters, was hired as a subcontractor to do the job.<ref name=\"Johnson_Kelly_1/9/2018\"></ref> In total, Perkins Coie paid Fusion GPS $1.02 million in fees and expenses, $168,000 of which was paid to Orbis by Fusion GPS and used by them to produce the dossier.<ref name=\"Hosenball_11/1/2017\"></ref> The DNC and Clinton campaign disclosed the total amount paid to Perkins Coie on campaign finance reports.<ref name=\"Johnson_9/10/2018\"></ref>\n\nOrbis was hired between June and November 2016, and Steele produced 16 memos during that time, with a 17th memo added in December. The memos were like \"prepublication notes\" based on reports from Steele's sources, and were not released as a fully vetted and \"finished news article\".<ref name=\"Flegenheimer_1/8/2018\"></ref> Steele believes that 70–90% of the dossier is accurate, a view that is shared by Simpson.\n\nSimpson has stated that, to his knowledge, Steele did not pay any of his sources.<ref name=\"Raju_Herb_Polantz_11/16/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Williams_Beavers_1/18/2018\"></ref> According to investigative reporter Jane Mayer of \"The New Yorker\", Orbis has a large number of paid \"collectors\" who \"harvest intelligence from a much larger network of unpaid sources, some of whom don't even realize they are being treated as informants […] but money doesn't change hands, because it could risk violating laws against, say, bribing government officials or insider trading. Paying sources might also encourage them to embellish.\" According to British journalist Luke Harding, Steele's sources were not new: \"They're not people that he kind of discovered yesterday. They are trusted contacts who essentially had proven themselves in other areas.\"<ref name=\"NPR.org_11/21/2017\"></ref> Howard Blum said that Steele leaned on sources \"whose loyalty and information he had bought and paid for over the years\".\n\nSteele delivered his reports individually to Fusion GPS as one- to three-page memos. The first memo, dated June 20, 2016, was sent to Washington by courier and hand-delivered to Fusion GPS. The names of the sources were redacted, \"providing instead descriptions of them that enabled Fusion to assess their basic credibility.\"\n\nLuke Harding wrote:\n\nSteele has stated that he soon found \"troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government.\" According to his sources, \"there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.\" According to Harding, \"Steele was shocked by the extent of collusion his sources were reporting,\" and told his friends: \"For anyone who reads it, this is a life-changing experience.\"<ref name=\"Borger_11/15/2017\"></ref> Steele felt that what he had unearthed \"was something of huge significance, way above party politics.\"<ref name=\"Blum_3/30/2017\"></ref> American reporter Howard Blum described Steele's rationale for becoming a whistleblower: \"The greater good trumps all other concerns.\"\n\nOn his own initiative, Steele decided to also pass the information to British and American intelligence services because he believed the findings were a matter of national security for both countries.<ref name=\"Sengupta_1/13/2017\"></ref> According to Simpson's testimony, Steele approached the FBI because he was concerned that Trump, then a candidate, was being blackmailed by Russia, and he became \"very concerned about whether this represented a national security threat\". When Steele showed his findings to FBI agents in Rome in early July, their reaction was \"shock and horror\".<ref name=\"Herb_Raju_Cohen_1/10/2018\"></ref><ref name=\"Kessler_1/9/2018\"></ref> Jane Mayer reports that the FBI agents \"asked Steele about Papadopoulos, and he [Steele] said that he hadn't heard anything about him.\"\n\nNancy LeTourneau, political writer for the \"Washington Monthly\", said that, according to ABC News,<ref name=\"Levine_9/18/2018\"></ref> in July 2016, as Steele was compiling the dossier, he sent what he had to \"an FBI contact in Rome, who passed it on to an agent in the FBI's New York field office. It sat there until mid-September, when it was finally sent to the counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.\" She wrote that \"while the Steele dossier was languishing in the FBI's New York field office\" for two months, according to \"The Washington Post\", CIA Director John Brennan had started an investigation with a secret task force \"composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI\". At the same time, he was busy creating his own dossier of material documenting that \"Russia was not only attempting to interfere in the 2016 election, they were doing so in order to elect Donald Trump ... [T]he entire intelligence community was on alert about this situation at least two months before [the dossier] became part of the investigation.\" She also said that the \"Steele dossier has so far proven to be fairly accurate\".<ref name=\"LeTourneau_9/19/2018\"></ref>\n\nSteele enjoyed a good working reputation \"for the knowledge he had developed over nearly 20 years working on Russia-related issues for British intelligence.\" Knowing this, in October 2016, a few weeks before the election, the FBI agreed to pay him to continue collecting information. However, the subsequent public release of the dossier stopped discussions between Steele and the FBI.<ref name=\"Hamburger_2/28/2017\"></ref> Simpson testified that \"Steele wasn't paid by the FBI, but was possibly reimbursed for a trip to Rome to meet with FBI officials.\"<ref name=\"Kiely_2/27/2018\"></ref> According to Mayer, Steele \"did request compensation for travelling to Rome, but he never received any.\"\n\nSimpson later said that \"Steele severed his contacts with [the] FBI before the election following public statements by the FBI that it had found no connection between the Trump campaign and Russia and concerns that [the FBI] was being 'manipulated for political ends by the Trump people'.\"<ref name=\"Jalonick_1/9/2018\"></ref> Steele had become frustrated with the FBI, whom he believed failed to investigate his reports, choosing instead to focus on the investigation into Clinton's emails. According to \"The Independent\", Steele came to believe that there was a \"cabal\" inside the FBI, particularly its New York field office linked to Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani, because it blocked any attempts to investigate the links between Trump and Russia.\n\nAccording to Fusion GPS's co-owners, Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, they did not tell Steele who their ultimate clients were, only that Steele was \"working for a law firm\", and they \"gave him no specific marching orders beyond this basic question: 'Why did Mr. Trump repeatedly seek to do deals in a notoriously corrupt police state that most serious investors shun?'\"\n\nJane Mayer reported that when the Clinton campaign \"indirectly employed\" Steele, Elias created a \"legal barrier\" by acting \"as a firewall\" between the campaign and Steele. Thus, any details were \"protected by attorney-client privilege. Fusion briefed only Elias on the reports. Simpson sent Elias nothing on paper—he was briefed orally.\" Only several months after signing the contract with Fusion GPS did Steele learn that the DNC and the Clinton campaign were the ultimate clients.\n\nA spokesperson for the DNC stated that neither Tom Perez nor \"the new leadership of the DNC were... involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization.\" A spokesperson for Perkins Coie stated that the campaign and the DNC were unaware that Fusion GPS \"had been hired to conduct the research\". \"The Washington Post\" reported that it is not clear how much of the research Elias received from Fusion GPS he shared with the campaign and the DNC. It is also not clear who in those organizations knew about the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele, but one person \"close to the matter\" said the organizations were \"not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS's role\". \"The New York Times\" revealed that earlier in 2017, \"Mr. Elias had denied that he had possessed the dossier before the election\".<ref name=\"Vogel_10/24/2017\"></ref>\n\nThe firewall was reportedly so effective that even campaign principals John Podesta and Robby Mook did not know that Steele was on the Democratic payroll until \"Mother Jones\" reported on the issue on October 31, 2016. When the \"Mother Jones\" story broke, John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign, said he was \"stunned by the news that the FBI had launched a full-blown investigation into Trump, especially one that was informed by research underwritten by the Clinton campaign.\" Although they knew that Perkins Coie had spent money for opposition research, neither Podesta nor campaign manager Robby Mook knew that Steele was on the Democratic payroll. Mayer said they both maintain they \"didn't read the dossier until BuzzFeed posted it online. She has also stated that \"the Clinton campaign never learned that Christopher Steele was on their payroll until it [the dossier] was in the press.\"<ref name=\"NPR_3/6/2018\"></ref> Far from a secret campaign weapon, Steele turned out to be a secret kept from the campaign.\"\n\nJane Mayer has described how, in \"late summer, Fusion set up a series of meetings, at the Tabard Inn, in Washington, between Steele and a handful of national-security reporters... Despite Steele's generally cool manner, he seemed distraught about the Russians' role in the election.\" Mayer attended one of the meetings. No news organizations ran any stories about the allegations at that time.\n\nBy the third quarter of 2016, many news organizations knew about the existence of the dossier, which had been described as an \"open secret\" among journalists. However, they chose not to publish information that could not be confirmed.<ref name=\"Ember_Grynbaum_1/10/2017\"></ref>\n\nBy October 2016, Steele had compiled 33 pages (16 memos), and he then passed on what he had discovered to David Corn, a reporter from \"Mother Jones\" magazine. On October 31, 2016, a week before the election, \"Mother Jones\" reported that a former intelligence officer, whom they did not name, had produced a report based on Russian sources and turned it over to the FBI.<ref name=\"Corn_10/31/2016\"></ref> The article disclosed some of the dossier's allegations:\n\nAfter Trump's election on November 8, 2016, the Democratic client stopped paying for the investigation, but Steele continued working on the dossier for Fusion GPS. At that time, Simpson \"reportedly spent his own money to continue the investigation\".<ref name=\"Sampathkumar_8/23/2017\"></ref> After the election, Steele's dossier \"became one of Washington's worst-kept secrets, and journalists worked to verify the allegations.\n\nOn November 18, 2016, U.S. Senator John McCain, who had been informed about the alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump, met with former British ambassador to Moscow Sir Andrew Wood at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada. Wood told McCain about the existence of the collected materials about Trump,<ref name=\"Edwards_1/11/2017\"></ref> and also vouched for Steele's professionalism and integrity.<ref name=\"Sengupta_1/12/2017\"></ref>\n\nAccording to Simpson's August 22, 2017, testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Steele and David J. Kramer, a longtime McCain aide and former U.S. State Department official working at Arizona State University, met each other at the Halifax forum and discussed the dossier. Kramer told Steele that McCain wanted to \"ask questions about it at the FBI. ... All we sort of wanted was for the government to do its job and we were concerned about whether the information that we provided previously had ever, you know, risen to the leadership level of the FBI.\" Later, \"Kramer followed up with Steele\". Steele had agreed with Fusion GPS to deliver a hard copy of all 16 memos to McCain, which McCain received in early December from Kramer. On December 9, McCain met personally with FBI Director James Comey to pass on the information.<ref name=\"Resnick_5/9/2018\"></ref> Comey later confirmed that counterintelligence investigations were under way into possible links between Trump associates and Moscow.\n\nAfter delivering his 16 memos, Steele received more information and composed the two-page \"December memo\", dated December 13. It mostly contained allegations against Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, which he denied. In an April 2017 court filing, Steele revealed previously unreported information that he had given a copy of his last memo to a \"senior UK government national security official acting in his official capacity, on a confidential basis in hard copy form\", because it \"had implications for the national security of the US and the UK\". Steele also \"sent an encrypted version to Fusion with instructions to deliver a hard copy to Senator McCain.\"\n\nIn early January 2017, President-elect Trump<ref name=\"Kosoff_7/20/2017\"></ref> and President Barack Obama were separately briefed about the Russian interference in the election and on the existence of the dossier by the chiefs of several U.S. intelligence agencies. Vice President Joe Biden has confirmed that he and the president received briefings on the dossier and the allegations within.<ref name=\"Nowicki_1/13/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"AOL_1/12/2017\"></ref>\n\nAfter the meeting with Obama, Trump was informed of the Russian election interference by Comey and Clapper on January 6, 2017, at a meeting in Trump Tower. After this meeting, Comey stayed behind and spoke privately with Trump, informing him of the dossier and some of its allegations.<ref name=\"Chan_4/16/2018\"></ref> Trump later expressed that he felt that James Comey was trying to blackmail him at the meeting in Trump Tower, held two weeks before the inauguration. In April 2018, Comey said he did not inform Trump that the dossier was partly funded by Democrats because that \"wasn't necessary for my goal, which was to alert him that we had this information.\"\n\nOn January 10, 2017, CNN reported that classified documents presented to Obama and Trump the previous week included allegations that Russian operatives possess \"compromising personal and financial information\" about Trump. CNN stated that it would not publish specific details on the memos because it had not \"independently corroborated the specific allegations.\"<ref name=\"Perez_Sciutto_Tapper_Bernstein_1/10/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Wemple_1/11/2017\"></ref> Following the CNN report, BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier that it said was the basis of the briefing, including unverified claims that Russian operatives had collected \"embarrassing material\" involving Trump that could be used to blackmail him.<ref name=\"Mak_Suebsaeng_Weiss_ 1/10/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Shane_Goldman_Rosenberg_1/10/2017\"></ref>\n\nBuzzFeed was harshly criticized for publishing what \"Washington Post\" columnist Margaret Sullivan called \"scurrilous allegations dressed up as an intelligence report meant to damage Donald Trump,\"<ref name=\"Sullivan_1/11/2017\"></ref> while \"The New York Times\" noted that the publication sparked a debate centering on the use of unsubstantiated information from anonymous sources.<ref name=\"Smith_1/23/2017\"></ref> BuzzFeed's executive staff said the materials were newsworthy because they were \"in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media\" and argued that this justified public release.<ref name=\"Graham_1/11/2017\"></ref>\n\nIn relation to a defamation lawsuit filed by Aleksej Gubarev against BuzzFeed, regarding their publication of the dossier, Senior Master Barbara Fontaine stated that Steele was \"in many respects in the same position as a whistle-blower\" because of his actions \"in sending part of the dossier to Senator John McCain and a senior government national security official, and in briefing sections of the US media.\" She said that \"it was not known who provided the dossier to BuzzFeed but Mr Steele's evidence was that he was 'horrified and remains horrified' that it was published at all, let alone without substantial redactions.\"<ref name=\"Express_3/21/2018\"></ref> Both Simpson and Steele have denied providing the dossier to BuzzFeed.\n\nWhen BuzzFeed published the 35-page dossier in January 2017, the individual memos were one- to three-pages long and page numbers 1-35 had been handwritten at the bottom. All but one had a typed date at the bottom. Each of the first 16 reports was assigned a typed number in the heading between 80 and 135, but the numeric order didn't always match the chronological order. The 17th memo, known as the \"December memo\", was numbered 166.<ref name=\"Bump_10/25/2017\"></ref> Of the original reports numbered 1-166, only certain reports were used for the dossier, and it is unknown what happened with the content of the other reports: \"For example, the first report is labeled as '080,' with no indication given as to where the original 79 antecedents might have gone. The second report is then labeled '086,' creating yet another mystery as to 81 through 85, and what content they might contain that would otherwise bolster or contextualize what came before or what follows.\"<ref name=\"Weiss_Fitzpatrick_7/25/2018\"></ref>\n\nEach memo started with a page heading in the same style as the first one shown here:\n\nWhen CNN reported the existence of the dossier on January 10, 2017,<ref name=\"Nichols_Dilanian_1/11/2017\"></ref> it did not name the author of the dossier, but revealed that he was British. Steele concluded that his anonymity had been \"fatally compromised\", and, realizing it was \"only a matter of time until his name became public knowledge\", fled into hiding with his family, in fear of \"a prompt and potentially dangerous backlash against him from Moscow\".<ref name=\"Staff_1/12/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Wood_1/12/2017\"></ref> \"The Wall Street Journal\" revealed Steele's name the next day, on January 11.<ref name=\"Hope_Rothfeld_Cullison_1/11/2017\"></ref> Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd, for whom Steele worked at the time the dossier was authored, and its director Christopher Burrows, a counterterrorism specialist, would not confirm or deny that Orbis had produced the dossier. On March 7, 2017, as some members of the U.S. Congress were expressing interest in meeting with or hearing testimony from Steele, he reemerged after weeks in hiding, appearing publicly on camera and stating, \"I'm really pleased to be back here working again at the Orbis's offices in London today.\"<ref name=\"Withnall_3/7/2017\"></ref>\n\nCalled by the media a \"highly regarded Kremlin expert\" and \"one of MI6's greatest Russia specialists\", Steele formerly worked for the British intelligence agency MI6, heading its Russia Desk for three years at the end of his MI6 career.

Generally, \"former intelligence officers and other national-security experts\" urged \"skepticism and caution\" but still took \"the fact that the nation's top intelligence officials chose to present a summary version of the dossier to both President Obama and President-elect Trump\" as an indication \"that they may have had a relatively high degree of confidence that at least some of the claims therein were credible, or at least worth investigating further\".<ref name=\"Tracy_1/11/2017\"></ref>\n\nVice President Joe Biden told reporters that, while he and Obama were receiving a briefing on the extent of election hacking attempts, there was a two-page addendum which addressed the contents of the Steele dossier.<ref name=\"Hensch_1/12/2017\"></ref> Top intelligence officials told them they \"felt obligated to inform them about uncorroborated allegations about President-elect Donald Trump out of concern the information would become public and catch them off-guard\".<ref name=\"Lederman_1/12/2017\"></ref>\n\nOn January 11, 2017, \"Newsweek\" published a list of \"13 things that don't add up\" in the dossier, writing that it was a \"strange mix of the amateur and the insightful\" and stating that it \"contains lots of Kremlin-related gossip that could indeed be, as the author claims, from deep insiders—or equally gleaned\" from Russian newspapers and blogs.<ref name=\"Matthews_1/11/2017\"></ref> Former UK ambassador to Russia Sir Tony Brenton stated that certain aspects of the dossier were inconsistent with British intelligence's understanding of how the Kremlin works, commenting: \"I've seen quite a lot of intelligence on Russia, and there are some things in [the dossier] which look pretty shaky.\"<ref name=\"SkyNews_1/13/2017\"></ref>\n\nIn his June 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee testimony, former FBI director James Comey called \"some personally sensitive aspects\" of the dossier \"salacious and unverified,\" but he did not state that the entire dossier was unverified or that the salacious aspects were false.

He initially denounced Russia's annexation of Crimea as a \"land grab\" that \"should never have happened\", and called for a firmer U.S. response, saying \"We should definitely be strong.

One retired diplomat later said, \"What was troubling about these stories is that suddenly I was hearing that we were preparing to rescind sanctions in exchange for, well, nothing.\"<ref name=\"Dilanian_3/4/2018\"></ref> The staffers alerted Congressional allies who took steps to codify the sanctions into law. The attempt to overturn the sanctions was abandoned after Flynn's conversation was revealed and Flynn resigned.<ref name=\"Isikoff_6/1/2017\"></ref> In August 2017, Congress passed a bipartisan bill to impose new sanctions on Russia.

Kalugin was the head of the economics section at the Russian embassy. He returned to Russia in August 2016. \"McClatchy\" reported that the FBI was investigating whether Kalugin played a role in the election interference. Kalugin has denied the allegations.<ref name=\"Hall_Stone_Gordon-Goldstein_2/15/2017\"></ref>\n\nJane Mayer said that this part of the dossier seems true, even if the name of an official may have been wrong.

While Trump and some Republicans have claimed that the dossier was behind the beginning of the FBI investigation into his campaign's potential conspiracy with Russia, in December 2017, former and current intelligence officials revealed that the actual impetus was a series of comments made in May 2016 by Papadopoulos to Alexander Downer, a top Australian diplomat, during a night of \"heavy drinking at an upscale London bar\". Shep Smith, an anchor at \"Fox News\", confirmed this series of events, directly contradicting Trump's and Sean Hannity's false claims that the dossier was the impetus for the start of the investigation. John Sipher reported that Papadopoulos bragged \"that the Trump campaign was aware the Russian government had dirt on Hillary Clinton\"<ref name=\"Sipher_1/11/2018\"></ref> in the form of \"thousands of emails\" stolen from Clinton which could be used to damage her campaign. Papadopoulos had learned this about three weeks earlier. Two months later, when WikiLeaks started releasing DNC emails, Australian officials alerted the Americans about Papadopoulos' remarks.<ref name=\"Hart_12/30/2017\"></ref> Over a year later, Papadopoulos was arrested on July 27, 2017,<ref name=\"Wang_Wilkie_10/30/2017\"></ref> and in October 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and became a cooperating witness in Mueller's investigation.\n\nOther factors also played into the FBI's decision to investigate Russian interference and the Trump campaign: intelligence from friendly governments, especially the British and Dutch, and information about Page's Moscow trip. Steele's first report was sent to Fusion GPS, dated June 20, 2016, and FBI agents first interviewed Steele in October 2016. \"The New York Times\" reported on February 14, 2017, that the FBI had made contact with some of Steele's sources.<ref name=\"Schmidt_Mazzetti_Apuzzo_2/14/2017\"></ref> CNN later reported that the FBI had used the dossier to bolster its existing investigations.\n\nIn a January 2, 2018, CNN panel discussion, Elizabeth Foley, a Florida International University law professor, falsely alleged that the FISA warrant for Page was \"all based on a dossier\", adding \"That's what Jim Comey has suggested.\" She also cited reports from CNN and \"The New York Times\". PolitiFact concluded that her claim about Comey was unsubstantiated, and according to CNN, the dossier was only \"part of the justification\", and that \"The New York Times\" report did not mention the dossier. PolitiFact rated her claim \"Mostly False\".<ref name=\"Graves_1/5/2018\"></ref>\n\nThe FBI has resisted FOIA requests which would force it to reveal classified details of its investigation, including its efforts to disprove or confirm allegations in the dossier. This resistance has been approved by U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta, but a move by Trump to declassify some of this material, and a following FOIA lawsuit by journalist Josh Gerstein and a pro-transparency group, the James Madison Project, resulted in a ruling which would allow some declassification. The irony of the situation was noted by Brad Moss, a lawyer involved in that lawsuit: \"It will be rather ironic if the president's peripheral actions that resulted in this ruling wind up disclosing that the FBI has been able to corroborate any of the 'salacious' allegations.\"<ref name=\"Gerstein_8/16/2018\"></ref>\n\nOn August 28, 2018, Bruce Ohr, former head of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, testified at a closed-door interview with Congressmen that he had \"passed on 'dossier'-linked information to the FBI\". At that time, the FBI's investigation had already been underway for four months, and the FBI had cited \"previously-obtained information from the 'dossier'\" to support secret surveillance of Carter Page.<ref name=\"Levine_8/29/2018\"></ref> Contrary to a conspiracy theory promoted by Trump, there is no evidence that Ohr was involved in the start of the Russia probe.<ref name=\"Shear_Benner_Fandos_8/17/2018\"></ref> According to a congressional source speaking to ABC News, Ohr had \"little impact\" on the investigation.<ref name=\"Levine_8/23/2018\"></ref>\n\nOn September 1, 2018, congressional sources relayed to the Associated Press that Ohr told members of Congress he had met Steele over breakfast on July 30, 2016, along with Nellie Ohr and a Steele associate. At that time Steele revealed that he had been told Russian intelligence believed \"they had Trump over a barrel\", an assertion that Steele echoed in his dossier. Ohr also stated that Steele told him Page had met with \"higher-level Russian officials than [he] had acknowledged\".<ref name=\"Tucker_Day_9/1/2018\"></ref>\n\nIn July 2018, after the FBI released redacted FISA court documents related to Carter Page, former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy wrote in \"National Review\" that the documents show that the FBI's probable cause finding that Trump campaign adviser Page conspired with Russian government to influence the 2016 election was based on the dossier. McCarthy said that even though each of the four surveillance applications claimed that the FBI had \"verified\" Steele's information, the bureau did not confirm the allegations independent of Steele. He also said that if the allegations had been corroborated, \"the bureau would not be suffering in silence\" and if the FBI and Justice Department had solid evidence to verify the dossier's allegations, which were based on multiple hearsay, they \"would have used that evidence as their probable cause showing against Page\". Former federal prosecutors Barbara McQuade, Daniel S. Goldman, and Mimi Rocah said that McCarthy argued on Fox News and in his column that: \"(1) the so-called Steele dossier was 'the driving force behind the Trump-Russia investigation'; (2) the FISA court was not told that the Clinton campaign was behind Steele's work; and (3) the FBI did not 'verify' the factual allegations contained in the dossier.\" After quickly dismissing the first two arguments as unsupported, they turned their attention to the third point, explaining that such verification is not always possible, and that if every detail of an accusation must first be proven before an application for surveillance can be submitted, then much police work would never happen. They argue that hearsay evidence is allowable as part of a FISA submission. In this case, they assert that the \"FBI would've been derelict not to use Steele dossier for the Carter Page FISA warrant\". All the FBI had to prove was \"probable cause\", not the higher standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt\": the \"FISA application simply provided evidence that there was probable cause to believe that Carter Page was an agent of a foreign power and may have, or may be about to, commit violations of criminal law.\"<ref name=\"McQuade_Goldman_Rocah_7/25/2018\"></ref>\n\nAccording to Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman Mark Warner (D-VA), the dossier's allegations are being investigated by a Special Counsel led by Robert Mueller, which, since May 2017, has been investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. In the summer of 2017, Mueller's team of investigators met with Steele.<ref name=\"Perez_Prokupecz_Brown_10/25/2017\"></ref> As some leads stemming from the dossier have already been followed and confirmed by the FBI, legal experts have stated that Special Counsel investigators, headed by Robert Mueller, are obligated to follow any leads the dossier has presented them with, irrespective of what parties financed it in its various stages of development, or \"[t]hey would be derelict in their duty if they didn't.\"<ref name=\"Bertrand_10/5/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Feldman_11/2/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Bertrand_10/26/2017\"></ref>\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the Nunes memo, a four-page memorandum written for U.S. Representative Devin Nunes by his staff, was released to the public. Referring to the dossier, the memo states that the FBI \"may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources\" to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant in October 2016 and in three subsequent renewals on Carter Page in the early phases of the FBI's interference investigation.<ref name=\"Parker_Helderman_Dawsey_Leonnig_1/27/2018\"></ref> Republican legislators argued that the memo presents evidence that a group of politically-biased FBI employees abused the FISA warrant process for the purpose of undermining the Trump presidency.<ref name=\"Savage_1/30/2018\"></ref> The Nunes memo stated that there was excessive and improper dependence on the Trump–Russia dossier.\n\nOn February 3, 2018, Trump praised the Nunes memo and tweeted:\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) disagreed, stating on February 4 on CBS's \"Face the Nation\": \"I actually don't think [the memo] has any impact on the Russia probe.\" He went on to say:\n\nGowdy was dissatisfied with the process of seeking the warrant: \"I say investigate everything Russia did but admit that this was a really sloppy process that you engaged in to surveil a U.S. citizen.\" When questioned, he said that the FISA warrant on Carter Page would not have been authorized without the dossier.<ref name=\"Watson_2/4/2018\"></ref>\n\nJane Mayer has quoted Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse: \"To impeach Steele's dossier is to impeach Mueller's investigation... It's to recast the focus back on Hillary\", with the Republicans' aim to \"create a false narrative saying this is all a political witch hunt.\" Mayer tied his view directly to Devin Nunes' production of \"a report purporting to show that the real conspiracy revolved around Hillary Clinton,\" falsely alleging that Clinton \"colluded with the Russians...\", a claim debunked by Glenn Kessler. Kessler, a fact checker for \"The Washington Post\", analyzed a false accusation made by Nunes in a February 7, 2018, interview on the Hugh Hewitt Show: \"The truth is that they [Democrats] are covering up that Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump to feed it to the FBI to open up an investigation into the other campaign.\" Kessler's \"Pinocchio Test\" rating was: \"[T]here is no evidence that Clinton was involved in Steele's reports or worked with Russian entities to feed information to Steele. That's where Nunes's claim goes off the rails—and why he earns Four Pinocchios.\"<ref name=\"Kessler_2/9/2018\"></ref> \"Four Pinocchios\" equals a \"Whopper\".<ref name=\"Kessler_9/11/2013\"></ref>\n\nThe Nunes memo falsely asserted that \"Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was—according to his June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.'\" Factcheckers noted that Comey actually testified that \"some personally sensitive aspects of the information\" were \"salacious and unverified,\" rather than the entire dossier.<ref name=\"Jacobson_2/5/2018\"></ref><ref name=\"Kiely_6/7/2017\"></ref> \nThe Nunes memo asserted that Andrew McCabe testified to the House Intelligence Committee that \"no surveillance warrant [of Carter Page] would have been sought from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) without the Steele dossier information,\" but because McCabe testified in classified session, no transcript has yet been released to verify this assertion. In a CNN interview, McCabe asserted \"that House Republicans twisted his answers\":\n\nCongressman Eric Swalwell, a member of the Committee, also stated that McCabe's testimony was mischaracterized.<ref name=\"Hains_2/2/2018\"></ref>\n\nContrary to assertions by Trump and his supporters that the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections was triggered by the dossier,<ref name=\"Cassidy_2/2/2018\"></ref> the Nunes memo confirmed the investigation began with a tip from Australian diplomat Alexander Downer regarding a conversation he had with Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos in a London bar in May 2016.<ref name=\"Lucas_2/2/2018\"></ref> The FBI opened its investigation in late July 2016, and \"The Washington Post\" noted that this timing is \"significant, given the FBI did not seek authorization to conduct surveillance on Page until three months later, on Oct. 21, 2016.\" The Democrats asserted that the Nunes memo \"shows the Russia investigation would be underway with or without the surveillance of Page, and—more critically—even if the government had never seen the dossier of information about Trump that was compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy.\"<ref name=\"Tumulty_Helderman_2/2/2018\"></ref>\n\nAmid assertions in the Nunes memo and from others that the dossier's use in the Carter Page FISA warrant request was improper—countered by Democrats' assertions that there was nothing improper—on April 6, 2018, the Justice Department made the FISA application available for all members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to review.<ref name=\"Jarrett_4/7/2018\"></ref>\n\nOn July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released heavily redacted versions of four FISA warrant applications for Carter Page which, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter, Charlie Savage, showed that key assertions made in the Nunes memo were \"misleading or false\", corroborating the rebuttal made by Democrats.<ref name=\"Savage_7/22/2018\"></ref><ref name=\"Kris_7/21/2018\"></ref>\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly condemned the dossier and denied collusion with Russia, including in this tweet, in which he quotes from \"Fox & Friends\":\n\nTrump has called the dossier \"fake news\" and criticized the intelligence and media sources that published it.<ref name=\"Henderson_Lawler_Burke_1/12/2017\"></ref> During a press conference on January 11, 2017, Trump denounced the dossier's claims as false, saying that it was \"disgraceful\" for U.S. intelligence agencies to report them.<ref name=\"Rascoe_1/11/2017\"></ref> Trump refused to take a question from CNN's senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta on the subject.
