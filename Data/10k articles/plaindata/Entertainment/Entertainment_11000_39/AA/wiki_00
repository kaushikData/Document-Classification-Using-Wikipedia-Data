African countries are suffering from the Digital Divide and many Africans, especially families in rural areas, are blocked from accessing information and digital technology.\n\nOne of the main goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to “significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020”.\n\nThe project will open a window for African rural families. Through television people will be able to acquire more useful information about the world. They will also have access to agriculture, science or sanitation's knowledge which will impact positively their daily lives. This will expand their horizon and help them to get rid of poverty.\n\nProject will also create local jobs. Staff will be hired and trained to maintain hardware and ensure the long-term operation of the project.\n\nKnowledge and information villagers will have access to will promote the development of rural areas of each country.\n\nAccess to digital TV will also accelerate digital television transition of the participating countries. That will expand coverage area of African local TV stations and promote TV industry's upgrade in Africa.\n\nThe project will narrow gaps between countries and regions in Africa, which will reduce inequality between African countries. Digital TV used to be luxury in African markets but the project of “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages” will help break the monopoly of digital TV industry as well as promote a balanced development in African region.\n\nThere will be total 10,112 villages in 25 African countries benefiting from the project “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages”.\n\nThe 25 countries are: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique, Côte d'Ivoire, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, D.R.C., Guinea, Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi, Benin, Eritrea, Chad, Central Africa, Congo Brazzaville, Guinea-Bissau, Namibia and Gabon.\n\nChinese government will aid each village with two Projector TVs, one 32 inch Digital TV set and 20 DTH decoders and satellite dishes. Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be equipped with solar power systems and DTH access units.\n\nThe Projector TV can project more than 120 inches picture screen in the wall and use DLP technology and LED light source with high brightness and low power.\n\nThe StarTimes Digital TV set supports signal input of satellite TV without a decoder and its smart operation system supports automatic system maintenance and upgrade. Comparing with CRT TV sets, the Digital TV set saves 50% power and comes with HD LED screen category, Dolby audio system, wide voltage input, HDMI and USB ports.\n\nThe Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be laid out in the public area of the village, like school or village clinic, which could allow all villagers, especially kids, to enjoy the wonderful digital TV programs.\n\nTo cope with the problem of power shortage in African rural areas, the Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be outfitted with solar power system, which can support the people to watch TV for 6 hours without electricity after sunset.\n\nThe decoders adopt the advanced standard H.265, which can support the input of HD digital signals from the satellite directly.\n\nDigital TV operator StarTimes has been chosen to carry out the project under the guide of Chinese and African governments.\n\nStarTimes will supply all hardware of the project, install them in each village of the 25 countries as well as maintain equipment once the project is complete.\n"}

Blaze was featured prominently during children's television advertising (Mattel was the very first toymaker to advertise year around with television commercials). Unlike other rocking-horses of the time, Blaze was mounted on a stand that was said to be \"untippable\" and had no springs. The apparatus prevented pinched fingers, and was fitted out with a mechanism that moved the horses legs in \"real life action.\" Another Mattel feature allowed Blaze to talk when you pulled his \"Magic Ring.\" His talking voice unit was the very same one produced by Mattel and unveiled in 1960 in its talking Chatty Cathy doll, and later toys like the Talking Mister Ed puppet. Blaze could say 11 different things like, \"How about some hay?\"; he could also whinny and neigh. A toy like this, that could gallop and move realistically when the horse was rocked forward and backward, was something special.\n\nBlaze was made of what Mattel called \"hi-impact plastic\" with black-and-white markings (a pinto pony), and a molded black saddle and red blanket. Blaze also had attached reins, fixed hand-posts, and 2-position foot rests. The stand was made of 1-inch tubular steel and was advertised as being \"untippable.\" Saddle height was 29 inches and was recommended for ages 1–7. Blaze was marketed in most retail catalogs, such as Sears, J.C. Penney, and Montgomery Wards. When first issued, Blaze did not have the talking feature, this was added very quickly after his initial release, so there may be versions of this toy that do not, and never did, talk.\n\n"}

Members include Alvaro Aguilera, Joe Jobe, Ambra Succi, Fredrik Rydman aka Benke, Filmon Michael, David Dalmo and Jennie Widegren. Many of the members has choreographed for \"So You Think You Can Dance (Scandinavia)\", and Fredrik \"Benke\" Rydman was permanent judge. The company recently staged a street dance tribute to Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\", which subsequently became a runaway YouTube success.\n\nLately they have been touring with their latest creation, \"Insane in the Brain\", a streetdance version of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", named after Cypress Hill's featured song, \"Insane in the Brain\".\n\nNow they are working on their final production as a group \"The Last Bounce\" at Ericsson Globe Arena in Stockholm.\n\nIn the late 1997 Bounce was formed by some of Sweden’s best streetdancers. The members of the group have been coming and going but the present dancers are Alvaro Aguilera, Ambra Succi, David Dalmo, Filmon “Fille” Michael, Fredrik “Benke” Rydman, Joe Jobe and Jennie Widegren. They have inspired each other with many different dance styles, Breaking, Locking, Popping, Boogaloo, New School, Jazz, Lindy Hop and Tap. Today they are ready to use any style of dance to create new and surprising shows.\n\nWhen Bounce started to practise together they knew pretty soon that they wanted to do something more. At first they thought that they wouldn’t stay together for very long so they wanted to do a show before summer 2007. At that time they didn’t know that Bounce would last for seven years.\n\nIn 1998 Bounce's first show premiered and was called Rot. Right after that they toured in Sweden with the production Asfalt. At that time they needed something different after working hard for a long time. They went to Los Angeles to work and practice. In the summer 1999 the show Rotmos, inspired by L.A, was performed in an outdoor arena in the center of Stockholm.\n\nBounce was invited to tour with the Riksteater and Freaky Flow was created for the spring of 2000. During the practice of Freaky Flow the English producer Nick Grace contacted them and they came to an agreement for a new show to be created for Stockholm and London. The new show was called Bounce The Show and one of the words greatest lighting designers, Patrick Woodroffe, was working with them. On this show they really went for it and added 7 more dancers to perform with them.\n\nBounce came back to Sweden to do 24 sold-out shows at Dansens Hus after being in London for two months and then went back for another 10 weeks at the Roundhouse. During the London period Filmon Michael replaced Joe Jobe after he had badly injured his knee, and in the late autumn 2002 Filmon became a full member of Bounce Streetdance Company.\nBounce vs Petter was the next production and started in winter 2001/2002. It was the first time a dancegroup and a recording artist worked together to make a theatrical experience. On outdoor stages they toured around Sweden with 10 performances during the summer 2002 with a great show at Skansen as an end in front of 5000 screaming people.\n\nFor six months in 2003 Bounce collected their best dance- and visual ideas to shape the new show The Score and its storyline. This was the biggest dance show ever in Sweden and was about seven criminals coming together to do a heist, chased by the cop (danced by Lil'Tim, UK). Even in Norway and Denmark The Score was shown. Almost 100.000 audiences came to watch 116 shows in Scandinavia.\n\nBounce Live was a two years project with live musician led by André Ferrari and a story about Bounce and personally told stories. The musician passion and attitude help them to create the air of warm and soul that Bounce was looking for to share with the audience. The show was performed on the music hall Nalen. This has given a great experience to perform so close to the audience. They did 46 shows in the spring after the premiere in January 2005 and then toured around in Sweden in the fall.\n\nIn 2005 the TV-show Floorfiller aired with Bounce as judges and choreographers. At the same time they started to prepare for the new show \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\". Before the show people had wondering how it would be possible to tell this story with dance. This had been the most challenging they ever had created. But the audiences had understood the story through pure hiphop. The danceshow had almost as many shows as The Score and was rewarded with SvD Opera-Prize.\n\nIn 2008 Bounce continued to perform with \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" or another name for it \"Insane in the Brain\" in Sweden and in the UK. When they were back in Sweden they took some time away from each other to get new energy and collect new fresh ideas. Back together the group stated to plan their next show Caution with live barking dogs and crazy stunt, inspired by De La Guarda, to push their limits and challenge them. Caution had premier in February 2009 at the Orion Theatre and played at full houses for four months. When Caution ended they held their annually Bounce Summercamp where people from all over the world joined for three weeks.\n\nBounce made a Flash Mob in tribute to Michael Jackson in the summer 2009 that got over 8 million hits on YouTube. Just a little while after the first one they ended Bounce Summercamp with another Flash Mob who was called the Human domino with the dancer from the camp on the amusement park Gröna Lund.\n\nIn September they returned to London to once again do \"Insane in the Brain\" at the Peacock Theater with a followed with a UK tour. Totally more than 125,000 people have seen the show until now and a new UK-tour is planned in June 2010 at the Peacock Theatre.\n\nOn April 23, 2010 Bounce last dance show has premier at the Ericsson Globe and is called The Last Bounce. The show is going to contain some of the highlight from Bounce early shows mixed with new numbers with over hundred guestdancers.\n\nOn May 14, Fredrik Rydman and Jennie Widegrens choreography will appear at the opening segment of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö.\n\nFormer members: Karl Dyall, Sandra Meneses, Karim Rahali Carlsson,\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19208133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19208133", "title": "Box hockey", "text": "Box hockey\n\nBox hockey is an active hand game played between two people with sticks, a puck and a compartmented box (typically long), and typically played outdoors. The object of the game is to move a hockey puck through the center dividers, of the box, out through a hole placed at each end of the box, also known as the goal. The two players face one another on either side of the box, and each attempts to move the puck to their left. If a player succeeds in getting the puck to exit the box through the goal, the player scores one point (or goal). The first player to score the predetermined number of goals wins the game.\n\nBox hockey has little known origin, but the game has been around since at least the late 19th century, as described in various game books, such as \"Games for the Playground, Home, School and Gym\" (Jessie H. Bancroft, 1913) and \"400 Games for School, Home, and Playground\" (F.A. Owen Pub. Co., 1920). \n\nBox Hockey was listed as the \"Game of the Month\" as published in the 1914 Volume 2 of the \"Recreational helps\" by the New York State College of Agriculture Department of Rural Sociology with the following description:\n\n\"Box hockey is an excellent active game for picnics camps and playgrounds. It can also be adapted to indoor recreation if the floor upon which it is played is well padded with old rugs to prevent being damaged with the hockey sticks.\" \n\n\"Equipment: Take two pieces [boards] of lumber 2 inches by 10 inches by 8 or 10 feet [5 cm × 25 cm × 2.4 or 3.0 m], and two [end] pieces 1 inch by 10 inches by 4 foot [2.5 cm × 25 cm × 1.2 m] and construct a rectangular box fastening it together with spike nails or wagon bed rods. Take another board 2 inches by 10 inches by 4 feet [5 cm × 25 cm × 1.2 m] and nail it into the rectangular frame, dividing it into two equal compartments. On the bottom side of the box, cut a hole inches at the base and about inches high [8.9 cm × 6.4 cm] in the center of each of the end boards, and cut two such holes in the bottom of the dividing board, which make the two equal compartments. These last two holes should be equidistant from the sides of the box. Now get a couple of three-foot [91 cm] sticks and an old baseball and you are ready to play. Almost any kind of a stick will do. Saplings cut off underneath the ground so as to get the curve are very good. Also cheap commercial hockey sticks with the blade reinforced with vtirc are excellent.\" \n\nAround 1937, Milton Bradley sold a box hockey game (model No. 4125). By the late 1930s and into the 1940s, it was not uncommon for towns to host youth box hockey tournaments, such as in Reading, Pennsylvania, where the winners of the Essick Playground and Oakbrook were reported by the local newspaper in the July 11, 1939, July 4, 1941 and June 29, 1949 issues of the \"Reading Eagle\".\n\nBy the 1950s, Sears & Roebuck was selling a mass-produced version of box hockey for 50 cents. In the mid-1950s adult box hockey clubs in Eugene, Oregon battled for the title \"Springfield Box Hockey service club champions\". \n\nIn the mid-1950s, Larry Best, Director of Recreation for the Milton Hershey School for Boys in Hershey, PA (the Milton Hershey School was established in 1909 by Milton S. Hershey), in search of an activity that would be healthy, active and fun for the students, became aware of the game BOX HOCKEY and introduced it to the students as part of their summer recreation program. Individual play as well as school tournaments were promoted, and Box Hockey is still an active program at the school with almost 75 student homes (approx. 16 students per home) each having a game set today, manufactured by Box Hockey International, Inc.\n\nWorld Wide Games, Inc. in Delaware, Ohio, manufactured the suitcase-style hockey box in 1965; one is on display at the Elliott Avedon Museum & Archive of Games.\n\nIn the mid-1970s to early 1980s, box hockey had a major resurgence in the United States, as a part of the dramatic increase in funding and staffing in municipal recreation and parks departments across the country to reduce youth crime and violence that was prevalent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, by providing activities to keep teenagers active and social.\n\nIn 1994, Andy Brody founded Box Hockey International and started to market and mass-produce the larger floor version. This variant of the game features multiple walls with staggered \"house holes\" through which the puck must be passed to reach either goal. Today, many children play the larger floor version in summer camps throughout the upper part of North America, such as Triumphant Life Camp in Larabee Valley, California, Wilderness Northwest on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state, and Shady Hollow Campground in Brainerd, Minnesota. Box hockey is also used for agility training in hockey schools and camps throughout Canada and the U.S.\n\nHandmade suitcase-style box hockey games are still available at crafts events like the Lowell Folk Festival in Lowell, Massachusetts. Each year they also have a dozen or so set up for playing during the festivities.\n\n\n\nThe equipment needed to play the game is as follows:\n\nThe equipment needed to play the game is as follows:\n\n"}

The screenplay is based on biographies of writer and critic Lytton Strachey (1880–1932) by Michael Holroyd.\n\nThe film, starring Emma Thompson in the title role, focuses on her unusual relationship with the author Lytton Strachey, played by Jonathan Pryce, as well as with other members of the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nThe film is divided into 6 chapters.\n\n\n\nThe score of the film was composed by Michael Nyman. It was primarily based upon his \"String Quartet No.3\", with which Hampton created a temp track, and wanted as a leitmotif for Lytton Strachey. The score is also based on Schubert's String Quintet in C, D. 956, whose Adagio is played during a scene in the film.

The film was written and directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor and stars Jason Statham reprising his role as Chev Chelios. The story of the film resumes shortly after the first film left off, in the current film, the ex-hit man Chev Chelios finds out he must fight on his life once again as his true heart is transferred and he becomes equipped with an artificial heart, and he reveals he must get injected with electric shocks in order to stay alive and kill those who did it to him. Alongside Statham, the film also stars Dwight Yoakam (reprising his role as Doc Miles), Bai Ling, Amy Smart (reprising her role as Eve), Efren Ramirez, Reno Wilson and Clifton Collins, Jr..\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on April 15, 2009, two days prior to its North American release date; April 17, 2009. Upon its release, \"Crank: High Voltage\" received positive reviews with many praising the acting, action sequences, humor, story and writing.\n\nImmediately after the events of the previous film, Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) lands in the middle of an intersection after falling out of a helicopter. He is scooped off the street via snow shovel by a group of Chinese medics and removed from the scene. Chev wakes up in a makeshift hospital and sees doctors removing his heart while Johnny Vang (Art Hsu) watches. The doctors place Chev's heart in a white cooler with a padlock, and place a clear plastic artificial heart in his chest. He wakes up sometime later and escapes. He notices a yellow battery pack is attached to him. After a gunfight and interrogation of a thug, he learns the location of Johnny Vang: the Cypress Social Club.\n\nChev calls Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), who says that Chev has been fitted with an AbioCor artificial heart. Miles informs Chev that once the external battery pack runs out, the internal battery will kick in and he will have 60 minutes before it stops working. While driving Chev crashes his car which destroys his external battery pack. After getting directions from a driver, Chelios has the driver use his jumper cables on him. At the club, Chev loses Vang but picks up a hooker named Ria (Bai Ling) who sends him to a strip club where Vang is hiding out. In the club, Chev finds Eve (Amy Smart), now a stripper (It is humorously revealed that the phone call Chev made to Eve while falling to his supposed death at the end of \"Crank\" was completely incomprehensible due to the wind rushing by, and the farewell he had left on her answering machine was merely how he imagined it would sound). A group of Mexican mobsters, led by Chico, show up looking for Chelios. After a gunfight, Chev learns that a mobster named \"El Hurón\" (\"The Ferret\") wants to kill him, but he doesn't find out why.\n\nOutside of the strip club, Chev commandeers a police cruiser with Eve and another stripper. The stripper tells Chev that he should look at the Hollywood Racetrack for Johnny Vang. Along the way, Chev meets Venus (Efren Ramirez), who reveals himself to be Kaylo's brother (and unable to completely control his body due to \"full-body Tourettes.\") Wanting his help, he tells Venus that El Huron was involved in his brother's death, but escaped. At the horse track Chev begins losing energy again. Another call to Doc Miles informs him that friction will cause static electricity to power the internal battery. Chev's attempts to generate electricity by rubbing himself against members of the audience prove ineffective, but Eve later arrives and they have sex on the racetrack, which generates enough friction to charge the heart. Chev spots Vang and leaves Eve behind. Vang escapes, and Chev is about to be subdued by security when Don Kim picks Chev up in his limo. He informs Chev that there is an ancient and prominent leader in the Triads named Poon Dong (David Carradine), who was in need of a heart transplant and chose Chev's to replace his. Chev kills Don Kim and his henchmen upon learning that Don Kim wishes to return him to Poon Dong for a reward. Meanwhile, Venus calls in Orlando (Reno Wilson) to assist in tracking down El Huron.\n\nWhile searching for Vang, Chev boards an ambulance and steals a battery pack for his artificial heart. Chev exits the ambulance upon seeing Johnny Vang on the street outside and a shootout ensues before Chev subdues Vang. Chev discovers that Vang's red cooler doesn't contain his heart (it actually contains something that Chelios finds utterly disgusting but is never specified in the film). He then learns via cellphone from Doc Miles that his heart has already been transplanted into Poon Dong (who is shown using it to engage in various acts of revelry and depravity). Johnny Vang is shot and killed by Chico as Chev questions him, after which Chev is knocked unconscious. Doc Miles uses his secretary, Dark Chocolate, to lure Poon Dong into his apartment and retrieve Chev's heart.\n\nChev has a flashback seeing himself as a young boy, being interrogated by his mother (Geri Halliwell) and Luke Cunard (Jamie Harris) on the Luke Cunard show about his violent attitude and his already extensive criminal activities.\n\nChev is taken to an island where El Huron awaits. It is revealed that El Huron is, in fact, the brother of Ricky and Alex Verona, both of whom Chelios killed in the first film. He reveals Ricky Verona's head is being kept alive long enough to watch El Huron kill Chelios. El Huron is about to kill Chelios when Orlando, Venus and Ria show up, each with their own group of gunfighters, and a fierce shootout ensues. Chev kicks Rick Verona's disembodied head in the nearby swimming pool. Venus engages El Huron in a fight before he can kill Chev. As he starts to slow down, Chev climbs a nearby electric pole and grabs a pair of live wires to recharge. He is flung off the pole and set on fire by the massive current. He returns fully powered and on fire, just in nick of time to save Venus, and kills El Huron. Due to a hallucination caused by the electric currents, he sees Ria as Eve and kisses her, inadvertently setting her on fire as well. Chelios walks towards the camera, giving the middle finger to the audience.\n\nDuring the first portion of the end credits, Doc Miles replaces Chev's heart. At first it looks like a failure, but Chelios's eyes open wide and his heart monitor indicates normal activity.\n\n\nCelebrity cameos include Ron Jeremy, Ed Powers, Jenna Haze, Nick Manning, Lexington Steele, Chester Bennington, Glenn Howerton, Maynard James Keenan, Danny Lohner, Keith Jardine, Lauren Holly, and Lloyd Kaufman.\n\nDismissing that a sequel is not possible, Neveldine and Taylor wrote a script for a second film, which was greenlit by Lionsgate. Statham turned down other projects in order to re-appear as the protagonist. Lions Gate Entertainment handled North American distribution of the film, while Lakeshore Entertainment and Sony Pictures handled international distribution.\n\nFilming started in April 2008. In order to help keep costs low, the filmmakers took advantage of low-cost prosumer HDV cameras such as the Canon XH-A1, as well as a consumer model, the Canon HF10.\n\nLinkin Park's song, \"Given Up\", was featured in the trailer for the film. The majority of the soundtrack was done by Mike Patton. The soundtrack received an \"Incredible\" 9.5 out of 10 from IGN.\n\nOriginal songs not scored by Mike Patton that appear in the film are as follows:\n\n\"Crank: High Voltage\" opened in 2,223 theaters in North America and grossed $6,963,565 with an average of $3,133 per theater and ranking #6 at the box office. The film ended up earning $13,684,249 domestically and $20,876,328 internationally for a total of $34,560,577.\n\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews and has a rating of 64% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 69 reviews with an average score of 5.9 out of 10. The consensus states \"\"Crank: High Voltage\" delivers on its promises: a fast-paced, exciting thrill ride that doesn't take itself too seriously.\" The film also has a score of 41 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 reviews indicating 'Mixed or average reviews'. One critic for \"The Guardian\" pointed out the film's \"extreme misogyny and racism\", and noted that although \"nothing should be off limits in comedy\", the film only amounted to \"flashy, arrogant emptiness\".\n\n\"Crank: High Voltage\" was released via DVD and Blu-ray on September 8, 2009 in the United States. At the DVD sales chart, \"Crank\" opened at No. 2, selling 305,000 units which translates to $5,345,078 in revenue. As per the latest figures, 827,000 units have been sold, acquiring revenue of over $15 million. This does not include Blu-ray sales or DVD rentals. In Germany, the uncut DVD and Blu-ray was indexed on March 31, 2010.\n\nIn regards of a third film, actress Smart said \"It's been talked about.\" Smart also noted that \"Crank 3\" might be made in 3-D. During an 'Ask me anything' on Reddit, Brian Taylor gave a possible 2013 release date for \"Crank 3\". In March 2015, Statham gave an update on the sequel, saying that he'd love to do it and he was waiting for Neveldine and Taylor to \"get their heads together.\" Statham stated that Neveldine and Taylor \"have a loose idea. They haven’t written the script.\" In January 2018, Brian Taylor stated it would \"be a while\" until there was a \"Crank 3\" due to profitability concerns and high expectations.\n\n"}

{"id": "75810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75810", "title": "Double entendre", "text": "Double entendre\n\nA double entendre (; ) is a figure of speech or a particular way of wording that is devised to be understood in two ways, having a double meaning. Typically one of the meanings is obvious, given the context, whereas the other may require more thought. The innuendo may convey a message that would be socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly (the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" describes a double entendre as being used to \"convey an indelicate meaning\", whilst \"Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English\" defines it as \"a word or phrase that may be understood in two different ways, one of which is often sexual\").\n\nA double entendre may exploit puns to convey the second meaning. Double entendres generally rely on multiple meanings of words, or different interpretations of the same primary meaning. They often exploit ambiguity and may be used to introduce it deliberately in a text. Sometimes a homophone (i.e., another word which sounds the same) can be used as a pun. When three or more meanings have been constructed, this is known as a \"triple entendre\", etc.\n\nA person who is unfamiliar with the hidden or alternative meaning of a sentence may fail to detect its innuendos, aside from observing that others find it humorous for no apparent reason. Perhaps because it is not offensive to those who do not recognise it, innuendo is often used in sitcoms and other comedy where the audience may enjoy the humour while being oblivious to its secondary meaning.\n\nA triple entendre is a phrase that can be understood in any of three ways, such as in the back cover of the 1981 Rush album \"Moving Pictures\" which shows a moving company carrying paintings out of a building while people are shown being emotionally moved and a film crew makes a \"moving picture\" of the whole scene.\n\nThe expression comes from French \"double\" = \"double\" and \"entendre\" = \"to hear\" (but also \"to understand\"). However, the English formulation is a corruption of the authentic French expression \"à double entente\" (\"double meaning\"). Modern French uses \"double sens\" instead; the phrase \"double entendre\" has no real meaning in the modern French language.\n\nIn Homer's \"The Odyssey\", when Odysseus is captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus, he tells the Cyclops that his name is Oudeis (ουδεις = No-one). When Odysseus attacks the Cyclops later that night and stabs him in the eye, the Cyclops runs out of his cave, yelling to the other cyclopes that \"No-one has hurt me!\", which leads the other cyclopes to take no action under the assumption that Polyphemus blinded himself by accident, allowing Odysseus and his men to escape.\nSome of the earliest double entendres are found in the Exeter Book, or Codex exoniensis, at Exeter Cathedral in England. The book was copied around AD 975. In addition to the various poems and stories found in the book, there are also numerous riddles. The Anglo-Saxons did not reveal the answers to the riddles, but they have been answered by scholars over the years. Some riddles were double-entendres, such as Riddle 25 (\"I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall––I stand up in bed––and whiskery somewhere down below. Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. Her eye will be wet.\") which suggests the answer \"a penis\" but has the correct answer \"an onion\".\n\nExamples of sexual innuendo and double-entendre occur in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" (14th century), in which the Wife of Bath's Tale is laden with double entendres. The most famous of these may be her use of the word \"queynte\" to describe both domestic duties (from the homonym \"quaint\") and genitalia (\"queynte\" being the root of 'cunt', a vulgar English word for vagina). \nThe title of Sir Thomas More's 1516 fictional work \"Utopia\" is a double entendre because of the pun between two Greek-derived words that would have identical pronunciation: with his spelling, it means \"no place\" (as echoed later in Samuel Butler's later Erewhon); spelled as the rare word Eutopia, it is pronounced the same by English-speaking readers, but has the meaning \"good place\".\n\nSometimes, it is unclear whether a double entendre was intended. For example, the character Charley Bates from Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\" is frequently referred to as Master Bates. The word \"masturbate\" was in use when the book was written, and Dickens often used colourful names related to the natures of the characters.\n\nThe title of Damon Knight's story \"To Serve Man\" is a double entendre which could mean \"to perform a service to humanity\" or \"to serve a human as food\". An alien cookbook with the title \"To Serve Man\" is featured in the story which could imply that the aliens eat humans. The story was the basis for an episode of \"The Twilight Zone\". At the end of the episode the line \"It's a cookbook!\" reveals the truth.\n\nShakespeare frequently used double entendres in his plays. Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\" says of Sir Andrew's hair, that \"it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off\"; the Nurse in \"Romeo and Juliet\" says that her husband had told Juliet when she was learning to walk that \"Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit\"; or is told the time by Mercutio: \"for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon\"; and in \"Hamlet\", Hamlet publicly torments Ophelia with a series of sexual puns, including \"country matters\" (similar to \"cunt\"). The title of Shakespeare's play \"Much Ado About Nothing\" is a pun on the Elizabethan use of \"no-thing\" as slang for vagina.\n\nIn the UK, starting in the 19th century, Victorian morality disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience. In music hall songs, on the other hand, this kind of innuendo remained very popular. Marie Lloyd's song \"She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas\" is an example of this. (Music hall in this context is to be compared with Variety, the one common, low-class and vulgar; the other demi-monde, worldly and sometimes chic.) In the 20th century there began to a crackdown on lewdness, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the Lord Chamberlain to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. Max Miller, famously, had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow, the white book was rarely used (in the UK, 'blue' colloquially refers to sexual content, as in 'blue jokes', 'blue movies' etc.).\n\nIn the United States, innuendo and double entendre were only lightly used in radio media until the 1980s when the Howard Stern Show began to push the envelope of what was acceptable on the radio through use of double entendre and ironies. This garnered so much attention it spawned an entire genre of Radio called \"Shock Jock Radio\" where DJs will push the limits of what is an \"acceptable\" double entendre to use on over the air as the FCC has been known to hand out large fines for the use of double entendre on radio if they deem it to be in violation of their standards.\n\nIn Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to radio and cinema from the late 1950s on. Particularly significant in this respect were the \"Carry On\" series of films and the BBC radio series \"Round the Horne\", although some of \"Round the Horne\" appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having 'rude' conversations in Polari (gay slang). \"Round the Horne\" depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show's name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor Kenneth Horne and those around him, the sailor's expression 'going round the horn' (i.e. Cape Horn), and the fact that 'horn' is slang for an erection. Spike Milligan, writer of \"The Goon Show\", remarked that a lot of 'blue' (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen's jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were \"Officer class\".\n\nIn 1968, the office of the Lord Chamberlain ceased to have responsibility for censoring live entertainment, after the Theatres Act 1968. By the 1970s innuendo had become widely used across much of the British broadcast media, including sitcoms and radio comedy, such as \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\". For example, in the 1970s TV comedy series \"Are You Being Served?\", Mrs. Slocombe frequently referred to her pet cat as her \"pussy\", apparently unaware of how easily her statement could be misinterpreted, such as \"It's a wonder I'm here at all, you know. My pussy got soakin' wet. I had to dry it out in front of the fire before I left\". Someone unfamiliar with sexual slang might find this statement funny simply because of the references to her sodden cat, whereas others would find further humour in the innuendo (\"pussy\" being sexual slang for vulva).\n\nModern comedies, such as the US version of \"The Office\", often do not hide the addition of sexual innuendos into the script; for example, main character Michael Scott often deploys the phrase \"that's what she said\" after another character's innocent statement, to turn it retroactively into a sexual pun.\n\nOn The Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with double meanings in a humorous context, a feature known as \"Innuendo Bingo\". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.\n\nDouble entendres are popular in modern movies, as a way to conceal adult humour in a work aimed at general audiences. The James Bond films are rife with such humour. For example, in \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997), when Bond is disturbed by the telephone while in bed with a Danish girl, he explains to Moneypenny that he is busy \"brushing up on a little Danish\". Moneypenny responds by pointing out that Bond was known as \"a cunning linguist\", a play on the word \"cunnilingus\". In the final scene of \"Moonraker\", while Bond is taking Dr Holly Goodhead “round the world one more time”, Q says to Sir Frederick Gray, “I think he’s attempting re-entry, sir.” In \"The World Is Not Enough\" (1999), while in bed with Dr Christmas Jones, Bond tells her “I thought Christmas only comes once a year”. Other obvious examples include Pussy Galore in \"Goldfinger\" and Holly Goodhead in \"Moonraker\". The double entendres of the Bond films were parodied in the \"Austin Powers\" series.\n\nBawdy double entendres, such as \"I'm the kinda girl who works for Paramount by day, and Fox all night\", and (from the movie \"Myra Breckinridge\") \"I feel like a million tonight — but only one at a time\", are typical of the comedy writing of Mae West, for her early-career vaudeville performances as well as for her later plays and movies.\n\nDouble entendres are very common in the titles and lyrics of pop songs, such as \"If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me\" by The Bellamy Brothers, which is based on an old Groucho Marx quote. By one interpretation, the person being talked to is asked if they would be offended; by the other interpretation, they are asked if they would press their body against the person doing the talking.\n\nSinger and songwriter Bob Dylan, in his somewhat controversial song \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\", repeats the line \"Everybody must get stoned\". In context, the phrase refers to the punishment of execution by stoning, but on another level it means to 'get stoned', a common slang term for being high on cannabis. In their song \"Big Balls\" on the album \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\", AC/DC the chorus \"we've got big balls\" can be read as referring to either formal dances or testicles. During the 1940s, Benny Bell recorded several \"party records\" that contained double entendre including \"Everybody Wants My Fanny\".\n\nDouble entendres can arise in the replies to inquiries. The clichéd phrase \"that's what she said\", as well as \"so to speak\" can be used to remark on a sentence said by another which was not intended as a double entendre but nevertheless could be interpreted with a double meaning, one of them sexual. In recent times, due to prevalence of memes, the sentence \"If you know what I mean\" has taken a similar meaning.\n"}

The subject of his doctoral thesis was 'Efficiency of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy on pigs in the hyperdynamic phase of endotoxemia' and he graduated \"magna cum laude\" from the University of Heidelberg. From 1996-1997 he studied scientific journalism at the Free University of Berlin, but without taking a degree.\n\nIn 1996 he started writing, mainly for \"Focus\" and \"Der Tagesspiegel\". His first appearance on television is believed to have been as a guest contestant performing magic tricks in Jürgen von der Lippe's show \"Geld oder Liebe\" ('Money or Love'). From 1998 to 2003, he hosted the weekly health advisory show \"Service: Gesundheit\" ('Service: Health') on Hessischer Rundfunk Television. Since 2004 he has been a weekly contributor to \"Stern: Sprechstunde\" (\"'Stern\": Consultation Hour'): his column is called \"Die Etwas Andere Medizinkolumne\" ('The Somewhat Different Medicine Column'). \n\nStarting in the mid-1990s, Eckart von Hirschhausen has performed as a stand-up comedian, show host and magician in variety. He is also a cabaret artist performing his own, and other, cabaret programmes. He was a guest artist in Berlin, in London and at the Cologne Comedy Festival 1997. Hirschhausen was also a member of the panels of contributors to the \"Knoff-Hoff-Show\" on ZDF and \"7 Tage, 7 Köpfe\" ('7 days, 7 heads') on RTL. Since 21 January 2004, he has been answering viewers' questions in his column 'Dr. von Hirschhausen wills wissen' ('Dr. von Hirschhausen wants to know') in the scientific television show \"W wie Wissen\" ('K for Knowledge') on ARD. In \"Hirschhausens Wissensbisse\" ('Hirschhausen's knowledge-bites') he also presents strange news and facts from the world of scientific research. Hirschhausen is a regular on the cabaret show \"Ottis Schlachthof\" ('Otti's Slaughterhouse') on Bayerisches Fernsehen and \"Quatsch Comedy Club\" on Pro Sieben. In 2007 he was a frequent guest on the ARD show 'Schmidt and Pocher'. He is also a speaker specialising in communication and motivational training. At the end of 2008, he founded a charity foundation 'Humor hilft heilen - für mehr gesundes Lachen im Krankenhaus' ('Humour helps the healing process - for more healthy laughing in hospitals'). Since September 2009 he has co-hosted the successor show of 'Die Tietjen und Dibaba' on NDR with Bettina Tietjen. \n\nEckard von Hirschhausen has developed a cabaret routine similar to that of Ludger Stratmann, also a PhD physician and cabaret artist. They both focus on the doctor-patient relationship, while von Hirschhausen specifically points out the inability and unwillingness of professionals in his field to express themselves clearly. He also focuses on the typical routines and rituals which, when separated from the professional environment, appear comical and absurd.\n\nHis program \"Filetspitzen\" was awarded the 'Garchinger Kleinkunstpreis' ('Garching Award for minor arts') in 2001. Hirschhausen also won the 'Garchinger Maske' in 2000, the 'Paulaner-Solo Kabarettpreis' in 2003, the 'Jurypreis des Berliner Kleinkunstfestivals' ('Jury's Prize of the Berlin Festival of Minor Arts') and the 'RTL Comedy Cup'. On 14 September 2004, he was awarded the 'St. Ingberter Pfanne', one of the most important German awards for minor arts. Hirschhausen is the current German champion of magic tricks. He was also awarded the 2011 Münchhausen Prize at Bodenwerder.\n\nHirschhausen was a supporter of the 'Pro Reli-Kampagne', a campaign to preserve religious education in Berlin's public schools. Berlin's voters, however, decided in a referendum in April 2009 not to keep religious education in their schools. The comedian and physician Hirschhausen was awarded the title 'Krawattenmann des Jahres 2009' ('Tie-man of the year 2009') on 3 December 2009. He received this honor from the 'Deutsche Mode Institut (DMI/Köln)' ('German Institute for Fashion, Cologne') in Krefeld.\n\nIn 2012 he was rewarded with the IQ Award.\n\nEckard von Hirschhausen has been living in Berlin since he was born.

{"id": "1164305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1164305", "title": "Exhibition drill", "text": "Exhibition drill\n\nExhibition drill is a variant of drill that involves complex marching sequences which usually deviate from drill used in the course of ordinary parades. Teams performing exhibition drill are often affiliated with military units, but the scope of exhibition drill is not limited to military drill teams. Exhibition drill is often performed by Armed Forces Drill Teams, the drill teams at service academies and ROTC and JROTC units, and civilian drill teams that perform at parades, drill meets, and half-time shows and other public venues.\n\nThe first documented performance of exhibition drill was performed by Hadji Cheriff and filmed at what is believed to be the Midway Plaisance of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. The film was later copyrighted by Thomas Edison in 1899, entitled \"The Arabian Gun Twirler\".\n\nThe performance demonstrates aerial (two ) and over-the-shoulder techniques, and \n\nIt is believed that the weapon was a .577 caliber, triple band 1853 Enfield Musket, which is 56\" long and weighs about 9.5 pounds and thus is 13\" longer and heavier than most drill weapons used today.\n\nExhibition drill is one of many different drill phases that are a part of a drill meet. Other phases include Inspection, Color Guard and Regulation Drill.\n\nExhibition military drill has grown drastically in popularity in recent decades. This growth can be attributed to several primary factors. These include:\n\n\nGeneral rules and guidelines\n\nRules of exhibition drill during competitions vary, but most of them apply the following guidelines:\n\nTime – There is usually a minimum and maximum time a routine may take. Points are deducted if a team is under or over time.\n\nBoundaries – Teams should be aware of their boundary lines, and if necessary, alter their routines as to not cross the boundary lines. Points are deducted if a person crosses a boundary line.\n\nSome high-school level competitions prevent cadets who are participating in armed drill events from performing more dangerous 'over the head' spins, or raising cadets off the floor, in the interest of safety.\n\nSome high school drill teams compete at the National High School Drill Team Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida, and generally use demilitarized Springfield M1903s, M1 Garands, M-14 rifles and Daisy Drill Rifles. Certain teams at the NHSDTC who receive high placings end up being well known on a national level. There are also national levels for JROTC divisions nationwide. There is the Navy JROTC, Army JROTC, Marine Corps JROTC, Air Force JROTC, and much more that all have their own prospective drill nationals. For the past two years, 2017 and 2018, at Navy Nationals, the first place armed exhibition team was Green Run High School, and the runner up being Troy High School in Fullerton, California. Other countries have their own drill team competitions for teenagers.\n\nIn an unarmed division, exhibition drill may consist of intricate precision marching, along with various hand movements. Modified step team routines are used in some competitions.\n\nColleges with Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) units, as well as military academies, have drill teams normally train and compete in two types of drill events: Regulation/Close Order and Exhibition (Trick or Fancy) Drill. Regulation Drill is conducted in accordance with Field Manual 22-5 (now FM 3-21.5) Drill and Ceremonies. Exhibition Drill is more free form and often more elaborate then Regulation Drill. Exhibition Drill teams are also more colorful in uniform and weaponry. In both types of event, participants are typically armed with weapons made safe or inert by removal of firing pins. Armament is totally devoid of all firing mechanisms for the safety of participants and audience alike.\n\nPershing Rifles, founded in 1894, is the oldest continuously operating college organization dedicated to military drill. The original drill team created by John J. Pershing had a simple goal: to serve as an example for the cadets at the University of Nebraska, who were sorely lacking in esprit de corps, motivation, and basic military skills. For its first few years, the group (then called \"Company A\") did just that: its members became experts at unarmed, armed, and exhibition drill, and were soon the pride of the university. By 1894, cadets and alumni formed Varsity Rifles. By June 1895, when Pershing announced his departure from the university, the group had morphed from a simple drill team into a fraternal organization; in his honor, they renamed the group the Pershing Rifles.\n\nAs the unit grew, their reputation followed: by the early 1900s, membership was considered a high military honor. Other schools soon applied for affiliation with the Pershing Rifles. By the middle of the 20th century, this now national organization comprised nearly 200 units representing all of the services stationed at ROTC detachments around the country. Through their phenomenal growth, however, the Pershing Rifles were careful to stay true to their basic purpose: to develop the traits of leadership and discipline among their members through drill competition.\n\nThe success of Pershing Rifles' leadership development program would not have been possible without the organization's focus on close-order and exhibition rifle drill. Excellence in drill, whether armed or unarmed, is a function of discipline and dedication; these traits are put to work on a regular basis by Pershing Rifles units. A typical unit performs as a color guard, exhibition drill team, honor guard, funeral detail, or any other ceremonial unit requested; these services are usually at the request of the local ROTC detachment or school, but are sometimes requested by alumni, local governments, or active duty military units. Through all of these activities, in addition to the skills gained by the performers, positive publicity is also received by the unit's host school, host ROTC detachment, and ultimately the military in general. Pershing Rifles hosts a National Drill Competition each spring which attracts some of the finest college level drill teams in the nation. \n\nTriphibian Guard was founded in 1959 as an Army ROTC Drill Team of Seton Hall University as a chartered and approved student organization. Cadets from the existing Pershing Rifles Company K-8 formed the Triphibian Guard. The name was chosen because it represented land, sea and air forces. Once established, the Triphibian Guard quickly grew in stature and respect at the university, becoming the official honor guard of the university president. Officer candidate student members wore a distinctive triangular patch and fourragere (gold and black cord) on the left shoulder of their uniform. This was the United States Army's colors, and depicted an African male lion with a gold crown on the forehead. Upon graduation, student officer graduates are eligible for the award of Distinguished Military Graduate (DMG), one of the awards and decorations of the United States military, and may become a commissioned officer of the United States Armed Forces. The unit disbanded in the late 1970s due to lack of student interest at the end of the hostilities of the Vietnam War.\n\nGator Guard Drill Team (GGDT) is a precision drill team and military fraternity based at the University of Florida. It is named after the Florida Gators, the mascot of the University of Florida. Founded in 1953, the Gator Guard absorbed and succeeded the University of Florida's Army ROTC chapter of the Pershing Rifles upon its inception. The Gator Guard performs annually at the university's Homecoming Parade, as well as the Krewe of Mid-City and King Rex parades at the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The team uses M1903 rifles with 8-inch bayonets for all performances. The Gator Guard also performs color guard ceremonies for the University of Florida, the SEC, and the MLB. \n\nBilly Mitchell Drill Team (BMDT), founded in 1951 as an Air Force ROTC Drill Team, is a drill, ceremony and color guard team at the University of Florida. It is open to all students of the university, but wears the United States Air Force uniform. With a history spanning six decades, BMDT's rich heritage and dedication to discipline and excellence help to produce officers for the nation's Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps.\n\nKing's Village Guard of Hawaii is more commonly known as the King's Guard. They were founded in the 1960s and perform weekly shows in Hawaii. They have also performed several times at the National High School Drill Team Championships in Daytona, Florida. They use a modified Springfield M1903 rifle.\n\nNew Guard America was founded in 1997 by Constantine H. Wilson. This is the world's only internationally touring civilian drill team. They use Springfield M1903 rifles with fixed bayonets. They are based out of the Washington, DC metropolitan area. They perform mainly in four man-blocks. In June 2008 they performed at the Norwegian Military Tattoo in Oslo, Norway, making them the first civilian drill team to perform at an international tattoo.\n\nHawaii Royal Honor Guard, formerly the Hilton Hawaiian Village Guards, was established in 1989 by Commander Adam Marumoto and is currently under the direction of Executive Officer Christopher Koanui. It was originally intended to perform for the Hilton Hawaiian Villages events and shows on the property, as well as elsewhere. As of 2009 the Hilton Hawaiian Village Guards adopted their new title as the Hawaii Royal Honor Guard, and now perform at private events for various clients. The HRHG'S members have numerous championship titles which range from the national championships and the Isis world championships beginning in 1989. The HRHG currently perform private shows at the Historic Royal Hawaiian Hotel. They contribute to Hawaii's tradition of training youth and young adults in the art of one of Hawaii's unique styles of exhibition drill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sony Pictures Entertainment, a division of the Japanese conglomerate Sony, is its majority owner. Based in Flower Mound, Texas, the studio is one of the leading distributors of anime and other foreign entertainment properties in North America alongside Viz Media, Sentai Filmworks, Aniplex of America, and more. Their most popular property is Toei Animation's action-adventure franchise \"Dragon Ball\", which - through its sequel \"Dragon Ball Z\" - had a successful run on Cartoon Network's Toonami block from 1998 to 2003, and has been re-released on DVD and Blu-ray several times since.\n\nThe company was founded on May 9, 1994 by Gen Fukunaga and his wife Cindy as FUNimation Productions, with funding by Daniel Cocanougher and his family, who became investors in the company. Funimation was sold to Navarre Corporation on May 11, 2005 and the company was renamed FUNimation Entertainment.\n\nIn April 2011, Navarre sold Funimation to a group of investors including Fukunaga (and John A. Kuelbs) for $24 million. Around the same time, the company's trademark ball, star and blue bar were dropped from its logo and the company was renamed to simply Funimation. In May 2013, Funimation consolidated its divisions under its new holding company Group 1200 Media. Kuelbs became Chairman of Funimation/Group 1200 after the acquisition from Navarre. Kuelbs and Fukunaga continued to make additional investments into Funimation. A new senior management was brought on and a multi-year distribution deal was announced with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. In January 2016 FunimationNow, a new ad free HD anime streaming service with Sony subscription, was announced at the CES show in Las Vegas. On July 31, 2017, Sony Pictures Television announced plans to acquire a 95% stake in Funimation for $143 million while Gen Fukunaga would retain his position with a 5% share. The deal was closed on October 27, 2017.\n\nFunimation is a portmanteau of the English words \"fun\" and \"animation\". From 2016 to 2018, Funimation had a partnership agreement with Crunchyroll.\n\nThe company was founded on June 14, 1994 by Japanese-born businessman Gen Fukunaga. Fukunaga's uncle, Nagafumi Hori, was working as a producer for Toei Company; Hori approached Gen about licensing \"Dragon Ball\" to the United States. He proposed that if Fukunaga could start a production company and raise enough money, Toei Animation would license the rights to the franchise. Fukunaga met with co-worker Daniel Cocanougher whose family owned a feed mill in Decatur, Texas and convinced Cocanougher's family to sell their business and serve as an investor for his company. The company was originally formed in Silicon Valley, California as Funimation Productions in 1994, but eventually relocated to Flower Mound, Texas, located near Fort Worth. They initially collaborated with other companies on \"Dragon Ball\", such as BLT Productions, Ocean Studios, Pioneer and Saban Entertainment. By 1998, after two aborted attempts to bring the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise to a U.S. audience via first-run syndication, it finally found success on Cartoon Network's action-oriented programming block Toonami, and the \"Dragon Ball\" phenomenon quickly grew in the United States as it had elsewhere. This led Funimation to begin licensing other anime to the U.S.\n\nStarting in September 2003, Funimation, along with British company Maverick, has distributed titles from Canada-based Nelvana, including \"Redwall\", \"Pecola\", \"Tales from the Cryptkeeper\", \"Timothy Goes to School\" and the Disney Channel TV special \"The Santa Claus Brothers\".\n\nOn May 11, 2005, Funimation was acquired by the now-defunct Navarre Corporation for US$100.4 million in cash and 1.8 million shares of Navarre stock. As part of the acquisition, the president Fukunaga was retained as head of the company, transitioning to the position of CEO, and the company's name was changed from Funimation Productions to Funimation Entertainment.\n\nIn 2007, Funimation moved from North Richland Hills, Texas to Flower Mound; the standalone Flower Mound facility has double the square footage of the space Funimation occupied previous North Richland Hills facility; in the North Richland Hills facility Funimation shared the building with other tenants. Funimation moved into the Lakeside Business District with a ten-year lease.\n\nAccording to an interview in February 2008 with Navarre Corporation CEO Cary Deacon, Funimation was in early stage negotiations to acquire some of the titles licensed through Geneon's USA division, which ceased operations in December 2007. In July 2008, Funimation confirmed that they had acquired distribution rights to several Geneon titles, including some that Geneon had left unfinished when they ceased operations.\n\nAt Anime Expo 2008, Funimation announced that it had acquired over 30 titles from the Sojitz catalog that had previously been licensed by ADV Films.\n\nIn 2009, Funimation signed a deal with Toei Animation to stream several of its anime titles online through the Funimation website and Hulu.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2010, Navarre Corporation reclassified Funimation as \"discounted operations\" and began preparations to sell the company. Navarre released a statement in April 2011 confirming that Funimation has been sold to a group of investors, including original owner Gen Fukunaga, for $24 million. It is speculated that Funimation was sold at such a low cost (in comparison to how much it was originally purchased for, almost $100 million in cash and $15 million in stock in 2005) because Navarre wanted to continue distributing goods in relation to the products, but not handle the publishing. Navarre remained as exclusive distributor of Funimation's titles until 2013 when the company shutdown.\n\nOn October 14, 2011, Funimation announced a permanent partnership with Niconico, the English-language version of \"Nico Nico Douga\", to form the 'Funico' brand for the licensing of anime for streaming and home video release. From this point on, virtually all titles simulcasted by Niconico were acquired by Funimation. The deal has since been severed.\nOn June 22, 2015, Funimation and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment announced a multi-year home video distribution deal. The deal will allow UPHE to manage distribution and sales of Funimation's catalog of titles. Universal began distributing Funimation's titles in October of that year.\n\nIn January 2016, Funimation announced a new streaming service, FunimationNow, along with a new logo. The service also is available in the UK and Ireland, the first time the company has expanded beyond North America.\n\nOn September 8, 2016, Funimation announced a partnership with Crunchyroll. Select Funimation titles will be streamed subtitled on Crunchyroll and select Crunchyroll titles will be streamed on FunimationNow, including upcoming dubbed content. In addition, Funimation and Universal will act as distributors for Crunchyroll's home video catalog.\n\nOn May 18, 2017, Shout! Factory acquired the North American distribution rights to \"In This Corner of the World\", with a U.S. theatrical release to take place in August 11, 2017, co-released by Funimation Films.\n\nIn May 2017, it was reported that Universal Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment were interested in purchasing Funimation; however, Universal decided not to proceed with the bidding. On July 31, 2017, Sony Pictures Television announced that it would buy a controlling 95% stake in Funimation for $143 million, a deal that was approved by the United States Department of Justice on August 22, 2017. This deal allows Funimation to have synergies with Sony's Animax and Kids Station divisions and \"direct access to the creative pipeline\". The deal was closed on October 27, 2017.\n\nOn February 16, 2018, it was reported that Shout! Factory's Shout! Studios division acquired the U.S/Canadian distribution rights to \"Big Fish & Begonia\" and partnered with Funimation Films again for distribution.\n\nOn July 12, 2018, it was announced that Funimation Films had picked up licensing rights for \"\" in North America and that its English dub would premiere in theaters sometime in January 2019 in the United States and Canada, only around a month after its national premiere in Japan.\n\nIn August 2018, WarnerMedia fully acquired Otter Media, owner of Crunchyroll. On October 18, 2018, Funimation and Sony Pictures announced that their partnership with Crunchyroll will end on November 9, 2018. Despite the home video releases being unaffected and still going on as planned, select Funimation content will be removed from Crunchyroll, and subtitled content will return to FunimationNow. Also, Funimation will be removed from Otter Media-owned streaming service VRV entirely, being replaced by Hidive.\n\nIn 2005, Funimation's legal department began to pursue a more aggressive approach toward protecting the company's licensed properties. Then started sending \"cease and desist\" (C&D) letters to sites offering links to fansubs of their titles. This move was similar to that taken by the now-defunct ADV Films several years before with several of the major torrent sites.\n\nFunimation's legal department served C&D letters for series that had not yet been advertised or announced as licensed, including \"\", \"Black Cat\", and \"SoltyRei\", with a few known series also mentioned in the letter. Funimation revealed more licenses on October 6, 2006 when it sent letters to torrent sites demanding that distribution of \"xxxHolic\"'s TV series, \"Mushishi\", \"Ragnarok the Animation\", and other series cease.\n\nSince October 2009, Funimation has routinely filed DMCA takedown notices to get unauthorized distributions of its and its partners' properties removed from Google search results.\n\nIn January 2011, Funimation filed a lawsuit against BitTorrent users in the U.S. for allegedly downloading and uploading \"One Piece\". Funimation dropped the suit in March after a Northern Texas judge, having already indicated that the court would appoint attorneys for the defendants, ruled that the defendants were not \"acting in concert\" and thus couldn't be sued as a group; each would have to be sued separately.\n\nThe \"One Piece\" film at issue was a fansub, an unauthorized copy distributed with fan-produced, translated subtitles. Soon after the lawsuit was abandoned, Funimation was reported to have long been deriving dubs from fansubs. Funimation nevertheless maintains that fansubbing is harmful to the anime industry, stating \"The practices of illegal downloads and 'fansubbing' are very harmful to our Japanese partners and [...] we have been asked to monitor and take action against unauthorized distribution of these titles. Because we believe that this will benefit the industry, we have agreed to do so.\" Sites which distribute fansubs or separate fan-created subtitles remain a frequent target of civil actions by Funimation and other anime companies, as well as criminal prosecution in at least one case.\n\nTwo months after the failure to sue BitTorrent users in the North Texas district, Funimation engaged in forum shopping and proceeded to sue 1,427 defendants in the neighboring East Texas district for acting \"in concert\" to infringe copyright on \"\". This case was allowed to proceed.\n\nIn November 2011, Funimation sued A.D. Vision, AEsir Holdings, Section23 Films, Valkyrie Media Partners, Seraphim Studios, Sentai Filmworks and its CEO, John Ledford and Switchblade Pictures for a sum of $8 million, citing \"breach of contracts\" and other issues. Funimation said that ADV's transfer of assets were made with \"the intent to defer, hinder or defraud the creditors of ADV [Films].\" Funimation sought ADV's sale of assets as void. The lawsuit was settled in mediation in 2014. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nFunimation does not directly release its properties in non-North American (English language-speaking) markets, instead sublicensing to other companies such as Manga Entertainment until it was transferred in 2015 to Anime Limited in the United Kingdom and Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand, Melanesia Region (PNG, Solomon Islands, Fiji). Funimation's former UK outlets include Revelation Films and MVM Films. Funimation has also attempted to distribute \"Dragon Ball Z\" to Spanish speaking audiences, and has released a number of Spanish-language DVDs of the series.\n\nFunimation Entertainment, along with Olympusat, launched the Funimation Channel in September 2005, the second 24-hour anime digital cable network in North America (the first being A.D. Vision's Anime Network). Olympusat was the exclusive distributor of the channel.\n\nWhen the channel first launched, it was available to a few cities via UHF digital signals. The service was temporary as the channel was trying to gain a foothold in the already crowded digital cable landscape. Another short-term service was the syndication of a Funimation Channel block to one of OlympuSAT's affiliate networks – Colours TV. Both services were discontinued in favor for a more successful expansion on digital cable, fiber optics and DBS systems. The channel launched its HD feed on September 27, 2010. On December 31, 2015, Funimation & Olympusat ended their deal and no longer broadcasts Funimation titles on the channel. The channel relaunched as Toku, while Funimation announced plans to relaunch Funimation Channel in 2016.\n\nBack in 2007, Funimation Entertainment licensed \"Revolutionary Girl Utena: The Movie\", the \"Record of Lodoss War\" series, \"Roujin Z\", the \"Project A-ko\" series, \"\" and \"Grave of the Fireflies\" from Central Park Media and played them on the Funimation Channel on television in the United States. In 2009, they licensed \"Buso Renkin\", \"Honey and Clover\", \"Hunter × Hunter\", \"Nana\" and \"Monster\" from Viz Media (their fellow rival) for the channel. They also licensed \"Ninja Nonsense\" and \"Boogiepop Phantom\" from Right Stuf Inc.'s Nozomi Entertainment division for it as well. The only title licensed for Funimation Channel which was not licensed by Funimation, neither Viz Media, nor Nozomi Entertainment or Central Park Media was \"Haré+Guu\", which was licensed for North American distribution by AN Entertainment and Bang Zoom! Entertainment and had its North American DVD release published by Funimation, while its licensors were the producers. The only Enoki USA titles Funimation licensed for Funimation Channel were \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" and \"His and Her Circumstances\".\n\nIn July 2008, Funimation and Red Planet Media announced the launch of a mobile video-on-demand service for AT&T Mobility and Sprint mobile phone subscribers. Three titles were part of the launch, \"Gunslinger Girl\", \"\", and \"The Galaxy Railways\", with entire seasons of each made available.\n\nOn September 19, 2006, Funimation created an official channel on YouTube where they upload advertisements for box sets, as well as clips and preview episodes of their licensed series. In September 2008, they began distributing full episodes of series on Hulu. In December of the same year, Funimation added a video section to their main website with preview episodes of various series. In April 2009, they began distributing full episodes of series at Veoh. Full episodes are also available on the YouTube channel as well as on Netflix, the PlayStation Network (PSN) Video Store and Xbox Live/Zune Marketplace. The application launched for PlayStation 4 in March 2015.\n\nFor the anime \"Space Dandy\", Funimation dubbed episodes and broadcast them on Adult Swim's Toonami block a day earlier than the \"original\" Japanese broadcast. After the method gained success, Funimation announced in October 2014 a \"broadcast dubs\" program, which would be exclusive to subscribers on their website. For the anime series, getting \"broadcast dubs\" confirms that the anime series will get USA home video releases from Funimation. These dubs are based on the broadcast versions of select licensed shows currently airing, which may include censorship depending on how it was originally aired, and differs from the final dubbed version included on home video releases on a case-by-case basis. The program first began with broadcast dub versions of \"Psycho-Pass 2\" and \"Laughing Under the Clouds\", episodes of which were streamed roughly a month following their original Japanese broadcast.\n\n"}

The family comprises the descendants of three brothers - Ashok Kumar Ganguly, Anoop Kumar Ganguly and Kishore Kumar Ganguly - and their sister Sati Rani Mukherkjee.\nMamta ki chhaon mein (1990)\nThe history of the Ganguly family begins with Kunjalal Ganguly, an advocate by profession coming from a long line of lawyers, and his wife Gouri Rani Devi, the grand-daughter of Raja Shibchandra Banerjee and sister of classical singer Dhananjay Banerjee. The celebrated brothers and their sister, who gave birth to the Mukherjee's of Bollywood, were born to these two. Supposedly, Kishore Kumar inherited his sense of comedy from Kunjalal. Also, the most popular film featuring all three Ganguly brothers – \"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi\" – was, supposedly, inspired by Kunjalal's Chrysler that he bought in 1928, a year before the birth of his youngest son.\n\nIf Rattan Bai from their extended family network is ignored, Ashok Kumar was the first person in the family to go into the film industry. His daughter Preeti Ganguly, son-in-law Deven Verma (married to his elder daughter Rupa Ganguly) and granddaughter Anuradha Patel also became accomplished actors. Ashok Kumar's son Arun Ganguly never joined the film industry.\nKishore Kumar was married to Ruma Guha Thakurta (1950–58), Madhubala (1960–69), Yogeeta Bali (1975–78) and Leena Chandavarkar (1980–87).\n\nRuma (now, Ruma Guha Thakurta) was the daughter of Satyen Ghosh (better known as Montey Ghosh) and a niece to Smt. Bijoya Roy, the wife of the legendary film director Satyajit Ray (son of writer Sukumar Ray and grandson of writer and publisher Upendrakishore Raychowdhury). Her mother Sati Devi, a talented singer, was the elder sister of Bijoya, the legendary director's wife. Amit Kumar, her son with Kishore Kumar eventually became a celebrity in his own right. Amit later sang duets with Krishna Mukherjee, a niece to his paternal aunt Satirani.\n\nYogeeta was a niece to Geeta Bali, who in turn was Shammi Kapoor's first wife. Kishore's second son Sumit Kumar was born to Leena and is also a singer. Ruma later married Arup Guha Thakurta and had a son, Ayan, and a daughter, Sromana, with him. Shammi Kapoor, a scion of the Kapoor family and Geeta Bali's daughter Kanchan Desai got married to Ketan Desai, son of director Manmohan Desai, who was engaged to actress Nanda (actor-director Master Vinayak's daughter) before his death.\n\nYogeeta eventually divorced Kishore Kumar and married Mithun Chakravorty, who married Sridevi for a brief stint. Sridevi later married producer Surinder Kapoor's son Boney Kapoor, a producer who has two famous actors for brothers – Anil Kapoor and Sanjay Kapoor. Surinder, on the other hand, began his career as Geeta Bali's secretary. His only daughter, Reena, is married to showbiz tycoon Sandeep Marwah. Satyajit and Bijoya's son Sandip Ray is an accomplished film director.\nThe only sister of the famous Ganguly brothers, Sati Devi, was married to Sashadhar Mukherjee (brother of Ravindramohan Mukherjee, Subodh Mukherjee and Prabodh Mukherjee) of the Mukherjee-Samarth family. She gave birth to director & composer Rono Mukherjee (father of actress Sharbani Mukherjee), actors Joy Mukherjee (father of actor Boy Mukherjee) & Deb Mukherjee (father of director Ayan Mukerji), directors & producers Shomu Mukherjee (husband of actress Tanuja and father of actresses Kajol and Tanishaa Mukerji) & Shubhir Mukherjee, and Shibani Mukherjee. Kajol, in turn, is married to actor Ajay Devgan, the son of fight choreographer Veeru Devgan.\n\nActresses Rani Mukherjee (granddaughter of Ravindramohan Mukherjee & daughter of director Ram Mukherjee and singer Krishna Mukherjee), and actor Mohnish Behl come from the extended Mukherjee-Samarth family. The film involvement of the clan began with actress Rattan Bai, mother of actress Shobhna Samarth, aunt to actress Nalini Jaywant and grandmother of actresses Tanuja and Nutan. Reportedly, music director Bappi Lahiri is also in the Mukherjee's extended family tree. Actress Chhaya Devi was first cousin of actor Ashok Kumar's wife Shobha Ganguly, thus related to the Ganguly family.\n\n"}
{"id": "20876702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20876702", "title": "Horror films of Cambodia", "text": "Horror films of Cambodia\n\nHorror films in Cambodia, first popular in the 1970s, have received renewed attention in Cambodian film making since the resurgence of the local industry in 2003. Horror is one of three popular genres into which most Cambodian films can be loosely grouped, the other two being period pieces and melodrama/romantic drama. The fledgling Cambodian industry of the mid 2000s looked to capitalize on the world-wide popularity of Japanese horror films which have heavily influenced Cambodian horror films. Common themes are ghost or spirit hauntings, possession, folk mythology and revenge by supernatural means. The storytelling takes a slower pace than Western horror and relies on suspense, a pervasive sense of doom and dread, and psychologically disturbing events and situations. Unlike its Japanese counterparts however, many Cambodian horror films also feature over the top gore as seen in Western horror.\n\nOne of the earliest successful Cambodian Horror movies was the 1970s film The Snake King's Wife by Tia Kim Kon. Other films followed such as \"Crocodile Man\", \"The Snake King's Wife Part 2\", \"The Snake girl\" and \"My Mother is Arb\". These films found success both in Cambodia and abroad. Although the Cambodian Civil War was being waged in the provinces during this era, there were up to 33 cinemas operating in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Always full of viewers, the theaters provided an escape from the realities of war and taxes imposed on the brisk ticket sales provided the weakening government with a source of revenue with which to fight the encroaching Khmer Rouge.\n\nAs the war began to threaten Phnom Penh in 1974, cinemas began to close and movie production all but halted. When the Khmer Rouge gained control of the government in 1975, the new regime abolished institutional establishments such as currency, education, markets and private property. Movie production in Cambodia ceased to exist as artists, producers, actors and singers were executed to \"get rid of any Western legacy of the capitalist ideology\".\n\nAfter the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia ended Khmer Rouge rule in 1979, cinemas began to open again, but only showed foreign films (specifically from Vietnam, the USSR, and Soviet Bloc countries) due to lack of both human and material resources to make movies locally. Despite these films being mostly propaganda vehicles with some from the romance genre, moviegoers starving for entertainment flocked to the hot, overcrowded theaters, standing in line for hours for a chance to buy tickets or bribe security guards to get in. This public enthusiasm led to the revival of the native Cambodian film industry in 1987. Horror films were still not allowed, however, as financial backing came primarily from Vietnam and the USSR and movies could not offend the Vietnamese-backed government.\n\nThe new themes introduced by the Cambodian-produced films, including romance stories and tales of hardship under Khmer Rouge rule, were widely popular which resulted in 215 production companies and almost 40 theaters in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Battambang. Yet, once again, this revival was short-lived, as the 1991 withdrawal of the Vietnamese from Cambodia and the subsequent United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia opened the markets to massively copied high budget foreign films from Hong Kong and serialized television soaps from Thailand. Most Cambodian film companies were forced out of business but the competition from television and foreign markets also raised the standards of the few remaining companies and a couple movies were produced that presaged the rising popularity of the Horror genre.\n\nThe 2003 Phnom Penh riots, aimed at Thai institutions and ostensibly caused by anti-Cambodian comments allegedly made by a Thai actress, resulted in the banning of Thai soap operas and films which by that time had represented the majority of screen time in Cambodia. This allowed Cambodian producers to once again fill the vacuum and just happened to coincide with the worldwide popularity of J-Horror (Japanese Horror films), spurred on in part by the success of the US remake of \"Ring\".\n\nModern Khmer producers have catered to the young public's taste for movies within the horror genre but domestic production companies typically have low budgets and employ weak special effects. Nonetheless, these horror movies, after decades of absence, have been very successful with local audiences, especially among the younger demographic groups. Korm Chanthy, the manager of FCI Productions, which made the popular 2004 \"Nieng Arp\", said \"We make movies to suit the domestic market and the demand of our youths and they like to watch horror movies because they make them feel excited, thrilled and terrified\".\n\nBetween 2004 and 2006, the domestic producers made nearly 20 horror films per year. Since 2004, almost 50% of Khmer films were of the horror genre. The most prolific producers of these horror films were FCI Production and Campro Production, a company founded in 2003 by young producer and computer entrepreneur Heng Tola and several friends. Although Campro Production closed in 2007, these two companies provided the Cambodian market over 15 horror films as of 2011. Budgets were typically very small and special effects were often lackluster compared to foreign horror movies. Making an entire movie took Campro about three months and cost an average of US$30,000, including $1,000 for the lead actor.\n\nThe 2001 Thai-Khmer joint film \"The Snake King's Child\", a retelling of 1971's \"The Snake King's Wife\", was recognized as the first Cambodian horror film to be released since before the Khmer Rouge era. The movie was a comparatively tame film, adapted from an old folk tale and not displaying the characteristic elements of the later, post-2003, horror films. The popularity of \"The Snake King's Child\" inspired a sequel, \"The Snake King's Grandchild\", which involved a ghost story based on the mythology of the \"ap\" (Thai: \"krasue\") legend.\n\nIn early 2003, the film \"Kohak Kmorch Tek Snech Asara Peak\", a period ghost film was released. A psychological thriller, \"The Weird Villa\", produced by Angkor Wat Production and written by \"Pan Phuong Bopha\", achieved some box office success and was considered one of the outstanding films of the year. It was followed by several major grossing horror films including \"Nieng Arp\" (English title: \"Lady Vampire\"), also centered on the popular \"ap\" legend, and \"Ghost Banana Tree\", produced by Campro Production.\n\nFilms developed after 2003 featured several remakes, mostly of foreign films, including \"Neang Neath\", \"Neang Pomiry\", and the 2006 hit \"The Killing Phone\" which is a remake of the Thai movie \"999-9999\" and includes homages to \"Ringu\" and \"One Missed Call\".\n\nTop grossing and award winning horror films from this era include \"The Crocodile\", a tale about the heroism of a man who killed the beast responsible for the deaths of several people in his village. Released in 2005, \"The Crocodile\" cost over $100,000 to make, the highest budgeted Cambodian production to date, won several awards and was re-released in 2007 due to its popularity. Other notable 2005 releases were \"The Forest\", a graphic film which won an award for best special effects, and \"The Haunted House\", both produced by Campro Production.\n\nIn the Third Khmer film festival which was held in late 2007, horror films were banned from competition on the grounds that too many horror movies had been made.\n\nThe Khmer Culture and Film ministry suggested that Khmer film makers should decrease their production of works in the horror genre despite their immense popularity with local audiences, especially the younger generation. In addition, a recent downturn in the domestic film market has left some producers believing the horror genre is serving to keep Cambodian cinema alive.\n\nAccording to Heng Tola, the current popularity of horror movies is waning in favor of \"a more serious\" emerging trend, both fueled by and feeding into the bitterness many Cambodians still hold on to regarding their country's recent history, specifically the humiliation of colonialism and losing territory, respect and political, economic and military prestige to powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nCambodian horror films, like those of Thailand, are heavily influenced by popular Japanese and Korean horror films but also display elements from Western (American) horror as well. The plot of Cambodian horror films generally center on a ghost story, physically or psychologically violent revenge, spirit hauntings or possessions, or myths taken from Cambodian folk religion such as the \"ap\". Films featuring ghost stories, mythology and blood rituals include \"Ghost Banana Tree\" and \"The Kantong Kiev Witch\". One film, \"The Haunted House\", is loosely based on an actual urban legend surrounding a supposedly haunted house in Kampong Chhnang Province.\n\nSimilar to more widely known Japanese movies, the more popular films rely on storytelling that takes a slower pace than Western horror, building suspense and focusing on the characters' suffering and anguish. A pervasive sense of doom and dread is maintained by portraying psychologically disturbing situations and events. In a departure from the East Asian formula, however, Cambodian films often feature over-the-top gore and cheaply overdone effects. Popular horror films in this modern vein that emphasize psychological terror include \"The Weird Villa\", \"Secret Well\" (from Ángkor Wat Productions), and \"Heart Talk\", a 2008 Khmer Mekong Films production written by British novelist and screenwriter Matt Baylis.\n\nFilms with revenge motifs are usually based on unrequited or betrayed love and often feature the offended person, who either is killed or commits suicide, rising from the dead either as a ghostly apparition or a spirit that can possess other bodies. The plots are usually resolved only after sufficient revenge has been taken or when the ghost or spirit is defeated by a holy man (an Achaa, Ruesi, or \"Khru\") or a Buddhist Monk. Popular revenge-themed movies include \"Villa Horror\", \"Annoyed\" and \"Moheagita\".\n\nCambodian \"monster\" films are another subgenre of horror. Although considered a relatively new subgenre, these movies are just extensions of the older folk mythology type films with different monsters. Similar to the older \"Snake King\" films, these low-budget monster films employ lots of outdoor cinematography and amateurish special effects. The characters in monster movies are usually groups of teens on outings or cross country journeys without adult supervision. Well known examples of monster films are \"The Forest\", \"Queen of Cobra\" and \"People eating Lizard\".\n\nSlasher films haven't been very common but a few have been made in Cambodia. Most portray many adolescent victims killed in a typically random, unprovoked fashion usually within a single night. The first slasher film produced by a Cambodian company was \"The Waterfall of Death\", which has noted similarities to the American murder thriller \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" and the Thai psychological killer film \"Scared\".\n\n"}

{"id": "18518369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18518369", "title": "Hurl!", "text": "Hurl!\n\nHurl! is an American television game show from G4 that first premiered on G4 in the USA on July 16, 2008. It takes a unique twist on competitive eating. The concept is for competitors to alternate between challenges of competitive eating and extreme activities in order to see who will be last to vomit. The winner receives $1,000 cash on the spot.\n\nThe show begins with an unidentified person shopping for food and purchasing the food for the current episode, with a narration about competition. The intro ends with the clerk asking \"What are you going to do with all this stuff?\"\n\nPrior to the game beginning, some information is provided via the narrators and on-screen text. All on-screen information for the viewer is done by holding up a post-it note or a notebook with handwriting on them. The \"one simple rule\" of the game is incorrectly described by the narrator as \"whoever eats the most and hurls the least, wins\". In fact the winner is the contestant that eats the most and hurls the \"last\" or not at all. Five competitors are introduced by name, height, weight, and occupation. The five begin the game by eating large quantities of food, usually a single savory dish accompanied with a drink to help wash it down. All food and drinks are identified as being organic. The food is placed on deli scales, which are used to determine through subtraction how much each competitor eats. Of the five competitors, only the three that eat the most in a span of five minutes make it through to the second round.\n\nThe second round involves some sort of physical or recreational activity, usually one that involves large amounts of spinning, for five minutes. The activity can end early if one of the contestants vomits. A \"hurl\" is defined on the show as any \"swallowed\" food that comes out of the mouth. If a player vomits into their mouth and it does not come out, it is not a \"hurl\".\n\nFor the third round, competitors return to the scales and eat for another four minutes. Sometimes they eat the same food as the first round, while other times they move to a second food item, usually a dessert. If three competitors make it to the third round, then the two that eat the most in the third round move on, unless somebody vomits first.\n\nAfter the third round, if two competitors are left, a fourth round of extreme activities is done in a \"sudden barf\" format: first to \"hurl\", loses. Sometimes the extreme activity is done blindfolded to induce disequilibrium and nausea. If necessary, a fifth round of eating and a sixth round of blindfolded extreme activities are done as well. If both players make it through all six rounds without hurling, then the one that ate the most during just the fifth round wins the contest.\n\nThe game crew that runs the competition is called the \"hazmat team\". They are several people dressed in Level C hazmat suits, complete with gas masks, and act as a cleanup crew. Although they are dealing with bodily fluids, necessitating some precaution, their dress is exaggerated for comedic effect.\n\nWhen a player vomits on-screen, the vomit is censored with numbered buckets and a pinball game sound effect. The buckets are used to arbitrarily rate the scale of the vomiting, up to an , although in Episode 11, a contestant hurls while being spun by a Sumo wrestler, and the narrator observes that on a scale of 1 to 5 buckets, this was an 11 bucket hurl. They are usually (but not always) preceded by a \"hurl warning\" with a handwritten note in front of the camera and a Klaxon, which also is sometimes used with close calls and fakeouts. The show also shows various \"strategies\" employed by some players to either eat more food or try to induce other players to vomit. Each strategy or technique has a number that is shown to the viewer on a handwritten note.\n\nThe last one remaining wins $1,000, which is paid immediately in cash by \"Manny\" (Manny Salcido), the leader of the hazmat team. If the winner also ate the most food in the contest, then they also win the \"Iron Stomach Award\". Sometimes the winner will vomit after their win; since they already won, this does not affect the outcome of the game. The show will also depict competitors that have lost and vomit after being eliminated.\n\nThe G4 network aired all 11 episodes in an uncensored (no buckets and no sound effects) format after the censored episodes had been shown.\n\n\n"}

It is believed that it was imported from China around the 13th century when Vietnam was warring against the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. A famous actor named Lý Nguyên Cát (李元吉) was imprisoned by the Vietnamese. The imperial court asked him to spread his knowledge of Chinese theatre to the children of the elite, thus explaining how tuồng had first had its beginnings in Vietnam in the royal court. Later on, it was adapted to travelling troupes who entertained commoners and peasants.\n\nHowever, the first one to lay the foundation for the art of tuồng in Vietnam is Dao Duy Tu. Under the Nguyen dynasty which he served for, tuồng reached its highest point and was favored by Nguyen kings. Many great playwrights including Đào Tấn were also in this time. \n\nAlong with \"Hát chèo\", \"tuồng\" was one of the highly popular art forms for commoners until 20th century. With the arrival of Cai Luong and modern theatrics, tuong gradually lost its position. \n\nStories in the opera tend to be ostensibly historical and frequently focus on the rules of social decorum, and can include legends from either the history of China or Vietnam. \n\n\"Tuồng\" employs the use of stock characters who are recognizable from their make-up and costumes, which are typically very elaborate and extravagant. \n\nUsually, a character's personalities can be revealed through three features: the color of the face, the eyebrows, and the beard.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Generally, this means gravure, or \"cheesecake\", fully clothed shots; but, junior idols can, and some do, eventually enter the AV industry. Child actors, musicians, and J-pop singers (whose musical genre is often termed idol pop) can also be considered junior idols and are often featured in photobooks and image DVDs.\n\nFemale fashion models (not to be confused with glamour models, including gravure idols) also begin their careers typically at age 13–15, but are usually not considered junior idols. Child models, whose careers are usually over by their early young years, are also not usually considered junior idols\n\nThere exists no clear set of guidelines regarding the age at which an individual becomes a junior idol: Yumi Adachi, for instance, started her modeling career at age two and many other idols have starred in image DVDs at the ages of three, four and five. The majority of junior idols belong to specialized talent agencies, some of which offer acting and voice training and are geared towards the production of television commercials, photobooks, and related materials. Though sources indicate revenue is relatively low for photographic models, a number of idols (and their parents) see this activity as a gateway to more mainstream media roles. These transitions are indeed frequent, one example being the case of Saaya Irie who was cast into the live action adaptation of the popular anime series \"Hell Girl\" and several other television programs. Conversely, some aspiring idols eventually find themselves pursuing less and less mainstream work.\n\nThe trend of junior idols dates back to the mid-1990s, a period marked by significant increase in the number of child models and works involving individuals in that age range. The term \"chidol\", a neologism of the words \"child\" and \"idol\", was coined by columnist Akio Nakamori to describe this new phenomena. Eventually, this term fell out of use and was replaced by \"Junior Idol\". Compared to \"chidol\", the term \"junior idol\" plays down the association with age and lends some credibility to the industry associating it with the legitimate mainstream idol culture in Japan.\n\nContent is available in many formats, usually physical goods such as bond photobooks, CDs and DVDs, but also digital content in the form of Portable Document Format books, JPEG photo sets, high resolution movie clips, etc. To promote a particular idol, or to celebrate the release of a specific title, certain stores hold special events where fans get to meet the idols, shake hands with them, obtain autographs or take photographs, either polaroids or pictures taken with the customers' own cameras, in accordance with the amount of money spent on related goods (either regular DVDs, photobooks, etc., or multiple copies of the same title).\n\nConcerning the contents of the titles put on sale, these include, in general terms, pictures or footage of the idols trying out a variety of outfits, such as school uniforms, bathing suits, gym clothes, yukata or even maid, police and anime-inspired costumes.\n\nSome services providers, such as —a subscription-based website—also feature short radio and movie dramas, available for download and later purchase on DVD.\n\nThe junior idol industry is a highly contentious one in Japan. Many Japanese criticise such depictions of underaged girls, including some Japanese politicians. Despite such disapproval, stores selling junior idol-related materials proliferate in prominent areas such as Oimoya, an area located in Japan's well-known Akihabara shopping district.\n\nInternationally, the junior idol trend has been harshly criticised. In 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund launched a Say 'NO' to Child Pornography campaign in Japan. As part of the campaign, four major internet portal site providers in Japan removed junior idol-related content from their services. The campaign also garnered over 100,000 signatures in a petition to the Japanese government to amend its child pornography laws to criminalise procession of child pornography, including junior idol materials.\n\nJunior idol materials stand on legally ambiguous ground in Japan. Regulation of such materials comes under the Japanese Anti-child prostitution and pornography law.\n\nThe Japanese Anti-child prostitution and pornography law was enacted in November 1999—and revised in 2004 to criminalize distribution of child pornography over the Internet—defines child pornography as the depiction \"in a way that can be recognized visually, such a pose of a child relating to sexual intercourse or an act similar to sexual intercourse with or by the child\", of \"a pose of a child relating to the act of touching genital organs, etc.\" or the depiction of \"a pose of a child who is naked totally or partially in order to arouse or stimulate the viewer's sexual desire.\"\n\nDespite inherent difficulties in effectively enforcing a ban on such materials, on August 25, 2007 the Japanese branch of Amazon.com removed over 600 junior idol titles on grounds the likelihood these were produced in violation of the Japanese anti-child prostitution and pornography law was high. This incident was then followed by the arrest—on October 16—of 34-year-old , chief producer of (a company specialized in idol and pornographic materials, as well as a number of novels and technical texts) and three associates over the production of an \"obscene\" DVD shot earlier in 2007 in the Indonesian island of Bali, starring a girl who was seventeen at the time. The prolonged filming of the girl's genitalia was in violation of Japanese law. Following the incident, the release date of several photobooks and DVDs originally slated for publication in November 2007 was postponed and idol events cancelled.\n\n"}

Kobzars accompanied their singing with a musical instrument known as the kobza, bandura, or lira. Their repertoire primarily consisted of para-liturgical psalms and \"kanty\", and also included a unique epic form known as dumas. \n\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century there were three regional kobzar schools: Chernihiv, Poltava, and Slobozhan, which were differentiated by repertoire and playing style.\n\nIn Ukraine, kobzars organized themselves into regional guilds or brotherhoods, known as tsekhs. They developed a system of rigorous apprenticeships (usually three years in length) before undergoing the first set of open examinations in order to become a kobzar. \n\nThese guilds were thought to have been modelled on the Orthodox Church brotherhoods as each guild was associated with a specific church. These guilds then would take care of one church icon or purchase new religious ornaments for their affiliated church (Kononenko, p. 568–9). The Orthodox Church however was often suspicious of and occasionally even hostile to kobzars.\n\nThe institution of the kobzardom essentially ended in the Ukrainian SSR in the mid 1930s during Stalin's radical transformation of rural society which included the liquidation of the kobzars of Ukraine. Kobzar performance was replaced with stylized performances of folk and classical music utilising the bandura.\n\nSoviet kobzars were stylised performers on the bandura created to replace the traditional authentic kobzari who had been wiped out in the 1930s. These performers were often blind and although some actually had contact with the authentic kobzari of the previous generation, many received formal training in the Folk conservatories by trained musicians and played on contemporary chromatic concert factory made instruments. \n\nTheir repertoire was primarily made up of censored versions of traditional kobzar repertoire and focused on stylized works that praised the Soviet system and Soviet heroes. \n\nIn recent times, there has been an interest in reviving of authentic kobzar traditions which is marked by the re-establishing the Kobzar Guild as a centre for the dissemination of historical authentic performance practice.\n\n\"Kobzar\" is also a seminal book of poetry by Taras Shevchenko, the great national poet of Ukraine.\n\nThe term \"kobzar\" has on occasion been used for hurdy-gurdy players in Belarus (where the hurdy-gurdy is often referred to as a \"kobza\", and bagpipe players in Poland where the bagpipe is referred to as a \"kobza\" or \"koza\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "493399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493399", "title": "Loudness", "text": "Loudness\n\nIn acoustics, loudness is the subjective perception of sound pressure. More formally, it is defined as, \"That attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from quiet to loud.\" The relation of physical attributes of sound to perceived loudness consists of physical, physiological and psychological components. The study of apparent loudness is included in the topic of psychoacoustics and employs methods of psychophysics.\n\nIn different industries, loudness may have different meanings and different measurement standards. Some definitions, such as ITU-R BS.1770 refer to relative loudness of different segments of electronically reproduced sounds, such as for broadcasting and cinema. Others, such as ISO 532A (Stevens loudness, measured in sones), ISO 532B (Zwicker loudness), DIN 45631 and ASA/ANSI S3.4, have a more general scope and are often used to characterize loudness of environmental noise.\n\nLoudness, a subjective measure, often confused with physical measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, sound pressure level (in decibels), sound intensity or sound power. Filters such as A-weighting and LKFS attempt to compensate measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the typical human.\n\nThe perception of loudness is related to sound pressure level (SPL), frequency content and duration of a sound. The relationship between SPL and loudness of a single tone can be approximated by Stevens's power law in which SPL has an exponent of 0.67. More precise measurements indicate that loudness increases with a higher exponent at low and high levels and with a lower exponent at moderate levels.\n\nThe sensitivity of the human ear changes as a function of frequency, as shown in the equal-loudness graph. Each line on this graph shows the SPL required for frequencies to be perceived as equally loud, and different curves pertain to different sound pressure levels. It also shows that humans with normal hearing are most sensitive to sounds around 2–4 kHz, with sensitivity declining to either side of this region. A complete model of the perception of loudness will include the integration of SPL by frequency.\n\nHistorically, loudness was measured using an \"ear-balance\" audiometer in which the amplitude of a sine wave was adjusted by the user to equal the perceived loudness of the sound being evaluated. Contemporary standards for measurement of loudness are based on summation of energy in critical bands.\n\nWhen sensorineural hearing loss (damage to the cochlea or in the brain) is present, the perception of loudness is altered. Sounds at low levels (often perceived by those without hearing loss as relatively quiet) are no longer audible to the hearing impaired, but sounds at high levels often are perceived as having the same loudness as they would for an unimpaired listener. This phenomenon can be explained by two theories, called \"loudness recruitment\" and \"softness imperception\".\n\nLoudness recruitment posits that loudness grows more rapidly for certain listeners than normal listeners with changes in level. This theory has been accepted as the classical explanation.\n\nSoftness imperception, a term coined by Mary Florentine around 2002, proposes that some listeners with sensorineural hearing loss may exhibit a normal rate of loudness growth, but instead have an elevated loudness at their threshold. That is, the softest sound that is audible to these listeners is louder than the softest sound audible to normal listeners.\n\nThe \"loudness\" control on some consumer stereos alters the frequency response curve to correspond roughly with the equal loudness characteristic of the ear. Loudness compensation is intended to make the recorded music sound more natural when played at a lower levels by boosting low frequencies, to which the ear is less sensitive at lower sound pressure levels.\n\nLoudness normalization is a specific type of audio normalization that equalizes perceived level such that, for instance, commercials do not sound louder than television programs. Loudness normalization schemes exist for a number of audio applications.\n\n\n\n\nHistorically Sone (loudness \"N\") and Phon (loudness level \"L\") units have been used to measure loudness.\n\nA-weighting follows human sensitivity to sound and describes relative perceived loudness for at quiet to moderate speech levels, around 40 phons.\n\nRelative loudness monitoring in production is measured in accordance with ITU-R BS.1770 in units of LKFS.\n\nWork began on ITU-R BS.1770 in 2001 after 0 dBFS+ level distortion in converters and lossy codecs had become evident; and the original Leq(RLB) loudness metric was proposed by Gilbert Soulodre in 2003. Based on data from subjective listening tests, Leq(RLB) compared favorably to numerous other algorithms. CBC, Dolby and TC Electronic and numerous broadcasters contributed to the listening tests. \n\nLoudness levels measured according to the Leq(RLB) specified in ITU-R BS.1770 are reported in LKFS units. \n\nThe ITU-R BS.1770 measurement system was improved for made multi-channel applications (monaural to 5.1 surround sound). To make the loudness metric cross-genre friendly, a relative measurement gate was added. This work was carried out in 2008 by the EBU. The improvements were brought back into BS.1770-2. ITU subsequently updated the true-peak metric (BS.1770-3) and added provision for even more audio channels, for instance 22.2 surround sound (BS.1770-4).\n\n"}

It was first mentioned in Vitruvius' book on architecture, \"De architectura\" (c. 14 BC) but its most intense use began in Renaissance theatre, as a result of the work of important theatrical designers, such as Nicola Sabbatini (1574-1654).\n\nIt consists of a revolving solid equilateral triangular prism made of wood. On each of its three faces, a different scene is painted, so that, by quickly revolving the periaktos, another face can appear to the audience. Other solid polygons can be used, such as cubes, but triangular prisms offer the best combination of simplicity, speed and number of scenes per device. A series of periaktoi positioned one after the other along the stage's depth can produce the illusion of a longer scene, composed by its faces as seen in perspective. These periaktoi must therefore be rotated simultaneously to a new position, thus achieving interesting illusions. This is made by coupling them by using sprocket gears at their bases and a flat chain or conveyor belt mechanical transmission system.\n\nA similar concept is used in some modern Trivision multi-message billboards, which are made up of a series of triangular prisms arranged so that they can be rotated to present three separate flat display surfaces in succession. \n\nEarly motion picture mechanical devices, such as the praxinoscope, were also based on rapidly rotating solid polygons, which had the successive animation or photographic plates affixed or projected to each face, thus providing the optical illusion of movement.\n\n\n"}

The term \"record label\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.\n\nWithin the mainstream music industry, recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base, market their albums, and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services, radio, and television. Record labels provide publicists, who assist performers in gaining positive media coverage, and arrange for their merchandise to be available via stores and other media outlets.\n\nBut an increasing number of artists have sought to avoid costs and gain new audiences via the Internet, often with the help of videos. Combined with the decline in album sales and rapid growth in free content available online, this has changed the way the industry works dramatically since the beginning of the 21st century. It has caused record labels to seek new sources of profit, in particular via \"360\" deals (see below, under \"new label strategies\").\n\nRecord labels may be small, localized and \"independent\" (\"indie\"), or they may be part of a large international media group, or somewhere in between. The Association of Independent Music (AIM) defines a 'major' as \"a multinational company which (together with the companies in its group) has more than 5% of the world market(s) for the sale of records or music videos.\" As of 2012, there are only three labels that can be referred to as \"major labels\" (Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group). In 2014 AIM estimated that the majors had a collective global market share of some 65-70%. \n\nA \"sublabel\" is a label that is part of a larger record company but trades under a different name.\n\nA label used as a trademark or brand and not a company is called an imprint, a term used for the same concept in publishing. An imprint is sometimes marketed as being a \"project\", \"unit\", or \"division\" of a record label company, even though there is no legal business structure associated with the imprint.\n\nRecord companies and music publishers that are not under the control of the big three are generally considered to be \"independent\" (\"indie\"), even if they are large corporations with complex structures. The term \"indie label\" is sometimes used to refer to only those independent labels that adhere to independent criteria of corporate structure and size, and some consider an indie label to be almost any label that releases non-mainstream music, regardless of its corporate structure.\n\nIndependent labels are often considered more artist-friendly. Though they may have less financial clout, indie labels typically offer larger artist royalty with 50% profit-share agreement, aka 50-50 deal, not uncommon.\n\nMusic collectors often use the term \"sublabel\" to refer to either an imprint or a subordinate label company (such as those within a group). For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, \"4th & B'way\" was a trademarked brand owned by Island Records Ltd. in the UK and by a subordinate branch, Island Records, Inc., in the United States. The center label on a 4th & Broadway record marketed in the United States would typically bear a 4th & B'way logo and would state in the fine print, \"4th & B'way™, an Island Records, Inc. company\". Collectors discussing labels as brands would say that 4th & B'way is a sublabel or imprint of just \"Island\" or \"Island Records\". Similarly, collectors who choose to treat corporations and trademarks as equivalent might say 4th & B'way is an imprint and/or sublabel of both Island Records, Ltd. and that company's sublabel, Island Records, Inc. However, such definitions are complicated by the corporate mergers that occurred in 1989 (when Island was sold to PolyGram) and 1998 (when PolyGram merged with Universal). Island remained registered as corporations in both the United States and UK, but control of its brands changed hands multiple times as new companies were formed, diminishing the corporation's distinction as the \"parent\" of any sublabels.\n\nVanity labels are labels that bear an imprint that gives the impression of an artist's ownership or control, but in fact represent a standard artist/label relationship. In such an arrangement, the artist will control nothing more than the usage of the name on the label, but may enjoy a greater say in the packaging of his or her work. An example of such a label is the Neutron label owned by ABC while at Phonogram Inc. in the UK. At one point artist Lizzie Tear (under contract with ABC themselves) appeared on the imprint, but it was devoted almost entirely to ABC's offerings and is still used for their re-releases (though Phonogram owns the masters of all the work issued on the label).\n\nHowever, not all labels dedicated to particular artists are completely superficial in origin. Many artists, early in their careers, create their own labels which are later bought out by a bigger company. If this is the case it can sometimes give the artist greater freedom than if they were signed directly to the big label. There are many examples of this kind of label, such as Nothing Records, owned by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails; and Morning Records, owned by the Cooper Temple Clause, who were releasing EPs for years before the company was bought by RCA.\n\nA label typically enters into an exclusive recording contract with an artist to market the artist's recordings in return for royalties on the selling price of the recordings. Contracts may extend over short or long durations, and may or may not refer to specific recordings. Established, successful artists tend to be able to renegotiate their contracts to get terms more favorable to them, but Prince's much-publicized 1994–1996 feud with Warner Bros. Records provides a strong counterexample, as does Roger McGuinn's claim, made in July 2000 before a US Senate committee, that the Byrds never received any of the royalties they had been promised for their biggest hits, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn!, Turn!\".\n\nA contract either provides for the artist to deliver completed recordings to the label, or for the label to undertake the recording with the artist. For artists without a recording history, the label is often involved in selecting producers, recording studios, additional musicians, and songs to be recorded, and may supervise the output of recording sessions. For established artists, a label is usually less involved in the recording process.\n\nThe relationship between record labels and artists can be a difficult one. Many artists have had albums altered or censored in some way by the labels before they are released—songs being edited, artwork or titles being changed, etc. Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made. Often the record label's decisions are prudent ones from a commercial perspective, but this typically frustrates the artists who feels that their art is being diminished or misrepresented by such actions.\n\nIn the early days of the recording industry, recording labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist. The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they sometimes ended up signing agreements in which they sold the rights to their recordings to the record label in perpetuity. Entertainment lawyers are usually employed by artists to discuss contract terms.\n\nThrough the advances of the Internet the role of labels is becoming increasingly changed, as artists are able to freely distribute their own material through web radio, peer to peer file sharing such as BitTorrent, and other services, for little or no cost but with little financial return. Established artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, whose career was developed with major label backing, announced an end to their major label contracts, citing that the uncooperative nature of the recording industry with these new trends are hurting musicians, fans and the industry as a whole. Nine Inch Nails later returned to working with a major label, admitting that they needed the international marketing and promotional reach that a major label can provide. Radiohead also cited similar motives with the end of their contract with EMI when their album \"In Rainbows\" was released as a \"pay what you want\" sales model as an online download, but they also returned to a label for a conventional release. Research shows that record labels still control most access to distribution.\n\nWith the advancement of the computer and technology such as the Internet, leading to an increase in file sharing and direct-to-fan digital distribution, combined with music sales plummeting in recent years, labels and organizations have had to change their strategies and the way they work with artists. New types of deals are being made with artists called \"multiple rights\" or \"360\" deals with artists. These types of pacts give labels rights and percentages to artist's touring, merchandising, and endorsements. In exchange for these rights, labels usually give higher advance payments to artists, have more patience with artist development, and pay higher percentages of CD sales. These 360 deals are most effective when the artist is established and has a loyal fan base. For that reason, labels now have to be more relaxed with the development of artists because longevity is the key to these types of pacts. Several artists such as Paramore, Maino, and even Madonna have signed such types of deals.\n\nA look at an actual 360 deal offered by Atlantic Records to an artist shows a variation of the structure. Atlantic's document offers a conventional cash advance to sign the artist, who would receive a royalty for sales after expenses were recouped. With the release of the artist's first album, however, the label has an option to pay an additional $200,000 in exchange for 30 percent of the net income from all touring, merchandise, endorsements, and fan-club fees. Atlantic would also have the right to approve the act's tour schedule, and the salaries of certain tour and merchandise sales employees hired by the artist. But the label also offers the artist a 30 percent cut of the label's album profits—if any—which represents an improvement from the typical industry royalty of 15 percent.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies. CDs still flow through a handful of sources, with the majority of the sales going through the \"big three\" record labels.\n\nIn the 1990s, as a result of the widespread use of home studios, consumer recording technology, and the Internet, independent labels began to become more commonplace. Independent labels are often artist-owned (although not always), with a stated intent often being to control the quality of the artist's output. Independent labels usually do not enjoy the resources available to the \"big three\" and as such will often lag behind them in market shares. Often independent artists manage a return by recording for a much smaller production cost of a typical big label release. Sometimes they are able to recoup their initial advance even with much lower sales numbers.\n\nOn occasion, established artists, once their record contract has finished, move to an independent label. This often gives the combined advantage of name recognition and more control over one's music along with a larger portion of royalty profits. Artists such as Dolly Parton, Aimee Mann, Prince, Public Enemy, BKBravo (Kua and Rafi), among others, have done this. Historically, companies started in this manner have been re-absorbed into the major labels (two examples are American singer Frank Sinatra's Reprise Records, which has been owned by Warner Music Group for some time now, and musician Herb Alpert's A&M Records, now owned by Universal Music Group). Similarly, Madonna's Maverick Records (started by Madonna with her manager and another partner) was to come under control of Warner Music when Madonna divested herself of controlling shares in the company.\n\nSome independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases, purchase the label completely.\n\nOn the punk rock scene, the DIY ethic encourages bands to self-publish and self-distribute. This approach evolved out of necessity around since the early 1980s, due to the major labels' aversion to signing the punk rock bands that spawned after the initial wave in the mid-70s. Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the big record labels at all. One of the most notable and influential labels of the Do-It-Yourself attitude was SST Records, created by the band Black Flag. No labels wanted to release their material, so they simply created their own label to release not only their own material but the material of many other influential underground bands all over the country. Ian MacKaye's Dischord is often cited as a model of success in the DIY community, having survived for over thirty years with less than twelve employees at any one time.\n\nWith the Internet now being a viable source for obtaining music, netlabels have emerged. Depending on the ideals of the net label, music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via PayPal or other online payment system. Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download. Digital Labels are the latest version of a 'net' label. Whereas 'net' labels were started as a free site, digital labels are more competition for the major record labels.\n\nThe new century brought the phenomenon of \"open-source\" or \"open-content\" record label. These are inspired by the free software and open source movements and the success of GNU/Linux.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, some music publishing companies began undertaking the work traditionally done by labels. The publisher Sony/ATV Music, for example, leveraged its connections within the Sony family to produce, record, distribute, and promote Elliott Yamin's debut album under a dormant Sony-owned imprint, rather than waiting for a deal with a proper label.\n\nRecord labels are often under the control of a corporate umbrella organization called a \"music group\". A music group is typically owned by an international conglomerate \"holding company\", which often has non-music divisions as well. A music group controls and consists of music publishing companies, record (sound recording) manufacturers, record distributors, and record labels. Record companies (manufacturers, distributors, and labels) may also constitute a \"record group\" which is, in turn, controlled by a music group. The constituent companies in a music group or record group are sometimes marketed as being \"divisions\" of the group.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1999, there were six major record labels, known as the Big Six:\n\nPolyGram was merged into UMG in 1999, leaving the rest to be known as the Big Five.\n\nIn 2004, Sony and BMG agreed to a joint venture to create the Sony BMG label (which would be renamed Sony Music Entertainment after a 2008 merger). In 2007, the four remaining companies—known as the Big Four—controlled about 70% of the world music market, and about 80% of the United States music market.\n\nIn 2012, the major divisions of EMI were sold off separately by owner Citigroup: most of EMI's recorded music division was absorbed into UMG; EMI Music Publishing was absorbed into Sony/ATV Music Publishing; finally, EMI's Parlophone and Virgin Classics labels were absorbed into Warner Music Group in July 2013. This left the so-called Big Three labels:\n\n"}

{"id": "488401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=488401", "title": "Sound design", "text": "Sound design\n\nSound design is the art and practice of creating sound tracks for a variety of needs. It involves specifying, acquiring or creating auditory elements using audio production techniques and tools. It is employed in a variety of disciplines including filmmaking, television production, video game development, theatre, sound recording and reproduction, live performance, sound art, post-production, radio and musical instrument development. Sound design commonly involves performing (see e.g. foley) and editing of previously composed or recorded audio, such as sound effects and dialogue for the purposes of the medium. A sound designer is one who practices sound design.\n\nThe use of sound to evoke emotion, reflect mood and underscore actions in plays and dances began in prehistoric times. At its earliest, it was used in religious practices for healing or recreation. In ancient Japan, theatrical events called \"kagura\" were performed in Shinto shrines with music and dance.\n\nPlays were performed in medieval times in a form of theatre called \"Commedia dell'arte\", which used music and sound effects to enhance performances. The use of music and sound in the Elizabethan Theatre followed, in which music and sound effects were produced off stage using devices such as bells, whistles, and horns. Cues would be written in the script for music and sound effects to be played at the appropriate time.\n\nItalian composer Luigi Russolo built mechanical sound-making devices, called \"intonarumori,\" for futurist theatrical and music performances starting around 1913. These devices were meant to simulate natural and man-made sounds, such as trains and bombs. Russolo's treatise, The Art of Noises, is one of the earliest written documents on the use of abstract noise in the theatre. After his death, his intonarumori' were used in more conventional theatre performances to create realistic sound effects.\n\nPossibly the first use of recorded sound in the theatre was a phonograph playing a baby’s cry in a London theatre in 1890. Sixteen years later, Herbert Beerbohm Tree used recordings in his London production of Stephen Phillips’ tragedy NERO. The event is marked in the Theatre Magazine (1906) with two photographs; one showing a musician blowing a bugle into a large horn attached to a disc recorder, the other with an actor recording the agonizing shrieks and groans of the tortured martyrs. The article states: “these sounds are all realistically reproduced by the gramophone”. As cited by Bertolt Brecht, there was a play about Rasputin written in (1927) by Alexej Tolstoi and directed by Erwin Piscator that included a recording of Lenin's voice. Whilst the term \"sound designer\" was not in use at this time, a number of stage managers specialised as \"effects men\", creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry, mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records. A great deal of care and attention was paid to the construction and performance of these effects, both naturalistic and abstract. Over the course of the twentieth century the use of recorded sound effects began to take over from live sound effects, though often it was the stage manager's duty to find the sound effects and an electrician played the recordings during performances.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1988, Charlie Richmond, USITT's first Sound Design Commissioner, oversaw efforts of their Sound Design Commission to define the duties, responsibilities, standards and procedures which might normally be expected of a theatre sound designer in North America. This subject is still regularly discussed by that group, but during that time, substantial conclusions were drawn and he wrote a document which, although now somewhat dated, provides a succinct record of what was expected at that time. It was subsequently provided to both the ADC and David Goodman at the Florida USA local when they were both planning to represent sound designers in the 1990s.\n\nMIDI and digital audio technology have contributed to the evolution of sound production techniques in the 1980s and 1990s. Digital audio workstations and a variety of digital signal processing algorithms applied in them allow more complicated sound tracks with more tracks as well as auditory effects to be realized. Features such as unlimited undo and sample-level editing allow fine control over the sound tracks.\n\nIn theatre sound, features of computerized theatre sound design systems have also been recognized as being essential for live show control systems at Walt Disney World and, as a result, Disney utilized systems of that type to control many facilities at their \"Disney-MGM Studios\" theme park, which opened in 1989. These features were incorporated into the MIDI Show Control (MSC) specification, an open communications protocol used to interact with diverse devices. The first show to fully utilize the MSC specification was the Magic Kingdom Parade at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in September, 1991.\n\nThe rise of interest in game audio has also brought more advanced interactive audio tools that are also accessible without a background in computer programming. Some of such software tools (termed \"implementation tools\" or \"audio engines\") feature a workflow that's similar to that in more conventional digital audio workstation programs and can also allow the sound production personnel to undertake some of the more creative interactive sound tasks (that are considered to be part of sound design for computer applications) that previously would have required a computer programmer. Interactive applications have also given rise to a plethora of techniques in \"dynamic audio\" that loosely means sound that's \"parametrically\" adjusted during the run-time of the program. This allows for a broader expression in sounds, more similar to that in films, because this way the sound designer can e.g. create footstep sounds that vary in a believable and non-repeating way and that also corresponds to what's seen in the picture. The digital audio workstation cannot directly \"communicate\" with game engines, because the game's events occur often in an unpredictable order, whereas traditional digital audio workstations as well as so called linear media (TV, film etc.) have everything occur in the same order every time the production is run. Especially games have also brought in dynamic or adaptive mixing.\n\nThe World Wide Web has greatly enhanced the ability of sound designers to acquire source material quickly, easily and cheaply. Nowadays, a designer can preview and download crisper, more \"believable\" sounds as opposed to toiling through time- and budget-draining \"shot-in-the-dark\" searches through record stores, libraries and \"the grapevine\" for (often) inferior recordings. In addition, software innovation has enabled sound designers to take more of a DIY (or \"do-it-yourself\") approach. From the comfort of their home and at any hour, they can simply use a computer, speakers and headphones rather than renting (or buying) costly equipment or studio space and time for editing and mixing. This provides for faster creation and negotiation with the director.\n\nIn motion picture production, a \"Sound Editor/Designer\" is a member of a film crew responsible for the entirety or some specific parts of a film's sound track. In the American film industry, the title \"Sound Designer\" is not controlled by any professional organization, unlike titles such as Director or Screenwriter.\n\nThe terms \"sound design\" and \"sound designer\" began to be used in the motion picture industry in 1969. At that time, The title of \"Sound Designer\" was first granted to Walter Murch by Francis Ford Coppola in recognition for Murch's contributions to the film The Rain People. The original meaning of the title \"Sound Designer\", as established by Coppola and Murch, was \"an individual ultimately responsible for all aspects of a film's audio track, from the dialogue and sound effects recording to the re-recording (mix) of the final track\". The term \"sound designer\" has replaced monikers like \"supervising sound editor\" or \"re-recording mixer\" for what was essentially the same position: the head designer of the final sound track. Editors and mixers like Murray Spivack (\"King Kong\"), George Groves (\"The Jazz Singer\"), James G. Stewart (\"Citizen Kane\"), and Carl Faulkner (\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\") served in this capacity during Hollywood's studio era, and are generally considered to be sound designers by a different name.\n\nThe advantage of calling oneself a sound designer beginning in later decades was two-fold. It strategically allowed for a single person to work as both an editor and mixer on a film without running into issues pertaining to the jurisdictions of editors and mixers, as outlined by their respective unions. Additionally, it was a rhetorical move that legitimated the field of post-production sound at a time when studios were down-sizing their sound departments, and when producers were routinely skimping on budgets and salaries for sound editors and mixers. In so doing, it allowed those who called themselves sound designers to compete for contract work and to negotiate higher salaries. The position of Sound Designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of Production Designer, which was created in the 1930s when William Cameron Menzies made revolutionary contributions to the craft of art direction in the making of \"Gone with the Wind\".\n\nThe audio production team is a principal member of the production staff, with creative output comparable to that of the film editor and director of photography. Several factors have led to the promotion of audio production to this level, when previously it was considered subordinate to other parts of film:\n\n\nThe contemporary title of \"sound designer\" can be compared with the more traditional title of \"supervising sound editor\"; many sound designers use both titles interchangeably. The role of \"supervising sound editor\", or \"sound supervisor\", developed in parallel with the role of sound designer. The demand for more sophisticated soundtracks was felt both inside and outside Hollywood, and the supervising sound editor became the head of the large sound department, with a staff of dozens of sound editors, that was required to realize a complete sound job with a fast turnaround.\n\nSound design, as a distinct discipline, is one of the youngest fields in stagecraft, second only to the use of projection and other multimedia displays, although the ideas and techniques of sound design have been around almost since theatre started. Dan Dugan, working with three stereo tape decks routed to ten loudspeaker zones during the 1968–69 season of American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco, was the first person to be called a sound designer.\n\nModern audio technology has enabled theatre sound designers to produce flexible, complex, and inexpensive designs that can be easily integrated into live performance. The influence of film and television on playwriting is seeing plays being written increasingly with shorter scenes, which is difficult to achieve with scenery but easily conveyed with sound. The development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design. Consequently, theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish long-term collaborations with directors.\n\nSound design for musicals often focuses on the design and implementation of a sound reinforcement system that will fulfill the needs of the production. If a sound system is already installed in the performance venue, it is the sound designer's job to tune the system for the best use for a particular production. Sound system tuning employs various methods including equalization, delay, volume, speaker and microphone placement, and in some cases, the addition of new equipment. In conjunction with the director and musical director, if any, the sound reinforcement designer determines the use and placement of microphones for actors and musicians. The sound reinforcement designer ensures that the performance can be heard and understood by everyone in the audience, regardless of the shape, size or acoustics of the venue, and that performers can hear everything needed to enable them to do their jobs. While sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement, many musicals, such as \"Into the Woods\" also require significant sound scores (see Sound Design for Plays). Sound Reinforcement Design was recognized by the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Musical until the 2014-15 season, later reinstating in the 2017-18 season.\n\nSound design for plays often involves the selection of music and sounds (sound score) for a production based on intimate familiarity with the play, and the design, installation, calibration and utilization of the sound system that reproduces the sound score. The sound designer for a play and the production's director work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored. Based on this, the sound designer for plays, in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer, decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods. In some productions, the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play. The sound designer and the director usually work together to \"spot\" the cues in the play (i.e., decide when and where sound will be used in the play). Some productions might use music only during scene changes, whilst others might use sound effects. Likewise a scene might be underscored with music, sound effects or abstract sounds that exist somewhere between the two. Some sound designers are accomplished composers, writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound. Many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement (see Sound Design for Musicals). Sound Design for plays was recognized by the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Play until the 2014-15 season, later reinstating the award in the 2017-18 season.\n\n\nIn contemporary music business, especially in the production of rock music, ambient music, progressive rock, and similar genres, the record producer and recording engineer play important roles in the creation of the overall sound (or soundscape) of a recording, and less often, of a live performance. A record producer is responsible for extracting the best performance possible from the musicians and for making both musical and technical decisions about the instrumental timbres, arrangements, etc. On some, particularly more electronic music projects, artists and producers in more conventional genres have sometimes sourced additional help from artists often credited as \"sound designers\", to contribute specific auditory effects, ambiences etc. to the production. These people are usually more versed in e.g. electronic music composition and synthesizers than the other musicians on board.\n\nIn application of electroacoustic techniques (e.g. binaural sound) and sound synthesis for contemporary music or film music, a sound designer (often also an electronic musician) sometimes refers to an artist who works alongside a composer to realize the more electronic aspects of a musical production. This is because sometimes there exists a difference in interests between artists calling themselves composers and artists calling themselves electronic musicians or sound designers. The latter being sometimes more experienced as well as interested in electronic music techniques, such as sequencing and synthesizers, but the former often wanting to use elements of electronic music in compositions but often being more experienced in writing music in a variety of genres. Since electronic music itself is quite broad in techniques and often separate from techniques applied in other genres, this kind of collaboration can be seen as fairly natural as well as beneficial.\n\nNotable examples of (recognized) sound design in music are the contributions of Michael Brook to the U2 album \"The Joshua Tree\", George Massenburg to the Jennifer Warnes album \"Famous Blue Raincoat\", Chris Thomas to the Pink Floyd album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", and Brian Eno to the Paul Simon album \"Surprise\".\n\nIn 1974, Suzanne Ciani started her own production company, Ciani/Musica. Inc., which became the #1 sound design music house in New York.\n\nSound is widely used in a variety of human-computer interfaces, in computer games and video games. Sound production for computer applications adds few extra concerns and requirements to the sound. Some of them are: non-repetitiveness, interactivity/dynamicity and low memory and CPU use. For example, the most computational resources are usually devoted to graphics, which in turn means that the sound playback is often limited to some upper memory consumption as well as CPU use limits. These have to be added to the concerns of audio production, since it is often not enough to merely \"create good sound\", but the sound also has to fit to the given computational limits, while still sounding good, which may require e.g. the use of audio compression or voice allocating systems. However, sound for computer applications also adds some new creative aspects to music and sound, because computer sound (especially in games) often involves the sound having or desired to be \"interactive\". Adding interactivity can involve using a variety of playback systems or logic, using tools that allow the production of interactive sound (e.g. Max/MSP, Wwise) and it also deviates from being just an art form to also requiring software or electrical engineering, since implementing interactivity of sound also requires engineering of the systems that play the sound or e.g. process user input. Therefore, in interactive applications, a sound designer often collaborates with an engineer (e.g. a sound programmer) who's concerned with designing the playback systems and their efficiency.\n\nSound designers have been recognized by awards organizations for some time, and new awards have emerged more recently in response to advances in sound design technology and quality. The Motion Picture Sound Editors and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes the finest or most aesthetic sound design for a film with the Golden Reel Award for Sound and Music editing, and the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing respectively. In 2007, the Tony Award for Best Sound Design was created to honor the best sound design in American theatre on Broadway.\n\nNorth American theatrical award organizations that recognize sound designers include these:\n\nMajor British award organizations include the Olivier Awards. The Tony Awards retired the awards for Sound Design as of the 2014-2015 season, then reinstated the categories in the 2017-18 season.\n\n\n"}

(known as \"Der Clou!\" in German-speaking regions) is a remake of the 1986 game \"They Stole a Million\". It would form a two-game series, with a sequel following in 2001, under the guise of The Sting! or Der Clou 2!. In 2000 the source code was released to the public. The game was since then ported to modern platforms (Windows, Linux) via SDL and receives still updates by the game's community (2015).\n\nAn adventure game, assuming the identity of Matt Stuvysant, a burglar who is looking beyond just the clothes on his back and a hotel room on Holland Street, the player is tasked with finding accomplices, scouting potential targets, and plotting plans of burglary, down to the finest detail. Featuring the archetypal point-and-click interface during investigations, engaging in planning a job would alter the controls to include keyboard, using it to control the planned movements of the personnel.\n\n\"The Clue!\" is mixture of many video game genres. It can be described as role-playing adventure game with tactical/strategy elements and puzzles in the form of burglaries. The gameplay is composed of two different modes - most of the time, the player is travelling around the city of London and talking with people using point-and-click interface like in classical adventure games, while more strategy-like top-down perspective is used for the actual planning of the heists.\n\nThe \"adventure mode\" features static graphics depicting various places with menu interface to control Matt's actions. It is in this mode, where the player buys and sells cars, tools and other equipment needed for thievery, recruits accomplices and scouts for possible target buildings. Every important information as an amount of money, description of tools, cars, loot, etc. can be accessed anytime through the \"Think\" menu. Before committing a burglary, the player must collect all the necessary information by investigation of the site. A car and at least one associate with driving skills is also obligatory.\n\nAfter these conditions have been fulfilled, the player can switch the game into the \"planning mode\" by selecting the option \"Planning\" in the hotel room. There he chooses the escape car, accomplices and the driver. In the final stage of planning, the player controls movement of the thieves by the keyboard and works out the details of the plan in real-time like simulation.\n\nThe loot from successful coup must be sold to one of the three available dealers in order to earn money. Each dealer is specialized in different commodities and will not accept or will pay less for other types of merchandise.\n\nEssential part of the gameplay are skills such as driving, lockpicking or electronics, which affects the time needed to complete specific tasks. Some actions and tools depend on particular skill level of person doing it (for example using stethoscope for opening a safe lock requies higher skill level than using a welding torch for the same job). Participants of a successful burglary also improve their skills. In addition to skills, each character has various personal traits as dexterity, loyalty, greed or nerves. These traits affect things like proportion of share from the loot, how many trails the person leaves on the crime scene or if he/she betrays his/her associates when captured by the police.\n\n\"The Clue!\" is set in 1953, shortly after World War II, and takes place in the streets of London and its countryside. The game's list of locations includes many of actual historical places and buildings such as Victoria station or Karl Marx's Tomb at Highgate Cemetery along with some fictional ones.\n\nThe player character is Matt Stuvysant, a young criminal wanna-be getting immersed into the world of London underworld. He can make social contacts with other characters in various pubs and bars. Most of the NPCs can be hired to assist in burglary.\n\nThe story begins with Matt Stuvysant arriving to London Victoria station. Shortly after he is settled in the Ugly dog hotel on Holland street, he is contacted by his father's old friend Herbert Briggs, a well-renowned burglar.\n\n"}
{"id": "99931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99931", "title": "Tony Clifton", "text": "Tony Clifton\n\nTony Clifton is a character created by performance artist Andy Kaufman, who also portrayed him in the late 1970s. Characteristic of the many elaborate hoaxes and practical jokes Kaufman concocted, Clifton was not exclusively portrayed by Kaufman. Others, mainly longtime Kaufman friend Bob Zmuda, also performed the role.\n\nKaufman would sometimes claim that Tony Clifton was a real lounge singer whom Kaufman encountered in the International Hotel in Las Vegas in 1969. He was waiting for Elvis Presley to arrive so he could meet him. Kaufman may have seen Clifton as the antithesis of the sweet, gentle \"Foreign Man\" character he was best known for (which was later adapted into Latka Gravas, Kaufman's character on \"Taxi\").\n\nClifton would often attempt to improvise comical lyrics that were intentionally unfunny before giving up entirely without seeming to care. Clifton also tended to randomly insult patrons, passing off the abuse as the \"comedy\" portion of his act. Adding to Clifton's annoying and unappealing presence was his tendency to rhyme various words at random in the middle of conversations. Many people misunderstood Kaufman's intent, focusing on the character's foul language and prima donna antics while failing to appreciate the fact that Clifton was meant to be the comic antithesis of the typical lounge singer: a bland, genial entertainer designed to add a touch of class to a hotel and make guests feel welcome.\n\nFor a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act, but the interviews invariably would turn ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up. Clifton claimed Kaufman was using his name \"to go places.\" Actually, in many cases, Andy Kaufman played Clifton. Promoters who thought they had caught on to the joke would hire Clifton because he was cheaper than booking Kaufman. However, Kaufman had the last laugh, enlisting his brother Michael or his showbiz partner Bob Zmuda to play the role, with Kaufman making unannounced appearances onstage during Clifton's act. \n\nRodney Dangerfield was a big fan of Andy Kaufman, and hired Clifton to open for him for two shows at Bill Graham's famed Fillmore West. After a disastrous first show, where Clifton took the stage with Tony Bennett's famous \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" and was summarily booed, he reappeared on the second night in riot gear amid a shower of rotten vegetables and other detritus. \n\nTony Clifton still makes occasional appearances, most notably in the days leading up to May 16, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of Kaufman's death. It was announced on May 16, 2008 that Comic Relief, in recognition of the 24th anniversary of Andy Kaufman's departure, would present \"The Return of Tony Clifton\", with his Katrina Kiss My Ass Orchestra. The national tour kicked off June 27, 2008 at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia, and benefited Gulf Coast musicians, dancers, and singers affected by Hurricane Katrina. Clifton fronted the Katrina Orchestra along with the Cliftonettes. Later dates included August 15 at Chicago's Chopin Theatre. In 2011, Tony and his orchestra were featured headliners as part of the annual Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama, on May 21. Later that month he began hosting the \"Tony Clifton Revue\" at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles. He was interviewed on the 284th (May 31, 2012) episode of Marc Maron's \"WTF podcast\" as promotion..\n\nClifton was hired to appear on an early episode of ABC's \"Taxi\". In 1977, the producers of \"Taxi\" saw Kaufman's Foreign Man act at The Comedy Store, and offered him a role in their show based on the character. Kaufman wasn't a fan of sitcoms, but his manager, George Shapiro, convinced him that this would propel him to stardom, where he would make a lot of money which he could then put into his own act, which became \"Andy's Funhouse\". Kaufman agreed to appear as Latka Gravas in fourteen episodes per season, approximately half of the entire series, if Tony Clifton was also allowed to guest star in the series. The producers were well aware that \"Clifton\" was an alter ego of Kaufman, but went along with the fiction that Clifton was a separate actor. They signed Clifton to a separate contract, and announced to the cast that Clifton was being hired to portray the character of Louie's brother in the series 13th episode. \n\nHowever, after the first day of rehearsal, the producers felt Kaufman-as-Clifton was not up to the acting challenge of playing the offered role. Informed of this, Kaufman asked that \"Clifton\" be fired in public, ostensibly for coming to rehearsal late. Clifton then showed up on set for the next day of filming, and was demanding, boorish and obnoxious. The producers not only fired Clifton in front of press and network executives (who had gathered on set to witness the promised spectacle), but threw him off the set after he caused havoc and enraged series stars Judd Hirsch and Jeff Conaway. The role was hurriedly recast, and when Kaufman (as himself) returned to work for the following episode, he acted as if nothing had happened. \n\nSam Simon, a season 5 writer and showrunner for \"Taxi\", revealed in a 2013 interview with Marc Maron for the WTF Podcast that the story of Andy (as opposed to \"Tony Clifton\") having been generally disruptive on the show was \"a complete fiction\" largely created by Bob Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a \"vested interest\" in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was \"completely professional\" and that he \"told you Tony Clifton was him\", but he also conceded that Kaufman would have \"loved\" Zmuda's version of events. However, while many \"Taxi\" staffers have corroborated the story that Clifton was a disruptive presence during his brief time on set, Simon himself had no association with \"Taxi\" during its first season when Clifton made his appearance, and was not a witness to this specific event. Simon did not join \"Taxi\" until two years later, during the series' third season.\n\nClifton (played by Zmuda) appeared once on \"Late Night with David Letterman\", where he was interviewed and sang a medley with the band. In 1982, Clifton also appeared on \"The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show\" as the host's \"new discovery,\" although the other Muppets and host George Hamilton remained skeptical of Clifton's talent. \n\nPerhaps the biggest myth surrounding Tony Clifton's TV appearances comes from Dinah Shore's daytime talk show \"Dinah & Friends\". According to legend Clifton arrived for the taping \"drunk\" and then pressured Shore in front of the studio audience to sing a duet with him although he had been previously told that she had a sore throat. In reality it was a pre-arranged bit, which featured messages from the producers telling the viewers at home that this was a \"put on\". The myth continues that after dumping eggs on Shore's head that the show's producers quickly cut to a commercial as Clifton was escorted out of the studio, and the tape of the incident was \"destroyed\". In reality the footage has been lost and, as with all Kaufman's appearances, the entire event was staged. \n\nTony was also a heckler on Paul Provenzas’ “Green Room” and was escorted out of the room. \n\nIn 2009, Clifton appeared on \"The Opie & Anthony Show\" to promote a performance at Santos Party House in New York City.\n\nKaufman and Zmuda wrote a screenplay for a Tony Clifton biography. However, the plan was sidelined after the box office failure of Kaufman's first major motion picture \"Heartbeeps\", in which he co-starred with Bernadette Peters as a robot who falls in love. In the screenplay Clifton dies at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles from cancer. Five years later, Kaufman died at the same hospital from lung cancer.\n\nClifton is portrayed in the Kaufman biographical film \"Man on the Moon\", credited as \"Himself\".\n\nKaufman's Tony Clifton character has influenced other \"anti-comedy\" acts, notably stand-up comedian Neil Hamburger and singer/comedian Unknown Hinson. Maren Ade's Toni Erdmann, the protagonist in the 2016 Oscar-nominated German movie of the same title, was influenced by Kaufman concerning appearance, humor and first name.\n\n"}

{"id": "373862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=373862", "title": "Video tape recorder", "text": "Video tape recorder\n\nA video tape recorder (VTR) is a tape recorder designed to record and playback video and audio material on magnetic tape. The early VTRs are open-reel devices which record on individual reels of 2-inch-wide (5.08 cm) tape. They were used in television studios, serving as a replacement for motion picture film stock and making recording for television applications cheaper and quicker. Beginning in 1963, videotape machines made instant replay during televised sporting events possible. Improved formats, in which the tape was contained inside a videocassette, were introduced around 1969; the machines which play them are called videocassette recorders. Agreement by Japanese manufacturers on a common standard recording format, so cassettes recorded on one manufacturer's machine would play on another's, made a consumer market possible, and the first consumer videocassette recorder was introduced by Sony in 1971.\n\nIn early 1951 Bing Crosby asked his Chief Engineer John T. (Jack) Mullin if television could be recorded on tape as was the case for audio. Mullin said that he thought that it could be done. Bing asked Ampex to build one and also set up a laboratory for Mullin in Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE) to build one. In 1951 it was believed that if the tape was run at a very high speed it could provide the necessary bandwidth to record the video signal. The problem was that a video signal has a much wider bandwidth than an audio signal does (6 MHz vs 20 kHz), requiring extremely high tape speeds to record it. However, there was another problem. The magnetic head design would not permit bandwidths over 1 meghertz to be recorded regardless of the tape speed.\n\nThe first efforts at video recording, using recorders similar to audio recorders with fixed heads, were unsuccessful. The first such demonstration of this technique was done by BCE on 11 November 1951. The result was a very poor picture. Another of the early efforts was the Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus, a high-speed multi-track machine developed by the BBC in 1952. This machine used a thin steel tape on a 21-inch (53.5 cm) reel traveling at over 200 inches (510 cm) per second. Despite 10 years of research and improvements, it was never widely used due to the immense length of tape required for each minute of recorded video. \n\nBy 1952 BCE also had moved on to multi-track machine, but found limitations in recording bandwidth even at the high speeds. In 1953 BCE discovered that the magnetic head design was the problem. This problem was corrected and bandwidths exceeding the 1 megahertz limit were able to be recorded. Since BCE and AMPEX were working together on the video recorder the new head designed was shared with them, and AMPEX used it in their recorder. In 1955 BCE demonstrated a broadcast quality color recorder that operated at 100 inches per second and CBS ordered three of them. Many other fixed-head recording systems were tried but all required an impractically high tape speed. It became clear that practical video recording technology depended on finding some way of recording the wide-bandwidth video signal without the high tape speed required by linear-scan machines.\n\nIn 1953 Dr. Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype helical scan video tape recorder. Another solution was transverse-scan technology, developed by Ampex around 1954, in which the recording heads are mounted on a spinning drum and record tracks in the transverse direction, across the tape. By recording on the full width of the tape rather than just a narrow track down the center, this technique achieved a much higher density of data per linear centimeter of tape, allowing a lower tape speed of 15 inches per second to be used. The Ampex VRX-1000 became the world's first commercially successful videotape recorder in 1956. It uses the 2\" quadruplex format, using two-inch (5.1 cm) tape. Because of its price, the Ampex VRX-1000 could be afforded only by the television networks and the largest individual stations.\n\nAmpex's quadruplex magnetic tape video recording system has certain limitations, such as the lack of clean pause, or still-frame, capability, because when tape motion is stopped, only a single segment of the picture recording is present at the playback heads (only 16 lines of the picture in each segment), so it can only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape is playing at normal speed.) But in spite of its drawbacks it remained the broadcasting studio standard until about 1980. The helical scan system overcame this limitation.\n\nIn 1959 Toshiba released the first commercial helical-scan video tape recorder. In 1963, Philips introduced its EL3400 1\" helical scan recorder (aimed at the business and domestic user), and Sony marketed the 2\" PV-100, its first open-reel VTR intended for business, medical, airline, and educational use.\n\nThe Telcan, produced by the Nottingham Electronic Valve Company and demonstrated on June 24, 1963, was the first home video recorder. It could be bought as a unit or in kit form for £60. However, there were several drawbacks: it was expensive, not easy to put together, and can record for only 20 minutes at a time in black-and-white.\n\nThe Sony model CV-2000, first marketed in 1965, is their first VTR intended for home use and is based on half-inch tape. Ampex and RCA followed in 1965 with their own open-reel monochrome VTRs priced under US $1,000 for the home consumer market. Prerecorded videos for home replay became available in 1967.\n\nThe EIAJ format is a standard half-inch format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 is an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 uses a cartridge that contains a supply reel, but not the take-up reel. Since the take-up reel is part of the recorder, the tape has to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, which is a relatively slow procedure.\n\nThe development of the videocassette followed other replacements of open-reel systems with a cassette or cartridge in consumer items: the Stereo-Pak 4-track audio cartridge in 1962, the compact audio cassette and Instamatic film cartridge in 1963, the 8-track cartridge in 1965, and the Super 8 home motion picture film cartridge in 1966.\nBefore the invention of the video tape recorder, live video was recorded onto motion picture film stock in a process known as telerecording or kinescoping. Although the first quadruplex VTRs record with good quality, the recordings cannot be slowed or freeze-framed, so kinescoping processes continued to be used for about a decade after the development of the first VTRs.\n\nIn the technique used in all transverse-scan video tape recorders, the recording heads are mounted in a rapidly spinning drum which is pressed against the moving tape, so the heads move across the tape in a transverse or nearly vertical path, recording the video signal in consecutive parallel tracks sideways across the tape. This allows use of the entire width of the tape, storing much more data per inch of tape, compared to the fixed head used in audio tape recording, which records a single track down the tape. The heads move across the tape at the high speed necessary to record the high-bandwidth video signal, but the tape moves at a slower speed through the machine. In addition, three ordinary tracks are recorded along the edge of the tape by stationary recording heads. For correct playback, the motion of the heads has to be precisely synchronized with the motion of the tape through the capstan, so a control track of synchronizing pulses is recorded. The other two tracks are for the audio channel and a cuing track.\n\nThe early machines use the Ampex 2 inch quadruplex system in which the drum has 4 heads and rotates at 14,400 RPM perpendicular to the tape, so the recorded tracks are transverse to the tape axis. With 2-inch tape this requires 16 tracks for a single analog NTSC video frame, or 20 for a PAL frame. \n\nThe helical scan methods use a recording drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so the tape heads, instead of moving across the tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the quadruplex system, move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the tape heads to repeatedly pass over the same track. \n\nThis recording technique has many potential sources of timing errors. If the mechanism runs at an absolutely constant speed, and never varies from moment to moment, or from the time of recording to the time of playback, then the timing of the playback signal is exactly the same as the input. However, imperfection being inevitable, the timing of the playback always differs to some extent from the original signal. Longitudinal error (error arising from effects in the long direction of the tape) can be caused by variations in the rotational rate of the capstan drive, stretching of the tape medium, and jamming of tape in the machine. Transverse error (error arising from effects in the cross-tape direction) can be caused by variations in the rotational speed of the scanning drum and differences in the angle between the tape and the scanning heads (usually addressed by video tracking controls). Longitudinal errors are similar to the ones that cause wow and flutter in audio recordings. Since these errors are not so subtle and since it is standard video recording practice to record a parallel control track, these errors are detected and servos are adjusted accordingly to dramatically reduce this problem.\n\nMany of the deficiencies of the open-reel systems were overcome with the invention of the videocassette recorder (VCR), where the videotape is enclosed in a user-friendly videocassette shell. This subsequently became the most familiar type of VTR known to consumers. In this system, the tape is preattached onto two reels enclosed within the cassette, and tape loading and unloading is automated. There is no need for the user to ever touch the tape, and the media can be protected from dust, dirt, and tape misalignments that can foul the recording mechanism. Typically, the only time the user ever touches the tape in a videocassette is when a failure results from a tape getting stuck in the mechanism.\n\nHome VCRs first became available in the early 1970s, with Philips releasing the Model 1500 in England in 1972. The first system to be notably successful with consumers was Sony's Betamax (or Beta) in 1975. It was soon followed by the competing VHS (Video Home System) format from JVC in 1977 and later by other formats such as Video 2000 from Philips, V-Cord from Sanyo, and Great Time Machine from Quasar.\n\nThe Beta/VHS format war soon began, while the other competitors quickly disappeared. Betamax sales eventually began to dwindle, and after several years VHS emerged as the winner of the format war. In 1988, Sony began to market its own VHS machines, and despite claims that it was still backing Beta, it was clear that the format was no longer viable in most parts of the world. In parts of South America and in Japan, Betamax continued to be popular and was still in production up to the end of 2002.\n\nLater developments saw analog magnetic tapes largely replaced by digital video tape formats. Following this, much of the VTR market, in particular videocassettes and VCRs popular at the consumer level, were also replaced by non-tape media, such as DVD and later Blu-ray optical discs.\n\nVideo tape recorder technologies include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Buggles' hit song \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", the first video ever to air on MTV, contains the lyric \"Put the blame on VTR\".\n\n\n"}

The monologue is a description of a college football game, as seen by a naive country preacher who attends the game by accident and is entirely puzzled by it.\n\nAt Griffith's request, Milton Alderfer (who was only 19 at the time), recorded and produced the original master tape in Greensboro, North Carolina. The master was then sent to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and mass-produced by the Colonial Records label in late 1953. Soon, after Colonial had sold nearly 50,000 copies of the record, Capitol Records took over distribution and ultimately sold nearly 800,000 copies. It also shot into the Top 10 in the Billboard record charts, peaking at #9 in February 1954. \"What It Was...\" (which remains one of the biggest-selling comedy records of all time) was instrumental in launching Griffith's career in television, stage, and film. On the original single, the monologue is credited to \"\"Deacon\" Andy Griffith.\"\n\nGriffith made an appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1954, in large part due to the popularity of the record.\n\n\"What It Was, Was Football\" was printed in \"Mad\" magazine in 1958, with illustrations by artist George Woodbridge. Most of the text of the recording is printed verbatim with faithful renderings of Griffith's accent as heard on the recording; however, Griffith's original climactic description of \"the awfullest fight that I have ever seen...\"in my life!\"\" is moved to an earlier position in the printed version. Also, while the original recording makes no direct reference to a specific university as a setting for the game witnessed, the illustrations in the \"Mad\" version refer to both the Ivy League and University of Notre Dame. Due to licensing issues, this adaptation had to be omitted from the \"Totally MAD\" CD-ROM collection of the magazine's run.\n\nIn 1987, Andy Griffith made an appearance on \"The Tonight Show\" promoting his series, \"Matlock,\" in which he acted out the attorney Benjamin Layton Matlock, one of whose heroes was, presumably, Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason. During the interview, guest host Bill Cosby told Griffith that he had purchased Griffith's recording of \"What It Was, Was Football.\" Cosby then told Griffith that he had performed it at school and received an A for his grade, much to Griffith's surprise and delight.\nIn 1997, the monologue was made into a short film.\n\n"}
