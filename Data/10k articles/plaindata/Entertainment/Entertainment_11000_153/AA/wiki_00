{"id": "30448646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30448646", "title": "3 Minutes", "text": "3 Minutes\n\n3 Minutes is an action-oriented short film that was released on January 10, 2011. Production on the film commenced in 2010, with director Ross Ching at the helm, alongside producers Don Le and George Wang. The film stars Harry Shum, Jr., Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss, Katrina Law, and Thaine Allison Jr. The special effects work was provided by David Adametz and the score composed by Paul Dateh.\n\nThe film centers on the unnamed main character (Harry Shum) receiving a handgun from an old man (Thaine Allison Jr.) and being told he has to complete an unspecified task within three minutes. Shum's character then rushes into a storage yard in pursuit of \"Steve\" (Stephen Boss), who evades Shum's gunshots and hides. Steve finds a dead body (Nicholas Acosta) holding a lightsaber, and uses the weapon to disarm Shum, who draws his own lightsaber. After a short battle, Shum decapitates Steve and runs back to the old man, where he is told that his time was three minutes, eighteen seconds. Shum panics and runs away. A fourth unnamed character (Katrina Law) comes forward and receives a pistol from the old man who repeats his \"three minutes\" instruction. Law's character then leaves the garage, presumably in pursuit of Shum.\n\nThe project is part two of a projected trilogy of short films including a prequel and sequel. The film was originally designed as a vehicle to showcase a wider range of acting skills for the two leads, Harry Shum Jr. and Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss, especially outside of the singing and dancing sphere. \"3 Minutes\" has received coverage from the official Star Wars site, Wired.com, and Gizmodo, as well as the \"New York Post\", \"Seventeen\" magazine, \"Audrey\" magazine, and \"Hyphen\" magazine. It was also featured on Vimeo's Staff Pick of the Day on its debut day.\n\n"}
{"id": "5729303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5729303", "title": "Analog high-definition television system", "text": "Analog high-definition television system\n\nAnalog high-definition television was an analog video broadcast television system developed in the 1930s to replace early experimental systems with as few as 12-lines. On 2 November 1936 the BBC began transmitting the world's first public regular analog high-definition television service from the Victorian Alexandra Palace in north London. It therefore claims to be the birthplace of television broadcasting as we know it today. John Logie Baird, Philo T. Farnsworth, and Vladimir Zworykin had each developed competing TV systems, but resolution was not the issue that separated their substantially different technologies, it was patent interference lawsuits and deployment issues given the tumultuous financial climate of the late 1920s and 1930s.\n\nMost patents were expiring by the end of World War II leaving no worldwide standard for television. The standards introduced in the early 1950s stayed for over half a century.\n\nWhen Europe resumed TV transmissions after WWII (i.e. in the late 1940s and early 1950s) most countries standardized on a 576i (625-line) television system. The two exceptions were the British 405-line system, which had already been introduced in 1936, and the French 819-line system. During the 1940s René Barthélemy already reached 1015-lines and even 1042-lines. On November 20, 1948, François Mitterrand, the then Secretary of State for Information, decreed a broadcast standard of 819-lines developed by Henri de France; broadcasting began at the end of 1949 in this definition.\n\nThis was arguably the world's first high-definition television system, and, by today's standards, it could be called 737i (as it had 737-lines active) with a maximum theoretical resolution of 408×368-line pairs (which in digital terms can be expressed as equivalent to 816×736 pixels) with a 4:3 aspect ratio (and thus a slightly wide effective \"pixel aspect ratio\" of 6:5, square pixel recording needing approx 980x736 instead). It was used only in France by TF1, and in Monaco by Tele Monte Carlo. However, the theoretical picture quality far exceeded the capabilities of the equipment of its time, and each 819-line channel occupied a wide 14 MHz of VHF bandwidth.\n\nBy comparison, the modern 720p standard is 1280×720 pixels, of which the 4:3 portion would be 960×720 pixels, while PAL DVDs have a resolution of 720×576 pixels.\n\nTelevision channels were arranged as follows:\n\nTechnical specifications of the broadcast television systems used with 819-lines.\n\nSystem E implementation provided very good (near HDTV) picture quality but with an uneconomical use of bandwidth; a 625/50 signal providing the same clarity as an 819-line image, but matted down 4:3 with the same number of lines, would still need nearly 6mhz for the vision carrier alone (vs typical 5 to 6mhz in actual use), and 5mhz for 525/60 (vs typical 4.2mhz), although a 405/50 transmission could get away with only 2.5mhz (typical \"3mhz\", as System A made no allowance for the Kell factor and thus had a \"narrow pixel\"/\"tall line\" appearance). Thus even an unusually crisp \"standard\" definition (or slightly soft 405-line) image only needed half, or even one-quarter the vision bandwidth of the 819-line system to give a \"balanced\" appearance, despite their lower overall resolution still seeming perfectly clear on the more affordable small-screen receivers often used in the pre-color era. With the usual additions of sound carrier and vestigial sideband the result was a combined signal that demanded approximately two to three times the bandwidth of more moderately specified standards, even when colour was added to them (as the color subcarrier resides \"within\" the luma signal space).\n\nSystem F was an adapted 819-line system used in Belgium and Luxembourg as an answer to this problem, with only half the vision bandwidth and approximately half the sound carrier offset. It allowed French 819-line programming to squeeze into the 7 MHz VHF broadcast channels used in those neighbouring countries, albeit with a substantial loss of horizontal resolution (408×737 effective, with what would now be considered extra-wide 12:5 aspect ratio pixels); although this still offered approximately twice the actual clarity of 405-line System A (twice the lines, roughly the same horizontal definition), the contrast between vertical and horizontal resolution would have made it seem perceptually worse. Use of System F was discontinued in Belgium in February 1968, and in Luxembourg in September 1971.\n\nDespite some attempts to create a color SECAM version of the 819-line system (which would have then also had the highest pre-HDTV colour signal resolution, with lines of FM encoding alternately centred on 8.82 and 8.5mhz, if arranged similarly to 625-line SECAM), France abandoned it in favor of the Europe-wide standard of 625-lines (576i50), with the final 819-line transmissions from Paris in 1984. TMC in Monaco were the last broadcasters to transmit 819-line television, closing down their System E transmitter in 1985.\n\nHowever, between 1976 and 1981 when French channel TF1 was switching area by area to the new analog 625-lines UHF network with SECAM color, some transmitters and gapfillers broadcast the 819-line signal in UHF. When switching to 625-lines, most gapfillers did not change UHF channel (e.g. many gapfillers using this transmission located in French Alps near Grenoble, Mont Salève and Geneva began broadcasting on UHF channel 42, and continue to use this frequency to this day). They were switched to 625-lines in June 1981.\n\nJapan had the earliest working HDTV system, with design efforts going back to 1979. The country began broadcasting wideband analog high-definition video signals in the late 1980s using an interlaced resolution of 1035 or 1080-lines active (\"1035i\") or 1125-lines total supported by the Sony HDVS line of equipment.\n\nThe Japanese system, developed by NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories in the 1980s, employed filtering tricks to reduce the original source signal to decrease bandwidth utilization. MUSE was marketed as \"Hi-Vision\" by NHK.\n\n\nIn the typical setup, three picture elements on a line were actually derived from three separate scans. Stationary images were transmitted at full resolution. However, as MUSE lowers the horizontal and vertical resolution of material that varies greatly from frame to frame, moving images were blurred in a manner similar to using 16 mm movie film for HDTV projection. In fact, whole-camera pans would result in a loss of 50% of horizontal resolution.\n\nMUSE's \"1125-lines\" are an analog measurement, which includes non-video \"scan lines\" during which a CRT's electron beam returns to the top of the screen to begin scanning the next field. Only 1035-lines have picture information. Digital signals count only the lines (rows of pixels) of the picture makeup as there are no other scanning lines (though conversion to an analogue format will introduce them), so NTSC's 525-lines become 480i, and MUSE would be 1035i.\n\nShadows and multipath still plague this analog frequency modulated transmission mode.\n\nConsidering the technological limitations of the time, MUSE was a very cleverly designed analog system.\nThough Japan has since switched to a digital HDTV system based on ISDB, the original MUSE-based BS Satellite channel 9 (NHK BS Hi-vision) was still being broadcast . It broadcast the same programs as BS-digital channel 103, but transmission ended on November 30, 2007.\n\nSubsampling lives on in modern MPEG systems based on JPEG coding, as JPEG offers Chroma sub-sampling. High quality HD television has a sampling structure approximating 4:2:1 (Luma : Chroma : Saturation) for reference images (I-Frames), though 4:0.75:0.65 is probably typical for multi-channel delivery.\n\nHD-MAC was a proposed television standard by the European Commission in 1986 (MAC standard) . It was an early attempt by the EEC to provide HDTV in Europe. It was a complex mix of analog signal (Multiplexed Analog Components) multiplexed with digital sound. The video signal (1250 (1152 visible) lines/50 frames in aspect ratio) was encoded with a modified D2-MAC encoder.\n\nIn the 1992 Summer Olympics experimental HD-MAC broadcasting took place. 100 HD-MAC receivers (in that time, retroprojectors) in Europe were used to test the capabilities of the standard. This project was financed by the European Union (EU). The PAL-converted signal was used by mainstream broadcasters such as SWR, BR and 3Sat.\n\nThe HD-MAC standard was abandoned in 1993, and since then all EU and EBU efforts have focused on the DVB system (\"Digital Video Broadcasting\"), which allows both SDTV and HDTV.\n\nThe analog TV systems these systems were meant to replace\n\nRelated standards\n\n\n<br>\n"}

He led the school of Soviet and Russian humorists for about half a century.\n\nRaikin was born into a Jewish family in Riga, in the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire (present-day Latvia). He graduated from the Leningrad Theatrical Technicum in 1935 and worked in both state theatres and variety shows. In 1939, he founded his own theatre in Leningrad, where he used skits and impersonations to ridicule the inefficiency of Communist bureaucracy and the Soviet way of life. In the Stalinist police state this was prone to danger, as it was not uncommon to get purged not only for telling a casual joke, but even for not reporting it to the authorities. He also appeared in several comedies during and after the Great Patriotic War.\nRaikin was the creator of a whole array of unforgettable satirical characters, and a living legend of his time and his country. Some of the brilliant satirical and lyrical images created by Raikin acquired their second life in the serial TV film \"People and Mannequins\".\n\nRaikin is often compared with Charlie Chaplin. His fame in the Soviet Union, and throughout Central and Eastern Europe, was such that he was invited to participate in the opening night of BBC Two television in 1964, although the broadcast had to be postponed for one day due to a power failure. His trip to London for the BBC broadcast—during which he was reunited with his British cousin, distinguished pianist Bruno Raikin—marked the first of only two times when the Soviet government permitted him to perform in the West. Arkady Raikin also maintained good working relationships with Marcel Marceau and some other foreign actors.\n\nThree years before his death, Raikin finally moved to Moscow, where he opened the Satyricon Theatre, now run by his son Konstantin Raikin, also an acclaimed actor. His wife, Roma, played a major role in guiding his career, and his daughter, Ekaterina, also had a successful career as a Moscow actress. For a month during the summer of 1987, Raikin hosted his American cousin, Washington D.C. attorney Steven Raikin, as a guest in his Moscow flat. In September 1987 the Soviet Ministry of Culture finally permitted Raikin to visit the United States, where, with his son and daughter, he gave emotional farewell performances in several cities to adoring audiences of Russian émigrés.\n\nRaikin was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR in 1968, the Lenin Prize in 1980, and the Hero of Socialist Labour award in 1981.\n\nA minor planet 4518 Raikin discovered on 1 April 1976, is named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "231159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231159", "title": "Bloomsday", "text": "Bloomsday\n\nBloomsday is a commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer James Joyce, observed annually in Dublin and elsewhere on 16 June, the day his novel \"Ulysses\" takes place in 1904, the date of his first outing with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle, and named after its protagonist Leopold Bloom.\n\nThe English compound word \"Bloomsday\" is usually used in Irish as well, though some publications call it .\n\nThe first mention of such a celebration is to be found in a letter by Joyce to Miss Weaver of 27 June 1924, which refers to \"a group of people who observe what they call Bloom's day – 16 June\".\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the events in the novel, in 1954, John Ryan (artist, critic, publican and founder of \"Envoy\" magazine) and the novelist Brian O'Nolan organised what was to be a daylong pilgrimage along the \"Ulysses\" route. They were joined by Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Tom Joyce (a dentist who, as Joyce's cousin, represented the family interest) and AJ Leventhal (a lecturer in French at Trinity College, Dublin). Ryan had engaged two horse-drawn cabs, of the old-fashioned kind, in which in \"Ulysses\" Mr. Bloom and his friends drive to Paddy Dignam's funeral. The party were assigned roles from the novel. Cronin stood in for Stephen Dedalus, O’Nolan for his father Simon Dedalus, John Ryan for the journalist Martin Cunningham, and A.J. Leventhal, being Jewish, was recruited to fill (unknown to himself according to John Ryan) the role of Leopold Bloom. They planned to travel round the city through the day, starting at the Martello tower at Sandycove (where the novel begins), visiting in turn the scenes of the novel, ending at night in what had once been the brothel quarter of the city, the area which Joyce had called Nighttown. The pilgrimage was abandoned halfway through, when the weary pilgrims succumbed to inebriation and rancour at the Bailey pub in the city centre, which Ryan then owned, and at which in 1967 he installed the door to No. 7 Eccles Street (Leopold Bloom's front door), having rescued it from demolition. A Bloomsday record of 1954, informally filmed by John Ryan, follows this pilgrimage.\n\nThe day involves a range of cultural activities, including \"Ulysses\" readings and dramatisations, pub crawls and other events, some of it hosted by the James Joyce Centre in North Great George's Street. Enthusiasts often dress in Edwardian costume to celebrate Bloomsday, and retrace Bloom's route around Dublin via landmarks such as Davy Byrne's pub. Hard-core devotees have even been known to hold marathon readings of the entire novel, some lasting up to 36 hours.\n\nThe James Joyce Tower and Museum at Sandycove, site of the opening chapter of \"Ulysses\", hosts many free activities around Bloomsday including theatrical performances, musical events, tours of the iconic tower and readings from Joyce's masterpiece.\n\"Every year hundreds of Dubliners dress as characters from the book ... as if to assert their willingness to become one with the text. It is quite impossible to imagine any other masterpiece of modernism having quite such an effect on the life of a city.\"\n\nOn Bloomsday 1982, the centenary year of Joyce's birth, Irish state broadcaster RTÉ transmitted a continuous 30-hour dramatic performance of the entire text of \"Ulysses\" on radio.\n\nA five-month-long festival, ReJoyce Dublin 2004, took place in Dublin between 1 April and 31 August 2004. On the Sunday before the 100th \"anniversary\" of the fictional events described in the book, 10,000 people in Dublin were treated to a free, open-air, full Irish breakfast on O'Connell Street consisting of sausages, rashers, toast, beans, and black and white puddings.\n\nThe 2006 Bloomsday festivities were cancelled, the day coinciding with the funeral of Charles Haughey.\n\nBloomsday has also been celebrated since 1994 in the Hungarian town of Szombathely, the fictional birthplace of Leopold Bloom's father, Virág Rudolf, an emigrant Hungarian Jew. The event is usually centred on the Iseum – the remnants of an Isis temple there from Roman times – and the Blum-mansion, commemorated to Joyce since 1997, at 40–41 Fő street, which used to be the property of an actual Jewish family called Blum. Hungarian author László Najmányi in his 2007 novel, \"The Mystery of the Blum-mansion\" (A Blum-ház rejtélye) describes the results of his research on the connection between Joyce and the Blum family.\n\nWashington, D.C. – The Georgetown Neighborhood Library, located at 3260 R Street, NW, in Washington, D.C. held a marathon dramatic reading of \"Ulysses\" beginning 9 June and concluding on 16 June 2014 (Bloomsday). Twenty-five writers, actors, and scholars read \"Ulysses\" aloud in its entirety, a project which took more than 33 hours. The reading concluded with opera singer Laura Baxter performing Molly Bloom's soliloquy in its entirety, a feat taking 2 1/2 hours by itself.\n\nPhiladelphia – The Rosenbach Museum & Library is home to Joyce's handwritten manuscript of \"Ulysses\". The museum first celebrated Bloomsday in 1992, with readings by actors and scholars at the Border's Bookstore in Center City. The following 16 June, it began the tradition of closing the 2000-block of Delancey Street for a Bloomsday street festival. In addition to dozens of readers, often including Philadelphia's mayor, singers from the Academy of Vocal Arts perform songs that are integral to the novel's plot. Traditional Irish cuisine is provided by local Irish-themed pubs. In 2014, the Rosenbach's Bloomsday festival went on the road, with two hours of readings at the main branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia, an hour of readings at Rittenhouse Square, and concluded with five hours of readings on the steps of the museum, at 2008–10 Delancey Street.\n\nNew York City has several events on Bloomsday including formal readings at Symphony Space and informal readings and music at the downtown Ulysses' Folk House pub. The Irish American Bar Association of New York celebrates Joyce's contribution to the First Amendment, with an annual keynote speech named after John Quinn, the Irish-American lawyer who defended Joyce's New York publishers in their obscenity trial in 1922. In 2014, New York celebrated Bloomsday with \"Bloomsday on Broadway,\" which includes famous actors reading excerpts of the books, and commentators explaining the work between segments. The 2016 celebration includes a juried competition for the Best Dressed Molly and Leopold Bloom, selected from among attendees by a blue-ribbon panel including image strategist Margaret Molloy several design figures.\n\nLos Angeles, California-Each year Bloomsday is celebrated at the Hammer Museum with readings, music and libations.\n\nKansas City, Missouri – the Irish Center of Kansas City currently hosts the Bloomsday celebration, started at Bloomsday Books, KCMO in 1995. Usually a day long event, the Center hosts readers of Ulysses, screens a documentary, and sponsors a play, punctuating the Joycean word with Irish dancers and a performance by Dublin balladeer Eddie Delahunt. This has been an annual event since its inception.\n\nSyracuse, New York – The Syracuse James Joyce Club holds an annual Bloomsday celebration at Johnston's BallyBay Pub, at which large portions of the book are either read aloud, or presented as dramatisations by costumed performers. The club awards scholarships and other prizes to students who have written essays on Joyce or fiction pertaining to his work. The city is home to Syracuse University, whose press has published or reprinted several volumes of Joyce studies.\n\nDetroit, Michigan – There was a marathon reading of Joyce's \"Ulysses\" on 15 June 2013, at Casey's Pub in the Historic Corktown neighbourhood.\n\nLos Angeles – The Hammer Museum hosts an annual Bloomsday celebration including: live Irish music, a Guinness happy hour, a public reading of the \"Lestrygonians\" episode, and a dramatic reading of \"Sirens\".\n\nCleveland, Ohio – The Nighttown Restaurant/Jazz Club holds an annual read of the novel on Bloomsday as well performed by local enthusiasts.\n\nWichita, Kansas – Bloomsday is honoured by a presentation on James Joyce (often by Dr. Marguerite Regan) as well as readings from \"Ulysses\" and Irish folk music, sponsored by the Wichita Irish Cultural Association.\n\nNorfolk, Virginia – The Irish American Society of Tidewater, Virginia, held a Bloomsday Happy Hour at Smartmouth Brewery, on Saturday, 14 June 2014. Live Irish music was provided by the band Glasgow Kiss, and IAS members attended dressed in Joycean accessories (fedoras, round glasses, eye patches, etc.).\n\nPortland, Maine – Readings from \"Ulysses\" at the Irish Heritage Center, corner of Gray and State Streets.\n\nPortland, Oregon - Powell's Books hosts a reading of the novel in its entirety for the duration of the day by authors, volunteers, and other Joyce lovers.\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts - long running annual celebration with readings from Ulysses at 7 sites around the city. Organized annually by the Worcester County Poetry Association.\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma - The Oklahoma Center for the Humanities, Booksmart Tulsa, and the Guthrie Green hold an annual Bloomsday Pub Crawl in the Brady Arts District of downtown Tulsa. Each stop on the pub crawl is typically accompanied by live readings from or performances of selections from \"Ulysses\".\n\nPhoenix, Arizona - the Irish Cultural Center and McClelland Library pull out all the stops to commemorate \"Ulysses\", the famous novel of Irish author, James Joyce, during its Annual Bloomin’ Beerfest. The festival includes live Irish music, a costume contest – come dressed as your favorite character from the novel or from the time period - musical selections based on the novel in the library, and live readings from the groundbreaking and scandalous novel Ulysses. The beerfest typically showcases a great selection of Local Craft, Irish and Scottish Beers and a souvenir Bloomsday tasting cup.\n\nThere have been many Bloomsday events in Trieste, where the first part of \"Ulysses\" was written. The Joyce Museum Trieste, opened on 16 June 2004, collects works by and about James Joyce, including secondary sources, with a special emphasis on his period in Trieste.\n\nSince 2005 Bloomsday has been celebrated every year in Genoa, with a reading of \"Ulysses\" in Italian by volunteers (students, actors, teachers, scholars), starting at 0900 and finishing in the early hours of 17 June; the readings take place in 18 different places in the old town centre, one for each chapter of the novel, and these places are selected for their resemblance to the original settings. Thus for example chapter 1 is read in a medieval tower, chapter 2 in a classroom of the Faculty of Languages, chapter 3 in a bookshop on the waterfront, chapter 9 in the University Library, and chapter 12 (\"Cyclops\") in an old pub. The Genoa Bloomsday is organised by the Faculty of Languages and the International Genoa Poetry Festival.\n\nIn Sydney, Bloomsday is hosted by the John Hume Institute for Global Irish Studies UNSW in association with the National Irish Association Sydney and the Consulate General of Ireland, Sydney.\n\nBloomsday in Melbourne has a proud history of engagement with the work of James Joyce. Since 1994, a small committee of Joyceans has read and re-read Joyce and mounted theatrical events designed to communicate the joy of Joyce to its loyal patrons.\n\nBloomsday commenced in Auckland in the year 2000 with a radio transmission of Ulysses on Access Radio from midnight to 6am, June 16 — the first Bloomsday celebration of the new millennium anywhere in the world. A cabaret show with Linn Lorkin and the Jews Brothers Band followed next year, 2001, and there has been a Jews Brothers Bloomsday ever since on June 16, with Brooklyn musician Hershal Herscher as a Woody Allen Bloom and Dublin actor Brian Keagan reading from Ulysses. Currently this three-hour show is hosted by the Thirsty Dog, on Karangahape Rd. Guest Molly Blooms have included top NZ performers Robyn Malcolm, Noelle McCarthy, Carmel McGlone, Lucy Lawless, Geraldine Brophy and Jennifer Ward-Lealand.\n\nA five-day Bloomsday festival has been celebrated in Montreal since 2012 with readings, academic workshops, films, concerts and musical galas, cabarets, walking tours of Irish Montreal, Irish pub events, and guest lectures by internationally known Ulysses experts. Major partners include the Concordia School for Canadian Irish Studies, McGill University Continuing Education, The Jewish Public Library, Westmount and Atwater Libraries.\n\nBloomsday has been celebrated annually since 1993 in Prague, near the grove with a pond (an unrelated monolith was erected near the place several years ago) just below the Strahov Monastery.\n\nBBC Radio Four devoted most of its broadcasting on 16 June 2012, to a dramatisation of \"Ulysses\", with additional comments from critic Mark Lawson talking to Joyce scholars. In the dramatisation, Molly Bloom was played by Niamh Cusack, Leopold Bloom by Henry Goodman, Stephen Daedalus by Andrew Scott, and the Narrator was Stephen Rea.\n\nThe Paris Bloomsday Group (five Paris-based Irish Joyceans) performs texts and songs from the work of James Joyce in such Parisian venues as the Irish Embassy, the Centre Culturel Irlandais or the American Library in Paris. Performances are in English with brief forays into French, Italian, Latin and Greek.\n\nOn Bloomsday 2011, \"@Ulysses\" was the stage for an experimental day-long tweeting of \"Ulysses\". Starting at 0800 (Dublin time) on Thursday 16 June 2011, the aim was to explore what would happen if \"Ulysses\" was recast 140 characters at a time. It was hoped that the event would become the first of a series.\n\nIn 2004, Vintage Publishers issued \"Yes I said yes I will yes: A Celebration of James Joyce, Ulysses, and 100 Years of Bloomsday\". It is one of the few monographs that details the increasing popularity of Bloomsday. The book's title comes from the novel's famous last lines.\n\nIn 1956, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath were married by special licence of the Archbishop of Canterbury at St George the Martyr Church, Holborn, on 16 June, in honour of Bloomsday.\n\nPat Conroy's 2009 novel \"South of Broad\" has numerous references to Bloomsday. Leopold Bloom King is the narrator. The book's first chapter describes the events of 16 June 1969 in Leo's story.\n\nIn the novel by Enrique Vila-Matas \"Dublinesca\" (2010), part of the action takes place in Dublin for the Bloomsday. The book's main protagonist, Riba, a retired Spanish editor, moves to this city with several writer friends to officiate a \"funeral\" for the Gutenberg era.\n\nIn Mel Brooks' 1968 film \"The Producers\", Gene Wilder's character is called Leo Bloom, an homage to Joyce's character. In the musical 2005 version, in the evening scene at the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, Leo asks, \"When will it be Bloom's day?\". However, in the earlier scene in which Bloom first meets Max Bialystock, the office wall calendar shows that the current day is 16 June, indicating that it is, in fact, Bloomsday.\n\nPunk band Minutemen have a song on their 1984 \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" album entitled \"June 16th\", which is named after Bloomsday.\n\nRichard Linklater alludes to \"Ulysses\" in two of his films. In 1991's \"Slacker\", a character reads an excerpt from \"Ulysses\" after convincing his friends to dump a tent and a typewriter in a river as a response to a prior lover's infidelity. The film also takes place over a 24-hour period. In 1995's \"Before Sunrise\", events take place on 16 June.\n\nA 2009 episode of the cartoon \"The Simpsons\", \"In the Name of the Grandfather\", featured the family's trip to Dublin and Lisa's reference to Bloomsday.\nU2's 2009 song \"Breathe\" refers to events taking place on a fictitious 16 June.\n\nOn Bloomsday 2014, it was announced that the chemist shop Swenys on Lombard Street, at which Bloom called to buy lotion for his wife, might soon close.\n\n\n\n"}

Based in Paris, the archive offers daily screenings of worldwide films.\n\nThe collection emerged from the efforts of Henri Langlois and Lotte H Eisner in the mid 1930s to collect and screen films. Langlois had acquired one of the largest collections in the world by the beginning of World War II, only to have it nearly wiped out by the German authorities in occupied France, who ordered the destruction of all films made prior to 1937. He and his friends smuggled huge numbers of documents and films out of occupied France to protect them until the end of the war.\n\nAfter the war, the French government provided a small screening room, staff and subsidy for the collection, which was first relocated to the Avenue de Messine. Significant French filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s, including Robert Bresson, René Clément, Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jacques Becker frequented screenings at the Cinémathèque. Directors of the New Wave (\"la Nouvelle Vague\") school — Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Roger Vadim, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Pierre Kast — also received much of their film education by attending the collection's screenings.\n\nIn June 1963, the Cinémathèque had moved to the Palais de Chaillot with funds provided by André Malraux, Minister of Culture, and became subject to the government. In February 1968, under pressure from the Ministry of Finance, Malraux required changes in the management of the Cinémathèque and dismissed Henri Langlois.\n\nA defence committee was formed, uniting the cream of French filmmakers (Alexandre Astruc, Claude Berri, Robert Bresson, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Jean Eustache, Georges Franju, Abel Gance, Jean-Luc Godard, Joris Ivens, Pierre Kast, Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, Jean Rouch, François Truffaut) together with major actors (Jean-Pierre Léaud, Claude Jade, Jean Marais and Françoise Rosay). Foreign filmmakers such as Charles Chaplin and Stanley Kubrick added their support. Protests were organized.\n\nConfrontations followed between young people, largely students, and what they saw as an authoritarian centre-right government, out of touch with the concerns of the younger generation. These demonstrations were precursors of and merged into the widespread student revolt that erupted from March 1968 onwards, escalating into nationwide unrest in May. Before then, the government had backed down over the Cinémathèque, reinstating Langlois as head in April 1968.\n\nAfter numerous incidents — including multiple relocations from one small screening room to another through the 1950s and a fire in its last premises — the Cinémathèque Française moved to 51, rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement of Paris and reopened its doors in a postmodern building designed by Frank Gehry, an American architect. A restaurant on the lower level is open to the public.\n\nThe Bibliothèque du Film, which was created in 1992 to show the history of cinema, its production, impact and artistic strength, has recently merged with the Cinémathèque Française.\n\nCinémathèque Française operates the Musée de la Cinémathèque, formerly known as Musée du Cinéma – Henri Langlois, in the new building.\n\n\nIn celebration of the Centennial of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum and the City Center of Music and Drama in New York co-sponsored \"Cinémathèque at the Metropolitan Museum.\" The exhibition showed seventy films dating from the medium's first seventy-five years on thirty-five consecutive evenings from July 29 to September 3, 1970. The films were selected by Henri Langlois for their significance and contributions to the history of filmmaking, including work from official film industries as well as current and early avant garde directors. The program was the most diverse film exhibition held in the United States to date, and was the Museum's first major undertaking in film.\n\nThe Cinémathèque's closing is noted in Truffaut's \"Stolen Kisses\". The Cinémathèque also appears in the Paul Auster novel \"The Book of Illusions\" and the Harvey Danger song \"Private Helicopter.\"\n\nThe Cinématèque and the events surrounding the dismissal of Henri Langlois in 1968 features heavily in Gilbert Adair's Novel \"The Holy Innocents\" also known as \"The Dreamers\" and in its film adaptation by Bernardo Bertolucci.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was devised by Gerard Frow, Alan Strachan and Wendy Toye. A book, also titled \"Cowardy Custard\", was published in connection with the revue, similarly celebrating the Coward image.\n\nThe biographical revue premiered in London in 1972, running for 405 performances. A revised version toured in the UK in 2011.\n\nThe term \"cowardy custard\" is a taunt used by children in the UK equivalent to \"scaredy cat\" in the US.\n\nThe working title of the show was \"Cream of Coward\", but Coward cabled the producers three months before the opening from his home in Jamaica suggesting \"Cowardy Custard\". He vetoed an alternative suggestion, \"This Is Noël Coward\", which he said was too close to \"This \"Was\" Noël Coward\".\n\nTelling the story of Coward's life through song and biographical snippets, the revue was billed as \"An entertainment featuring the words and music of Noël Coward\". The Coward numbers featured are songs and scenes from Coward's works of the 1920s to the 1960s, including \"You were there\", \"Mad About the Boy\"; \"The Stately Homes of England\", \"I Wonder What Happened to Him?\" and, perhaps most memorably, \"Marvellous Party\" (sung by Patricia Routledge in the original production). The revue also contains previously unpublished material, excerpts of plays and dialogues, material from Coward's autobiographies and some of his poems. Sketches featured include scenes from \"Shadow Play\".\n\nThe original production opened at the Mermaid Theatre, London, on 10 July 1972 as part of the 1972 City of London Festival and ran for over a year for a total of 405 performances. It was directed by Wendy Toye and employed a cast of twelve (six men and six women), featuring Routledge, Derek Waring, John Moffatt, Elaine Delmar, Una Stubbs, Jonathan Cecil, Peter Gale, Anna Sharkey, Geoffrey Burridge, Laurel Ford, Tudor Davies and Olivia Breeze. The musical director was John Burrows. After its run in London, the show toured the UK with different cast members. It has since been produced by amateur groups. Also in 1972, a revue on similar lines, \"Oh, Coward!,\" played in New York at the New Theatre, achieving 294 performances.\n\nA recording of the original London production of \"Cowardy Custard\" was made by RCA. The production also spawned a book called \"Cowardy Custard: The World of Noël Coward\".\n\nA new version of the show, revised by Strachan, was toured in the UK in spring 2011, starring Dillie Keane and Kit and The Widow, with Stuart Neal and Savannah Stevenson. It included unpublished material and excerpts from Coward's diaries and memoirs, as well as the songs and scenes. Charles Spencer in \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote, \"This loving tribute to Noël Coward … now revised for a smaller cast ... is a classy delight … from Dillie Keane's hilariously hooting, rubber-legged drunk-act during 'I've Been to a Marvellous Party' ... to Kit Hesketh-Harvey's amazing hip-swivelling during the Latin American number 'Nina'.\"\n\nFrom Mermaid Theatre programme, 10 July 1972 and sleeve notes to cast recording, RCA SER 5656/57. Numbers marked * were retained in the 2011 revival (with additional numbers listed below)\n\n\n\nIn addition to the numbers marked with an asterisk above, the 2011 revival of the show featured:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50731741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50731741", "title": "Dead by Daylight", "text": "Dead by Daylight\n\nDead by Daylight is an asymmetric survival horror game developed and published by Behaviour Interactive. \"Dead by Daylight\" was released on the Microsoft Windows operating system in June 2016, and released on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One home consoles in June 2017. The game is played exclusively as a one versus four (1 v. 4) online multiplayer where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught and sacrificed to the Entity.\n\nAmong a handful of original Characters, the game also includes unlockable and downloadable (DLC) Characters. Characters from the \"Halloween\", \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", and \"Saw\" horror franchises are featured.\n\nA spiritual successor, Identity V, developed by NetEase and co-developed by Behaviour Interactive, was released for mobile devices in China in early 2018, and was released worldwide in July 2018.\n\nA group of up to four Survivors must elude one Killer. The Survivors' perspectives are third-person, while the Killer's perspective is first-person.\n\nPlayers assume the role of one of the 14 Survivors, Dwight Fairfield, Meg Thomas, Claudette Morel, Jake Park, Nea Karlsson, Laurie Strode, William 'Bill' Overbeck, Ace Visconti, Feng Min, David King, Quentin Smith, David Tapp, Kate Denson, Adam Francis or Jeff Johansen. The goal of the Survivors is to escape the enclosed area, which can be done in one of two ways: either by repairing a certain number of disabled Generators (always one Generator more than the amount of Survivors that spawned into the trial) to provide power to the switch boxes of two Exit Gates leading out of the trial grounds; or by escaping through the Hatch. The Hatch appears when the number of repaired Generators exceeds the number of Survivors that are still alive by one, and opens only when there is only one Survivor remaining in the trial. The Survivors will need a key to open the Hatch if there are more than one person alive. The Survivor's movement options consist of sprinting, walking, crouch-walking or crawling. They must elude the Killer by losing their line of sight in a chase or by successfully hiding from them.\n\nAs the Killer, players assume the role of either the Trapper, the Wraith, the Hillbilly, the Nurse, the Shape, the Hag, the Doctor, the Huntress, the Cannibal, the Nightmare, the Pig, the Clown, the Spirit or the Legion. Most Killers only have one form of locomotion, moving at a fast pace, which is moderately faster than the pace of a sprinting Survivor. When hunting the Survivors, the Killer must capture them by either striking them twice with their Weapon (the first hit reduces the Survivor to the Injured State and pushes them a short distance ahead of the Killer, while the second hit drops them to crawling on the ground) or grabbing them in one move by either catching them inside Lockers, while attempting to vault over Pallets or through Windows (these work only when the Survivor is injured), while repairing a Generator, trying to rescue a fellow Survivor from a Hook or attempting to escape through the Hatch. Some Killers have secondary attacks that deal double-damage and put Survivors into the Dying State in one strike.\n\nThe Killer's goal is to sacrifice Survivors to the Entity, a malevolent being which rules over the Realm in which Dead by Daylight takes place. Caught Survivors are put onto Meathooks located throughout the trial grounds, which starts the sacrifice process, which will take 2 minutes to complete without any outside influences. Some special Add-ons, Perks or the 'Memento Mori' Offerings allow the Killer to bypass the sacrifice process and kill a Survivor directly, with a special animation.\n\nThe first time a Survivor is hooked, they enter the first phase. In this phase only, the Survivor can try for a low (4 %) chance of escaping from the Hook at the cost of tremendously accelerating the sacrifice process upon failure to escape. Hooked Survivors can also be rescued by fellow Survivors. If the Survivor escapes or is saved and eventually hooked a second time, they will enter the 'struggle phase', in which the Survivor has to resist the Entity trying to stab them by rapidly pressing the Spacebar, X, or A, depending on the platform, until they are either saved by an ally or killed by the 'Entity'. If the Survivor is saved during the 'struggle phase' and is hooked a third time, they will die instantly with no opportunity of survival.\n\nThe Killer, despite walking at a fast pace, is slower than Survivors in most other movements: after striking a Survivor, the Killer will slow their movement to wipe the blood off of their Weapon. The Killer is also slower in vaulting through Windows and cannot leap over Pallets Survivors can throw down into their path, but instead have to go around the spot or spend some time destroying them.\n\nThe Killer also has an Aura-reading ability, constantly revealing the location of Generators, Hex Totems and in case of carrying a Survivor, Hooks across the Map. A new mechanic was added in Patch 1.5.0, which introduced 'Bloodlust'. 15 seconds into a chase, the Killer receives a boost of 0.2 m/s to their base movement speed; 30 seconds into a chase grants the Killer a 0.4 m/s boost; and finally, if a chase lasts for 45 consecutive seconds, the Killer receives a 0.6 m/s boost. Bloodlust only lasts until a chase ends after which the movement speed boost will degrade at a rate of 10 % per second spent not chasing a Survivor, with breaking a Pallet or injuring a Survivor instantly removing it completely.\n\nSurvivors and Killers each have the option to utilise up to four Perks in their load-out, that give their Characters special abilities. Each Survivor starts off with a set of three Perks that are unique to them and must first be unlocked before the other Survivors can use them. There are also Perks that can be obtained by any Character, such as Kindred, Small Game, etc. These perks can be unlocked and upgraded in the Bloodweb using Bloodpoints and each Bloodweb can only hold up to two perks. These perks can range from giving a burst of speed when running from the Killer, to being able to self-heal without a first aid kit, to unlocking the ability to sabotage meat hooks without a toolbox. There are also a multitude of 'universal' perks that are available to unlock by any Survivor.\n\nIn dealing with the Killer, Survivors can also make use of a handful of Items – searching Chests inside buildings will sometimes yield Med-Kits (which allow the Survivors to heal themselves rather than wait for a teammate), Flashlights (which can be used to temporarily blind the Killer and rescue a Survivor that the Killer is carrying), Toolboxes (which can be used both to repair Generators faster and to temporarily sabotage Hooks and Bear Traps), Keys (do a variety of things depending on their Add-ons and may be used to open the Hatch), Maps (which track objectives and reveal their Auras). One resource that Survivors can use are massive wooden Pallets, which are placed upright, and can be pulled down when a Survivor runs past them – if the Killer is right behind them, the Pallet will momentarily stun the Killer if it successfully hits them.\n\nOther technical advantages that Survivors have include the ability to see the Aura of downed and hooked teammates – thus easily drawing them to their location for a rescue – and can similarly see the locations of newly repaired Generators and the Exit Gates for a short period of time once all necessary Generators are repaired. When the Killer is near, the Survivors will hear a heartbeat, and eventually tense music, both of which increase in intensity with proximity to the Killer. They can also see a red light (called the \"red stain\") emanating from the Killer's head, which reveals the direction which they are facing.\n\nInteracting with most objects and actions in the game causes random Skill Checks to trigger. Right before a skill check triggers, the player will receive a noise notification, and a needle within a circle will then appear on-screen. The player must hit the action button, when the needle is within a certain randomly chosen section of the circle before the needle passes it. The player can hit either a Good Skill Check or A Great Skill Check. Hitting a Good Skill Check grants 50 Bloodpoints, and a Great Skill Checks grants 150 Bloodpoints and an instant 2 % bonus to progression on the generator. Failing a Skill Check has multiple consequences based on the action being taken.\n\nRepairing each Generator takes a lengthy period of time and makes a rather small mechanical noise during the process. Failing a repair Skill Check will cause an explosion that will set the progress of the Generator repair back and make a loud noise alerting the Killer to the Survivor's location. Killers have the ability to damage Generators, which will regress them over time.\n\nSabotaging a Hook takes a significantly shorter amount of time than repairing a Generator but is considerably louder. To sabotage a Hook, Survivors must be equipped with a 'Toolbox’ or have the Saboteur Perk active. Skill Checks are more common during this action than when repairing a Generator. Failing a Sabotage Skill Check makes a loud banging sound, momentarily halting progress and alerting the Killer. Sabotaged Hooks will respawn after three minutes have elapsed. Special Event Hooks and the Basement Hooks cannot be sabotaged.\n\nHealing yourself or your allied Survivors can take drastically different lengths of time depending on multiple factors such as if they have a Med-Kit, certain Perks active, Killer de-buffs and whether the Survivor is healing themselves or an ally. Skill Checks are as common as when repairing but have a slightly less severe consequence when failed. Failing a Healing Skill Check still reduces the progress of the action but the wail made by the Survivor being healed is quieter than the other explosions and bangs, but still alerts the Killer of the location within a certain range.\n\nIf a Survivor is caught by the Killer, they are picked up and usually carried to the nearest Hook. During this time they can attempt to wiggle out of the Killer's grasp before they reach the Hook, and attempt to run away. If the Killer succeeds in impaling a Survivor on one of the many Hooks in the area, a teammate can rescue the impaled Survivor or, more rarely, the impaled Survivor (with a 4 % chance) can rescue themselves from the Hook (although attempting this is likely to backfire and injure the Survivor further, drawing them closer to death).\n\nOnce all Generators are repaired, a Survivor must find a switch next to one of two Exit Gates and hold it for 20 seconds in order to open the door. The game only ends when all Survivors have either escaped or have been killed – thus, while some Survivors may escape and finish early, those still inside must keep playing. Players who have escaped or died have the ability to observe the remaining players through the game's conclusion, or return to the menu and join a new game.\n\nIf only one Survivor remains then repairing Generators can become nearly impossible. An alternative escape method would be to use the 'Hatch', which spawns in a random area after the number of Generators repaired equals one more than there are Survivors left alive in the game (i.e. three Generators repaired with only two Survivors still living). The Hatch spawns closed but when only one Survivor remains then it will open automatically. While closed it can be opened if one Survivor has a 'Dull Key' or a 'Skeleton Key' and will remain open for 30 seconds, allowing any remaining Survivors to hop in and escape.\n\nBoth Survivor and Killers are able to unlock Items, Perks, Add-ons and Offerings through the Bloodweb. Every action performed in a trial awards the player a number of Bloodpoints, and the sum are added to the player's total at the end of the trial. Each level of the Bloodweb is procedurally generated, and gets larger as the Character gains levels. The rewards are connected to each other in a radial tree, and players must purchase rewards along the progression path to gain access to others. Once every reward on the tree has been purchased, the Bloodweb will generate a new level for the player to progress to, increasing that Character's level. Once the Character reaches Level 50, they will be given the option to prestige. While given the option, they will still be able to buy things from the Bloodweb, but will not further increase their Level. Once prestiged, Characters will reset their progression and receive one of their default customisation options in a blood-splattered variation. One can prestige their Character up to three times.\n\nThe Bloodweb may contain Items and their Add-ons, Offerings that can be spent at the start of the round to influence the trial's conditions, and Perks that make the Character more powerful. Offerings and Add-ons may only be used in one trial, whereas Items can be re-used until the player dies, uses up all the charges of an Item or gives it to another player. Items can also be acquired from Chests on the map, but this does not affect the Character's Bloodweb.\n\nThe game takes place across eleven Realms which are based on the places the Killers became murderers: The MacMillan Estate (Trapper), Autohaven Wreckers (Wraith), Coldwind Farm (Hillbilly), Crotus Prenn Asylum (Nurse, Clown), Haddonfield (Shape), Backwater Swamp (Hag), Léry's Memorial Institute (Doctor), the Red Forest (Huntress), Springwood/Badham Preschool (Nightmare), Gideon Meat Plant (Pig), Yamaoka Estate (Spirit), and the Ormond Slopes Resort (Legion). Over time, the evilness of their actions accumulated there until it attracted the attention of the Entity, an unknown force of darkness from a place with no name. Most Realms are split into multiple Maps with similar features but small variations.\n\nEvery Realm and Map features a map-specific building or landmark that remains in the same place in the map every game. Every map also features a building known as 'The Shack' which is the same throughout all maps and appears a different one of a few predetermined locations in the map, with the exception of the two indoor maps, Léry's Memorial Institute and Gideon Meat Plant. Every new game, a room known as the 'Basement' is placed under either the map-specific building or the shack.\n\nThe Basement is a special room consisting of one item chest for the Survivors to scavenge in, and four cabinets for them to hide in. It's also home to a special four-pointed hook that cannot be destroyed or tampered with in any way by Survivors. The basement only has one way in and one way out, making it a very secure place for Killers to bring their victims without fear of other Survivors saving them. Because of this danger, Survivors are awarded a small number of points for even venturing into the basement.\n\nThe Entity, a supernatural being hailing from the ancient blood web, is awakened from its slumber whenever it is summoned by actions of great violence and malice. The Killers, exclusively serial murderers, are pulled out of reality by it and convinced to do its bidding. In order to maintain its existence, the Entity requires sacrifices, and demands that they hunt and kill the Survivors so it can feed off their hope and steal a piece of their soul upon death. Then they are brought back to life to repeat the trial, endlessly attempting to escape.\n\nThe Survivors are pulled into the Entity's constructed world when they wander too close to the places the Killers were taken from, disappearing from the real world without a trace. They end up at a lonely campfire, where they rest between trials, until a Killer pursues them again. Each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the Entity of areas from where the Killers were taken. The Survivors' only hope of escape is to complete a series of generators scattered throughout each realm to power up large gates to escape. If the Killer has killed all but one Survivor, the Entity will offer the latter a final means of escape in the form of a hatch. Escaping from the grounds always takes the Survivors back to the campfire, and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal for the Entity's favour. Since the Entity feeds off the hope of the Survivors to escape, it helps them just as much as the Killers, acting as an impartial observer of the hunt, stepping in only to claim those hung on its hooks.\n\nBehaviour Interactive has as of December 2018 released 11 individual DLC's in total. Each DLC has included both a new Survivor and Killer except for two that separately introduced one killer and one new survivor respectively (Left Behind and LeatherFace DLC). The DLC's release with an average of three months interval between each one. Prior to the release of every DLC, a so-called Public Test Build (PTB) is discharged, which allows the developers of the game to test and receive community feedback on the major upcoming changes. Once the PTB has been out for roughly two weeks, it is removed for further maintenance, e.g. bug fixing, adding missing features etc. before the DLC gets released. The estimated time span between the opening of the Public Test Build and a new DLC's release is approximately 2-3 weeks.\n\n5 out of the 11 currently released DLC's have featured licensed Killers and Survivors from both popular horror franchises and other video games. The DLC's can be acquired in two ways; by either purchasing them normally through Steam or buying them through an item-shop within the game using an in-game currency called Iridescent Shards. This alternative way of obtaining the DLC's was introduced in the 2.0 update (Curtain Call DLC). Each DLC has its own trailer and a so-called \"spotlight\" that exhibits the Killer and Survivor as well as a new in-game map that gets released along with the new characters.\n\nAlong with the Curtain Call DLC that was released on June 12, 2018, the developers also released a cosmetics store which allows you to use Iridescent Shards or Auric Cells. In the store, players can use the Iridescent Shards or Auric Cells to buy cosmetics for their Survivors or Killers. They would be able to buy a set chosen by the developers for a discount instead of individually buying it. Licensed Survivors and Killers (Shape, Cannibal, Pig, David Tapp and Laurie Strode etc.) will not have any cosmetics released for them.\nAlthough this procedure may seem like a way to make their Survivors or Killers more presentable, Auric Cells can only be bought with real money. If the player wants to use Iridescent Shards, it would take a longer time.\n\n\"Dead by Daylight\" received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. \"GameSpot\" awarded it a score of 6 out of 10, saying \"\"Dead by Daylight\" executes the concept of a competitive horror game well, but only to a point.\"\n\n"}

It was meant to target large cities and urban areas. Had the project continued, Disney had plans to construct locations in many major cities in the United States, like Philadelphia and Baltimore. However, only two locations were built; one in Walt Disney World and a much shorter-lived one in Chicago.\n\nDisneyQuest first opened on June 19, 1998, as part of a major expansion of the Downtown Disney entertainment district (today Disney Springs) at Downtown Disney West Side, and was intended as the first of a larger chain of similar facilities.\n\nThe first DisneyQuest outside of a resort was opened in Chicago on June 16, 1999 with plans for more locations worldwide. The Chicago location was in a development, North Bridge, where ESPN Zone, a fellow Disney Regional chain, opened about a month later. \n\nOn December 9, 1998, Disney Regional announced Philadelphia as new location as a tenant of the Pavilion at Market East project developed by Goldenberg Group on the former location of a Gimbels Department Store. \n\nThe Chicago location permanently closed on September 4, 2001 due to low attendance as well as other, broader issues. However, the location was generating income just not enough for Disney.\n\nAfter the failure of DisneyQuest Chicago, the DisneyQuest project was officially brought to an end. Construction that had begun in Philadelphia was scrapped, leaving a giant hole in its place for several years; the hole has since been filled and the space later became a parking lot. A DisneyQuest at Disneyland Resort in California never proceeded past the planning stage. Disney announced another location to be built in downtown Toronto but the project was canceled. After the closure of the Chicago location, Disney Regional Entertainment turned over control of the remaining location to Walt Disney World operations.\n\nOn June 30, 2015, Disney officials announced that the Walt Disney World location would close in 2016 as part of the continued redevelopment of Downtown Disney into Disney Springs. A spokesperson for the labor unions that represent Disney employees who work at DisneyQuest stated that displaced workers will be relocated to other positions. The property was set to be redeveloped into a new attraction themed to the NBA after they left their previous location at Universal CityWalk. In November 2016, Disney officials announced that DisneyQuest would remain open for the remainder of the year and into 2017, with no definitive closing date.

{"id": "40665782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40665782", "title": "Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy", "text": "Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy\n\nDracula 5: The Blood Legacy is a 2013 point-and-click adventure video game developed by Koalabs Studio for Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android and OS X. It was published on all systems by Anuman under their Microïds brand. In 2014, the game was released on GOG.com and Steam, bundled with its prequel, \"\".\n\nThe game follows 2000's \"\" and \"\", 2008's \"\" and 2013's \"Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon\". The plot is unrelated to \"Resurrection\" and \"Last Sanctuary\", but is instead the second of a two-part loose sequel to \"Path of the Dragon\", continuing the story of Metropolitan Museum of Art art restorer Ellen Cross and her investigation into a mysterious portrait of Dracula. Ellen's journey leads her from New York to Istanbul to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, bringing her into contact with an ancient secret society founded by Vlad Tepes' brother Radu, and placing her in the middle of a 500-year-old conflict between the society and Dracula's followers.\n\n\"The Blood Legacy\" received very little attention in the mainstream gaming press, with limited coverage from professional critics, and what reviews it did receive were negative. As with \"Shadow of the Dragon\", the biggest criticism of the game was its length, but critics were also unimpressed with the plot, the graphics, and the identical gameplay to the previous game.\n\nGameplay in \"The Blood Legacy\" is identical to \"Shadow of the Dragon\". The game is a first-person point-and-click adventure game, with a minimalist HUD; a quick-access item holder, which allows the player to use an item without entering their inventory. The main inventory is accessible by clicking on the hand icon beside the quick-access holder. As well as the inventory, the player has access to a list of objectives, records of all conversations, records of all documents seen and collected, a summary of relevant information acquired, and options for the player to quit their game, or load a previously saved game. The game employs an autosave feature, which is activated at certain predetermined spots, or whenever the player quits to the main menu.\n\nThe game uses a basic point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the game world, with player's perspective controlled by the mouse, although the game is also fully touchscreen operable on compatible operating systems. Within each screen, the player is free to look around 360 degrees. As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), a mouth (the player can speak to the character over whom the option appears), an eye (an area or object can be examined in more detail), a hand (the player can take the object), a cog (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction with the object), a left-right horizontal arrow (the object can be moved left and right), and an up-down vertical arrow (the object can be moved up and down).\n\nA gameplay mechanic not seen in the previous \"Dracula\" games (until \"Shadow of the Dragon\") is a health system. The player character (Ellen Cross) suffers from a rare blood disorder which must be managed with medication. During the game, Cross' health continually decreases, and if it goes below a certain level, she becomes unable to move or perform tasks. The player has access to various types of medication throughout the game and can experiment with combinations to continually top off her health.\n\nThe game can be played in either \"Adventure Mode\" or \"Casual Mode\". In Casual Mode, interactive zones are automatically shown on-screen. Also in Casual Mode, after a set period of time elapses, players are given the option to skip puzzles. The game also features a points system and a series of in-game trophies, both of which are inactive if the player is playing in casual mode.\n\nThe game begins with the final scene from \"Shadow of the Dragon\"; Ellen Cross, an art restorer from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, opening the uncatalogued sixteenth painting from the Vambery collection, which she believes to be a portrait of Dracula. Ellen is shocked, however, to instead see a portrait of Vambery's assistant, Adam Stoker, Bram Stoker's great-grandson, which suddenly comes to life, as Adam grows fangs and lunges at Ellen. However, this is revealed to have been a nightmare. In reality, Ellen has returned to New York with the painting unopened. Back at the Met, Phillips tells her the Turkish police found no body at Yanek's, who probably cleaned out his apartment after discovering Ellen had broken in. As such, they still have no idea who Yanek is working for, and why he was in possession of several of the lost Vambery paintings. Meanwhile, Ellen opens the painting to find it has been tarred over with a black cross. Her colleague Gerry Berowski tells her people used to paint crosses in black tar on their doors to ward off vampires. As Vambery seemed to have been afraid of the painting, Gerry speculates Vambery himself may have painted the cross.\n\nEllen removes the tar, revealing the portrait of Dracula. She puts the painting in storage, and then reads an unpublished biography of Vlad Tepes, which portrays him in a more positive light than usual. The book says Vlad's brother, Radu, was responsible for the suicide of Vlad's wife, telling her Vlad had been killed in battle and giving her a knife with which to kill herself. Vlad never recovered from her death, and turned to evil soon thereafter. The book explains Radu hated Vlad because when they were held prisoner by Sultan Murad II, Vlad had been released fourteen years prior to Radu. The book also reproduces a letter written by Radu in which he says \"since you've refused to give me the gift you have thanks to me, my death is only the beginning of your torture. My blood will remain restless for as long as my vengeance goes unsatisfied, and throughout your lifetime, danger hangs over you.\"\n\nAdam arrives to see Ellen, and back in her apartment, they sleep together. The next day, she finds a note from Adam promising to see her soon. She heads to the museum, but the painting has been stolen. Checking the surveillance footage, she sees Adam taking it. Meanwhile, a librarian friend of Gerry's leaves him a message telling him whilst she was researching Radu, she found a poem he had written called \"The Shadow of the Dragon.\" Ellen reads the poem, which seems to offer instructions on how to find the headquarters of a secret society formed by Radu with the express purpose of gaining revenge against Vlad. Ellen realizes the poem is a guide to the headquarters of the society, and leads to the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. She then gets a phonecall from a woman telling her Gerry is dead, and advising her to be careful, as powerful agents are working against her investigation. The woman also says her master knows the painting is missing, and would be very grateful if Ellen could bring it to him.\n\nShe heads to Turkey, and finds the headquarters. In display cases, she finds several items, including the diary of Fr. Arno Moriani (the protagonist of \"Path of the Dragon\") and notes on a series of eugenics experiments called \"Operation D\" (referred to in the final scene of \"Path of the Dragon\"). The dagger used by Vlad's wife to kill herself, allegedly one of the few items capable of harming Dracula, is also supposed to be there, but is missing. Ellen learns the present day leader of the society is Adam, who is a direct descendent of Radu. She concludes Adam plans to kill Dracula using the dagger, and stole the painting as a way to draw Dracula out. With no other leads to follow, she returns to see Yanek.\n\nHe reveals he is a vampire, serving Dracula, who has forbidden his followers to harm Ellen. Yanek explains he is really Kaneyek, the painter of the portrait, which is more than just a painting. In fact, it allows Dracula to see through it, which was why Vambrey was so afraid of it, and why he covered it with tar. He tells her Dracula became a vampire by drinking his dead wife's blood, but because all vampires originate from Dracula, no vampire can harm him. Only a vampire born independently of Dracula can destroy him, and the only way for the creation of such a vampire is if someone else were to drink his wife's blood, which he wears in a vial around his neck. He also tells her she is pregnant with Adam's child. Yanek and Ellen conclude this must be Adam's goal, and with Yanek's instructions, Ellen heads to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to meet Dracula.\n\nIn an underground castle, he tells her Adam is imprisoned nearby, and asks her to retrieve his portrait. She goes to Adam, and tells him about the baby. He promises that if she saves him, he will give her the portrait, and they can escape together. She opens his cell, but faints. Adam carries her body to Dracula, and tries to stab him with the knife. However, Dracula avoids the attack, and knocks Adam out. Impressed with Ellen, he offers her his wife's blood to drink. The player is given the choice as to whether to accept it or not. If the player does so, Ellen becomes a vampire. If the player does not, Dracula kills her. However, unseen by Dracula, Adam is able to drink some of his wife's blood.\n\n\"The Blood Legacy\" was first announced on August 23, 2013, at Gamescom, when Anuman Interactive revealed the game was under development by Koalabs Studio and would be published under Anuman's Microïds brand.\n\nIn relation to the game's story, the character of Professor Vambery was partly inspired by Ármin Vámbéry, a Turkologist, who stayed with Bram Stoker in London prior to the composition of \"Dracula\", and is said to have influenced many elements of the novel, including the depiction of Dracula himself. The concept of Dracula's wife killing herself after being tricked into thinking he had died was taken primarily from Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\". The captivity of Vlad Tepes and his brother Radu by Sultan Murad II, with Radu remaining with the Sultan longer than Vlad, and their imprisonment driving a wedge between the brothers, is very loosely based on historical fact. In reality, in 1442, Vlad II Dracul took his two eldest sons, Vlad and his half-brother Mircea, to meet Murad, who had supported Dracul in securing the throne of Wallachia. However, Murad took them prisoner. Both brothers were released in 1448, by which time their younger brother, Radu had earned the nickname \"Radu cel Frumos\" (\"Radu the Handsome\") and become friends with Murad's son, Mehmet, earning Vlad's enmity, due to his hatred of the Turks. Radu eventually converted to Islam and entered Ottoman service, alienating Vlad even more.\n\n\"The Blood Legacy\" received little attention in the gaming press, garnering very limited coverage from professional critics. What reviews it did receive were negative, with the PC version holding an aggregate score of 45% on GameRankings.\n\nAdventure Gamers' Rob Franklin scored the game 1.5 out of 5, calling it \"simply the second half of a game that should have shipped as a complete \"Dracula 4\".\" Of the gameplay, he wrote \"Puzzles are painfully obvious from the outset, with little to no challenge as you proceed.\" He concluded \"For anyone who enjoyed \"Dracula 4\", the final half of this two-part adventure is more of the same. \"The Blood Legacy\" won't give you any sense of closure in its own right, but it will at least resolve the unsatisfactory cliffhanger from the previous instalment. For everyone else, this is merely a second incomplete \"Dracula\" game that can only be taken seriously when paired with its predecessor.\"\n\nAdventure Classic Gaming's Mervyn Graham scored the game 3 out of 5, writing \"\"Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy\" plays neither as a standalone game nor as a true sequel to the series. Instead, it plays more like the second part of a full game that begins with the previous game.\" He was critical of several aspects, including the linearity of the gameplay, and the graphics, calling the character animations \"abysmal,\" and criticising the lack of lip syncing. He concluded \"despite being better than \"Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon\", \"Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy\" still leaves much to be desired.\"\n\nGameBoomers' Jenny100 gave the game a C, making a similar point about the length of the game; \"It's essentially Part 2 of \"Dracula 4\", takes about the same time to play, and has the same shortcomings. Both \"Dracula 4\" and \"Dracula 5\" together are still shorter than the games we used to get from Kheops and older companies that used to make first person games.\"\n"}

{"id": "1870213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870213", "title": "Film distributor", "text": "Film distributor\n\nA film distributor is responsible for the marketing of a film. The distribution company is usually different from the production company. Distribution deals are an important part of financing a film.\n\nThe distributor may set the release date of a film and the method by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing; for example, directly to the public either theatrically or for home viewing (DVD, video-on-demand, download, television programs through broadcast syndication etc.). A distributor may do this directly, if the distributor owns the theaters or film distribution networks, or through theatrical exhibitors and other sub-distributors. A limited distributor may deal only with particular products, such as DVDs or Blu-ray, or may act in a particular country or market. The primary distributor will often receive credit in the film's credits, one sheet or other marketing material.\n\nIf a distributor is working with a theatrical exhibitor, the distributor secures a written contract stipulating the amount of the gross ticket sales the exhibitor will be allowed to retain (usually a percentage of the gross). The distributor collects the amount due, audits the exhibitor's ticket sales as necessary to ensure the gross reported by the exhibitor is accurate, secures the distributor's share of these proceeds, surrenders the exhibitor's portion to it, and transmits the remainder to the production company (or to any other [intermediary], such as a film release agent). \n\nThe distributor must also ensure that enough film prints are struck to service all contracted exhibitors on the contract-based opening day, ensure their physical delivery to the theater by the opening day, monitor exhibitors to make sure the film is in fact shown in the particular theatre with the minimum number of seats and show times, and ensure the prints' return to the distributor's office or other storage resource also on the contract-based return date. In practical terms, this includes the physical production of release prints and their shipping around the world (a process that is being replaced by digital distribution in most developed markets) as well as the creation of posters, newspaper and magazine advertisements, television commercials, trailers, and other types of ads.\n\nThe distributor is also responsible for ensuring a full line of advertising material is available for each film which it believes will help the exhibitor attract the largest possible audience, create such advertising if it is not provided by the production company, and arrange for the physical delivery of the advertising items selected by the exhibitor at intervals prior to the opening day. Film distributors spend between $3.5 billion and $4.0 billion a year in the United States alone on direct buys of advertising such as TV commercials, billboards, online banner ads, radio commercials and the like. That distributor-spending figure doesn't include additional costs for publicity, film trailers and promotions, which aren’t classified as advertising but also market films to audiences.\n\nDistributors typically enter into one of the two types of film booking contracts. The most common is the aggregate deal where total box office revenue that a given film generates is split by a pre-determined mutually-agreed percentage between distributor and movie theater. The other method is the sliding scale deal, where the percentage of box office revenue taken by theaters declines each week of a given film's run. The sliding scale actually has two pieces that starts with a minimum amount of money that theater is to keep—often called “the house nut”—after which the sliding scale kicks in for revenue generated above the house nut. However, this sliding scale method is falling out of use. Whatever the method, box office revenue is usually shared roughly 50/50 between film distributors and theaters.\n\nIf the distributor is handling an imported or foreign film, it may also be responsible for securing dubbing or subtitling for the film, and securing censorship or other legal or organizational \"approval\" for the exhibition of the film in the country/territory in which it does business, prior to approaching the exhibitors for booking. Depending on which studio that is distributing the film, the studio will either have offices around the world, by themselves or partnered with another studio, to distribute films in other countries. If a studio decides to partner with a native distributor, upon release both names will appear. The foreign distributor may license the film for a certain amount of time, but the studio will retain the copyright of the film. \n\nWhen a film is produced and distributed by an independent production company and independent distributor (meaning outside the studios), generally an international sales agent handles the licensing of international rights to the film. The international sales agent will find a local distributor in each individual international territory (meaning outside of the US for a US independent film) and license the exclusive rights to the film for a certain amount of time but in the same case as the studios described above, the production company will retain the copyright of the film. This means that this distributor in a certain territory has the exclusive right to exploit the film in various media (theatrical, tv, home entertainment, etc) for a certain amount of time.\n\nAlthough there are now numerous distribution techniques, in the past the studios and networks were slow to change and did not experiment with different distribution processes. Studios believed that new distribution methods would cause their old methods of revenue to be destroyed. With time, the development of new distribution did prove to be beneficial. The studios revenue was gained from myriad distribution windows. These windows created many opportunities in the industry and allowed networks to make a profit and eliminate failure. These new distribution methods benefited audiences that were normally too small to reach and expanded the content of television. With the new age of technology, networks accepted the fact that it was a consumer demand industry and accepted the new models of distribution.\n\nThis term, used mainly in the British film industry, describes the distribution of feature films for screening to a gathered audience, but not in theatres at which individual tickets are sold to members of the public. The defining distinctions between a theatrical and a non-theatrical screening are that the latter has to be to a closed audience in some way, e.g. pupils of a school, members of a social club or passengers on an airline, and that there can be no individual admission charge. Most non-theatrical screening contracts also specify that the screening must not be advertised, except within the group that is eligible to attend (e.g. in a membership organisation's newsletter or an in-flight magazine).\n\nNon-theatrical distribution includes the airlines and film societies. Non-theatrical distribution is generally handled by companies that specialise in this market, of which Motion Picture Licensing Company (MPLC) and Filmbankmedia are the two largest:\n\nMotion Picture Licensing Company\nFilmbankmedia\n\nRepresenting the major Hollywood studios and independent producers. Home video media is sold with a licence that permits viewing in the home only. Until these technologies were widespread, most non-theatrical screenings were on 16mm film prints supplied by the distributor. Today, the most common business model is for a distributor to sell the exhibitor a licence that permits the legal projection of a copy of the film, which the exhibitor buys separately on a home video format. These licences can either be for individual, one-off screenings, or cover an unlimited number of screenings of titles represented by that distributor for a specified time period. The latter are often purchased by pubs and students' unions, to enable them to show occasional feature films on a TV in their bars.\n\nSome distributors only handle home video distribution or some sub-set of home video distribution such as DVD or Blu-ray distribution. The remaining home video rights may be licensed by the producer to other distributors or the distributor may sub-license them to other distributors.\n\nIf a distributor is going to distribute a movie on a physical format such as DVD, they must arrange for the creation of the artwork for the case and the face of the DVD and arrange with a DVD replicator to create a glass master to press quantities of the DVD.\n\nSome movie producers use a process called \"DVD-on-demand.\" In DVD-on-demand, a company will burn a DVD-R (a process called \"duplication\") when a copy of the DVD is ordered, and then ship it to the customer.\n\nA distributor may also maintain contact with wholesalers who sell and ship DVDs to retail outlets as well as online stores, and arrange for them to carry the DVD. The distributor may also place ads in magazines and online and send copies of the DVD to reviewers.\n\nThe primary distribution companies will usually receive some billing for the film. For example, \"Gone With the Wind\" was shown on the one sheet as \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Release\". A modern example, \"Jurassic Park\", would be the credit \"Universal Pictures presents …\". The Universal production logo also opened the film's trailer. In some cases, there is split distribution as in the case of \"Titanic\" (1997): \"20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures present …\". Both companies helped to finance the film.\n\n"}

However, more recent 2009-2010 data no longer show Florida among the top four states.\n\nProduction activity has been generally concentrated in two regions, South and Central Florida (Orlando and Tampa). The South Florida region is famous for large projects like Jerry Bruckheimer's \"Bad Boys\" film series and Neal Moritz's \"2 Fast 2 Furious\". The Central Florida area has been featured in \"The Punisher\", starring John Travolta, and Adam Sandler's \"The Waterboy\".\n\nThe state of Florida has a long film history thanks to its year-round sunshine and moderate climate. Film classics were filmed throughout the state, such as \"Moon Over Miami\" (1941) and Esther Williams' \"Easy to Love\" (1953).\n\nIn the early 1990s Orlando experienced a great boom in film production. The construction of the Disney-MGM Studios and Universal Studios production facilities attracted many filmmakers to the area. Films like Ron Howard's \"Parenthood\" and syndicated television shows like \"The Adventures of Superboy\" led the pack. Soon, the Steven Spielberg series \"seaQuest DSV\" and Tom Hank's \"From the Earth to the Moon\" called Florida home. During this period Orlando acquired the nickname \"Hollywood East\" because of its surging film industry.\n\nJust as film production appeared to be on the decline in Florida, the phenomenal success of 1998's \"The Blair Witch Project\" led to another boom. While this film was filmed in Maryland, its director and entire crew were University of Central Florida film school graduates. This cult independent film has led to a new wave of film production for the area.\n\nFlorida is also the home of many famous actors. Celebrity residents of Florida include Burt Reynolds, James Best, John Travolta, Michael Winslow, Justin Timberlake, Scott \"Carrot Top\" Thompson, Will Smith, Allan Meade, and Sylvester Stallone.

Among the inspirations of the genre there were the Gothic literature, the French \"feuilleton\" and the Italian horror cinema. In a local market characterized from comics devoted to a young audience, the immediate commercial success of \"Diabolik\" revealed a niche of adult readers interested in adult and sometimes exploitive themes characterized by violence and sex references.\n\nThe heroes of \"fumetti neri\" were more anti-hero or villain than traditional heroes, and Diabolik himself was very loosely based on the French\" Fantômas\" character. The subsequent main characters in these comics were all inspired on Diabolik and often had a K in their names. They included \"Kriminal\" (a more violent version of Diabolik by Magnus and Max Bunker), \"Satanik\" ( a female version of Diabolik by the same authors but with supernatural and horrific elements) and \"Sadik\".\n\nThe large success of this genre led in 1965 to public campaigns against them, and even to trials and judicial seizures. As a result, from 1966 some comics remarkably reduced violence and erotic situations, and tried to open themselves to a younger and wider audience, while others, the so-called \"vietati ai minori\" (\"restricted to the minors\") exploited their status, increasing the levels of sex, and sometimes becoming openly pornographic.\n\nIn France, these comics were published in digest size editions by the likes of Elvifrance.\n\nIt was in the scene set by the \"fumetti neri\" that fumetti d'autore/auteur comics - comics published in magazines such as \"linus\" (1965ff.), \"Il Sergente Kirk\" (July 1967 – December 1969), \"Eureka\" (November 1967 – November 1967), \"Il Mago\" (April 1972 – December 1980) and \"Frigidaire\" (December 1980ff.) - found a favorable ground for development in Italy in the mid-1960s.\n"}

Japanese authors on the other hand exploit daily life extensively – but these are often the least likely to be widely translated.\n\nFor the participants of Nouvelle Manga there are bridges to build between the comics of all nationalities, not least between the comics \"d'auteur\" in each country.\n\nPeople often restrict Nouvelle Manga to the world of alternative comics, yet there are many examples of Nouvelle Manga authors publishing in all kinds of arenas. For instance, Boilet himself has been published in mainstream Seinen magazines like \"Big Comics\" in Japan as well as in alternative editorial structures such as \"Spore\" in Japan, Ego Comme X in France and, more recently, Fanfare / Ponent Mon in the US. \n\nBoilet prefers to refer to Nouvelle Manga as being in the French feminine form (\"la\") as opposed to the French masculine form (\"le\") which is used for the very mainstream action-oriented manga that is more usually published in France.\n\nExamples of artists who are associated in varying degrees with the outputs and debates surrounding Nouvelle Manga are:\nMoyoko Anno, Aurélia Aurita, David B., Matthieu Blanchin, Frédéric Boilet, Nicolas de Crécy, Étienne Davodeau, Yoji Fukuyama, Emmanuel Guibert, Kazuichi Hanawa, Daisuke Igarashi, Little Fish, Taiyō Matsumoto, Fabrice Neaud, Loïc Néhou, Benoît Peeters, Frédéric Poincelet, David Prudhomme, François Schuiten, Joann Sfar, Kiriko Nananan, Hideji Oda, Kan Takahama, Jiro Taniguchi, Yoshiharu Tsuge, Vanyda and Naito Yamada.\n\nA great exhibition and a cycle of debates were held in Tokyo in September and October 2001, notably at the Tokyo Museum of Fine Arts and at the French-Japanese Institute.\n\nNouvelle Manga has extended to other media with Nouvelle Manga Digitale, a creation of the multimedia author Fred Boot.\n\n\n\n"}

Open to the public for the first time on 27 June 1881, it had a roller coaster, a dance hall, a Ferris wheel, boating attractions, hot air balloon rides, wrestling bears, contortionists, aerial acts (including a human cannonball), a man who walked on ceilings, and exhibits displaying more than 40 species of animals, but its primary draw was Roger the Elephant (real name: Rajah), who was a popular children's ride. Visitors reached the park by streetcar, boats, and wagons.\n\nA large theater at the park was opened on June 27, 1891. It featured everything from light opera to vaudeville.\n\nWhile Manhattan Beach was a popular destination, competition (from nearby Elitch Gardens and White City, the latter eventually becoming Lakeside Amusement Park) and mishaps marked its existence. Roger the Elephant was spooked by the sound of a hot-air balloon, bucked passengers and stepped on the head of a six-year-old boy; George W. Eaton (son of Pressley Jr. and Harriett Eaton, brother of Clayton Arnold \"Jack\" Eaton). In 1908, Manhattan Beach was destroyed by fire; later that year, it was rebuilt and reopened as Luna Park.

{"id": "177079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177079", "title": "Mechanical (character)", "text": "Mechanical (character)\n\nA mechanical is any of six characters in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" who perform the play-within-a-play \"Pyramus and Thisbe\". Named for their occupations as skilled manual laborers, they are a group of amateur and mostly incompetent actors from around Athens, looking to make names for themselves by having their production chosen among several acts as the courtly entertainment for the royal wedding party of Theseus and Hippolyta. \n\nThe biggest ham among them, Bottom, becomes the unlikely object of interest for the fairy queen Titania after she is charmed by a love potion and he is turned into a monster with the head, eyes and ears of an ass by the servant-spirit Puck.\n\nPeter Quince's name is derived from \"quines\" or \"quoins\", which are wooden wedges used by carpenters.\n\nQuince's amateurish playwriting is usually taken to be a parody of the popular mystery plays of the pre-Elizabethan era, plays that were also produced by craftspeople. His metrical preferences are references to vernacular ballads. \n\nDespite Quince's obvious shortcomings as a writer, Stanley Wells argues that he partly resembles Shakespeare himself. Both are from a craftsmanly background, both work quickly and both take secondary roles in their own plays. Robert Leach makes the same point.\n\nIn performing the play, Quince recites the prologue but struggles to fit his lines into the meter and make the rhymes. The noble audience makes jocular comments, whilst the rest of the mechanicals struggle (all except Bottom, who rather confidently improvises).\n\nTraditionally, Peter Quince is portrayed as a bookish character, caught up in the minute details of his play, but as a theatrical organizer. However, in the 1999 film version of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", he is portrayed by Roger Rees as a strong character extremely capable of being a director. It is he who leads the search party looking for Nick Bottom in the middle of the play. \n\nMany interpret Quince to be an author surrogate, representing William Shakespeare, albeit a comical version of himself.\n\nThe character is named in the title of a Wallace Stevens poem, \"Peter Quince at the Clavier\", which is written in the first person as if spoken by Quince. The character also inspired the name of Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the 1999 film \"Galaxy Quest\".\n\nSnug is a minor character in the play. He is a joiner from Athens who is hired by Peter Quince to play the part of the lion in Pyramus and Thisbe. When he is first assigned the part, he is afraid it may take him a while to finally remember his lines (even though the lion's role was nothing but roaring originally). Bottom offers to play the part of the lion (as he offers to play all other parts), but he is rejected by Quince, who worries (as do the other characters) that his loud and ferocious roar in the play will frighten the ladies of power in the audience and get Quince and all his actors hanged. In the end, the lion's part is revised to explain that he is in fact not a lion and means the audience no harm.\n\nSnug is often played as a stupid man, a manner describing almost all of the Mechanicals.\n\nSnug is the only Mechanical to whom the playwright did not assign a first name.\n\nIn Jean-Louis and Jules Supervielle's french adaptation, \"Le Songe d'une nuit d'été\" (1959), Snug is renamed to , where Georges Neveux's 1945 adaptation used the English names.\n\nOn the Elizabethan stage, the role of Snug and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with Titania's four fairy escorts: Moth, Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom.\n\nNick Bottom provides comic relief throughout the play. A weaver by trade, he is famously known for getting his head transformed into that of a donkey by the elusive Puck. Bottom and Puck are the only two characters who converse with and progress the three central stories in the whole play. Puck is first introduced in the fairies' story and creates the drama of the lovers' story by messing up who loves whom, and places the donkey head on Bottom's in his story. Similarly, Bottom is performing in a play in his story intending it to be presented in the lovers' story, as well as interacting with Titania in the fairies' story.\n\nFrancis Flute's occupation is a bellows-mender. He is forced to play the female role of Thisbe in \"Pyramus and Thisbe\", a play-within-the-play which is performed for Theseus' marriage celebration.\n\nIn the play Flute (Thisbe) speaks through the wall (played by Tom Snout) to Pyramus (Nick Bottom).\n\nFlute is a young, excited actor who is disappointed when he finds he is meant to play a woman (Thisbe) in their interlude before the duke and the duchess.\n\nFlute's name, like that of the other mechanicals, is metonymical and derives from his craft: \"Flute\" references a church organ, an instrument prominently featuring the bellows a bellows-mender might be called upon to repair.\n\nIn Jean-Louis and Jules Supervielle's french adaptation, \"Le Songe d'une nuit d'été\" (1959), Flute is renamed to , where Georges Neveux's 1945 adaptation used the English names.\n\nOn the Elizabethan stage, the role of Flute and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with Titania's four fairy escorts: Moth (also spelled Mote), Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom.\n\nTom Snout is a tinker, and one of the Mechanicals of Athens.\n\nIn the play-within-a-play, Tom Snout plays the wall which separates Pyramus' and Thisbe's gardens. In \"Pyramus and Thisbe\", the two lovers whisper to each other through Snout's fingers (representing a chink in the wall). Snout has eight lines under the name of Tom Snout, and two lines as \"The Wall\". He is the Wall for Act V-Scene 1.\n\nTom Snout was originally set to play Pyramus's father, but the need for a wall was greater, so he discharged \"The Wall\". Snout is often portrayed as a reluctant actor and very frightened, but the other mechanicals (except Bottom and Quince) are usually much more frightened than Tom Snout.\n\nSnout's name, like that of the other mechanicals, is metonymical and derives from his craft: \"Snout\" means a nozzle or a spout, a feature of the kettles a tinker often mends.\n\nRobin Starveling plays the part of Moonshine in their performance of \"Pyramus and Thisbe\". His part is often considered one of the more humorous in the play, as he uses a lantern in a failed attempt to portray Moonshine and is wittily derided by his audience.\n\n"}

In 1984, Plasticville as well as the entire line was taken over by Kader Industries of Dongguan, China and made entirely in China.\n\nPlasticville buildings are a simple design, made of walls that snap together, permitting them to be assembled without glue and easily disassembled again for storage. Out of the box, Plasticville buildings are usually two-tone, with building walls of one color and the doors, windows and roof molded out of a different colored plastic. With few exceptions, Plasticville buildings are styled after 1950s suburban buildings, and the product line has not changed since the late 1950s.\n\nMost Plasticville buildings are 1:64 scale with 1:48 scale doors, a design compromise that allows them to be used with O gauge, O27 gauge, or S gauge train layouts without looking far off-scale. This allowed one product line to serve Lionel's low-end and high-end product lines as well as American Flyer's product line in the 1950s. Later, as HO scale gained popularity, Bachmann produced a line of 1:87 scale buildings for that standard.\n\nThe first Plasticville product was a plastic fence, first marketed as a Christmas tree accessory. When Bachmann found out consumers were using its product on train layouts, it also added some other accessories such as trees, bushes, and bridges. By 1950, Bachmann had added houses and stores to the product line, and Plasticville quickly became the most popular brand of train buildings on the U.S. market. Bachmann added several buildings to the product line every year until 1958. Some of these buildings were of Bachmann design, but others came from competing product lines that Bachmann absorbed in the mid-1950s.\n\nIn the late 1950s, mass-market interest in trains declined, with other pastimes, such as slot cars, gaining at their expense. Bachmann responded in 1963 by introducing a line of accessories for slot car track.\n\nAlthough not all pieces were manufactured every year, the Plasticville line has remained commercially available since the 1950s.\n\nIn 1984, Plasticville as well as the entire line OF Bachmann Industries was taken over by Kader Industries of Dongguan, China and made entirely there in China.\n\nThe only way to accurately date many Plasticville buildings is by examining its packaging. A Plasticville building has its highest collectible value when accompanied by its original box and in an unglued and unpainted state. Glued Plasticville structures are worth about 20% as much to a collector as an unglued piece, although a Plasticville piece that is nicely glued and painted will have value for use in a train layout, rather than as a collectible.\n\nThe plastic used in modern Plasticville has slightly different texture from vintage Plasticville and although Bachmann uses the same molds today as in the 1950s, it uses different colors in an effort to not diminish the collector value of its old pieces. Re-issues produced after 1997 are marked \"Made in China.\"\n\nVariations in common buildings can drive up the value. The common Plasticville one-story ranch house is worth about $5, but a variation using dark blue plastic is worth about $200.\n\nMany Plasticville collectors join the Plasticville Collectors Association (PCA). The purpose of the association is to promote a sense of fellowship among Plasticville, USA collectors and to serve as an accurate source of information regarding all aspects of Plasticville collecting for its members and the general public.\n\nWith declining values, collectors are becoming somewhat scarce since it was taken over by Kader Industries in 1984.\n\n"}

Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons, most importantly to control rodents. Vermin aboard a ship can cause damage to ropes, woodwork, and more recently, electrical wiring. Also, rodents threaten ships' stores, devour crews' foodstuff, and could cause economic damage to ships' cargo such as grain. They are also a source of disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. Rat fleas are carriers of plague, and rats on ships were believed to be a main spreader of the Black Death.\n\nCats naturally attack and kill rodents, and their natural ability to adapt to new surroundings made them suitable for service on a ship. In addition, they offer companionship and a sense of home, security and camaraderie to sailors away from home.\n\nThe domestication of cats is believed to date back to around 9,000 years ago on farms in the Near East. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board Nile boats to catch birds in the thickets along the riverbanks. A 2017 mitochondrial DNA study suggests that cats spread from ancient Egypt along maritime trade routes a few thousand years after first being domesticated. Preliminary results of a genetic study published in September 2016 concluded that cats were carried on trading ships to control rodents, and that practice was adopted by traders from many nations, including Vikings in northern Germany around the 8th to 11th centuries. The Norwegian Forest cat is a natural breed believed to have been developed from Viking ships' cats. Sailing ships spread the domestic cat throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery in the 15th through 18th centuries.\n\nSometimes worshipped as deities, cats have long had a reputation as magical animals and numerous myths and superstitions sprang up among the unusually superstitious seafaring community. They were considered to be intelligent and lucky animals, and a high level of care was devoted to keeping them happy. Some sailors believed that polydactyl cats were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. In some places polydactyl cats became known as \"ship's cats\".\n\nCats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea. It was believed to be lucky if a cat approached a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it only came halfway, and then retreated. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included, if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.\n\nSome of these beliefs are rooted in reality. Cats are able to detect slight changes in the weather, as a result of their very sensitive inner ears, which also allow them to land upright when falling. Low atmospheric pressure, a common precursor of stormy weather, often makes cats nervous and restless.\nThe prevalence of cats on ships has led to them being reported on by a number of noted seafarers. The outbreak of the Second World War, with the spread of mass communication and the active nature of the world's navies, also led to a number of ship's cats becoming celebrities in their own right.\n\nBlackie was HMS \"Prince of Wales\"'s ship's cat. During the Second World War, he achieved worldwide fame after \"Prince of Wales\" carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, in August 1941, where he secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt for several days in a secure anchorage. This meeting resulted in the declaration of the Atlantic Charter, but as Churchill prepared to step off \"Prince of Wales\", Blackie approached. Churchill stooped to bid farewell to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill. Blackie survived the sinking of \"Prince of Wales\" by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service later that year, and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and his fate is unknown.\n\nCamouflage was the ship's cat aboard a US Coast Guard LST in the Pacific theater, WWII. He was known for chasing enemy tracer rounds across the deck.\n\nChibley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship Barque \"Picton Castle\". She was rescued from an animal shelter and circumnavigated the world five times. \"Picton Castle\"’s role as a training ship resulted in Chibley being introduced to a large number of visitors and becoming a celebrity in her own right. Chibley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea.\n\nConvoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS \"Hermione\". He was so named because of the number of times he accompanied the ship on convoy escort duties. Convoy was listed in the ship's book and provided with a full kit, including a tiny hammock in which he slept. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when \"Hermione\" was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205.\n\nEmmy was the ship's cat on . She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy jumped ship while in port in Quebec City. The crew returned her to the ship, but she left again, leaving her kittens behind. The \"Empress of Ireland\" left without her, which was regarded as a terrible omen. Early the next morning \"Empress of Ireland\" collided with while steaming through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and rapidly sank, killing over 1,000 people.\n\nFelix was the ship's cat aboard \"Mayflower II\" when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957 to symbolize the solidarity between the UK and the US following World War II. He was given his own life jacket and once suffered a broken paw after a mishap. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. Photos and stories about Felix appeared in \"National Geographic\", \"Life\", and \"Yankee\" magazine after his arrival in the US. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. He was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The current captain of the \"Mayflower II\" wrote a children's book about Felix entitled \"Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures\". The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation.\n\nHalifax was the name given to Alvah and Diana Simon's ship's cat who was found in the port of Halifax, on their way to winter at Tay Bay in 1994, on \"Roger Henry\". The cat spent all of the time iced in on the boat with Alvah, when Diana had to leave for family purposes. Alvah's book \"North To The Night\" describes his adventure in the ice with Halifax the cat, who ended up losing half an ear to frostbite.\n\nJenny was the name of the ship's cat aboard and was mentioned in the accounts of several of the crew members who survived the ocean liner's fateful 1912 maiden voyage. She was transferred from \"Titanic\"s sister ship and gave birth in the week before \"Titanic\" left Southampton. The galley is where Jenny and her kittens normally lived, cared for by the victualling staff who fed them kitchen scraps. Stewardess Violet Jessop later wrote in her memoir that the cat \"laid her family near Jim, the scullion, whose approval she always sought and who always gave her warm devotion.\"\n\nJenny and her kittens went down with the ship.\n\nKiddo seemed to have stowed away on the airship \"America\", when she left from Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean in 1910. Kiddo was upset at first by the experience, but settled in and evidently, was better at predicting bad weather than the barometer. The airship's engines failed, and the small crew and Kiddo abandoned the \"America\" for lifeboats when they sighted the Royal Mail steamship \"Trent\", near Bermuda. Kiddo then was retired from being a ship's cat and was taken care of by Edith Wellman Ainsworth, the daughter of the American journalist, explorer, and aviator, Walter Wellman, who made the daring attempt.\n\nMrs Chippy (actually a male) was the ship's cat aboard \"Endurance\", the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. When the ship was lost, having become trapped and eventually crushed in pack ice, Shackleton ordered the sled dogs and Mrs Chippy shot, as Shackleton had decided that the animals could not be kept during the arduous journey ahead.\n\nNansen was the ship's cat on , which was used for the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. He was brought on board by cabin boy Johan Koren, and was named after Fridtjof Nansen. He died on 22 June 1898, and was buried in the Antarctic.\n\nPeebles was the ship's cat aboard HMS \"Western Isles\". Another cat who became a favourite of the ship's crew, he was known to be particularly intelligent and would shake the hands of strangers when they entered the wardroom.\n\nPooli served aboard a United States attack transport during the Second World War.\n\nRinda was the ship's cat on the Norwegian cargo ship , which was torpedoed and sunk during World War II. When the surviving crew realized that their beloved ship's cat was not on board the lifeboat, they rowed around in the night until they finally heard a pitiful \"miauu\" in the distance. \"We rowed as hard as we could and laughed and cried when we lifted the sopping wet furball aboard\". The cat became the ship's cat aboard the rescue ship, the British armed naval trawler , and was given the name Rinda after the previous ship.\n\nSimon was the ship's cat of HMS \"Amethyst\" during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, and was wounded in the bombardment of the ship which killed 25 of \"Amethyst\"’s crew, including the commanding officer. He soon recovered and resumed killing rats and keeping up the crew's morale. He was appointed to the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon and became a celebrity after the ship escaped the Yangtze and returned to Britain. He later succumbed to an infection and died shortly after. Tributes poured in and his obituary appeared in \"The Times\". He was posthumously awarded the Dickin Medal, the only cat ever to earn the award, and was buried with full naval honours.\n\nTarawa was a kitten rescued from a pillbox during the Battle of Tarawa by the United States Coast Guard. She was a mascot aboard an LST, but did not get along with the LST's other mascot, a dog named Kodiak, and jumped ship ashore.\n\nTiddles was the ship's cat on a number of Royal Navy aircraft carriers. He was born aboard , and later joined . He was often seen at his favourite station, on the aft capstan, where he would play with the bell-rope. He eventually travelled over during his time in service.\n\nTrim was the ship's cat on a number of the ships under the command of Matthew Flinders during voyages to circumnavigate and map the coastline of Australia during 1801–1803. He became a favourite of the crew and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. He remained with Flinders until death. He has been the subject of a number of works of literature, and statues have been placed in his honour, including one that sits on a window sill at the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney.\n\nPreviously named Oscar, he was the ship's cat of the German battleship \"Bismarck\". When she was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 out of a crew of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS \"Cossack\" (one of the ships responsible for destroying \"Bismarck\"). \"Cossack\" herself was torpedoed and sunk a few months later, on 24 October, killing 159 of her crew, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS \"Ark Royal\", which was torpedoed and sunk in November that year. Oscar was again rescued, but it was decided at that time to transfer him to a home on land. By now known as Unsinkable Sam because of surviving the three ship sinkings, he was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General's of Gibraltar office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him exists in the private collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.\n\nThe Royal Navy banned cats and other pet animals from all ships on the ocean in 1975 on hygiene grounds; however, cats are still common on many private ships.\n\nOne notable example is \"Toolbox\" (a feral kitten born in a toolbox), the senior ship's cat, official warrant officer and \"Captain's Assistant\" aboard the modern \"Kalmar Nyckel\". A celebrity in her own right, she is the subject of two books. Also, American sailor Robin Lee Graham was the youngest solo sailor to circumnavigate the globe, beginning in 1965. A number of ship's cats were included in the chronicles for the \"National Geographic Magazine\" (1968–1970) and detailed in the 1972 book \"Dove\", which was adapted into the 1974 film \"The Dove\".\n\nThere are at least two books called \"The Ship's Cat\": a 1977 children's book by Richard Adams and Alan Aldridge, and a 2000 novel by Jock Brandis. \"Matthew Flinders' Cat\" is a 2002 novel by Bryce Courtenay featuring tales about Trim, the ship's cat that circumnavigated Australia. In \"Fish Head\", a 1954 children's book by Jean Fritz, the eponymous cat unwittingly becomes a ship's cat.\n\nIn a central episode in Jan de Hartog's novel \"The Captain\", taking place on board a ship engaged in the dangerous Murmansk Convoys in the Second World War, a young officer is killed in an effort to save the ship's cat and her playful kittens during a Luftwaffe attack on the ship. This profoundly affects the main protagonist, the ship's captain, and is one of the factors leading to his later becoming a conscientious objector.\n\nIn science fiction, the role of the ship's cat has been transferred to spaceships. Notable examples include Cordwainer Smith's 1955 short story \"The Game of Rat and Dragon\" and Andre Norton's 1968 novel \"The Zero Stone\" featuring a telepathic mutant feline named Eet. On film, \"Alien\" (1979) and the sequel \"Aliens\" (1989) feature Jones (\"Jonesy\") aboard USCSS \"Nostromo\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18755674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18755674", "title": "The Blueprint 3", "text": "The Blueprint 3\n\nThe Blueprint 3 is the eleventh studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released September 8, 2009, on Roc Nation, through distribution from Atlantic Records. It is the third \"Blueprint\" album, preceded by \"The Blueprint\" (2001) and \"\" (2002). Production for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at several recording studios and was handled by Kanye West, No I.D., The Neptunes, Jeff Bhasker, Al Shux, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, The Inkredibles, Swizz Beatz, and Timbaland. This is the third\n\"Blueprint\" album in the \"Blueprint\" trilogy, as well as the first Jay-Z album since \"Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter\" (1999) to not feature production from Just Blaze.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 476,000 copies in its first week. It became Jay-Z's eleventh US number-one album, breaking the record he had previously shared with Elvis Presley, and produced five singles that achieved chart success. Upon its release, \"The Blueprint 3\" received generally positive reviews from music critics.\n\nThe earliest hype over \"The Blueprint 3\" came when DJ Clue released in January 2008 a mixtape song called \"Ain't I\", produced by Timbaland. In the intro, Clue says, \"Off that \"Blueprint 3\" baby!\" However, a spokesperson for Jay-Z said that it was an old, unreleased song and that the recording of \"The Blueprint 3\" had not yet started. On July 20, Timbaland, a frequent contributor to previous Jay-Z albums, told MTV News that he would be producing the whole album. But in an interview with the \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Jay-Z called the statement \"premature\". In July 2009, Jay-Z confirmed \"The Blueprint 3\" as the album's title during an interview with radio station Shade 45.\n\nBy November 2008, he had finished the album but with lengthy negotiations with Def Jam, he went on to reworking it. In January 2009, Jay-Z confirmed continued production of the album and admitted the leak of several songs. In a \"Billboard\" magazine interview, Jay-Z confirmed \"What We Talkin' About\", the album's intro, \"Thank You\", and \"Already Home\" as song names and collaborations with Australian dance group Empire of the Sun, rappers Drake and Kid Cudi and singer Rihanna. He also mentioned in an interview with DJ Semtex that his favorite song on the album is \"Empire State of Mind\". The official track list for \"Blueprint 3\" was revealed on August 18, confirming the guest appearances from Kanye West, Rihanna, Drake, Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, J. Cole, Alicia Keys, and more.)\n\nThe cover consists of a large amount of all-white instruments and recording tools stacked in a corner, with three red lines across the image. Rather than simply using photoshop, the album's design team carefully stacked all the equipment in a corner then used a projector to create the bars. They then painted red onto the equipment where the projection of the bars was, and replaced the projector with a camera to achieve the correct perspective for the image. \"Blueprint 3\" would be Jay-Z's first album cover that did not feature his face on it.\n\nMost of the album's recording sessions took place in Hawaii at Avex Honolulu Studio, in an effort to avoid leakage. West's protégé Mr Hudson explained to \"The Times\" that he \"won't get bothered there\" compared to a major city such as New York or Los Angeles. Sessions for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at Avex Honolulu Studio and several other recording studios, including Germano Studios, Oven Studios, and Roc The Mic in New York City, Kingdom Studios and Lava Studios in Cleveland, Midnight Blue Studios and South Beach Studios in Miami, The Holy Chateau in Perth, Australia, and Westlake Studio in Los Angeles.\n\nJay-Z told \"Rolling Stone\" his method of selecting producers: \"If Timbaland makes ten great tracks then he produces the album, if Kanye West makes ten great tracks then he produces the album; if he makes three, I'll take three. I let the music dictate the direction.\" However, the final track listing reveals, that West produced the majority of tracks on the album, and three done by Timbaland. West confirmed two songs, \"A Star Is Born\" and \"Young Forever\", during an appearance on \"The Wake Up Show\" in February 2009. Mr Hudson, who is the featured artist on the latter, described it as a flip on the Alphaville record of a similar name. During a joint interview with Hudson, West confirmed that the pop artist would be featured on three songs. Pharrell stated that he emailed \"So Ambitious\" to Jay-Z the day he was mastering the album. He loved the track so much that he put off the mastering.\n\nThe album was released September 8, 2009 on Roc Nation in the United States. It was also released digitally on September 11, 2009 in the US, and its United Kingdom and international release followed on September 14 that same year. Prior to its official release, the album leaked in its entirety on August 31, 2009. When asked about the leak, Jay-Z stated \"It's a preview. I'm excited for people to hear the album. I'm very proud of the work I've done, so enjoy it\".\n\nThe album's first single \"D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)\" was premiered on June 5, 2009 via New York radio station Hot 97. On June 7, 2009 Jay-Z made a guest appearance at Hot 97's Summer Jam concert, and performed D.O.A. live on stage, for the first time. On May 20, 2009, Jay-Z confirmed that he bought out the remainder of his contract from Def Jam Records in order to start his contract with Live Nation, as \"The Blueprint 3\" was set to be released under Roc Nation and distributed by Atlantic Records. In August 2008, Jay-Z performed the Kanye West–produced song \"Jockin' Jay-Z\" during the latter's Glow in the Dark Tour.\n\n\"The Blueprint 3\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 22 reviews. In his review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau called the album \"fairly superb\" and gave it an A- rating, indicating \"the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction\". AllMusic writer John Bush compared the album to its predecessors, describing it as \"somewhere between the two, closer to the vitality and energy of the original but not without the crossover bids and guest features of the latter (albeit much better this time)\". Leah Greenblatt of \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented that the album succeeds at its goal of \"reaching maximum commercial blast radius while maintaining its street bona fides\".\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the album four out of five stars and complimented its modern sound. \"The A.V. Club\" gave it a B+ rating and stated, \"Jay-Z sounds liberated by his legacy rather than weighed down by expectations\". Despite noting inconsistency in Jay-Z's rapping, Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" complimented the album's varied musical elements and called it \"an unexpected blend of maturity and youth\". Pete Cashmore of \"NME\" commented that it \"delivers because of hefty beats and quality rapsmanship, nothing else. And, ultimately, that'll do just fine\". Kiilian Fox of \"The Observer\" commented that Jay-Z is \"maturing into a responsible elder statesman\". Zach Baron of \"The Village Voice\" viewed that \"much of \"Blueprint 3\" is about the weird, meta-rap work of redefining what it is to be a boss\" and stated \"Jay-Z's midlife crisis is over. Which doesn't make \"The Blueprint 3\" a classic. But we'll take it. For now\".\n\nIn a mixed review, \"Slant Magazine\"s William McBee found \"The Blueprint 3\" \"predictable\", \"complacent\", and \"a hip-hop feast, for sure, filled to the brim with elite production and elite rapping, but it lacks the hungriness, the spirit, and the craziness that marks a classic album\". \"Rolling Stone\"s Jody Rosen called it \"a catchy, pop-friendly record\", but viewed that it lacks the \"electric charge\" of Jay-Z's previous albums and that he is \"stuck for a subject [...] But he says it well\". Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" wrote that it \"peters out in a mass of indistinct tracks\" following its first four songs. \"The Sunday Times\" criticized the music's \"insistent straining for a crossover, pop-coloured sheen\", writing that it \"mires much of the album in insipidness, coating stale braggadocio (without, mostly, any compensating humour).\" \"Pitchfork\"s Ian Cohen commented that it is \"so certainly Jay-Z's weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if \"Kingdom Come\" was somehow underrated\". Greg Kot of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars and viewed Jay-Z's celebrity and older age as somewhat of a flaw, stating:\n\n\"The Blueprint 3\" was ranked the best album of the year by \"Billboard\", and seventh best album of the year by MTV. \"Rolling Stone\" named it the fourth best album of 2009 in its year-end list.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart with first-week sales of 476,000 copies. It serves as the third-highest first-week sales of 2009. It became Jay-Z's eleventh US number-one album, breaking the record he had previously shared with Elvis Presley. In its second week, it remained at number 1, selling another 301,000 units, before dropping to second in its third week. After four weeks sales totaled 1,104,000 units.\nIn the album's fifth week it sold 75,000 copies bringing the total to 1,178,000 it is Jay-Z's 11th solo album to go Platinum. The album in its fifth week is also number 5 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In its sixth week the album rose up 2 spots to number 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200, despite selling 65,000 copies, 10,000 less than its previous week. 53,000 copies were sold in the US in its seventh week, putting it at number 4 on the charts. In week eight the album sold 51,000 copies. In the next week album sold 48,000 units. In next three weeks album sold over 100,000 copies and, as of May 2010, its sales in the U.S. stand at 1,748,000 units. It is Jay-Z's first album to have 3 Hot 100 Top 10 Hits.\n\nThe album was the 9th best selling album of 2009 in the U.S., selling over 1.52 million copies in 4 months, the album is now at over 1.86 million sold and still in the Top 30. \"The Blueprint 3\" was the second highest selling hip-hop album of 2009 domestically.\nIt was the 5th Highest selling Rap Album of 2010 according to Billboard.\n\nOn the week ending July 29, 2012, \"The Blueprint 3\" re-entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at 28. It has sold 1,933,000 copies in the US to date. The album sold over 3 million records worldwide.\n\nNotes\n\nSample credits\n\nArtists\nTechnical\n\nProduction\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n\n"}

The film's title song was performed by Kate Bush.\n\nYasha Mazur (Alan Arkin) is a turn-of-the-20th-century Jewish stage magician, womaniser, conman, and mystic. His great ambition is to figure out how to fly – an ambition he eventually achieves but not as a magic trick. He tours the western reaches of the old Russian Empire.\n\nYasha is married to Esther (Linda Bernstein), but he is rarely home in Lublin to see her and they have not been able to have any children. On the road, however, there are plenty of women to keep Yasha company. Among many others, there is the zaftig Zeftel Valerie Perrine and the Polish Catholic assistant, Magda Maia Danziger, who tours and performs with him. Magda's brother is Bolek (Zachi Noy), who is incompetent; and their mother is Elzbieta (Shelley Winters), who is desperate. Magda herself, it transpires, is mentally unstable.\n\nBut the great loves of Yasha's life, and the great ambition of his love, are the aristocratic but poor widow, Emilia (Louise Fletcher), whom he would marry; and her daughter, Halina (Lisa Whelchel), whom he adores as if she were his own. But Halina is ill and needs medical care, that Emilia knows Yasha will never be able to provide; so she must keep herself free to marry someone who \"can\" pay for the medical treatment her daughter needs.\n\nBut Yasha's big break looms. In addition to demonstrating a Houdini-style escape from a tank of water while shackled, Yasha convinces his manager/impresario, Wolsky (Lou Jacobi), that he can fly. So Wolsky arranges for a booking at the prestigious Alhambra theatre in Warsaw. Yasha will at last make it big!\n\nBut then Zeftel arrives unexpectedly and innocently announces she is emigrating to America – to Buenos Aires – where a man has promised her work. But Yasha knows that Buenos Aires is in Argentina, and that man who is going to take her there is a pimp who is selling her into sexual slavery. What else can Yasha do, but perform a special show of magic and card tricks for the pimp and give him money, to save Zeftel.\n\nThus he misses his big break – and discovers the next morning that Zeftel had lied to him, after he attempts to burglarise the home of Count Zaruski to steal the money Emilia needs to take Halina to Italy for her cure, and so that Emilia will marry him instead of the Count. His attempt at burglary fails because he has a vision of blood and death that distracts him. He manages to escape, using his cape as wings to glide him safely to the ground. But he is emotionally fragile, knowing that he has lost Emila and Halina, as well as his career.\n\nBut real horror awaits. He makes it back to his rooms and discovers that Magda did not go to the theatre the night before. She stayed at home, dressed her face in a clown makeup, chopped her hair with a razor, and then hanged herself.\n\nNow fully broken, Yasha returns home to Esther. His mystic vision of death having come true, he encloses himself in a brick hut with only a window, through which to receive food and communicate with people as a holy man, dispensing wisdom and blessings. Wolsky arrives, having read in the Warsaw papers about the holy man of Lublin who lives in a grave. He has brought Emilia with him, who asks Yasha's forgiveness and asks him to pray for her. She is now the Countess Zaruski, and Halina is at least in a sanitorium in Italy receiving treatment.\n\nAnother visitor from away has also come. She is a widow, heavily veiled in black mourning, who has also heard of the holy man in the brick hut, who spends his days in prayer and study of the torah, comes to seek his advice what to do. She is mourning the loss of her daughter who killed herself for love of a man, and she cannot forgive the man.\n\nSuddenly she pulls back her veil and reveals that she is Elzbieta, come with Bolek and some friends to avenge Magda's death by killing Yasha. A battering ram is brought and attacks the brick hut, again and again, until its walls collapse and the hut is opened. Elzbieta and Bolek are ready to kill the man they blame for Magda's suicide.\n\nBut Yasha is not inside the brick hut when it is open. He is nowhere to be seen but neither could he possibly have escaped. All fall back dumbfounded by an apparent miracle, and then they see a skein of geese in the sky – and one goose in particular, chasing after it.\n\nYasha truly \"had\" learned to fly.\n\nThe film was a box office and critical failure.

In addition to the Nick Jr. global acquisition, the show has been sold to free-to-air television partners internationally. Launching on Channel 5's Milkshake slot 1 November 2012, other broadcasters who have picked up the 52-episode series include TG4 in Ireland and Family Channel in Canada. Jolly Roger (Amusement Rides LTD) made a kiddie ride based on Pufferty the train, featuring the main characters Tommy & Tallulah. It features a mirror so you can see yourself on Pufferty, the Tickety Toc theme tune and 4 funny sound effects.\n\nIn the US, \"Tickety Toc\" originally aired on Nickelodeon's preschool block, but was later burned off to Nick Jr. on weekdays.\n\nIn a clock shop, there is a fun-styled cuckoo-like clock called the Tickety Toc Clock. As every hour passes, two figures come out near the top: a boy named Tommy playing his drums, and a girl named Tallulah playing her trumpet. A dog-shaped train named Pufferty also runs around on the clock's rails. However, unlike most clocks, it features a magical world called Tickety inside it; thus Tommy, Tallulah, and Pufferty would come alive and hang out there with their friends between the hours. Things don't always run smoothly.\n\nThe show centres on Tommy & Tallulah and their remarkable friends, as they race against time to keep the clock ticking and to perform their duty of chiming in the time. Through Tommy & Tallulah's madcap adventures, \"Tickety Toc\" explores concepts of teamwork, social responsibility & problem solving in a fun and engaging way.\n\nEvery show starts with Pufferty dropping off the twins after they've finished Chime Time. Tommy & Tallulah then unintentionally set off a chain of events which will ultimately threaten to prevent Chime Time from happening. With the help from one or more of the eclectic Tickety Town residents, the twins develop ways of overcoming the emotional or physical jeopardy that has been caused. Once the problem is resolved, Pufferty takes Tommy & Tallulah to the Tickety Toc Clock so Chime Time can take place again.\n\n\n\nZodiak Rights, the Consumer Products Licensing division of the Zodiak Media Group will be launching merchandise; including toys, books, games and clothing internationally from Autumn 2013. Vivid Imaginations and Just Play are the master toy partners for \"Tickety Toc\" globally. International licensing agents will represent \"Tickety Toc\" in the following countries;\n"}

{"id": "31469509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31469509", "title": "Triniscope", "text": "Triniscope\n\nThe Triniscope was an early color television system developed by RCA. It used three separate video tubes with colored phosphors producing the primary colors, combining the images through dichroic mirrors onto a screen for viewing.\n\nAs a consumer system it was enormous, expensive, impractical, and dropped as soon as the shadow mask system was successful. However, the Triniscope idea was used commercially in several niche roles for years, notably as a color replacement for the kinescope, from which it took its name.\n\nThe term can also be applied to any projection television system using three tubes, but this use is rare in the literature.\n\nColor television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \"gel\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from CBS as their color broadcast in 1950.\n\nRCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it first combined the RGB signals from the camera into one overall brightness figure, the \"luminance\". The luminance signal closely matched the existing black and white broadcasts, and would display properly on existing sets. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the broadcast signal at high-frequency. On a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets, a decoder would notice the signal, filter it out from the luminance, and then process it to retrieve the color again.\n\nAlthough RCA's system had enormous benefits over CBS's, it had not been successfully developed because it proved difficult to produce the display tubes. Compared to the CBS system, where the color changed once a frame at 144 times a second, RCA's system changed the color continually across the line, thousands of times a second, far too fast for a mechanical filter like the CBS design. Instead, the system required small dots of colored phosphor to be deposited on the screen, instead of the even coating used in conventional sets or mechanical color systems. These dots were far too small to be accurately hit by an electron gun.\n\nIf a single tube could not be built with the required performance, an obvious solution is to use multiple tubes, one for each color. A wide variety of systems attempted to use this concept, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the images for display.\n\nRCA's solution was to use three conventional black and white tubes with filters on the front to produce the three primary colors. The tubes were arranged with the green-filtered tube at the bottom of the chassis, facing up. Above it and to one side was the blue-filtered tube This was aimed at right angles to the green, so light from the two crossed in space between them. At the crossing point, a dichromic mirror was positioned to reflect the blue light up, while allowing the green light to pass through unchanged. Both \"beams\" were now traveling toward the top of the tube. A third tube and mirror completed the system by adding red to the image. A suitable red phosphor was not available at the time; instead, a red Wratten filter was placed over a tube with bright yellow phosphor, and then neutral filtered to get the proper brightness in relation to the other two tubes. All three signals then shone onto a mirror at the top of the chassis, which reflected the light forward toward the viewer.\n\nThere were numerous problems with the arrangement. The first, and most difficult to solve, was that the resulting system was enormous. One example system using three 10-inch kinescope monitors, was 40-inches high, 38-inches wide and 21-inches deep. This was the smallest of the Triniscope models produced with a reasonable display size; others had smaller chassis, but only at the cost of much smaller displays.\n\nThe signal was decoded by filtering out the color portion of the signal and sending the left-over luminance signal to all three tubes evenly. The color signal was then used to gate each color tube to the correct brightness levels. This required separate circuits for each tube, and even the most developed example required a total of 44 vacuum tubes in four separate chassis units. The system was expensive, both to build and to keep running. Given the cost and complexity, RCA also built prototype units using a two-color system, orange and cyan. Similar systems had been used to produce low-cost color films as early as the 1920s.\n\nDuring the early color meetings hosted by the FCC, the selection board made it clear they did not consider the Triniscope to be an acceptable solution. They allowed RCA to use the system in order to illustrate the dot-sequential system, but stated that only a system with a single display tube would be selected. In any event, RCA's displays never produced a reasonable image in testing.\n\nAs the FCC meetings evolved into the NTSC, other researchers at RCA were hard at work on the competing shadow mask concept. By the time the next set of presentations was ready, shadow mask tubes using one or three guns were available. These did not fare any better in viewing tests, but critically, it was due to the signaling system, not the tubes. By that point, RCA had abandoned further development of the Triniscope.\n\nAlthough the shadow mask worked, it had a number of practical drawbacks. Notable among these was the dim images it produced as a side-effect of the mask blocking off most of the power from the electron guns. Development of other solutions to the color problem continued throughout the 1950s and 60s, including commercial development of the Triniscope.\n\nThe Triniscope was first used as a color analog of the existing kinescope systems it was originally developed from. NBC and Pathé demonstrated a working system as early as 1954. However, in tests the system proved to be only \"resonsable\" so development continued in order to improve the quality.\n\nHowever, during the same period the first video tape systems were being introduced, and the expense of the color printing used in the Triniscope made it an expensive option. Improvements in color film technology improved the system and work on the concept continued into the 1970s.\n\nThe Triniscope also saw limited development for consumer television use. One example is the Mitsubishi 6CT-338, which used three 5-inch CRTs arranged behind a faux screen on the front of the display. The image was viewable as a small image centered within the larger faux screen. Using three separate tube resulted in image brightness no shadow mask set could match, but because the image was \"behind\" the front of the display, the system had a limited display angle.\n\n\n"}

Most kits were static models and used scale 1/100 for airliners, and later for smaller aircraft. They also produced a model of the Soviet spaceship Vostok (scaled 1/25) and the Energia rocket with the Soviet space shuttle Buran (1/288). Many of them are today valued collector items.\n\nVEB Plasticart was established in 1958 in Zschopau, East Germany. VEB (Volkseigener Betrieb) was a Communist-era designation, meaning \"company owned by the people\". The company was called \"KVZ\" from 1958-1969, \"MPKAB\" from 1969-1973, \"VEB Plasticart Zschopau\" from 1973-1989 and \"Mastermodell GmbH\" from 1989-1991. After a two-years break the company was sold in 1993 by the German Treuhand (an organization which privatized state owned enterprises of the GDR) to Manfred Wader. It is today called \"Plasticart\". In 1993 the company had only 37 workers left. A new factory was constructed in Elterlein, Saxony, and now the company counts over 70 workers. They no longer make kits, but playthings for toddlers. In late 2012 German company \"Reifra\" has resumed production of the some former Plasticalt model kits.\n\nThe \"VEB\" title was applied to a range of small semi-autonomous businesses in the GDR that made goods especially for export. The GDR needed to export as much as possible to earn foreign \"hard\" currency as its own \"soft\" Ostmark was not freely convertible and could only be obtained and used within the GDR. Consequently, VEB Plasticart was able to sell cheap, but well designed, plastic construction kits to the Western countries in exchange for much-needed Western currencies.\n\nThe factory was located in August-Bebel Strasse 2, 936 Zschopau, German Democratic Republic.\n\nFor a long time the name \"VEB\" has stood with modelers for plastic construction kits from East Germany. The company changed its name several times.\n\nIn addition to these company names, two more brand names were used by UK importers: \"Playfix\" from the mid-1980s and \"Nu-Bee\" from the early 1990s.\n\nStarting in a modest way with a Ilyushin Il-14 airliner in HO scale, then dabbling in the odd 1/40th scale for an Aero 45 twin engine low wing monoplane Plasticart soon progressed to something more ambitious, a scale model of the first jet turbine airliner to be produced by the GDR. This was the extraordinary Baade 152, the last development in a line of aircraft that sprung from the former Junkers works in Leipzig and Dresden (both then in the GDR). Next up was the stalwart of Interflug's European network, the four-engined Ilyushin IL-18 turboprop.\n\nThe first of the famous Soviet airliner series to appear, in 1963, was the Tupolev Tu-104, the first medium haul jet aircraft to go into regular sustained airline service. The early Plasticart Tu-104 set the standard for all the kits that followed. It was scaled at 1:100 which whilst not common for aircraft kits at the time, was close to FROG models' 1:96 scale and matched well with contemporary East German TT trains such as Berliner Bahn. In addition, the kit set a standard for being simple to assemble, with a minimal number of parts, sturdy landing gear and a full decal sheet. Instructions were a let-down though – often printed in German, Russian, Polish and Czech, these were aimed squarely at consumers in the Comecon countries, were Plasticart kits were both affordable and plentiful. There was an exploded diagram, but no English instructions.\n\nBecause the drawings were easy to obtain, Plasticart began to introduce a comprehensive range of detailed models of Soviet airliners and other Warsaw Pact aircraft. Whilst the Tu-104 had only been available with Aeroflot markings, the new introductions mostly came with Interflug decals – markings of the state airline of the GDR.\n\nThe latest airliners soon made it into the range, including the Tupolev Tu-134, Tu-154, Ilyushin's Il-62 long range airliner, the Antanov design bureau's An-24 twin engine short hauled feeder-liner and the Czech-built Let L-410 Turbolet twin prop commuter aircraft. Later additions included the remarkable Yakovlev Yak-40 tri-jet short-haul \"hot & high\" jet and the awesome Tu-144 supersonic jet, known as the Charger or as \"Concordski\" more generally. A very interesting mix of Soviet fighter aircraft and especially, helicopters, was also produced including the giant Mil Mi-10 flying crane and the famous MiG-21 \"Fishbed\" (1/100) and Sukhoi Su-7 \"Fitter\" fighters (1/72 scale).\n\nBut it is the Western airliners that are most sought after by collectors today. The eclectic choice commenced with a very large kit indeed, the Douglas DC-8-54 series. The DC-8 was in early KLM stripes livery and is today very sought after. It was subsequently re-issued with an updated KLM decal sheet.\nOne of the most pleasing box arts was completed for the De Havilland DH106 Comet 4 airliner, depicted departing from Hong Kong Kai Tak airport. Full BOAC decals are included. The SE210 Caravelle was also released in this era. Then the Boeing 727-100 got the Plasticart treatment with good box art in Pan-Am colours. Plasticart then added the Hawker Siddeley Trident and the Dassault Mercure of French airline Air Inter.\n\nLater models, such as the 1/72 scale Junkers G23/24 tri-motor corrugated aluminium airliner were detailed and well moulded. Western fighter jets also made an appearance with the introduction of the delta-wing Saab Draken in 1/100 to complement the MiG-21. Along with the aircraft and helicopter kits, VEB Plasticart also produced a model of the first manned spaceship Vostok 3KA (1/25) and the Soviet Energia rocket with Buran (1/288). The Vostok kit is almost the same size as Revell's Vostok, and the box artwork is also very similar, but the two are completely different. Revell's Vostok is actually 1/24 scale and it was initially released in the late 1960s.\n\nCivil aircraft (Eastern)\nCivil aircraft (Western)\nMilitary aircraft\nHelicopter\nSpacecraft\n\n"}

The mytheme, which is similar to that of the World Elephant and World Serpent, occurs in Hindu mythology, Chinese mythology and the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The \"World-Tortoise\" mytheme was discussed comparatively by Edward Burnett Tylor (1878:341).\n\nThe World Turtle in Hindu mythology is known as \"Akupāra\" (Sanskrit: अकूपार), or sometimes \"Chukwa\". An example of a reference to the World Turtle in Hindu literature is found in Jñānarāja (the author of \"Siddhāntasundara\", writing c. 1500): \"A vulture, which has only little strength, rests in the sky holding a snake in its beak for a prahara [three hours]. Why can [the deity] in the form of a tortoise, who possesses an inconceivable potency, not hold the Earth in the sky for a \"kalpa\" [billions of years]?\"\nThe British philosopher John Locke made reference to this in his 1689 tract, \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", which compares one who would say that properties inhere in \"substance\" to the Indian, who said the world was on an elephant, which was on a tortoise, \"but being again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-backed tortoise, replied—something, he knew not what\".\n\n\"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" lists, without citation, \"Maha-pudma and Chukwa\" as names from a \"popular rendition of a Hindu myth in which the tortoise Chukwa supports the elephant Maha-pudma, which in turn supports the world\".\n\nIn Chinese mythology, the creator goddess Nüwa cut the legs off the giant sea turtle Ao () and used them to prop up the sky after Gong Gong damaged Mount Buzhou, which had previously supported the heavens.\n\nThe Lenape myth of the \"Great Turtle\" was first recorded between 1678 and 1680 by Jasper Danckaerts. The myth is shared by other indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands, notably the Iroquois.\n\nThe \"Jesuit Relations\" contain a Huron story concerning the World Turtle:\n\n'When the Father was explaining to them [some Huron seminarists] some circumstance of the passion of our Lord, and speaking to them of the eclipse of the Sun, and of the trembling of the earth which was felt at that time, they replied that there was talk in their own country of a great earthquake which had happened in former times; but they did not know either the time or the cause of that disturbance. \"There is still talk,\" (said they) \"of a very remarkable darkening of the Sun, which was supposed to have happened because the great turtle which upholds the earth, in changing its position or place, brought its shell before the Sun, and thus deprived the world of sight.\"'\n\n"}
