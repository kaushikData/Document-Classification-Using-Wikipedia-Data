The first champion was crowned on March 17, 2013, when Fénix won a tournament for the title. On August 17, 2014, the title was unified with the AAA Cruiserweight Championship.\n\nThe championship was generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition.\n\nIn late 2012, AAA introduced a new television program, titled \"AAA Fusión\", which would start airing alongside the promotion's primary television program, \"Sin Límite\". The first show was taped on September 30, 2012. The following November, AAA started a tournament to determine the inaugural AAA Fusión Champion. On April 23, 2013, AAA split its entire roster into two brands; AAA Evolución and AAA Fusión, with the AAA Fusión Championship becoming exclusive to the latter. On June 27, 2014, AAA announced that the AAA Fusión Championship and the AAA Cruiserweight Championship would be unified on August 17 at Triplemanía XXII. El Hijo del Fantasma won the ten-way elimination match to unify the two titles into the new \"AAA World Cruiserweight Championship\".\n\nThe AAA Fusión Championship tournament started on November 3, 2012, when Fénix defeated Dark Dragon, Drago and Toscano in a four-way elimination match to become the first wrestler to advance to the finals. The second tournament match took place on November 18, when Daga defeated Jack Evans, Joe Líder and Psicosis in another four-way elimination match. The final two first round elimination matches took place on March 1, 2013, when Juventud Guerrera defeated Aero Star, Pentagón Jr. (Dark Dragon's second appearance in the tournament) and Último Gladiador, while Crazy Boy defeated Angélico, Halloween and Super Fly. The finals of the tournament took place on March 17 at \"Rey de Reyes\", where Fénix defeated Crazy Boy, Daga and Juventud Guerrera to become the inaugural champion.\n\n"}

{"id": "29829201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29829201", "title": "Battlecade Extreme Fighting", "text": "Battlecade Extreme Fighting\n\nBattlecade: Extreme Fighting, sometimes referred to simply as Extreme Fighting, is a now defunct mixed martial arts promotion which hosted four events in the United States and Canada between 1995 and 1997. Although few events were held, a number of well known fighters competed for the promotion. Battlecade CEO Rick Blume is credited with coining the phrase \"mixed martial arts\" and the promotion was the first to implement weight classes in MMA.\n\nDespite the number of fighters which the promotion was able to attract, Battlecade struggled financially and had trouble with authorities over the sanctioning of MMA bouts. Following the fourth and final Extreme Fighting event, General Media International, Battlecade sponsor and publisher of Penthouse, withdrew their financial support of the promotion. Additionally, cable television providers Tele-Communications Inc. and Request TV refused to air further Extreme Fighting events.\n\nThe first Extreme Fighting event was planned to be held in Brooklyn, New York on November 18, 1995. Pressure from state politicians forced the event to be moved to Wilmington, North Carolina on a single day's notice. This event featured a four-man heavyweight tournament which was won by eventual American Top Team co-founder Marcus Silveira. Silveira defeated Victor Tatarkin of Russia by submission via strikes in the semi-finals of the tournament, moving on to defeat Gary Myers via guillotine choke in the finals. With his victory over Myers, Silveira became the Extreme Fighting Heavyweight Champion.\n\nThis event also featured a four-man middleweight tournament, showcasing judoka Igor Zinoviev and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner Mario Sperry. Zinoviev defeated his first opponent, Harold German, an accomplished but notably outweighed New York-based boxer, by submission via strikes. Sperry won by the same means against his opponent, UFC 6 competitor Rudyard Moncayo. Zinoviev defeated Sperry in the finals by technical knockout to become Extreme Fighting Middleweight Champion.\n\nIn addition to the two tournaments held that night, the event featured Ralph Gracie and a bout between Carlson Gracie Jr. and John Lewis which ended in a draw after twenty minutes.\n\nOn April 26, 1996, a second Extreme Fighting event was held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Marcus Silveira and Igor Zinoviev were victorious in separate bouts. An eighteen-year-old Carlos Newton, who would go on to become a champion in the UFC, made his professional debut that night, fighting eventual K-1 USA Grand Prix '98 competitor, and a man almost twice his size, in Jean Riviere. Newton lost the bout via submission by a small package(when an opponent is on their back with their legs being smashed atop of them).\n\nRalph Gracie returned to action and was declared Extreme Fighting Lightweight Champion after defeating Steve Nelson via submission in the first round of their bout.\n\nDespite arrangements made with the Kahnawake tribal council for the event to be held, Montreal authorities arrested a number of the evening's competitors, the referee, announcer, and Battlecade's matchmaker following the event.\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma hosted the third Extreme Fighting event on the night of October 18, 1996. In one of the most recognized bouts from the short-lived promotion, kickboxer and eventual UFC Heavyweight Champion Maurice Smith defeated Marcus Silveira via technical knockout to become the new Extreme Fighting Heavyweight Champion.\n\nMatt Hume and Erik Paulson, who both went on to become well known trainers after their fighting careers ended, battled until Paulson suffered a cut in the third round of their bout.\n\nIgor Zinoviev retained his middleweight championship after fighting to a draw with John Lober. A bout between John Lewis and Vale Tudo fighter Johil de Oliveira also ended in a draw.\n\nRalph Gracie submitted Ali Mihoubi via armbar to retain his lightweight championship. Eventual Pride competitor Kazunari Murakami defeated Bart Vale via technical knockout, while Anthony Macias submitted to the strikes of Allan Goes. Angolan fighter João Roque - who went on to compete in the UFC, DEEP, and Shooto - defeated Abdelaziz Cherigui via armbar.\n\nThe final Extreme Fighting event was held in Des Moines, Iowa on March 28, 1997. Kevin Jackson, Olympic gold medalist freestyle wrestler and winner of the UFC 14 middleweight tournament, defeated John Lober via arm triangle choke. In what was his lone professional MMA bout, Kenny Monday, another Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling, defeated John Lewis via technical knockout.\n\nMatt Hume proved victorious against Miletich Fighting Systems founder Pat Miletich, who suffered a fight-ending broken nose. Allan Goes defeated Todd Bjornethun via triangle choke, while Erik Paulson fought Paul Jones to a draw.\n\nFinally, Maurice Smith defended his heavyweight title against Kazunari Murakami. Their bout ended decisively, as Smith knocked Murakami out in the first round.\n\nNeither the middleweight or lightweight titles were defended on the final Extreme Fighting card, as champions Igor Zinoviev and Ralph Gracie did not appear. Zinoviev was unable to compete because of a separated shoulder. Gracie's scheduled opponent, Luta Livre fighter Eugenio Tadeu, was unable to attend the event and Battlecade could not find a replacement in time.\n\n"}

{"id": "46810411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46810411", "title": "Bruno (bear actor)", "text": "Bruno (bear actor)\n\nBruno, also called Ben or Gentle Ben (1962− c. 1981) was a male American black bear actor best known for playing the leading role of Ben the bear in the 1967-1969 CBS television series, \"Gentle Ben\". He also played the adult Ben in the feature film prequel to the TV series, \"Gentle Giant\" (1967). In 1968, Bruno received a first-place PATSY Award for his work on the \"Gentle Giant\" film and a second-place award for his work on the TV series. After the \"Gentle Ben\" series ended, Bruno made another well-received appearance in the 1972 John Huston-directed film \"The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\", starring Paul Newman.\n\nHe is not related or otherwise connected to the earlier bear actor also named \"Bruno the Bear\" who appeared in several Mack Sennett comedies and similar comedy films, such as \"Her Week-End\" starring Gale Henry, during the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nBruno was acquired by Ralph Helfer's Africa U.S.A. animal ranch sometime before 1965. Africa U.S.A., at that time located in Soledad Canyon near Saugus, California, provided trained animals to Hollywood for film and television work, including many Ivan Tors productions. According to Ken Beck and Jim Clark, Bruno and a brother were orphaned in Wisconsin as cubs, and later acquired by Helfer from a private party. It was reported during the \"Gentle Ben\" series run that Bruno (who at that point had been renamed \"Ben\" for the run of the show) had been \"discovered\" in White Lake, Wisconsin, and that he was 6 years old in 1968, making his birth year 1962. Ralph Helfer confirmed in 1970 that one of the bears who appeared in \"Gentle Ben\" was obtained from Ivan Walters' game farm in White Lake.\n\nAnthony \"Tony\" Pelky, owner of the Chain Lake Game Farm near Lakewood, Wisconsin, and his son claimed during Pelky's lifetime and in his 1986 obituaries that Pelky was the \"man who raised Gentle Ben\" from a cub. According to Tony Pelky, \"Gentle Ben\" and his two brothers were born near Lakewood in 1962. Shortly after their birth, their mother was killed by a hunter and the cubs were adopted and bottle-fed by the hunter's son. A local game warden took the cubs as wards of the state and offered one cub to Pelky. (According to the \"Milwaukee Journal\", the other two cubs were given to a game farm near Langlade, Wisconsin, and eventually appeared on the Ivan Tors-produced TV series \"Daktari\", which was filmed primarily at Africa U.S.A. using its animals.) Pelky said that the cub, which he named \"Smokey\", was \"the tamest bear he ever saw\" although the bear had no training. Smokey, who eventually grew to an adult size of 650 pounds, would allow a man to put an arm in his mouth without biting and would back away from a dog rather than fight. According to the Pelkys, Africa U.S.A. trainers heard about the bear, were impressed by his docile temperament and large size, and purchased him from Pelky for either $500 or $600. The Pelkys said that they later recognized the bear shown in the opening theme sequence of \"Gentle Ben\", which was Bruno, as the bear they had sold. However, Pelky also said that the sale took place in 1968 whereas Bruno was reportedly acquired by Africa U.S.A. in 1962 and was living at the Africa U.S.A. ranch by 1965. A 1967 interview with \"Gentle Ben\" actor Dennis Weaver refers to a bear named \"Smokey\" that \"alternate[d] with Bruno as Gentle Ben\" in the series. \n\nAfter Bruno arrived at Africa U.S.A., he was declawed and his teeth were removed, and he was trained for acting work using Helfer's \"affection training\" system, a method which seeks to establish a bond between animal and trainer by the trainer giving affection and attention, rather than relying on physical punishment or food rewards. Throughout his career, his weight (which may have fluctuated) was reported at different levels between 600 and 800 pounds, and his height has been variously stated as 7, 7 1/2. or just over 8 feet tall.\n\nBruno made his film debut in 1965 in the Ivan Tors/ MGM film \"Zebra in the Kitchen\", about animals set free from a zoo. He also appeared on Tors' hit television series \"Daktari\" as a guest star, playing a sick circus bear who escapes into the African bush. An April 1966 article by Cleveland Amory in \"TV Guide\" described Bruno as \"a 7-foot, 700-pound black bear, perhaps the biggest 'working' bear in the world and yet so gentle children can ride him.'\" \n\nBefore he became known as the star of \"Gentle Ben\", Bruno narrowly escaped death or serious injury at least twice. On December 29, 1965, record rains caused an 8-foot-deep flash flood at the Africa U.S.A. compound in Soledad Canyon. The vast majority of animals were saved, but Bruno was washed away and could not be found after the floodwaters subsided. The Ivan Tors production unit, via radio and newspapers, asked area residents not to shoot him on sight, and assured the public that he had no teeth and was \"harmless and just loves Cokes or fruit.\" A few days later, Bruno returned to the ranch of his own accord and scratched at his cage to be let back in. He was several pounds lighter and covered with mud, but in good health. \n\nOn July 12, 1966, a runaway Southern Pacific locomotive (or according to some accounts, a flatcar carrying a steam-powered crane) suddenly derailed and crushed several cages in the Africa U.S.A. compound, killing a railroad employee. Bruno's cage was demolished, but he was unharmed because his trainers had taken him out of the cage for a walk shortly before the accident occurred.\n\nBruno rose to fame when he appeared in the leading role of the adult Ben the bear in Tors' 1967 feature film \"Gentle Giant\" and the 1967-1969 CBS television series based on the film, \"Gentle Ben\". The film and series concern the adventures of a large male bear named Ben and his human companion Mark Wedloe, a little boy whose father is a wildlife officer in the Florida Everglades. Bruno traveled to Florida to film the series, and had difficulty adjusting to the heat, causing him to lose weight and necessitating trips back to Africa U.S.A. to get him back in shape. Following a January 1969 flood which severely damaged Africa U.S.A., he was permanently relocated to Florida.\n\nAlthough several bears were used to play the adult Ben depending on the desired behavior for a scene (for example, different bears were used for running, fighting, and swimming), Bruno was the favorite due to his large size, relatively docile temperament, broad range of behaviors, facial expressions, and ability to work well with children. Helfer said that \"Bruno did most of his own work,\" including riding the airboat shown in the series, doing his own \"attacks\", and \"grabbing the bad guy.\" According to actor Clint Howard, who co-starred as Mark in the film and series, Bruno, along with a bear named Buck that was used for running scenes because Bruno did not like to run, did 75% of the work. Howard, who was a young child between 6 and 10 years old when working with Bruno, said that he never had any trouble working with him except once when Bruno sat on him and had to be gotten off by the trainers.\n\nBruno was known for his prodigious appetite, with Coca-Cola, fruit and Tootsie Rolls being among his favorite foods. When a script called for him to reject his food, he continued to eat despite being fed large meals beforehand and the crew covering the food used in the scene with cold cream and Chanel No. 5. He also frequently stole cigarettes from the cast and crew and ate them. Helfer said, \"We had a game we played during lunch. We would run around [Bruno] in a circle, and he would catch us in his arms, and we would wrestle, which was fun. When he got tired, he would sit on you.\"\n\nDuring the 1967-1969 run of the series, Bruno's name in articles and other publicity materials was briefly changed to \"Ben\" or sometimes \"Gentle Ben\". After the series ended, his name was changed back to Bruno. (In addition to Bruno, other bears who had appeared in or been involved with the series were also publicly exhibited under the name \"Gentle Ben\" throughout the late 1960s and 1970s.) \n\nSeveral trainers were involved with the \"Gentle Giant\" film and/or the \"Gentle Ben\" TV show, but most of the day-to-day work on the show with Bruno was handled by Monty Cox and Vern Debord. Head trainer Cox lived with Bruno in a Miami apartment in order to give him the necessary affection and attention he needed. According to Cox, Bruno sometimes followed him into the shower and slept in his bed.\n\nAfter the \"Gentle Ben\" TV series ended in 1969, Bruno moved back to the Soledad Canyon area near Saugus and Acton, California, with trainer Ron Oxley, who had worked as a trainer on \"Gentle Ben\" and was now setting up his own business, Action Animals, to provide trained animals for film and TV work. (At that time, Africa U.S.A. had been forced to close and go through a lengthy relocation after suffering extensive damage from two major floods and a fire during early 1969.) Bruno lived with Oxley and a trained lion named Neil (who later lived for a time in a house with actress Tippi Hedren and her family). Bruno and Neil were friendly with each other and Oxley sometimes took both of them to acting job locations, even if only one had a part. After Oxley's death, his obituary mentioned them as his two most prized animals out of many that he had trained. \n\nIn November 1972, Bruno received publicity for appearing in an episode of \"Gunsmoke\" entitled \"Tatum\" (Season 18, Episode 10). Due to the desert location, Bruno's scenes had to be shot in the early morning before the ground got too hot for his paws. By this point, Bruno was being credited with over 400 television appearances.\n\nBruno again made news for his appearance as Watch Bear (aka Zachary Taylor), the bear companion of Judge Roy Bean played by Paul Newman in the 1972 John Huston-directed film \"The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\". The bear character was a fictionalized version of a real pet black bear, coincidentally also named \"Bruno\", that the real-life Judge Roy Bean had kept while serving as a justice of the peace in Langtry, Texas, in the late 1800s. During production, Oxley brought Neil the lion along with Bruno to the filming location, where Neil reportedly urinated on a visiting journalist and caused havoc by wandering into actress Jacqueline Bisset's trailer. Huston \"fuss[ed] over\" both animals and encouraged Newman to grow a beard for the film in order to blend in with Bruno. Although the movie received mixed reviews, Bruno received good reviews for his performance. Some critics as well as Newman himself opined that Bruno had stolen every scene in which he appeared with Newman. \n\nOther feature films in which Bruno appeared included the family adventure movie \"The Adventures of the Wilderness Family\" (1975), the horror film \"Shadow of the Hawk\" (1976) starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and the TV movie \"Guardian of the Wilderness\" (1976), a biopic of Yosemite National Park protector Galen Clark.\n\nBruno also continued to make TV appearances, including on the 1973 \"Mama\" Cass Elliot TV special \"Don't Call Me Mama Anymore\" and \"The Merv Griffin Show\". He also made occasional personal appearances with Oxley at circuses and events.\n\nIn 1968, Bruno won the PATSY Award in the motion picture category for his work in \"Gentle Giant\". He was also nominated in the TV category for the \"Gentle Ben\" series, but placed second, losing out to Arnold the Pig from \"Green Acres\". \nHe was nominated for another PATSY in 1973 for \"The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\" and again in 1977 for \"Guardian of the Wilderness\", but did not win.\n\nAfter Ron Oxley's sudden death in 1985, his friend Carol Riggins stated in one of his obituaries that Bruno the bear had died \"four or five years ago\", which placed Bruno's death in 1980 or 1981 at the age of 18 or 19.\n\n\n\n1966 Cleveland Amory article from \"TV Guide\" posted on a \"Daktari\" fan site - contains information about Bruno at Africa U.S.A. and a photo of Bruno \n"}

Autodesk Maya is used predominantly throughout the VFX and Animation industry, with Softimage also having a large user-base. In the gaming industry, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max have been the dominant presence.\n\nMany studios pair off-the-shelf software with their own in-house software and plug-ins for rigging and simulation. For instance, Industrial Light & Magic does much of their sim setup and simulation in a proprietary package called Zeno, and Weta Digital uses an in-house simulation system they call Tissue.\n\nNotable newcomers to the field of rigging include the independent platform Fabric Engine, being used by Double Negative, MPC and Hybride.\n\nWithin the VFX, Animation, and Game Development communities, a number of artists have gained name-recognition for their contributions to the field of rigging. A few of those artists include:\n\nAn EA and LucasArts Character TD Known for pioneering and disseminating (through his book \"\") a type of facial-rigging that did not rely on phonemes and pre-built expressions, but rather the blending of more generic poses using simplified controls often referred to as Osipa-Style controls.\n\nA Weta and Dreamworks Creature TD Known for his video series \"Animator Friendly Rigging\", wherein he discusses techniques for building complex rigging control systems that are intuitive and easy to use (thus the term \"Animator Friendly\").\n\nA Naughty Dog Character TD Known for his implementation of the Skinning Converter, converting any sequence of meshes to a set of animated Joints and automated Skinning maps.\nAnother interesting Plugin is the RBF Solver, a global interpolator N-dimensional.\n"}

{"id": "3018540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3018540", "title": "Criticism of the BBC", "text": "Criticism of the BBC\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) took its present form on 1 January 1927 when Sir John Reith became its first Director General. Reith stated that impartiality and objectivity were the essence of professionalism in broadcasting.\n\nAllegations that the corporation lacks impartial and objective journalism are regularly made by observers, on both the left and right of the political spectrum.\n\nAnother key area of criticism is the mandatory licence fee, as commercial competitors argue that this means of financing is unfair and has the result of limiting their ability to compete with the corporation. Also, accusations of waste or over-staffing occasionally prompt comments from politicians and the rest of the media.\n\nAccusations of a left-wing bias were often made against the Corporation by members of Margaret Thatcher's 1980s Conservative government. Norman Tebbit called the BBC the \"Stateless Person's Broadcasting Corporation\" because of what he regarded as its unpatriotic and neutral coverage of the Falklands War, and Conservative MP Peter Bruinvels called it the \"Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation.\" Steve Barnett wrote in \"The Observer\" in 2001 that in 1983, Stuart Young, the \"accountant and brother of one of Thatcher's staunchest cabinet allies\", David Young, was appointed as BBC chairman. After him, in 1986, came Marmaduke Hussey, a \"brother-in-law of another Cabinet Minister. ... According to the then-Tory party chairman, Norman Tebbit, Hussey was appointed 'to get in there and sort the place out'\".\n\nControversies continued with the likes of the \"Nationwide\" general election special with Thatcher in 1983, a \"Panorama\" documentary called Maggie's Militant Tendency, the \"Real Lives\" interview with Martin McGuinness, the BBC's coverage of the United States' 1986 Bombing of Libya and the Zircon affair. In 1987, the Director-General of the BBC Alasdair Milne was forced to resign. Thatcher later said: \"I have fought three elections against the BBC and don't want to fight another against it.\" In 2006 Tebbit said: \"The BBC was always against Lady Thatcher.\"\n\nMark Thompson, Director General of the BBC said in 2010 \"In the BBC I joined 30 years ago [as a production trainee, in 1979], there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people's personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left. The organisation did struggle then with impartiality.\"\n\nBBC News forms a major department of the Corporation, and receives many complaints of bias. The Centre for Policy Studies has stated that, \"Since at least the mid-1980s, the Corporation has often been criticised for a perceived bias against those on the centre-right of politics.\" Similar allegations have been made by past and present employees such as Antony Jay, North American editor Justin Webb, former editor of the \"Today\" programme Rod Liddle, former correspondent Robin Aitken and Peter Sissons, a former news presenter.\n\nFormer political editor Andrew Marr argued in 2006 that the liberal bias of the BBC is the product of the types of people the Corporation employs, and is thus cultural not political. In 2011, Peter Oborne wrote in his \"Daily Telegraph\" blog, \"Rather than representing the nation as a whole, it [the BBC] has become a vital resource – and sometimes attack weapon – for a narrow, arrogant Left-Liberal elite\".\n\nSpeaking to journalists at a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch in 2009, Jeremy Hunt, the Shadow Cabinet Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, claimed that BBC News needed more people from the centre-right \"I wish they would go and actively look for some Conservatives to be part of their news-gathering team, because they have acknowledged that one of their problems is that people who want to work at the Corporation tend to be from the centre-left. That's why they have this issue with what Andrew Marr called an innate liberal bias.\"\n\nOther commentators have taken the opposite view and criticised the BBC for being part of The Establishment. The commentator Mehdi Hasan in the \"New Statesman\" pointed out the right-wing backgrounds of many BBC presenters and journalists, querying why even many \"liberals and leftists\" accept the right's description of BBC bias. \"Guardian\" columnist Owen Jones is also of the opinion that the BBC is biased towards the right owing to numerous key posts being filled by Conservatives.\n\nA study by Cardiff University academics, funded by the BBC Trust, was published in August 2013, examining the BBC's coverage of a broad range of issues. One of the findings was the dominance of party political sources. In coverage of immigration, the EU and religion, these accounted for 49.4% of all source appearances in 2007 and 54.8% in 2012. The data also showed that the Conservative Party received significantly more airtime than the Labour Party. In 2012 Conservative leader David Cameron outnumbered Labour leader Ed Miliband in appearances by a factor of nearly four to one (53 to 15), while Conservative cabinet members and ministers outnumbered their Labour counterparts by more than four to one (67 to 15).\n\nFormer Director General of the BBC, Greg Dyke, has criticised the BBC as part of a \"Westminster conspiracy\" to maintain the British political system.\n\nOn Friday 22 September 2004 the BBC's Board of Governors held an impartiality seminar which was streamed live on the Internet. The previous day the then Chairman of the Governors, Michael Grade, explained the thinking behind the seminar in an article in \"The Guardian\" newspaper. He also announced in the same article that a live stream of the seminar would be available on the BBC Governors' website.\n\nIn the seminar there was a hypothetical discussion including senior BBC executives about what they would allow controversial Jewish comedian Sacha Baron Cohen to throw into a dustbin on the satirical television show \"Room 101\". It was imagined that Baron Cohen would wish to throw into Room 101 kosher food, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Quran, and the Bible. Most at the summit agreed that all would be permissible – except for the Quran. There was also a hypothetical discussion about whether a Muslim BBC newsreader should be allowed to wear a veil.\n\nIn the seminar former BBC business editor Jeff Randall claimed he was told by a senior news executive in the organisation that \"The BBC is not neutral in multiculturalism: it believes in it and it promotes it.\" The \"Daily Mail\" claimed in 2006 that Andrew Marr stated, \"The BBC is not impartial or neutral. It's a publicly funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, ethnic minorities and gay people. It has a liberal bias not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias\".\n\nThese comments were reported in the UK national press a couple of weeks later. At the seminar Helen Boaden (Director of BBC News) said that the BBC must be impartial on the issue of multiculturalism. Boaden responded to press criticism of the seminar in a post on the BBC's Editors' Blog. Mark Thompson responded to press criticism in an article in the \"Daily Mail\", as did Mark Byford in an interview in \"The Sunday Telegraph\".\n\nThe BBC has also been accused of racism. In a speech to the Royal Television Society in 2008, Lenny Henry said that ethnic minorities were \"pitifully underserved\" in television comedy and that little had changed at senior levels in terms of ethnic representation during his 32 years in television. Jimmy McGovern in a 2007 interview called the BBC \"one of the most racist institutions in England\".\n\nIn 2001, BBC director-general Greg Dyke said that the BBC was \"hideously white\", and acknowledged difficulties with \"race relations\". He acknowledged that it was having difficulties in retaining minority staff and outlined plans towards solving these problems.\n\nRageh Omaar, the Somali-born British journalist and former BBC war correspondent who reported the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, called BBC a \"white man’s club\" after he resigned to join Al-Jazeera in 2006. Later, in 2007, while being interviewed by Hannah Pool of \"The Guardian\", he accused the BBC of classism too.\n\nThe BBC, which is legally obliged to be an equal opportunities employer, is striving for 12.5% of its staff to be from a black or minority ethnic background (12% at 31 January 2009). The BBC's buildings are largely based in urban areas with a more diverse demography than the UK as a whole (30% ethnic minority population in London and about 15% in the Manchester/Salford area), whereas the 12.5% figure is over 4% higher than the current percentage of ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom as a whole. However, it has been argued that many of its ethnic minority members of staff are cleaners and security guards and not presenters and programme makers. \"The Guardian\" reported: \"The BBC has pledged to increase the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people on air by more than 40% over the next three years and almost double the number of senior managers from those groups who work at the corporation by 2020.\"\n\nIndarjit Singh, chief of Britain's Network of Sikh Organisations, criticised the BBC Asian Network, a radio station intended for an audience of South Asian origin, saying \"Stations like BBC Asian Network do little to encourage integration and social cohesion because they allow communities to ghettoise themselves\".\n\n\"The Independent\" reported the findings of a University of Leeds study in March 2006 which accused the BBC of being \"institutionally homophobic\" towards the LGBT community. The Leeds researchers found that 80% of portrayals by the BBC of those who are lesbian or gay were negative and accounted for just 0.4% of output. Focus groups used in the study accused the BBC of being the worst broadcaster in terms of gay and lesbian issues and their portrayal of them.\n\nA report commissioned by the BBC Trust, \"Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century\", published in June 2007, stressed that the BBC needed to take more care in being impartial. It said the BBC broke its own guidelines by screening an episode of \"The Vicar of Dibley\" that promoted the Make Poverty History campaign. The bias was explained as the result of the BBC's liberal culture. A transcript of the impartiality seminar is included as a separately published appendix to the report available via the BBC Trust.\n\nAfter press reports emerged that BBC employees had edited the Wikipedia article's coverage of the report, the BBC issued new guidelines banning BBC staff from \"sanitising\" Wikipedia articles about the BBC.\n\nIn 2005, two independent reports deemed the BBC's coverage of the European Union to be rather inadequate and one of the reports noted a \"cultural and unintentional bias\".\n\nIn July 2013, a report commissioned by the BBC Trust found that the organisation had been slow to reflect widespread public concerns about immigration to the UK, and shifts in public attitudes within the UK towards the European Union. The report, by Stuart Prebble, stated that Helen Boaden, the former director of BBC News, had said that when she arrived at the organisation there had been a \"deep liberal bias\" in the handling of immigration issues. It also stated that, within the BBC, \"the agenda of debate is probably too driven by the views of politicians\", but that \"overall the breadth of opinion reflected by the BBC on this subject is broad and impressive, and no persuasive evidence was found that significant areas of opinion are not given due weight today.\" It also stated that the BBC was \"slow to give appropriate prominence to the growing weight of opinion opposing UK membership of the EU, but in more recent times has achieved a better balance\".\n\nTo contrast, in 2018, former BBC (now ITV) journalist Robert Peston accused the organisation of not being \"confident enough\" in pointing out false arguments during the campaign, and giving a false balance of impartiality. Peston said that the organisation \"put people on with diametrically opposed views and didn't give their viewers and listeners any help in assessing which one was the loony and which one was the genius. ... Impartial journalism is not giving equal airtime to two people one of whom says the world is flat and the other one says the world is round\".\n\nCriticism of the BBC's Middle East coverage from supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians led the BBC to commission an investigation and report from a senior broadcast journalist Malcolm Balen, referred to as the Balen Report and completed in 2004. The BBC's refusal to release the report under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 resulted in a long-running and ongoing legal case. This led to speculation that the report was damning, as well as to accusations of hypocrisy, as the BBC frequently made use itself of Freedom of Information Act requests when researching news stories.\n\nAfter the Balen report, the BBC appointed a committee chosen by the Governors and referred to by the BBC as an \"independent panel report\" to write a report for publication which was completed in 2006. Chaired by the British Board of Film Classification president, Sir Quentin Thomas, the committee found that \"apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias\" in the BBC's reporting of the middle east. However, their coverage had been \"inconsistent,\" \"not always providing a complete picture\" and \"misleading\", and that the BBC failed to adequately report the hardships of Palestinians living under occupation. Reflecting concerns from all sides of the conflict, the committee highlighted certain identifiable shortcomings and made four recommendations, including the provision of a stronger editorial \"guiding hand\".\n\nOf the report's findings regarding the dearth of BBC reporting of the difficulties faced by the Palestinians, Richard Ingrams wrote in \"The Independent\" that \"No sensible person could quarrel with that judgement\". Martin Walker, then the editor of United Press International, agreed that the report implied favouritism towards Israel, but said this suggestion \"produced mocking guffaws in my newsroom\" and went on to list a number of episodes of (in his view) clear pro-Palestinian bias on the part of the BBC. Writing in \"Prospect\" magazine, Conservative MP Michael Gove wrote that the report was neither independent nor objective.\n\nFormer BBC Middle East correspondent Tim Llewellyn wrote in 2004 that the BBC's coverage allowed an Israeli view of the conflict to dominate, as demonstrated by research conducted by the Glasgow Media Group.\n\nDouglas Davis, the London correspondent of \"The Jerusalem Post\", has accused the BBC of being anti-Israel. He wrote that the BBC's coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict was a \"portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors\" and resembled a \"campaign of vilification\" that had de-legitimised the State of Israel. \"Anglicans for Israel\", the pro-Israel pressure group, have berated the BBC for apparent anti-Israel bias.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" has criticised the BBC for its coverage of the Middle East. In 2007, the newspaper wrote, \"In its international and domestic news reporting, the corporation has consistently come across as naïve and partial, rather than sensitive and unbiased. Its reporting of Israel and Palestine, in particular, tends to underplay the hate-filled Islamist ideology that inspires Hamas and other factions, while never giving Israel the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nIn April 2004, Natan Sharansky who was then Israel's minister for diaspora affairs wrote to the BBC accusing its Middle East correspondent, Orla Guerin, as having a \"deep-seated bias against Israel\" following her description of the Israeli army's handling of the arrest of Hussam Abdo, who was captured with explosives strapped to his chest, as \"cynical manipulation of a Palestinian youngster for propaganda purposes.\"\n\nIn March 2006 a report about the Arab-Israeli conflict on the BBC's online service was criticised in a BBC Governors Report as unbalanced and creating a biased impression. The article's account of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 in 1967 concerning the Six-Day War between Israel and a coalition of Egypt, Jordan and Syria \"suggested the UN called for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from territories seized during the six-day war, when in fact, it called for a negotiated 'land for peace' settlement between Israel and 'every state in the area'. The committee considered that by selecting only references to Israel, the article had breached editorial standards on both accuracy and impartiality\".\n\nOn 7 March 2008, news anchor Geeta Guru-Murthy clarified significant errors in the BBC's coverage of the Mercaz HaRav massacre that had been exposed by media monitor Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America. Correspondent Nick Miles had informed viewers that \"hours after the attack, Israeli bulldozers destroyed his [the perpetrator's] family home.\" This was not the case, and other broadcasters showed the east Jerusalem home to be intact and the family commemorating their son's actions.\n\nOn 14 March 2008, the BBC accepted that in an article on their website of an IDF operation that stated \"The Israeli air force said it was targeting a rocket firing team. ... UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has condemned Israel's attacks on Palestinian civilians, calling them inappropriate and disproportionate\", they should have made reference to what [Ban] said about Palestinian rocket attacks as well as to the excessive use of force by Israel. The article was additionally amended to remove the reference of Israeli 'attacks on civilians' as Ban Ki-Moon's attributed comments were made weeks earlier to the UN Security Council, and not in reference to that particular attack, and in fact, he had never used such terminology.\n\nThe BBC received intense criticism in January 2009 for its decision not to broadcast a television appeal by aid agencies on behalf of the people of Gaza during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, on the grounds that it could compromise the BBC's journalistic impartiality. A number of protesters asserted that this showed pro-Israeli bias, while some analysts suggested that the BBC's decision in this matter derived from its concern to avoid anti-Israeli bias as analysed in the Balen report. Parties criticising the decision, included Church of England archbishops, British government ministers and even some BBC employees. More than 11,000 complaints were filed in a three-day span. The BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, explained that the corporation had a duty to cover the Gaza dispute in a \"balanced, objective way\", and was concerned about endorsing something that could \"suggest the backing one side\". Politicians such as Tony Benn broke the corporation's ban on the appeal and broadcast the Gaza appeal on BBC News, saying that \"If the BBC won't broadcast the appeal, then I'm going to do it myself\", and adding that \"no one [working for the broadcaster] agrees with what the BBC has done\".\n\nMohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, protested the BBC's decision by cancelling interviews scheduled with the company; ElBaradei claimed the refusal to air the aid appeal \"violates the rules of basic human decency which are there to help vulnerable people irrespective of who is right or wrong.\" The BBC's chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson, affirmed the need to broadcast \"without affecting and impinging on the audience's perception of our impartiality\" and that in this case, it was a \"real issue.\"\n\nIn response to perceived falsehoods and distortions in a BBC One \"Panorama\" documentary entitled 'A Walk in the Park', transmitted in January 2010, British journalist Melanie Phillips wrote an open letter in news magazine \"The Spectator\" to the Secretary of State for Culture, Jeremy Hunt, accusing the BBC of \"flagrantly biased reporting of Israel\" and urged the BBC to confront the \"prejudice and inertia which are combining to turn its reporting on Israel into crude pro-Arab propaganda, and thus risk destroying the integrity of an institution\".\n\nIn 2010 the BBC was accused of pro-Israel bias in its documentary about the Gaza flotilla raid. The BBC documentary concluded that Israeli forces had faced a violent premeditated attack by a group of hardcore IHH activists, who intended to orchestrate a political act to put pressure on Israel. The programme was criticised as \"biased\" by critics of Israel and the PSC (Palestine Solidarity Campaign) questioned why the IDF boarded the ship at night if it had peaceful intention. Eyewitness Ken O'Keefe accused the BBC of distorting the capture, medical treatment and ultimate release of three Israeli commandos into a story of heroic self-rescuing commandos. Anthony Lawson produced a 15-minute video detailing the BBC's alleged bias.\n\nIn March 2011, Member of Parliament Louise Bagshawe criticised the inaccuracies and omissions in BBC's coverage of the Itamar massacre and questioned the BBC's decision not to broadcast this incident on television and barely on radio, and its apparent bias against Israel. In his July 2012 testimony to the Parliament, the outgoing Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson admitted that BBC \"got it wrong\".\n\nA BBC Editorial Standards Findings issued in July 2011 found that a broadcast on Today on 27 September 2010 that stated \"At midnight last night, the moratorium on Israelis building new settlements in the West Bank came to an end. It had lasted for ten months\", had breached the Accuracy guideline in respect of the requirement to present output \"in clear, precise language\", as in fact the moratorium on building new settlements had been in existence since the early 1990s and remained in place.\n\nIn December 2011, the BBC caused further controversy after censoring the word 'Palestine' from a song played on BBC Radio 1Xtra.\n\nMore controversy was caused in April 2012 when the BBC broadcast news of 2,500 Palestinian prisoners who were on hunger strike, with very little overall coverage. This resulted in two protests outside the BBC buildings in Glasgow and in London.\n\nDuring the 2012 Summer Olympics, on their country profiles pages, the BBC listed \"East Jerusalem\" as the capital of Palestine, and did not list a capital at all for Israel. After public outrage and a letter from Israeli government spokesperson Mark Regev, the BBC listed a \"Seat of Government\" for Israel in Jerusalem, while adding that most foreign embassies \"are in Tel Aviv\". It made a parallel change to the listing for \"Palestine\", listing \"East Jerusalem\" as the \"Intended seat of government\".\n\nIn a response to a reader's criticism on the issue, the BBC replied that the complaints that prompted the changes were \"generated by online lobby activity\". The BBC was also noted for having no coverage whatsoever about the campaign for the IOC to commemorate the 11 killed Israeli athletes from the Munich massacre in the 1972 Summer Olympics, which was met with repeated refusal by IOC President Jacques Rogge, despite the issue receiving much press by other major news networks.\n\nAccording to the poll conducted by Jewish Policy Research on more than 4,000 respondents, nearly 80% of British Jews believes that BBC is biased against Israel. Only 14% of British Jews believes that BBC coverage of Israel is \"balanced\".\n\nIn 2013, the BBC scheduled to broadcast a documentary film, \"Jerusalem: an Archaeological Mystery Story\", but pulled the film \"off the schedule at the last minute.\" The film \"theorizes that many Jews did not leave Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple, and that many modern-day Palestinians may be in part descended from those Jews\". Simon Plosker of HonestReporting believed that the decision was made not to offend people who are ideologically opposed to Israel by broadcasting a documentary about Jewish history in the region. The BBC's explanation for the sudden schedule change was that the film did not fit with the theme of the season, which was archaeology.\n\nIn 2014, an op-ed in \"The Jerusalem Post\" by Raphael Cohen-Almagor criticised BBC for avoiding the word 'terrorism' in connection with violent acts or groups of people considered by various governments or intergovernmental organizations to be terrorists. Cohen-Almagor wrote: \"Instead of adhering to one principled definition of terrorism and then employing it across the board, the BBC prefers to sit on the fence, so as to say that it is impossible to differentiate between terrorists and 'freedom fighters', that one person's terrorist might be another's 'freedom fighter'.\"\n\nIn the same year, protesters presented an open letter from the Palestinian Solidarity Foundation, Stop the War Coalition, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other groups to Lord Hall, Director General of the BBC; the letter accused the broadcaster of presenting Israeli attacks on Gaza as a result of rocket fire from Hamas, without giving any other context. This letter was signed by notable individuals, such as Noam Chomsky, John Pilger and Ken Loach.\n\nIn 2015, Fraser Steel – head of the Editorial Complaints Unit of the BBC – upheld complaints that it had breached impartiality guidelines in an interview with Moshe Ya'alon, who was then the Israeli defence minister. Ya'alon claimed on the \"Today\" programme that Palestinians \"enjoy already political independence\" and \"have their own political system, government, parliament, municipalities and so forth\", claiming that Israel had no desire \"to govern them whatsoever\". The Palestine Solidarity Campaign objected to these claims, saying: \"Palestinians don't have political independence. They live under occupation and, in Gaza, under siege.\" Filmmaker and activist Ken Loach sent a letter via the Campaign, saying that: \"You understand, I’m sure, that this interview is a serious breach of the requirement for impartiality. Unlike all other \"Today\" interviews, the minister was allowed to speak without challenge. Why?\"\n\nAfter the June 2017 Jerusalem attack, the BBC reported it as \"Three Palestinians killed after deadly stabbing in Jerusalem.\" After being inundated with complaints, the BBC news on-line changed the headline.\n\nThe BBC was criticised for its coverage of the events before the invasion of Iraq, in 2003. The controversy over what it described as the \"sexing up\" of the case for war in Iraq by the government, led to the BBC being heavily criticised by the Hutton Inquiry, although this finding was much disputed by the British press, who branded it as a government whitewash.\n\nThe BBC's chairman and director general both resigned following the inquiry, and its vice-chairman Lord Ryder made a public apology to the government – which the Liberal Democrat Norman Baker MP described as \"of such capitulation that I wanted to throw up when I heard it\".\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli diplomatic officials boycotted BBC news programmes, refused interviews, and excluded BBC reporters from briefings because Israeli officials believed the BBC's reporting was biased, stating \"the reports we see give the impression that the BBC is working on behalf of Hezbollah instead of doing fair journalism\". Fran Unsworth, head of BBC News gathering, defended the coverage in an article for \"Jewish News.com\".\n\nThe BBC eventually overturned a ruling by the Information Tribunal rejecting the BBC's refusal to release the Balen report to Steven Sugar, a member of the public, under the Freedom of Information Act on the grounds that it was held for the purposes of journalism. The report examines BBC radio and television broadcasts covering the Arab–Israeli conflict and was compiled in 2004 by Malcolm Balen, a senior editorial adviser.\n\nOn 10 October 2006, \"The Daily Telegraph\" claimed that \"The BBC has spent thousands of pounds of licence payers' money trying to block the release of a report which is believed to be highly critical of its Middle East coverage. The corporation is mounting a landmark High Court action to prevent the release of The Balen Report under the Freedom of Information Act, despite the fact that BBC reporters often use the Act to pursue their journalism. The action will increase suspicions that the report, which is believed to run to 20,000 words, includes evidence of anti-Israeli bias in news programming.\" \"The Times\" reported in March 2007 that \"critics of the BBC\" were interested in knowing if the Balen Report \"includes evidence of bias against Israel in news programming.\"\n\nFirst, the Information Commissioner ruled in favour of the BBC. Mr Sugar appealed to the Information Tribunal, who overturned the decision on the basis that the report was not for the purposes of journalism. The BBC appealed on two grounds, firstly that the Information Tribunal did not have jurisdiction in these circumstances, and secondly, even if they did, the report was for the purposes of journalism. On 27 April 2007 the High Court agreed that the Information Tribunal had no jurisdiction (thus reinstating the Information Commissioner's ruling in favour of the BBC) and therefore they did not rule on the second ground for appeal. The BBC issued a press release which included the following statement:\"The BBC's action in this case had nothing to do with the fact that the Balen report was about the Middle East – the same approach would have been taken whatever area of news output was covered.\"\n\nBut then, on 11 February 2009 the House of Lords (then the UK's highest court) overruled them, stating that the Information Tribunal did have jurisdiction, and referred the case back to the High Court to rule on the other ground. Sugar was then reported as saying:\"It is sad that the BBC felt it necessary to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money fighting for three years to try to load the system against those requesting information from it. I am very pleased that the House of Lords has ruled that such obvious unfairness is not the result of the Act.\"\n\nHowever, on 2 October 2009, the High Court ruled that the BBC was \"not\" required to disclose the Balen Report, because it was partly for the purposes of journalism, and in spite of appeals by Steven Sugar and, after his death, his wife, both the Court of Appeal, on 23 June 2010, and the Supreme Court, on 23 November 2011, agreed with that ruling, thus clarifying the law applying to any similar reports in the future.\n\nIn 2010 it was reported by the Journalism.co.uk website, after a Freedom of Information request, that the BBC had spent £270,867.12 in legal fees since 2005 in sustaining its refusal of the request to publicly release the Balen Report.\n\nDuring the BBC programme \"From Our Own Correspondent\" broadcast on 30 October 2004, Barbara Plett described herself crying when she saw a frail Yasser Arafat being evacuated to France for medical treatment. This led to \"hundreds of complaints\" to the BBC, and suggestions that the BBC was biased. Andrew Dismore, the MP for Hendon, accused Plett of \"sloppy journalism\", and commented that \"this shows the inherent bias of the BBC against Israel\".\n\nBBC News defended Plett in a statement saying that her reporting had met the high standards of \"fairness, accuracy and balance\" expected of a BBC correspondent. Initially, a complaint of bias against Plett was rejected by the BBC's head of editorial complaints. However, almost a year later, on 25 November 2005, the programme complaints committee of the BBC governors partially upheld the complaints, ruling that Plett's comments \"breached the requirements of due impartiality\". Despite initially issuing a statement in support of Plett, the BBC director of news Helen Boaden later apologised for what she described as \"an editorial misjudgment\". The governors praised Boaden's speedy response and reviewed the BBC's stance on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nIn April 2009, the Editorial Standards Committee of the BBC Trust published a report on three complaints brought against two news items involving Jeremy Bowen, the Middle East Editor for BBC News. The complaints included 24 allegations of inaccuracy or partiality of which three were fully or partially upheld. The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee found that Bowen's radio piece \"had stated his professional view without qualification or explanation, and that the lack of precision in his language had rendered the statement inaccurate\". They opined that the online article should have explained the existence of alternative views and that it breached the rules of impartiality. However, the report did not accuse Bowen of bias. The website article was amended and Bowen did not face any disciplinary measures.\n\nHindu and Sikh leaders in the United Kingdom have accused the BBC of pandering to Britain's Muslim community by making a disproportionate number of programmes on Islam at the expense of covering other Asian religions, such as Sikhism and Hinduism. However, in a letter sent in July to the Network of Sikh Organizations (NSO), the head of the BBC's Religion and Ethics, Michael Wakelin, denied any biases on their part. A spokesman for the BBC said the broadcaster was committed to representing all of Britain's faiths and communities.\n\nHowever, a number of MPs, including Rob Marris and Keith Vaz, called on the BBC to do more to represent Britain's minority faiths. \"I am disappointed,\" said Vaz. \"It is only right that as licence fee payers all faiths are represented in a way that mirrors their make-up in society. I hope that the BBC addresses the problem in its next year of programming.\"\n\nThe overly positive coverage by BBC of the Arab Spring was criticised both from within and outside of the corporation. In June 2012, the head of news Helen Boaden admitted that the coverage was \"over-excited\". She attributed this to reporters embedded with the rebels, who produced reports which are \"too emotive\" and \"veering into opinion\".\n\nIn June 2012, the BBC admitted making \"major errors\" in its coverage of the unrest. In an 89-page report, 9 pages were devoted to the BBC's coverage of Bahrain and included admissions that the BBC had \"underplayed the sectarian aspect of the conflict\" and \"not adequately convey the viewpoint of supporters of the monarchy\" by \"[failing] to mention attempts by Crown Prince\" Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa to \"establish dialogue with the opposition\". The report added that \"the government appears to have made a good-faith effort to de-escalate the crisis\" in particular during a period when the BBC's coverage of the unrest dropped substantially and that many people had complained that their coverage was \"utterly one-sided\".\n\nIn 2008, the BBC was criticised by some for referring to the men who carried out the November 2008 Mumbai attacks as \"gunmen\" rather than \"terrorists\". This follows a steady stream of complaints from India that the BBC has an Indophobic bias that stems from a culturally ingrained racism against Indians arising from the British Raj. Rediff reporter Arindam Banerji has chronicled what he argues are numerous cases of Indophobic bias from the BBC regarding reportage, selection bias, misrepresentation, and fabrications.\n\nIn protest against the use of the word \"gunmen\" by the BBC, journalist Mobashar Jawed \"M.J.\" Akbar refused to take part in an interview following the Mumbai terror attacks, and criticised the BBC's reportage of the incident. British parliamentarian Stephen Pound has supported these claims, referring to the BBC's whitewashing of the terror attacks as \"the worst sort of mealy mouthed posturing. It is desperation to avoid causing offence which ultimately causes more offence to everyone.\"\n\nA controversial report from BBC accused India of sponsoring Pakistan's MQM party, a domestic party based out of Karachi, to fund anti-Pakistani activities. However, the only sources BBC managed to mention for this report was \"authoritative Pakistani source\", rather than independent investigation. The flawed reporting was severely criticized by India and other prominent journalists like Barkha Dutt. Expectedly, the pro-Pakistan and anti-Indian report was extensively circulated in Pakistani domestic media to fuel propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nWriting for \"The Hindu Business Line\", reporter Premen Addy criticises the BBC's reportage on South Asia as consistently anti-India and pro-Islamist, and that they underreport India's economic and social achievements, as well as political and diplomatic efforts, and disproportionately highlight and exaggerate problems in the country. In addition, Addy alludes to discrimination against Indian anchors and reporters in favour of Muslim Pakistani and Bangladeshi ones who are hostile to India.\n\nWriting for the 2008 edition of the peer-reviewed \"Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television\", Alasdair Pinkerton analyses the coverage of India by the BBC since India's independence from British rule in 1947 until 2008. Pinkerton observes a tumultuous history involving allegations of anti-India bias in the BBC's reportage, particularly during the cold war, and concludes that the BBC's coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics shows a pervasive and hostile anti-India bias due to the BBC's alleged imperialist and neo-colonialist stance.\n\nJournalist Christopher Booker has also criticized the BBC for its coverage of India-related matters. He concludes that the BBC's efforts to reinforce Stereotypes of South Asians has been directly responsible for damaging the image of India, and encouraging racist incidents against Indians, such as the Leipzig University internship controversy.\n\nHindu groups in the United Kingdom have accused the BBC of anti-Hindu bigotry and whitewashing Islamist hate groups that demonise the British Indian minority.\n\nIn 2005, the Vivekananda Centre London and the Hindu Council(UK) reported an institutional anti Hindu bias and stated that \"Anything that may show Hinduism in a poor light is immediately picked up by the BBC programme makers, while anything that may show Hinduism in a glorious light remains ignored by the BBC.\"\n\nIn March 2012, the BBC referred to the Hindu festival of Holi as a \"filthy festival\". The Webster New World Dictionary defines \"filthy\" as \"full of filth, disgustingly foul; grossly obscene; morally vicious or corrupt\". The BBC has since apologised for the offence caused.\n\nIn 2009, the BBC Asian Network angered Sikhs for a show in which Muslim presenter Adil Ray expressed that Sikhs should not always carry their kirpan, a ceremonial dagger and key item of their faith. The BBC rejected the charge, but deleted the show from their website.\n\nIn October 2006, Chief Radio Correspondent for BBC News since 2001 and Washington correspondent Justin Webb said that the BBC is so biased against America that deputy director general Mark Byford had secretly agreed to help him to \"correct\" it in his reports, and that the BBC treated America with scorn and derision and gave it \"no moral weight\".\n\nIn April 2007, Webb presented a three-part series for BBC Radio 4 called \"Death to America: Anti Americanism Examined\" in which he challenged a common perception of the United States as an international bully and a modern-day imperial power.\n\nConservative American news commentator Bill O'Reilly has repeatedly sought to draw attention to what he calls the BBC's \"inherent liberal culture.\"\n\nOn Thursday 15 July 2004 the BBC broadcast a documentary on the far right British National Party where undercover reporter Jason Gwynne infiltrated the BNP by posing as a football hooligan. The programme resulted in Mark Collett and Nick Griffin, the leader of the party, being charged for inciting racial hatred in April 2005, for statements which included Griffin describing Islam as a \"wicked, vicious faith,\" Collett describing asylum seekers as \"a little bit like cockroaches\" and saying \"let's show these ethnics the door in 2004.\" Griffin and Collett were found not guilty on some charges at the first trial in January 2006, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the others, so a retrial was ordered.\n\nAt the retrial held in November 2006 all of the defendants were found not guilty on the basis that the law at the time did not consider those who follow Islam or Christianity to be a protected group with respect to racial defamation laws. Shortly after this case, British law was amended to outlaw incitement to hatred against a religious group (see Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006).\n\nThe BNP believe this was an attempt to \"Discredit the British National Party as a party of opposition to the Labour government.\"\n\nAfter the second trial, Nick Griffin described the BBC as a \"Politically correct, politically biased organisation which has wasted licence-fee payers' money to bring two people in a legal, democratic, peaceful party to court over speaking nothing more than the truth.\"\n\nIn January 2005, the BBC aired \"\", ultimately resulting in around 55,000 complaints to the BBC from those upset at the opera's alleged blasphemies against Christianity. In advance of the broadcast, which the BBC had warned \"contains language and content which won't be to some tastes\" mediawatch-uk's director John Beyer wrote to the Director General urging the BBC to drop the programme, saying \"Licence fee payers do not expect the BBC to be pushing back boundaries of taste and decency in this way.\" The BBC issued a statement saying: \"As a public service broadcaster, it is the BBC's role to broadcast a range of programmes that will appeal to all audiences – with very differing tastes and interests – present in the UK today.\"\n\nBefore the broadcast, some 150 people bearing placards protested outside the BBC Television Centre in Shepherd's Bush. On the Monday following the broadcast, which was watched by some two million viewers, \"The Times\" announced that BBC executives had received death threats after their addresses and telephone numbers were posted on the \"Christian Voice\" website. The Corporation had received some 35,000 complaints before the broadcast, but reported only 350 calls following the broadcast, which were split between those praising the production and those complaining about it.\n\nOne Christian group attempted to bring private criminal prosecutions for blasphemy against the BBC, and another demanded a judicial review of the decision.\n\nIn March 2005, the BBC's Board of Governors convened and considered the complaints, which they rejected by a majority of 4 to 1. The subsequent refusal of the BBC to reproduce the actual Muhammad cartoons in its coverage of the controversy concerning them convinced many that the BBC follows an unstated policy of freely broadcasting defamation of Christianity which it would not allow in the case of any other religion.\n\nThe BBC has been criticised for hypocrisy over its high carbon footprint, in view of the amount of coverage it gives to the topic of climate change. \"Newsnight\" presenter Jeremy Paxman argues that the Corporation's correspondents \"travel the globe to tell the audience of the dangers of climate change while leaving a vapour trail which will make the problem even worse\". Paxman further argues that the 'BBC's coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago'.\n\nAt the 2007 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Peter Horrocks (Head of TV News) and Peter Barron (Editor, \"Newsnight\"), said that the BBC should not campaign on the issue of climate change. They criticised proposed plans for a BBC Comic Relief-style day of programmes around climate change. Horrocks was quoted as saying: \"I absolutely don't think we should do that because it's not impartial. It's not our job to lead people and proselytise about it.\"\n\nPeter Barron was quoted as adding: \"It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. I think there are a lot of people who think that, but it must be stopped.\"\n\nPeter Horrocks later outlined the BBC's position on the BBC Editors Blog (\"No Line\").\n\nThe plans for a day of programmes about environmental issues were abandoned in September 2007. A BBC spokesperson said this was \"absolutely not\" because of concerns about impartiality.\n\nIn July 2011 a BBC Trust review cited findings of an assessment by Professor Steve Jones of University College London. Jones found there was an at times \"over-rigid\" application of the Editorial Guidelines on impartiality in relation to science coverage, which failed to take into account what he regarded as the \"non-contentious\" nature of some stories and the need to avoid giving \"undue attention to marginal opinion\". Professor Jones gave reporting of the safety of the MMR vaccine and more recent coverage of claims about the safety of GM crops and the existence of man made climate change as examples of his point. In 2017, the BBC apologised for allowing climate change denier Lord Lawson to falsely claim that global temperatures had not risen in the past decade on BBC Radio 4's \"Today Programme\" (which the organisation acknowledged breached its editorial guidelines) and in 2018, Carbon Brief released an internal notice sent by Fran Unsworth, BBC director of news and current affairs, arguing that the BBC's coverage of climate change often went against its own guidelines on accuracy and created a false balance with regard to impartiality stating: \"Manmade climate change exists: If the science proves it we should report it. … To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.\"\n\nThe BBC is alleged to have attempted to cover up a climate change seminar credited with shaping its coverage of the environment.\n\nProminent Roman Catholic leaders have criticised the BBC for having an anti-Catholic bias and showing hostility towards the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe BBC has also been criticised for recycling old news and for \"insensitivity\" and bad timing when it decided to broadcast programmes called \"Kenyon Confronts\" and \"Sex and the Holy City\" around the same time as Pope John Paul II's 25th anniversary and the beatification of Mother Teresa.\n\nIn 2003, the BBC had planned \"Popetown\", a ten-part cartoon series which \"featured an infantile Pope [...] bouncing around the Vatican on a pogostick\". The plans were shelved after it evoked intense outrage and criticism from Roman Catholics.\n\nEleven days before the tournament took place, the BBC current affairs programme \"Panorama\", entitled \"Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate\", included recent footage of supporters chanting various racist slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland, and Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was first commented widely in the British press, but then accused of being one-sided, biased and unethical. Critics included the British media; anti-racism campaigners, and black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and footballers (Gary Lineker, Roy Hodgson and others).\nJonathan Ornstein, the leader of Jewish community in Kraków, a Jewish source used in the documentary said: \"I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source. The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda... the BBC knowingly cheated its own audience - the British people - by concocting a false horror story about Poland. In doing so, the BBC has spread fear, ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I am profoundly disturbed by this unethical form of journalism.\"\n\nA reporter from \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", Poland's biggest left-wing newspaper, questioned \"Panorama\"'s practices and said: \"I am becoming more and more surprised with what the BBC says. So far it has denied two situations I witnessed. I would not be surprised if the BBC prepared a statement saying that the \"Panorama\" crew has never been to Poland.\"\n\nAn anti-racism campaigner Jacek Purski said: \"The material prepared by the BBC is one-sided. It does not show the whole story of Polish preparations for the Euros. It does not show the Championship ran a lot of activities aimed at combating racism in the \"Respect Diversity\" campaign. For us the Euro is not only about matches. The event has become an opportunity to fight effectively against racism and promote multiculturalism. There is no country in Europe free from racism. These are the facts.\"\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" reported that the Football Association intended to write a letter of complaint to the BBC.\n\nThe nations fined by UEFA for racism were not the hosts but the visitors from Spain, Croatia, Russia and Germany. The Royal Dutch Football Association issued a complaint to UEFA after monkey chants were thought to be aimed at their black players, during an open training session in Kraków. UEFA denied the chants were racially motivated.\n\nIn the weeks after the ITV1 documentary \"Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile\" was broadcast on 3 October 2012, the BBC faced questions and criticism over allegations that it had failed to act on rumours about sexual assaults, especially on young girls, by presenter Jimmy Savile, some of which had occurred on BBC premises after the recording of programmes including \"Top of the Pops\" and \"Jim'll Fix It\". Allegations were also made that a \"Newsnight\" investigation into Savile in December 2011 was dropped because it conflicted with tribute programmes prepared after Savile's death.\n\nBy 11 October 2012 allegations of abuse by Savile had been made to 13 British police forces, and on 19 October Scotland Yard launched a formal criminal investigation into historic allegations of child sex abuse by Savile and others over four decades. The police reported on 25 October 2012 that the number of possible victims was 300.\n\nIt was claimed that Douglas Muggeridge, the controller of Radio 1 in the early 1970s, was aware of allegations against Savile, and had asked for a report on them in 1973. The BBC stated that no evidence of any allegations of misconduct, or of actual misconduct by Savile, had been found in its files and later denied that there had been a cover-up of Savile's activities. However, there were claims by some, including DJ Liz Kershaw, who joined BBC Radio 1 in 1987, that there was a culture within the BBC which tolerated sexual harassment.\n\nThe BBC was criticised in Parliament for its handling of the affair, with Harriet Harman stating that the allegations \"cast a stain\" on the corporation. The Culture Secretary, Maria Miller, said that she was satisfied that the BBC was taking the allegations very seriously, and dismissed calls for an independent inquiry. Labour leader Ed Miliband said that an independent inquiry was the only way to ensure justice for those involved. George Entwistle offered to appear before the Parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport Committee to explain the BBC's position and actions.\n\nOn 16 October the BBC appointed the heads of two separate inquiries into events surrounding Savile. Former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith, who led the inquiry into serial killer Harold Shipman, will review the culture and practices of the BBC during the time Savile worked there, while Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, will look at why a \"Newsnight\" investigation into Savile's activities was dropped shortly before transmission.\n\nA \"Panorama\" investigation was broadcast on 22 October 2012. The Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, declined to be interviewed, citing legal advice that BBC senior management should co-operate only with the police, the BBC's reviews and Parliament. On the same day the BBC announced that \"Newsnight\" editor Peter Rippon would \"step aside\" from his position with immediate effect. On 23 October, Entwistle appeared before the Parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport Committee, at which he faced hostile questioning and stated that it had been a \"catastrophic mistake\" to cancel the \"Newsnight\" broadcast.\n\nIn the context of the Savile scandal, it was noted that a book written in 1999 by journalist John Simpson, \"Strange Places, Questionable People\", had referred to an \"Uncle Dick\" at the BBC who had sexually assaulted children, and who appeared to fit the profile of BBC announcer Derek McCulloch. Author Andrew O'Hagan wrote that there had long been rumours about McCulloch's activities, and those of his colleague Lionel Gamlin, while working at the BBC in the 1940s and 1950s. The BBC said that they would \"look into these allegations as part of the Jimmy Savile review.\" McCulloch's family described the allegations as \"complete rubbish\".\n\n\"Newsnight\" broadcast, on 2 November 2012, a report making allegations against, but not naming, a \"prominent Thatcher era Conservative politician\" in relation to the North Wales child abuse scandal. However, this story collapsed after \"The Guardian\" reported on 8 November a case of mistaken identity, and the next day the victim retracted the allegation. An apology was included in \"Newsnight\" on 9 November, and all ongoing \"Newsnight\" investigations were suspended. George Entwistle stated that he was unaware of the content of the report before it was broadcast and stated that \"Newsnight\" staff involved in the broadcast could be disciplined. However, Entwistle himself resigned on 10 November, after facing further criticism in the media. The Director of BBC Scotland, Ken MacQuarrie, investigated the circumstances around the \"Newsnight\" programme. His findings were published on 12 November, and concluded that there had been \"a lack of clarity around the senior editorial chain of command\" and that \"some of the basic journalistic checks were not completed.\"\n\nNick Pollard's report into the shelving of a \"Newsnight\" report on Savile in 2011 was published in December 2012. It concluded that the decision to drop the original report was \"flawed\", but that it had not been done to protect programmes prepared as tributes to Savile. His report criticised George Entwistle for apparently failing to read emails warning him of Savile's \"dark side\", and stated that, after the allegations against Savile eventually became public, the BBC fell into a \"level of chaos and confusion [that] was even greater than was apparent at the time\".\n\nOn 20 December 2012, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee published criticism of payments made to Entwistle after he had resigned, stating that the £450,000 paid to him after 54 days in post - double the amount specified in his contract - together with a year's health insurance and additional payments, was a \"cavalier\" use of public money.\n\nIn 2011, after three years of Primark's effort, the BBC acknowledged that its award-winning investigative journalism report of Indian child labour use by the retailing giant was a fake. BBC apologised to Primark, to Indian suppliers and all its viewers.\n\nIn January 2016, stories originating from the BBC alleged that the Lancashire Constabulary had taken a young Muslim child away for questioning on anti-terrorism charges after he accidentally spelled \"terraced house\" as \"terrorist house\"; this story was widely reported in the British and international media. The police force in question criticised the BBC's coverage of the story, saying that it was \"untrue to suggest that this situation was brought about by a simple spelling mistake\", adding that \"[the incident] was not responded to as a terror incident and the reporter was fully aware of this before she wrote her story\", adding that \"the media needs to take more responsibility when sensationalising issues to make stories much bigger than they are and to realise the impact they can have on local communities\". A statement from the police and local council also said that it was \"untrue to suggest that this situation was brought about by a simple spelling mistake. The school and the police have acted responsibly and proportionately in looking into a number of potential concerns using a low-key, local approach.\" Other pieces of work by the student, including one where the child wrote about his uncle beating him, were allegedly other reasons for the police questioning over the safety of the child.\n\nThe BBC has been criticised for 'overstaffing' news, sporting, and cultural events and in doing so both wasting licence fee money, and using their dominant position to control the coverage of events.\n\nA 2010 House of Commons Public Accounts Committee report criticised the number of staff that the BBC had sent to sporting events such as the Beijing Olympics and the Euro 2008 football championships. In June 2011 the Corporation sent 263 staff to cover the Glastonbury Festival. The next month they sent 250 staff members to cover an event marking one year until the start of the London 2012 Olympics, ten times the numbers used by other broadcasters.\n\nOn 19 October 2011 the Liberal Democrats' culture spokesman Don Foster criticised the large number of BBC staff members who attended the eviction of travellers and their supporters from the illegal section of the Dale Farm site. Foster stated that it was 'ludicrous over staffing and hardly good way to get public sympathy for the 20 per cent budget cuts facing the BBC'. The BBC responded that they only had 20 staff members on site.\n\nThe fact that the BBC's domestic services are funded by television licence fees is heavily criticised by its competitors and others on a number of grounds.\n\nThe recent rise of multi-channel digital television has led to criticism that the licence fee is unjustifiable on the basis that minority interest programmes can now be transmitted on specialist commercial channels and that the licence fee is funding a number of digital-only channels which many licence holders cannot watch (for example BBC Three and BBC Four). Since 24 October 2012, with the completion of the digital switchover all licence payers can now access this content.\n\nOn 17 August 2007 it was reported that FM broadcast of the BBC's Russian language service in Russia would be dropped, leaving only medium and short wave broadcasts in Russia. Financial organisation \"Finam\", which owns the FM radio service now dropping the BBC Russia broadcasts, through its spokesman Igor Ermachenkov, said that \"Any media which is government-financed is propaganda – it's a fact, it's not negative\". A spokesman, for the BBC responded: \"Although the BBC is funded by the UK government... a fundamental principle of its constitution and its regulatory regime is that it is editorially independent of the UK government.\" Reports put the development in the context of criticism of the Russian government for curbing media freedom and strained UK-Russian relations. Reporters Without Borders condemned the move as censorship.\n\nOn 1 November 2007 it was reported that Sir Michael Lyons, chairman of the BBC Trust, criticised the BBC as too London-centric, paying less attention to news stories outside of the capital. In light of such criticism in terms of both news and general programming (and in recognition of its mandate to represent the entire UK and encourage creativity throughout the country) there have been active efforts made by the Trust and Board of Governors to correct this regional imbalance. This is reflected in a commitment to produce at least 50 percent of programmes outside of the Greater London area, a target that the corporation has achieved in 2013 and 2014, but fell short of in 2015.\n\nThe BBC's annual report for 2015-2016 makes reference to the \"London bubble\" while claiming that does this not represent an active bias but rather the fact that London is the place where so many decisions and programming are made. While notable investments in production capacity outside of London have been made- such as the creation of MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester- spending figures for radio and television production in the nations and regions has fallen in real terms, though this accompanies a near £600 million pound reduction in funding for the BBC as a whole since 2010.\n\nThe UK's move towards increased devolution in the areas of healthcare, education, and a range of other policy areas, has created additional challenges for the corporation. The flagship newscasts are based in London and tend to report \"nation-wide\" stories related to government and policy that are often only pertinent to England, or sometimes England and Wales. The BBC Trust and Future for Public Service Television Inquiry has recognized that this requires more clarity in UK-wide news programming (ex. explaining why the Junior Doctors Strike only effects England, or that Scotland and Northern Ireland are exempt from the bedroom tax and the funding changes leading to the 2010 Student Protests) and creates an additional responsibility for the home nations opt-outs to report on devolved matters. From 2016 onward, BBC management will go before the devolved committees for culture or media to answer questions and criticism in the same way that it does for the Westminster Culture, Media, and Sport Committee.\n\nIn August 2007, Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru MP, highlighted what he perceived as a lack of a Welsh focus on BBC news broadcasts. Price threatened to withhold future television licence fees in response to a lack of thorough news coverage of Wales, echoing a BBC Audience Council for Wales July report citing public frustration over how the Welsh Assembly is characterised in national media.\n\nPlaid AM Bethan Jenkins agreed with Price and called for responsibility for broadcasting to be devolved to the Welsh Assembly, voicing similar calls from Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond. Criticism of the BBC's news coverage for Wales and Scotland since devolution prompted debate of possibly providing evening news broadcasts with specific focus for both countries.\n\nThe National Union of Journalists (NUJ) criticised the BBC in October 2012 for its poor coverage of the Scotland independence referendum which took place on 18 September 2014. The BBC reportedly \"downplayed the costs of referendum coverage, claiming it was a 'one off'.\" According to a research team led by Dr John Robertson from the University of the West of Scotland the BBC's first year of referendum coverage (to September 2013) was biased towards the pro-Unionist No campaign.\n\nAndrew Marr, the BBC presenter, was accused of expressing anti-independence views in a March 2014 interview with Alex Salmond. The BBC allowed the Better Together campaign to make a pro-unionist cinema advertisement at its Glasgow studios in April 2014 which was thought to contravene its editorial guidelines. According to \"The Scotsman\", the BBC appointed Kezia Dugdale, Labour’s education spokeswoman, as presenter of \"Crossfire\", a radio programme debating issues relating to the referendum. The newspaper believed this arrangement was also a breach of the corporation's guidelines and asserted that Dugdale is \"a member of Scottish Labour’s Truth Team – set up to monitor all SNP and Yes Scotland interviews, press statements and briefing papers\" in the run-up to the September vote.\n\nA report by the Audience Council Scotland, the BBC Trust's advisory body in Scotland, questioned the impartiality of BBC Scotland in covering the independence referendum in July 2014. A \"Sunday Times\" article, also in July 2014, queried the BBC's approach to the independence referendum, and stated that emails by a senior member of a production company organising debates for the corporation gave advance notice to the No campaign.\n\nOn 10 September 2014 the BBC were accused of bias in their reporting of an Alex Salmond press conference for the international media. In a response to a question by the BBC's Nick Robinson, Salmond accused him of heckling and wanted an inquiry by the UK's Cabinet Secretary into a leak to the BBC from the Treasury concerning the plans of the Royal Bank of Scotland to relocate its registered office to London which had been in the previous evening's news. In response to complaints about editing of the live coverage of the conference for later bulletins, the corporation said: \"The BBC considers that the questions were valid and the overall report balanced and impartial, in line with our editorial guidelines.\"\n\nAfter a day of protests from Yes campaigners, and demands that Robinson should be sacked, the following Monday (15 September), Salmond responded to questions from journalists at Edinburgh Airport. About Robinson's report in later bulletins, he said: \"I don't think it was fair for Nick to suggest that I hadn't answered a question when I actually answered it twice.\" He did not believe Robinson should be sacked.\n\nFormer BBC correspondent, Paul Mason, was reported in September 2014 to have been critical of the corporation's reporting on his Facebook page (intended only to be read by his 'friends'). According to Mason: \"Not since Iraq have I seen BBC News working at propaganda strength like this. So glad I’m out of there.\"\n\nChannel 4's director of creative diversity, Stuart Cosgrove called for a re-think at the BBC on the nature of balance and due impartiality based. This was during a BBC Scotland radio conversation hosted by John Beattie. Cosgrove commented: \"Yesterday, I was watching the rolling BBC News very closely and it was clear that notions of balance were being predicated on a party political basis. It would go from Cameron to Miliband to Clegg and back. If you look at it as a different premise – it’s a yes/no question – then Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, who is not the leader but is a significant political person within the Yes campaign, should have had exactly the same coverage as Ed Miliband. Do you think for a second he got that? Of course he didn’t. I think there’s been a failure of the understanding of the nature of balance and due impartiality. It’s simply wrong and not acceptable.\"\n\nAn interview of Alex Salmond for the \"Sunday Herald\" published on 14 September 2014 included his opinion that the BBC had displayed a pro-union bias during the referendum.\n\nIn October 2012 a Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom) report found that the BBC had 25,000 \"off payroll\" contracts – 13,000 for people who were on air. These contracts enable people to make their own arrangements to pay tax and national insurance, which could allow them to contribute less than employees on pay-as-you-earn tax (PAYE). In response the BBC said many of these were short-term contracts, but it was carrying out a detailed review of tax arrangements.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48184504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48184504", "title": "Development of musical theatre", "text": "Development of musical theatre\n\nDevelopment of musical theatre refers to the historical development of theatrical performance combined with music that culminated in the integrated form of modern musical theatre that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre developed from several lines of antecedents that evolved over several centuries through the 18th century when the Ballad Opera and pantomime emerged in England and its colonies as the most popular forms of musical entertainment.\n\nIn the 19th century, following the development of European operetta, many of the structural elements of modern musical theatre were established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the Edwardian musical comedies, beginning in the 1890s in England, and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan early in the 20th century. The Princess Theatre musicals in New York City during the First World War, and other smart shows like \"Of Thee I Sing\" (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to the modern \"book\" musical, where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.\n\nThe antecedents of musical theatre in Europe can be traced back to the theatre of ancient Greece, where music and dance were included in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE. The dramatists Aeschylus and Sophocles composed their own music to accompany their plays and choreographed the dances of the chorus. The 3rd-century BCE Roman comedies of Plautus included song and dance routines performed with orchestrations. The Romans also introduced technical innovations. For example, to make dance steps more audible in large open-air theatres, Roman actors attached metal chips called \"sabilla\" to their stage footwear, creating the first tap shoes. The music from all of these forms is lost, however, and they had little influence on later development of musical theatre.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, theatre in Europe consisted mostly of travelling minstrels and small performing troupes of performers singing and offering slapstick comedy. In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas, such as \"The Play of Herod\" and \"The Play of Daniel\" taught the liturgy, set to church chants. Later \"mystery plays\" were created that told a biblical story in a sequence of entertaining parts. Several pageant wagons (stages on wheels) would move about the city, and a group of actors would tell their part of the story. Once finished, the group would move on with their wagon, and the next group would arrive to tell its part of the story. These plays developed into an autonomous form of musical theatre, with poetic forms sometimes alternating with the prose dialogues and liturgical chants. The poetry was provided with modified or completely new melodies.\n\nThe European Renaissance saw older forms evolve into commedia dell'arte, an Italian tradition where raucous clowns improvised their way through familiar stories, and later, opera buffa. In England, Elizabethan and Jacobean plays frequently included music, with performances on organs, lutes, viols and pipes for up to an hour before and during the performance. Plays, perhaps particularly the heavier histories and tragedies, were frequently broken up with a short musical play, perhaps derived from the Italian intermezzo, with music, jokes and dancing, or were followed by an afterpiece known as a jigg, often consisting of scandalous or libellous dialogue set to popular tunes (anticipating the Ballad Opera). Court masques also developed during the Tudor period that involved music, dancing, singing and acting, often with expensive costumes and a complex stage design, sometimes by a renowned architect such as Inigo Jones, presented a deferential allegory flattering to a noble or royal patron. Ben Jonson wrote many masques, often collaborating with Jones. William Shakespeare often included masque-like sections in his plays.\n\nThe musical sections of masques developed into sung plays that are recognizable as English operas, the first usually being thought of as William Davenant's \"The Siege of Rhodes\" (1656), originally given in a private performance. In France, meanwhile, Molière turned several of his farcical comedies into musical entertainments with songs (music provided by Jean Baptiste Lully) and dance in the late 17th century. His \"Psyche\" was the model for an English opera by Thomas Shadwell, \"The Miser\" produced in 1672. Davenant produced \"The Tempest\" in 1667, which was the first Shakespeare plot set to music, and was then adapted by Shadwell into an opera in 1674 (composed by Matthew Locke and others). About 1683, John Blow composed \"Venus and Adonis\", often considered the first true English-language opera. Blow was followed by Henry Purcell and a brief period of English opera. After the death of Charles II in 1685, English opera began to fall out of fashion.\n\nBy the 18th century, the most popular forms of musical theatre in Britain were ballad operas, like John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" (1728), that included lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and later the developing form of pantomime and comic operas with original scores and mostly romantic plot lines, like Michael Balfe's \"The Bohemian Girl\" (1845). Meanwhile, on the continent, singspiel, comédie en vaudeville, opéra comique and other forms of light musical entertainment were emerging. Other musical theatre forms developed by the 19th century, such as music hall and melodrama. Melodramas and burlettas, in particular, were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music. Some unlicensed theaters avoided the legal restrictions by providing supposedly free musical shows while serving tea at wildly inflated prices. In 1820, a new ordinance restricted all unlicensed theater productions to no more than six songs, which had to be an organic part of the play rather than a break or digression. In any event, what a piece was called did not necessarily define what it was. The Broadway extravaganza \"The Magic Deer\" (1852) advertised itself as \"A Serio Comico Tragico Operatical Historical Extravaganzical Burletical Tale of Enchantment.\"\n\nThe first recorded long-running play of any kind was \"The Beggar's Opera\", which ran for 62 successive performances in 1728. It would take almost a century before the first play broke 100 performances, with \"Tom and Jerry\", based on the book \"Life in London\" (1821), and the record soon reached 150 in the late 1820s. Colonial America did not have a significant theatre presence until 1752, when London entrepreneur William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia and opened with \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"The Anatomist\". The company moved to New York in the summer of 1753, performing ballad-operas such as \"The Beggar’s Opera\" and ballad-farces like \"Damon and Phillida\". By the 1840s, P.T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan. Other early musical theatre in America consisted of British forms, such as burletta and pantomime. Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown from around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate prices, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s. Broadway's first \"long-run\" musical was a 50 performance hit called \"The Elves\" in 1857. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's \"musical burletta\" \"Seven Sisters\" (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.\n\nAround 1850, the French composer Hervé was experimenting with a form of comic musical theatre that came to be called opérette. The best known composers of operetta were Jacques Offenbach from the 1850s to the 1870s and Johann Strauss II in the 1870s and 1880s. Offenbach's fertile melodies, combined with his librettists' witty satire, formed a model for the musical theatre that followed. In 1957, Mark Lubbock traced the development of musical theatre from Offenbach to Gilbert and Sullivan and eventually to Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hammerstein, writing: \"Offenbach is undoubtedly the most significant figure in the history of the 'musical'. In the mid-19th century in England, musical theatre consisted of mostly of music hall, adaptations of the French operettas (played in bad, risqué translations) and musical burlesques (the culmination of which were seen at the Gaiety Theatre beginning in 1868). In reaction to these, a few family-friendly entertainments were created, such as the German Reed Entertainments.\n\nIn America, mid-18th century musical theatre entertainments included crude variety revue, which eventually developed into vaudeville, minstrel shows, which soon crossed the Atlantic to Britain, and Victorian burlesque, first popularized in the US by British troupes. The first original theatre piece in English that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is generally considered \"The Black Crook\", which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was a staggering five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances, in no small part because of its scantily-clad female ballet chorus. The same year, \"The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post\" was the first show to call itself a \"musical comedy.\" Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (\"The Mulligan Guard Picnic\") and 1885, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law David Braham. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step from burletta, minstrel shows, variety and burlesque, towards a more legitimate theatrical form. They starred high quality singers (Lillian Russell, Vivienne Segal, and Fay Templeton) instead of the ladies of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.\nThe length of runs in the theatre changed rapidly around the same time that the modern musical emerged. As transportation improved, poverty in London and New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London (non-musical) comedy \"Our Boys\", opening in 1875, which set an astonishing new record of 1,362 performances. This run was not equaled on the musical stage until World War I, but musical theatre soon broke the 500 performance mark in London, most notably by the series of more than a dozen long-running Gilbert and Sullivan family-friendly comic opera hits, including \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in 1878 and \"The Mikado\" in 1885. These were sensations on both sides of the Atlantic and, along with the other changes in the theatre, raised the standard for what was considered a successful run. Only a few 19th century musical pieces exceeded the run of the Mikado: \"The Chimes of Normandy\" (\"Les Cloches de Corneville\") ran for 705 performances in 1878 in London, and Alfred Cellier and B. C. Stephenson's 1886 hit, \"Dorothy\" (a show midway between comic opera and musical comedy), set a new record with 931 performances.\n\nGilbert and Sullivan's influence on later musical theatre was profound, creating examples of how to \"integrate\" musicals so that the lyrics and dialogue were designed to advance a coherent story. Their works were admired and copied by early authors and composers of musicals such as Ivan Caryll, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse, and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart, Alan Jay Lerner, Yip Harburg, Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Other British composers of the 1870s and 1880s included Edward Solomon and F. Osmond Carr. The most popular British shows, beginning with the Savoy operas, also enjoyed profitable New York productions and tours of Britain, America, Europe, Australasia and South Africa. These shows were fare for \"respectable\" audiences, a marked contrast from the risqué burlesques, melodramas, minstrel shows, bawdy music hall shows and French operettas that dominated the stage prior to Gilbert and Sullivan and drew a sometimes seedy crowd looking for less wholesome entertainment.\n\nCharles H. Hoyt's \"A Trip to Chinatown\" (1891) was Broadway's long-run champion (until \"Irene\" in 1919), running for 657 performances. Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were both pirated and imitated in New York by productions such as Reginald de Koven's \"Robin Hood\" (1891) and John Philip Sousa's \"El Capitan\" (1896). \"A Trip to Coontown\" (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans in a Broadway theatre (largely inspired by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by the ragtime-tinged \"Clorindy, or the Origin of the Cakewalk\" (1898), and the highly successful \"In Dahomey\" (1902). Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century composed of songs written in New York's Tin Pan Alley by composers such as Gus Edwards, John Walter Bratton and George M. Cohan (\"Little Johnny Jones\" (1904)). Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until the 1920s. Tours, however, were often extensive, beginning with the original Broadway cast.\n\nMeanwhile, musicals had spread to the London stage by the Gay Nineties. George Edwardes had left the management of Richard D'Oyly Carte's Savoy Theatre. He took over the Gaiety Theatre and, at first, he improved the quality of the old burlesques. He perceived that audiences wanted a new alternative to the Savoy-style comic operas and their intellectual, political, absurdist satire. He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the Gaiety, Daly's Theatre and other venues. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and also used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his \"respectable\" corps of dancing, singing Gaiety Girls to complete the musical and visual fun. The success of the first of these, \"In Town\" in 1892 and \"A Gaiety Girl\" in 1893, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking. These \"musical comedies\", as he called them, revolutionized the London stage and set the tone for the next three decades.\nEdwardes' early Gaiety hits included a series of light, romantic \"poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds\" shows, usually with the word \"Girl\" in the title, including \"The Shop Girl\" (1894) and \"A Runaway Girl\" (1898), with music by Ivan Caryll and Lionel Monckton. These shows were immediately widely copied at other London theatres (and soon in America), and the Edwardian musical comedy swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. At Daly's Theatre, Edwardes presented slightly more complex comedy hits. \"The Geisha\" (1896) by Sidney Jones with lyrics by Harry Greenbank and Adrian Ross and then Jones' \"San Toy\" (1899) each ran for more than two years and also found great international success, for example in Australian productions by J. C. Williamson.\n\nThe British musical comedy \"Florodora\" (1899) by Leslie Stuart and Paul Rubens made a splash on both sides of the Atlantic, as did \"A Chinese Honeymoon\" (1901), by British lyricist George Dance and American-born composer Howard Talbot, which ran for a record setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York. The story concerns couples who honeymoon in China and inadvertently break the kissing laws (shades of \"The Mikado\"). \"The Belle of New York\" (1898) ran for 697 performances in London after a brief New York run, becoming the first American musical to run for over a year in London. After the turn of the 20th century, Seymour Hicks (who joined forces with American producer Charles Frohman) wrote popular shows with composer Charles Taylor and others, and Edwardes and Ross continued to churn out hits like \"The Toreador\" (1901), \"A Country Girl\" (1902), \"The Orchid\" (1903), \"The Girls of Gottenberg\" (1907) and \"Our Miss Gibbs\" (1909). Other Edwardian musical comedy hits included \"The Arcadians\" (1909) and \"The Quaker Girl\" (1910).\n\nVirtually eliminated from the English-speaking stage by competition from the ubiquitous Edwardian musical comedies in the 1890s, operettas returned to London and Broadway in 1907 with \"The Merry Widow\", and operettas and musicals became direct competitors for a time. In the early years of the 20th century, English-language adaptations of 19th century continental operettas, as well as operettas by a new generation of European composers, such as Franz Lehár and Oscar Straus, among others, spread throughout the English-speaking world. In America, Victor Herbert produced a string of famous operettas (\"The Fortune Teller\" (1898), \"Babes in Toyland\" (1903), \"Mlle. Modiste\" (1905), \"The Red Mill\" (1906) and \"Naughty Marietta\" (1910)), often with librettist Harry B. Smith, as well as some intimate musical plays with modern settings. In English-speaking countries, during World War I, German-language operetta lost its popularity.\n\nAmong other British and American composers and librettists of the 1910s, the team of P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern stood out. Following in the footsteps of Gilbert and Sullivan, their \"Princess Theatre shows\" paved the way for Kern's later work by showing that a musical could combine light, popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs:\n\nThe theatre-going public needed escapist entertainment during the dark times of World War I, and they flocked to the theatre. Harry Tierney and Joseph McCarthy's 1919 hit musical \"Irene\" ran for 670 performances, a Broadway record that held until 1938's \"Hellzapoppin\". The British public supported far longer runs like that of \"Maid of the Mountains\" (1,352 performances) and especially \"Chu Chin Chow\". Its run of 2,238 performances was more than twice as many as any previous musical, setting a record that stood for nearly forty years until \"Salad Days\". Revues like \"The Bing Boys Are Here\" in Britain, and those of Florenz Ziegfeld and his imitators in America, were also extraordinarily popular. A new generation of composers of operettas emerged in the 1920s, such as Rudolf Friml and Sigmund Romberg.\n\nThe primacy of British musical theatre from the 19th century through 1920 was gradually replaced by American innovation in the 20th century. Edwardes' competitor and counterpart in the U.S. was Charles Frohman and his Theatrical Syndicate. George M. Cohan's and Herbert's musical entertainments after the turn of the century gave way to the Princess Theatre shows and a profusion of other musicals as Kern and other Tin Pan Alley composers began to bring new musical styles such as ragtime and jazz to the theatres. The Shubert Brothers took control of the Broadway theatres after the war as new writers like the Gershwin brothers (George and Ira), Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hart began to produce shows. Musical theatre writer Andrew Lamb notes, \"The triumph of American works over European in the first decades of the twentieth century came about against a changing social background. The operatic and theatrical styles of nineteenth-century social structures were replaced by a musical style more aptly suited to twentieth-century society and its vernacular idiom. It was from America that the more direct style emerged, and in America that it was able to flourish in a developing society less hidebound by nineteenth-century tradition.\"\n\nThe musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall and other light entertainments, tended to emphasize star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs, at the expense of plot. Typical of the decade were lighthearted productions like \"Sally\"; \"Lady Be Good\"; \"Sunny\"; \"No, No, Nanette\"; \"Oh, Kay!\" and \"Funny Face\". While the books of these shows may have been forgettable, they featured stars such as Marilyn Miller and Fred Astaire and produced dozens of enduring popular songs (\"standards\") by, most notably, Jerome Kern, the Gershwin brothers, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Vincent Youmans, and the team of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, popular music was dominated by musical theatre composers and lyricists. These musicals and the standards they produced, including \"Fascinating Rhythm\", \"Tea for Two\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", became popular on both sides of the Atlantic ocean.\n\nMany shows were revues, series of sketches and songs with little or no connection between them. The best-known of these were the annual \"Ziegfeld Follies\", spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets, elaborate costumes, and beautiful chorus girls. These spectacles also raised production values, and mounting a musical generally became more expensive. \"Shuffle Along\", an all-African American show was a hit on Broadway. In London, stars such as Ivor Novello and Noël Coward became popular. Meanwhile, operettas, which had been nearly absent from the English-speaking stage since World War I, had a last burst of popularity; works by continental European composers were successful, as were those by Sigmund Romberg and Rudolf Friml in America, which included \"Rose-Marie\" and \"The Student Prince\" respectively. The last hit operetta of the era on Broadway was Romberg's \"The New Moon\" in 1928.\n\nProgressing far beyond the comparatively frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, \"Show Boat\", which premiered on December 27, 1927 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York, represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. This was accomplished by combining the lyricism of Kern's music with the skillful craft of Oscar Hammerstein II, who adapted Edna Ferber's novel and wrote lyrics for the show. One historian wrote, \"Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now ... the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.\" However, Bordman argues, \"\"Show Boat\" is certainly an operetta with its many arioso passages, its musical depth and seriousness, and its romantic story set, in typical operetta fashion, in the long ago and far away.\" Nevertheless, as the Great Depression set in during the post-Broadway national tour of \"Show Boat\", the public turned back to light, brassy, escapist entertainment, and no follow-up was produced so seriously treating serious social themes until \"Oklahoma!\" in 1943.\n\nThe motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition to theatre. But by the end of the 1920s, films like \"The Jazz Singer\" could be presented with synchronized sound. \"Talkie\" films at low prices effectively killed off vaudeville by the early 1930s. Historian John Kenrick commented: \"Top vaudeville stars filmed their acts for one-time pay-offs, inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville. After all, when 'small time' theatres could offer 'big time' performers on screen at a nickel a seat, who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent?\"\n\nThe Great Depression affected theatre audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as people had little money to spend on entertainment. Only a few stage shows exceeded a run on Broadway or in London of 500 performances during the decade.\n\nMany shows continued the lighthearted song-and-dance style of their 1920s predecessors. The revue \"The Band Wagon\" (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, while Cole Porter's \"Anything Goes\" (1934) confirmed Ethel Merman's position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. British writers such as Noël Coward and Ivor Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as \"The Dancing Years\". Similarly, Rodgers & Hart returned from Hollywood to churn out a series of Broadway hits, including \"On Your Toes\" (1936, with Ray Bolger, the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), \"Babes In Arms\" (1937), and \"The Boys From Syracuse\" (1938), and Cole Porter wrote a similar string of hits, including \"Anything Goes\" (1934) and \"DuBarry Was a Lady\" (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was \"Hellzapoppin\" (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record that was finally beaten by \"Oklahoma!\" five years later.\nHowever, a few creative teams began to build on \"Show Boat\"'s innovations, experimenting with musical satire, topical books and operatic scope. \"Of Thee I Sing\" (1931), a political satire with music by George Gershwin and lyrics by Ira Gershwin and Morrie Ryskind, was the first musical awarded the Pulitzer Prize. \"As Thousands Cheer\" (1933), a revue by Irving Berlin and Moss Hart in which each song or sketch was based on a newspaper headline, marked the first Broadway show in which an African-American, Ethel Waters, starred alongside white actors. Waters' numbers included \"Supper Time\", a woman's lament for her husband who has been lynched. \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935), by the Gershwin brothers and DuBose Heyward, featured an all African-American cast and blended operatic, folk, and jazz idioms. It has entered the permanent opera repertory and, in some respects, it foreshadowed such \"operatic\" musicals as \"West Side Story\" and \"Sweeney Todd\". \"The Cradle Will Rock\" (1937), with a book and score by Marc Blitzstein and direction by Orson Welles, was a highly political pro-union piece that, despite the controversy surrounding it, managed to run for 108 performances. Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's \"I'd Rather Be Right\" (1937) was a political satire with George M. Cohan as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Kurt Weill's \"Knickerbocker Holiday\", based on source writings by Washington Irving, depicted New York City's early history while good-naturedly satirizing the good intentions of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDespite the economic woes of the decade and the competition from film, the musical survived. In fact, the move towards political satire in \"Of Thee I Sing\", \"I'd Rather Be Right\" and \"Knickerbocker Holiday\", together with the musical sophistication of the Gershwin, Kern, Rodgers and Weill musicals and the fast-paced staging and naturalistic dialogue style created by director George Abbott, showed that musical theatre was beginning to evolve beyond the gags and showgirls musicals of the \"Gay Nineties\" and \"Roaring Twenties\" and the sentimental romance of operetta. Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\" (1943) completed the revolution begun by \"Show Boat\", by tightly integrating all the aspects of musical theatre, with a cohesive and more serious plot, and songs and dances that furthered the action of the story and developed the characters. It was also the first \"blockbuster\" Broadway show, running a total of 2,212 performances, and was made into a hit film.\n\n\n"}

It was released worldwide on October 17, 2017, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows. The game has been described as a \"edgy, dark, uncompromising, and complex\" post-apocalyptic sci-fi role-playing game where the protagonist joins the war for the powerful resource, \"ELEX\", which gives people magic-like powers. The game world is a mix of futuristic and medieval locations, in which the player can use guns, swords and magic against enemies.\n\nMagalan was a planet looking to the future. Then a comet hit the planet, causing massive destruction. Those who survived are now trapped in a battle to survive, and a struggle to decide the fate of the planet. At the center of this fight is the element ELEX, a precious and limited resource that arrived with the meteor, which can power machines, give magical powers, or re-sculpt life into new, different forms. The protagonist is a former member of the Albs, who use ELEX to power their advanced technology and consume it to gain enhanced strength as well as rid them of emotions and enable them to make decisions based on cold logic alone.\n\nRecovering from a crash in his glider jet, the protagonist goes through withdrawal from ELEX, experiences emotions for the first time in his life, and is classified as a traitor to the Albs. A central conflict of the story will be the player character's history with the Albs and the need to hide his former identity from the factions he previously fought with.\n\nThe player can cooperate with and eventually join one of three factions in the game. The Berserkers have renounced modern technology and the use of Elex, instead finding a way to purify the substance into Mana to weave magic and restore life to nature. The Clerics fanatically worship a god called Calaan and operate like a religious police state where consuming Elex is expressly forbidden but it is used to power complex war technologies. The Outlaws have no formal leadership and operate with a \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, using improvised and deadly weaponry, and consume Elex in the form of specialized stimulant drugs.\n\n\"ELEX\" is an action role-playing game set in a post-apocalyptic open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The player can use both swords and firearms in the game, with magic becoming available later. The game includes mutated creatures as one of the enemy types, and has an interconnected quest system that supports player choices. The player may join up with one of three factions - the Berserkers who use ELEX for magical purposes, the Clerics who use the substance to power their machines, or the Outlaws who embrace an \"everyone for themselves\" philosophy.\n\n\"ELEX\" was announced during Gamescom 2015, where Piranha Bytes and Nordic Games confirmed their partnership on the project. It was featured as a cover story in the German magazine \"GameStar\".\n\n\"ELEX\" received \"mixed to average\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

{"id": "1758267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1758267", "title": "Giallo", "text": "Giallo\n\nGiallo (; plural gialli) is a 20th-century Italian genre of literature and film. Especially outside Italy, \"giallo\" refers specifically to a particular Italian thriller-horror genre that has mystery or detective elements and often contains slasher, crime fiction, psychological thriller, psychological horror, exploitation, sexploitation, and, less frequently, supernatural horror elements. In Italy, the term generally denotes thrillers, typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror subgenres, regardless of the country of origin.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, the term \"giallo\" often refers to the Italian film version of the genre, a particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery thriller-horror film that usually blends the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French \"fantastique\" genre), and often involves a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the final act of the film. The genre developed in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades. (Some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.\n\nThe word \"giallo\" is Italian for yellow. The term derives from a series of cheap paperback mystery novels with yellow covers that were popular in post-fascist Italy.\n\nThe term \"giallo\" (\"yellow\") derives from a series of crime-mystery pulp novels entitled \"Il Giallo Mondadori\" (\"Mondadori Yellow\"), published by Mondadori from 1929 and taking its name from the trademark yellow cover background. The series consisted almost exclusively of Italian translations of mystery novels by British and American writers. These included Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Edgar Wallace, Ed McBain, Rex Stout and Raymond Chandler.\n\nPublished as cheap paperbacks, the success of the \"giallo\" novels soon began attracting the attention of other Italian publishing houses. They published their own versions and mimicked the yellow covers. The popularity of these series eventually established the word \"giallo\" as a synonym in Italian for a mystery novel. In colloquial and media usage in Italy, it also applied to a mysterious or unsolved affair.\n\nIn the Italian language, \"giallo\" is a broad term that can be translated as \"crime novel\" including any literary genre involving crime and mystery, with all its sub-genres such as crime fiction, detective story, murder mystery or thriller-horror.\n\nIn the movie context, for Italian audiences \"giallo\" has come to refer to any kind of murder mystery or horror thriller, regardless of its origin. Thus, American, British or other horror-thrillers such as \"Psycho\", \"Vertigo\", and \"Peeping Tom\" are considered \"gialli\".\n\nEnglish-speaking audiences have used the term to refer specifically to the type of Italian-produced thriller-horror films known to Italian audiences as \"giallo all'italiana\".\n\nThe film subgenre began as literal adaptations of the \"giallo\" mystery novels. Directors soon began taking advantage of modern cinematic techniques to create a unique genre that retained the mystery and crime fiction elements of \"giallo\" novels but veered more closely into the psychological thriller or psychological horror genres. Many of the typical characteristics of these films were incorporated into the later American slasher genre.\n\nCritics disagree on characterization of a \"giallo\" film. Gary Needham wrote:\n\nBy its very nature, the \"giallo\" challenges our assumptions about how non-Hollywood films should be classified, going beyond the sort of Anglo-American taxonomic imaginary that \"fixes\" genre both in film criticism and the film industry in order to designate something specific. ...however, despite the \"giallo\"'s resistance to clear definition there are nevertheless identifiable thematic and stylistic tropes.\n\nThese distinct \"thematic and stylistic tropes\" constitute a loose definition of the genre which is broadly consistent, though various critics have proposed slightly differing characteristic details (which consequently creates some confusion over which films can be considered gialli).\n\nAlthough they often involve crime and detective work, gialli should not be confused with the other popular Italian crime genre of the 1970s, the \"poliziotteschi\", which includes more action-oriented films about violent law enforcement officers (largely influenced by gritty 1970s American films such as \"Dirty Harry\", \"Death Wish\", \"The Godfather\", \"Serpico\", and \"The French Connection\"). Directors and stars often moved between both genres and some films could be considered under either banner, such as Massimo Dallamano's 1974 film \"La polizia chiede aiuto\" (\"What Have They Done to Your Daughters?\"). Most critics agree that the \"giallo\" represents a distinct category with unique features.\n\nGiallo films are generally characterized as gruesome murder-mystery thrillers, that combine the suspense elements of detective fiction with scenes of shocking horror, featuring excessive bloodletting, stylish camerawork and often jarring musical arrangements. The archetypal \"giallo\" plot involves a mysterious, black-gloved psychopathic killer who stalks and butchers a series of beautiful women. While most gialli involve a human killer, some also feature a supernatural element.\n\nThe typical \"giallo\" protagonist is an outsider of some type, often a traveler or tourist, and usually a young woman (gialli rarely feature law enforcement officers as chief protagonists, which would be more characteristic of the poliziotteschi genre). The protagonists are generally unconnected to the murders before they begin and are drawn to help find the killer through their role as a witness to one of the murders. The mystery is the identity of the killer, who is often revealed in the climax to be another key character, who conceals his or her identity with a disguise (usually some combination of hat, mask, sunglasses, gloves, and trench coat). Thus, the literary whodunit element of the \"giallo\" novels is retained, while being filtered through horror genre elements and Italy's long standing tradition of opera and staged grand guignol drama. The structure of \"giallo\" films is also sometimes reminiscent of the so-called \"weird menace\" pulp magazine horror mystery genre of the 1930–1940s, a genre itself also heavily influenced by grand guignol and related to the original Italian \"giallo\" novels.\n\nIt is important to note that while most gialli feature elements of this basic narrative structure, not all do. Some films (for example Mario Bava's 1970 \"Hatchet for the Honeymoon\", which features the killer as the protagonist) may radically alter the traditional structure or abandon it altogether and still be considered gialli due to stylistic or thematic tropes, rather than narrative ones. A consistent element of the genre, is an unusual lack of focus on coherent or logical narrative storytelling. While most have a nominal mystery structure, they may feature bizarre or seemingly nonsensical plot elements and a general disregard for realism in acting, dialogue and character motivation. As Jon Abrams wrote, \"Individually, each [\"giallo\"] is like an improv exercise in murder, with each filmmaker having access to a handful of shared props and themes. Black gloves, sexual ambiguity, and psychoanalytic trauma may be at the heart of each film, but the genre itself is without consistent narrative form.\"\n\nWhile a shadowy killer and mystery narrative are common to most gialli, the most consistent and notable shared trope in the \"giallo\" tradition is the focus on grisly death sequences. The murders are invariably violent and gory, featuring a variety of explicit and imaginative attacks. These scenes frequently evoke some degree of voyeurism, sometimes going so far as to present the murder from the first-person perspective of the killer, with the black-gloved hand holding a knife viewed from the killer's point of view. The murders often occur when the victim is most vulnerable (showering, taking a bath, or scantily clad); as such, \"giallo\" films often include liberal amounts of nudity and sex, almost all of it featuring beautiful young women (actresses associated with the genre include Edwige Fenech, Barbara Bach, Daria Nicolodi, Mimsy Farmer, Barbara Bouchet, Suzy Kendall, Ida Galli and Anita Strindberg). Due to the titillating emphasis on explicit sex and violence, gialli are sometimes categorized as exploitation cinema. The association of female sexuality and brutal violence has led some commentators to accuse the genre of misogyny.\n\nGialli are noted for psychological themes of madness, alienation, sexuality and paranoia. The protagonist is usually a witness to a gruesome crime but frequently finds their testimony subject to skepticism from authority figures, leading to a questioning of their own perception and authority. This ambiguity of memory and perception can escalate to delusion, hallucination and delirious paranoia. Since gialli protagonists are typically female, this can lead to what writer Gary Needham calls, \"...the \"giallo\"'s inherent pathologising of femininity and fascination with \"sick\" women.\" The killer is likely to be mentally ill as well; \"giallo\" killers are almost always motivated by insanity caused by some past psychological trauma, often of a sexual nature (and sometimes depicted in flashbacks). The emphasis on madness and subjective perception has roots in the \"giallo\" novels (for example, Sergio Martino's \"Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key\" was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Black Cat\", which deals with a psychologically unstable narrator) but also finds expression in the tools of cinema: The unsteady mental state of both victim and killer is often mirrored by the wildly exaggerated style and unfocused narrative common to many gialli.\n\nWriter Mikel J. Koven posits that gialli reflect an ambivalence over the social upheaval modernity brought to Italian culture in the 1960s.\n\n\"The changes within Italian culture... can be seen throughout the \"giallo\" film as something to be discussed and debated -- issues pertaining to identity, sexuality, increasing levels of violence, women's control over their own lives and bodies, history, the state -- all abstract ideas, which are all portrayed situationally as human stories in the \"giallo\" film.\n\nGialli have been noted for their strong cinematic technique, with critics praising their editing, production design, music and visual style even in the marked absence of other facets usually associated with critical admiration (as gialli frequently lack characterization, believable dialogue, realistic performances and logical coherence in the narrative). Alexia Kannas Wrote of 1968's \"La morte ha fatto l'uovo\" (\"Death Laid an Egg\") that \"While the film has garnered a reputation for its supreme narrative difficulty (just as many art films have), its aesthetic brilliance is irrefutable\", while Leon Hunt wrote that frequent gialli director Dario Argento's work \"vacillate[s] between strategies of art cinema and exploitation\".\n\nGialli are frequently associated with strong technical cinematography and stylish visuals. Critic Maitland McDonagh describes the visuals of \"Profondo rosso\" (\"Deep Red\") as, \"vivid colors and bizarre camera angles, dizzying pans and flamboyant tracking shots, disorienting framing and composition, fetishistic close-ups of quivering eyes and weird objects (knives, dolls, marbles, braided scraps of wool)...\" In addition to the iconic images of shadowy black-gloved killers and gruesome violence, gialli also frequently employ strongly stylized and even occasionally surreal uses of color. Directors Dario Argento and Mario Bava are particularly known for their impressionistic imagery and use of lurid colors, though other \"giallo\" directors (notably Lucio Fulci) employed more sedate, realistic styles as well. Due to their typical 1970s milieu, some commentators have also noted their potential for visual camp, especially in terms of fashion and decor.\n\nMusic has been cited as a key to the genre's unique character; critic Maitland McDonagh describes \"Profondo rosso\" (\"Deep Red\") as an \"overwhelming visceral experience...equal parts visual...and aural.\" Writer Anne Billson explains, \"The Giallo Sound is typically an intoxicating mix of groovy lounge music, nerve-jangling discord, and the sort of soothing lyricism that belies the fact that it's actually accompanying, say, a slow motion decapitation\", (she cites as an example Ennio Morricone's score for 1971's \"Four Flies on Grey Velvet\"). Composers of note include Morricone, Bruno Nicolai, and the Italian band Goblin (all three of whom are probably best known for their collaborations with director Dario Argento, though they worked with other directors as well). Other important composers known for their work on \"giallo\" films include Piero Umiliani (composer for \"Five Dolls for an August Moon)\", Riz Ortolani (\"The Pyjama Girl Case\") and Fabio Frizzi (\"Sette note in nero\" a.k.a.\"The Psychic\").\n\nGialli often feature lurid or baroque titles, frequently employing animal references or the use of numbers. Examples of the former trend include \"Sette scialli di seta gialla\" (\"Crimes of the Black Cat\"), \"Non si sevizia un paperino\" (\"Don't Torture a Duckling\"), \"La morte negli occhi del gatto\" (\"Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye\") and \"La tarantola dal ventre nero\" (\"Black Belly of the Tarantula\"); while instances of the latter include \"Sette note in nero\" (\"Seven Notes in Black\") and \"The Fifth Cord\".\n\nThe first \"giallo\" novel to be adapted for film was James M. Cain's \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\", adapted in 1943 by Luchino Visconti as \"Ossessione\". Though the film was technically the first of Mondadori's \"giallo\" series to be adapted, its neo-realist style was markedly different from the stylized, violent character which subsequent adaptations would acquire. Condemned by the fascist government, \"Obsessione\" was eventually hailed as a landmark of neo-realist cinema, but it did not provoke any further \"giallo\" adaptations for almost 20 years.\n\nIn addition to the literary \"giallo\" tradition, early gialli were also influenced by the German \"krimi\" films of the early 1960s. Produced by Danish/German studio Rialto Film, these black-and-white crime movies based on Edgar Wallace stories typically featured whodunit mystery plots with a masked killer, anticipating several key components of the \"giallo\" movement by several years. Despite their link to \"giallo\" author Wallace, though, they featured little of the excessive stylization and gore which would define Italian gialli.\n\nThe Swedish director Arne Mattsson has also been pointed to as a possible influence, in particular his 1958 film \"Mannequin in Red\". Though the film shares stylistic and narrative similarities with later \"giallo\" films (particularly its use of color and its multiple murder plot), there is no direct evidence that subsequent Italian directors had seen it.\n\nThe first \"true\" \"giallo\" film is usually considered to be Mario Bava's \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" (1963). Its title alludes to Alfred Hitchcock's classic \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1934, remade by Hitchcock in 1956), highlighting the early link between gialli and Anglo-American crime stories. Though shot in black and white and lacking the lurid violence and sexuality which would define later gialli, the film has been credited with establishing the essential structure of the genre: in it, a young American tourist in Rome witnesses a murder, finds her testimony dismissed by the authorities, and must attempt to uncover the killer's identity herself. Bava drew on the krimi tradition as well as the Hitchcockian style referenced in the title, and the film's structure served as a basic template for many of the gialli that would follow.\n\nBava followed \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" the next year with the stylish and influential \"Blood and Black Lace\" (1964). It introduced a number of elements that became emblematic of the genre: a masked stalker with a shiny weapon in his black-gloved hand who brutally murders a series of glamorous fashion models. Though the movie was not a financial success at the time, the tropes it introduced (particularly its black-gloved killer, provocative sexuality, and bold use of color) would become iconic of the genre.\"\n\nSeveral similarly-themed crime/thriller movies followed in the next few years, including early efforts from directors Antonio Margheriti (\"Nude... si muore\" [\"Naked You Die\"] in 1968), Umberto Lenzi (\"Orgasmo\" in 1968, \"Paranoia\" [\"A Quiet Place to Kill\"] and \"Così dolce... così perversa\" [\"So Sweet... So Perverse\"] in 1969) and Lucio Fulci (\"Una sull'altra\" [\"One on Top of the Other\"] in 1969), all of whom would go on to become major creative forces in the burgeoning genre. But it was Dario Argento's first feature, in 1970, that turned the \"giallo\" into a major cultural phenomenon. That film, \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\", was greatly influenced by \"Blood and Black Lace\", and introduced a new level of stylish violence and suspense that helped redefine the genre. The film was a box office smash and was widely imitated. Its success provoked a frenzy of Italian films with stylish, violent, and sexually provocative murder plots, (Argento alone made three more in the next five years) essentially cementing the genre in the public consciousness. In 1996, director Michele Soavi wrote, \"there's no doubt that it was Mario Bava who started the \"spaghetti thrillers\" [but] Argento gave them a great boost, a turning point, a new style...'new clothes'. Mario had grown old and Dario made it his own genre... this had repercussions on genre cinema, which, thanks to Dario, was given a new lease on life.\" The success of \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\" provoked a decade which saw multiple gialli produced every year. In English-language film circles, the term \"giallo\" gradually became synonymous with a heavy, theatrical and stylized visual element.\n\nThe \"giallo\" genre had its heyday from 1968 through 1978. The most prolific period, however, was the three-year timespan between 1971 and 1973, during which time 65 different gialli were produced (see filmography below). Directors like Bava, Argento, Fulci, Lenzi, and Margheriti continued to produce gialli throughout the 70s and beyond, and were soon joined by other notable directors including Sergio Martino, Paolo Cavara, Armando Crispino, Ruggero Deodato and Bava's son Lamberto Bava. The genre also spread to Spain by the early 70s, resulting in films like \"La residencia\" (\"The House That Screamed\") (1969) and \"Los Ojos Azules de la Muneca Rota\" (\"Blue Eyes Of The Broken Doll\") (1973) which had unmistakable \"giallo\" characteristics but feature Spanish casts and production talent. Though they preceded the first \"giallo\" by a few years, German krimi films continued to be made contemporaneously with early gialli, and were also influenced by their success. As the popularity of krimis declined in Germany, Rialto Film began increasingly pairing with Italian production companies and filmmakers (such as composer Ennio Morricone and director, cinematographer Joe D'Amato, who worked on later krimi films following their successes in Italy). The overlap between the two movements is extensive enough that one of Rialto's final krimi films, \"Cosa avete fatto a Solange?\" (\"What Have You Done to Solange?\"), features an Italian director and crew and has been called a \"giallo\" in its own right.\n\nGialli continued to be produced throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but gradually their popularity diminished and film budgets and production values began shrinking. Director Pupi Avati satirized the genre in 1977 with a slapstick \"giallo\" titled \"Tutti defunti... tranne i morti\".\n\nThough the \"giallo\" cycle waned in the 1990s and saw few entries in the 2000s, they continue to be produced, notably by Argento (who in 2009 released a film actually titled \"Giallo\", somewhat in homage to his long career in the genre) and co-directors Hélène Cattet & Bruno Forzani, whose \"Amer\" (which uses music from older giallis, including tracks by Morricone and Bruno Nicolai) received a positive critical reception upon its release in 2009. To a large degree, the genre's influence lives on in the slasher films which became enormously popular during the 1980s and drew heavily on tropes developed by earlier gialli.\n\nThe \"giallo\" cycle has had a lasting effect on horror films and murder mysteries made outside Italy since the late 1960s. This cinematic style and unflinching content is also at the root of the gory slasher and splatter films that became widely popular in the early 1980s. In particular, two violent shockers from Mario Bava, \"Hatchet for the Honeymoon\" (1970) and \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" (1971) were especially influential.\n\nEarly examples of the \"giallo\" effect can be seen in the British film \"Berserk!\" (1967) and the American mystery-thrillers \"No Way to Treat a Lady\" (1968), \"Klute\" (1971), \"Pretty Maids All in a Row\" (1971, based on an Italian novel), Alfred Hitchcock's \"Frenzy\" (1972), Vincent Price's \"Madhouse\" (1974) and \"Eyes of Laura Mars\" (1978). \"Berberian Sound Studio\" (2012) offers an affectionate tribute to the genre.\n\nDirector Eli Roth has called the \"giallo\" \"one of my favorite, favorite subgenres of film,\" and specifically cited Sergio Martino's \"Torso\" (\"I corpi presentano tracce di violenza carnale\") (along with the Spanish horror film \"Who Can Kill a Child?\") as influential on his 2005 film \"Hostel\", writing, \"...these seventies Italian giallos start off with a group of students that are in Rome, lots of scenes in piazzas with telephoto lenses, and you get the feeling they're being watched. There's this real ominous creepy feeling. The girls are always going on some trip somewhere and they're all very smart. They all make decisions the audience would make.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47083555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47083555", "title": "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child", "text": "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a two-part stage play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by Thorne, J. K. Rowling and John Tiffany. Previews of the play began at the Palace Theatre, London on 7 June 2016, and it premiered on 30 July 2016.\n\nThe play opened on Broadway on 22 April 2018 at the Lyric Theatre, with previews starting on 16 March 2018. Its cast is similar to that of the first year on West End, with returning actors Anthony Boyle, Sam Clemmett, Noma Dumezweni, Poppy Miller, Jamie Parker, Alex Price, and Paul Thornley.\n\nThe story begins nineteen years after the events of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" and follows Harry Potter, now a Ministry of Magic employee, and his younger son Albus Severus Potter, who is about to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nAt the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, the London production received a record-breaking eleven nominations and an again record-breaking nine awards, including Best New Play, Best Actor, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Director. At the 2018 Tony Awards, the Broadway production won six awards, including Best Play.\n\nIn December 2013, it was revealed that a stage play based on \"Harry Potter\" had been in development for around a year, with the view to bringing it to the stage sometime in 2016. At the time of the announcement, Rowling revealed that the play would \"explore the previously untold story of Harry's early years as an orphan and outcast\". The following May, Rowling began establishing the creative team for the project.\n\nOn 26 June 2015, the project was officially confirmed under the title of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", and it was revealed it would receive its world premiere in mid-2016 at London's Palace Theatre. The announcement marked the eighteenth anniversary of the publication of the first \"Harry Potter\" novel, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", published on 26 June 1997.\n\nOn announcing plans for the project, Rowling stated that the play would not be a prequel. In response to queries regarding the choice of a play rather than a new novel, Rowling has stated that she \"is confident that when audiences see the play they will agree that it is the only proper medium for the story\". Rowling has also assured audiences that the play will contain an entirely new story and will not be a rehashing of previously explored content. On 24 September 2015, Rowling announced that the play had been split into two parts. The parts are designed to be viewed on the same day or consecutively over two evenings.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, it was confirmed the plays were set nineteen years after the conclusion of the final novel \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", and would open at London's Palace Theatre in July 2016. The plays principally follow Harry, now Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and his younger son Albus Severus Potter. , little more had been revealed about the plot even by those who had attended the previews since 7 June.\n\nThe producers and Rowling have maintained a campaign called #KeepTheSecrets to ask people who have seen the play not to reveal its major twists. The slogan is printed on the tickets for the play and badges with the slogan are handed out for free during intervals. People buying their tickets online are emailed a video after the play from J.K. Rowling asking them to support the campaign.\n\nIn the opening scene, set during the epilogue of \"Deathly Hallows\" in the year 2017, Harry Potter and Ginny Potter send their second son, Albus Severus Potter, on the Hogwarts Express to begin his first year at Hogwarts. Harry is now working in a desk job as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic, while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of \"The Daily Prophet\". Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also send their daughter Rose Granger-Weasley on the train. Hermione is now Minister of Magic, while Ron manages Weasley's Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley. Albus makes an unlikely friendship in Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry's former nemesis Draco Malfoy and Astoria Malfoy (née Greengrass). The school is stunned when, in a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into Gryffindor, Albus is sorted into Slytherin alongside Scorpius.\n\nBoth boys are bullied by other students over the next few years, Albus due to his perceived failure to live up to his parents, Scorpius due to unproven rumours that he is the son of Lord Voldemort. In addition, Albus and Harry begin to drift apart, owing to Albus's struggles with his father's shadow and Harry's uncertainty on how to deal with his son's issues. Albus also drifts apart from Rose, with whom he was friends before meeting Scorpius and who was sorted into Gryffindor. Prior to Albus and Scorpius's fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with his father after he is given Harry's baby blanket and a love potion from Ron. During the fight, Harry accidentally says that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.\n\nHarry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the Time-Turner, built by a Slytherin contemporary of Harry's, Theodore Nott, that allows one to travel back several years into the past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar begins to hurt again, causing him to become concerned that Voldemort may somehow be returning. Amos Diggory, who has become old and is cared for by his niece, Delphi Diggory, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent the death of his son, Cedric Diggory. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so himself and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express and the trolley operator, who is revealed to be a monster placed on the train to prevent students from escaping. The two arrive at St. Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards in Yorkshire, where Amos lives, and team up with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with Polyjuice Potion.\n\nKnowing that Cedric's death was the result of him winning the Triwizard Tournament alongside Harry, the boys use the Time-Turner to travel back to the first challenge of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994 and sabotage Cedric during the tournament's first task in the hope of preventing his victory. Instead, they only succeed in creating an alternate reality in which Ron and Hermione never married, and thus Rose was never born, and Albus was sorted into Gryffindor. Albus discovers that this was because they chose to disguise themselves as Durmstrang students, causing Hermione to become suspicious of Viktor Krum and go to the Yule Ball with Ron instead of Viktor. As a result, Ron never experienced the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione, fell in love with Padma Patil at the Ball, and eventually became married to her, having a son named Panju. Hermione, in turn, became a frustrated and mean professor at Hogwarts, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\nAt around the same time, Harry's fear increases that Voldemort may return as his scar continues to hurt and as he has Voldemort-related nightmares. After speaking with a portrait of Dumbledore, and being told by centaur Bane that a \"dark cloud\" is around Albus, he becomes convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus and tries to have the boys kept apart at Hogwarts by forcing a reluctant Minerva McGonagall, now Headmistress of Hogwarts, to keep tabs on Albus using the Marauder's Map, threatening to shut down the school otherwise.\n\nAlbus and Scorpius's friendship is destroyed, but the two eventually reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old Invisibility Cloak from James Sirius (Albus' older brother), and after McGonagall refuses to enforce Harry's request. Harry himself is persuaded to relent after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus and Scorpius decide to make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to change Cedric's fate, this time by humiliating him during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, however, Albus is not with him, and Scorpius finds himself in a reality in which Harry is dead, and Lord Voldemort rules the wizarding world.\n\nScorpius discovers that – as a result of his actions – an embittered Cedric joined the Death Eaters and killed Neville Longbottom during the events of \"Deathly Hallows\", preventing him from killing Nagini and allowing Voldemort to win the Battle of Hogwarts. With Harry now dead, Albus subsequently never existed, while Voldemort was able to completely consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic into a dictatorial regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and Quidditch star, helping the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. Dolores Umbridge became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and patrols the school with Dementors and a revived Inquisitorial Squad led by Scorpius. Draco Malfoy occupies Harry's old position as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, using his post to encourage routine attacks on Muggles and bribe the Prime Minister to remain silent on the actions of the Death Eaters.\n\nA powerful dark figure called \"The Augurey\" leads the Ministry of Magic. With help from Ron, Hermione, and Severus Snape, now the final members of a dwindling anti-Voldemort resistance movement, Scorpius is able to use the Time-Turner to prevent the interference of Albus and his past self and restore the events of the original timeline, the alternate Ron, Hermione, and Snape sacrificing themselves to the Dementors in order to allow him to do so. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two boys are eventually found by their parents, as well as Ron and Hermione. Following these events, Harry scolds Albus for his actions, but the two nevertheless begin to reconcile.\n\nRealising the danger the Time-Turner poses and deciding their parents will continue to keep it (as Hermione had done in the Ministry of Magic), Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it themselves, but they are joined by Delphi Diggory. Scorpius realizes that Delphi was in charge of the Ministry of Magic in the alternate timeline (from her tattoo of the wings of a magical bird, which she says is called an Augurey), and she takes them captive, later revealing her intention of restoring the alternate timeline.\n\nAfter the adults learn Albus and Scorpius were seen disappearing with Delphi, they confront Amos, only to discover Delphi is not his niece, but the daughter of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Delphi had placed Amos under a \"confundus\" charm. Searching her room, they discover she is following a prophecy that, if fulfilled, would lead to Lord Voldemort's return. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius prevent her from acting, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel further back in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her and then destroys the Time-Turner to leave them all stranded in time.\n\nAbandoned by Delphi, Albus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night before Harry's parents were killed at Godric's Hollow (30 October 1981), and assume Delphi is planning to kill Harry before Voldemort attempts to do so (which severely weakens Voldemort). Albus and Scorpius write an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present (which is now also the night of the anniversary of the death of Harry's parents, when he often looks for his blanket as it is the only physical memento he has), the blanket would become stained with love potion and expose the message to Harry.\n\nMeanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him (it was made for his father), but they remain unable to rescue the boys due to their uncertainty over which time period they have entered. After Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to save them and stop Delphi. While waiting for Delphi, they deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his doomed attempt to kill Harry, ensuring her father's survival and allowing her to be with him.\n\nHarry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, and after a struggle, the group manages to subdue her. Rather than killing Delphi, it is decided that she will be brought to Azkaban Prison. Lord Voldemort then appears and is oblivious to the presence of Harry and the group. The group allows the murder of Harry's parents to play out again, unwilling to risk the consequences of altering the past.\n\nThey all stand with Harry to watch the sad event replay. After returning to the present day, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius now decide to be more active at Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for Quidditch and asking Rose on a date. Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, with Harry apologizing for his role in Cedric's death. Albus has also witnessed the death of a fellow student, Craig Bowker Jr. (the only current timeline murder in the play), who tried to intervene when Delphi held Albus and Scorpius captive on the Quidditch pitch.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", a two-part play, was written by British playwright Jack Thorne based on an original story by Thorne, John Tiffany and Rowling. Some websites were listing all three as authors of the script but by 26 July 2016, the official web site for the play and many others (including the BBC) were listing Thorne as the sole script writer.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" is directed by John Tiffany with choreography by Steven Hoggett, set design by Christine Jones, costume design by Katrina Lindsay, lighting design by Neil Austin, music by Imogen Heap, and sound design by Gareth Fry. In addition, special effects were created by Jeremy Chernick, with illusions by Jamie Harrison, and musical supervision by Martin Lowe.\n\nPreviews at the West End Palace Theatre, London began on 7 June 2016, with the official opening night for both parts on 30 July, and originally booking until 18 September 2016. Tickets went on sale to pre-registered priority bookers on 28 October 2015, with a public sale scheduled to commence on 30 October. In just under 8 hours of priority booking 175,000 tickets were sold for the world premiere production, with the play's booking period extended to January 2017. On commencement of the public sale booking was extended until 30 April 2017, with a further extension issued the same day to 27 May 2017.\n\nTickets for the opening performance were priced from £30 up to £130 for a ticket for both parts, although ticket resale agencies were selling seats for up to £3,000. Ticket resale has been banned by the producers, with tickets no longer valid if sold on. In mid-July 2016, the theatre began holding a ticket lottery at 1 pm each Friday, releasing 40 for sale on their website for \"some of the best seats\" in the theatre for the lowest price, advertised at £20 per part. For example, the \"Friday Forty\" tickets sold on 29 July 2016 were for performances on 3, 5, 6, and 7 August.\n\nOn 20 December 2015, initial casting was announced with Jamie Parker playing Harry Potter, Noma Dumezweni playing Hermione Granger and Paul Thornley playing Ron Weasley. The casting of the dark-skinned Noma Dumezweni as Hermione sparked fervent discussion, to which Rowling responded that Hermione's skin was never specified as white. Further notable casting includes Poppy Miller as Ginny Potter, Alex Price as Draco Malfoy, Sam Clemmett as Albus Severus Potter and Anthony Boyle as Scorpius Malfoy. The production features an overall cast of 42.\n\nThe production began previews on 16 March 2018, officially opening on 22 April at the Lyric Theatre. Clemmett, Boyle, Dumezweni, Miller, Parker, Price and Thornley reprised their roles, from the West End. The theatre removed 400 seats from the auditorium and moved the entrance to 43rd Street. The production is produced by Sonia Friedman Productions, Sir Colin Callender, and Harry Potter Theatrical Productions. Tickets initially went on sale through Ticketmaster Verified Fan on 18 October 2017, for performances from 16 March through 18 November 2018. The New York Times estimates that it is the most expensive non-musical Broadway play ever, incurring $68 million in opening costs.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, the Michael Cassel Group announced that it will be producing the Australian premiere of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\". The show will open on 16 January 2019 in Melbourne's Princess Theatre, where it will reportedly have an exclusive two-year residency. Presale tickets were released on 2 August 2018, selling more than 200,000 tickets in just four days, before the public sale tickets were released.\n\nThe 35 original Australian adult cast was revealed on 2 September and includes Gareth Reeves as Harry Potter, Paula Arundell as Hermione Granger, Gyton Grantley as Ron Weasley, Lucy Goleby as Ginny Potter, Sean Rees-Wemyss as Albus Potter, Tom Wren as Draco Malfoy and William McKenna as Scorpius Malfoy. The roles of the remaining supporting cast will remain unannounced until the show opens to \"honour its 'keep the secret' message (and) to ensure the storyline doesn't slip out\". The production will also feature seven child performers. Four boys will alternate the roles of Young Harry and three girls will portray Luna Potter.\n\n\nBoth parts of the stage play's script have been released in print and digital formats as \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II\".\n\nThe first edition, entitled \"Special Rehearsal Edition\", corresponded to the script used in the preview shows and was scheduled to be published on 31 July 2016, the date of Harry's birthday in the series and Rowling's birthday, as well. Since revisions to the script continued after the book was printed, an edited version was released on 25 July 2017, as the \"Definitive Collector's Edition\". According to CNN, this was the most preordered book of 2016.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the book sold over 2 million copies in its first two days of release. 847,885 copies were sold during the book's first week of release in the United Kingdom. By June 2017, the book had sold over 4.5 million copies in the United States.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" has received critical acclaim. Some audiences and critics have complimented the casting and performances, while many debate the quality of the piece and how it compares to entries in the main \"Harry Potter\" series.\n\nPublications awarding five star ratings included \"The Independent\", the \"London Evening Standard\", \"The Stage\" and WhatsOnStage.com. \"The Telegraph\" also gave five, although \"there are some quibbles,\" while \"The Guardian\"'s Michael Billington awarded four stars.\n\nAnthony Boyle's performance as Scorpius Malfoy garnered particular acclaim. WhatsOnStage.com wrote that \"Boyle gives a career-making performance,\" while \"The Wall Street Journal\" described him as \"the break-out performance\". \"Variety\"s critic, Matt Trueman, agreed, writing, \"it's Boyle who really stands out\", and both Trueman and Henry Hitchings, in the \"Evening Standard\", noted that his performance was sure to be a fan favourite.\n\nThe response to the play from the \"Harry Potter\" fandom was mixed. Some fans said the story seemed \"like a work of fan fiction\" and claimed that it diverged from previously established rules of the universe, criticising the script's characterisation. Some also took issue with the style and plot of the script, complaining that the Time-Turner storylines had already been used, as had Cedric Diggory's death, and that the writers were rehashing old storylines. These criticisms have led to some of the fandom rejecting the play as separate from the \"Potter\" canon. Some potential plot holes in the story have been highlighted, such as the likelihood of Lord Voldemort's infertility, the speed at which the Polyjuice Potion is created, the unexplained non-operation of the Fidelius Charm, and Cedric Diggory's dramatic turn to becoming a Death Eater.\n\nHowever, some fans responded positively to the play and its characters, with Scorpius Malfoy being particularly popular. Some fans commented that the dialogue between the familiar characters was \"spot on\", celebrating it as a faithful continuation of the books. Others have noted that the play sheds light on some of the relationships between the characters, such as Harry and Dumbledore's. The response had been particularly positive among fans who watched the play on stage.\n\nThe play never explicitly states who the \"Cursed Child\" is. There are several possible answers, including Delphi, who is cursed by her parentage; Harry himself, whose difficult childhood is the subject of several flashbacks in the play and who must accept and relive the death of his parents to conquer Lord Voldemort; Albus, who at one stage Harry says he wished \"was not his son\" and can do no right in this father's eyes being \"cursed\" by the Potter reputation; Scorpius, who is rumoured to be Lord Voldemort's child and whose mother dies during the play; and Cedric Diggory, whose tragic death is a focus of the play, and whose death is also finally accepted as a necessary condition for future peace.\n\n"}

{"id": "62000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62000", "title": "Legal drama", "text": "Legal drama\n\nA legal drama, or a courtroom drama, is a genre of film and television that generally focuses on narratives regarding legal practice and the justice system. The American Film Institute (AFI) defines \"courtroom drama\" as a genre of film in which a system of justice plays a critical role in the film's narrative. Legal dramas have also followed the lives of the fictional attorneys, defendants, plaintiffs, or other persons related to the practice of law present in television show or film. Legal drama is distinct from police crime drama or detective fiction, which typically focus on police officers or detectives investigating and solving crimes. The focal point of legal dramas, more often, are events occurring within a courtroom, but may include any phases of legal procedure, such as jury deliberations or work done at law firms. Some legal dramas fictionalize real cases that have been litigated, such as the play-turned-movie, \"Inherit the Wind\", which fictionalized the Scopes Monkey Trial. As a genre, the term \"legal drama\" is typically applied to television shows and films, whereas legal thrillers typically refer to novels and plays.\n\nLegal dramas typical portray moral dilemmas that occur with the practice of the law or participating in the justice system, many of which mirrors dilemmas in real life. The American Bar Association Journal has interpreted the public's enjoyment of legal dramas occur because \"stories about the legal system are laced with human vulnerability.\" Indeed, even though \"there are no car chases [and]... [g]uns are never drawn\", legal dramas retain strong followings because of their presentation of moral intrigue in a setting that actually reflects what occurs in the world.\n\nLegal dramas may present stories of the miscarriages of justice, such as persons wrongly convicted of a crime they did not commit. At times, stories may involve the moral implications of police misconduct, such as placing or tampering with evidence, such as in the 1993 film, \"In the Name of the Father\". More often, legal dramas focus on the attorneys' point of view when faced with these difficulties. For instance, in \"The Practice\", a television legal drama series revolving around a firm of criminal defense attorneys, a common theme presented is the difficulty of defending clients known or believed to be guilty.\n\nFinally, many legal dramas present themes that reflect politicized issues. In the 1960 film, \"Inherit the Wind\", the politicized issue portrayed was the legality of a Tennessee statute that made it unlawful to teach the theory of evolution in a public school. As laws and public policy opinions change, so do the themes presented in legal dramas. The 1992 film, \"A Few Good Men\", explored the psychology of superior orders, e.g. excusing criminal actions because they were only committed from 'following orders'. The film \"Philadelphia\" (1993) addressed homophobia, and the discrimination and public fear of HIV/AIDs carriers. In 1996, \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" portrays the early years of Hustler Magazine and issues of obscenity and freedom of speech. \"You Don't Know Jack\" (2010) is a fictional biographic film about Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the legal actions he faced as a result of providing euthanasia services to terminal patients. Racial injustice remains a common theme from as far back as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" in 1962 to the 2017 film \"Marshall.\"\n\nLegal dramas in American film has an extensive history stemming from as early as the 1908 film, \"Falsely Accused!\" The 1950s and 1960s presented a number of legal drama films including, \"12 Angry Men\" (1957), \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957), \"I Want to Live!\" (1958), \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959), \"The Young Philadelphians\" (1959), \"Compulsion\" (1959), \"Inherit the Wind\" (1960), \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961),and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1962). Arguably, \"12 Angry Men\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" stand as the cornerstones of early legal dramas, garnering extensive acclaim, recognition, and awards. Despite underwhelming box office performance, \"12 Angry Men\" was nominated in three different categories at the 30th Academy Awards and appears on half of the AFI 100 Years... series lists of films, which celebrate the greatest films in American cinema. Likewise, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" received even more acclaim, garnering three academy awards out of eight total nominations at the 35th Academy Awards, appears on seven of the AFI's ten lists celebrating the greatest films, including ranking as the best courtroom drama, and selected for preservation United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Other countries also premiered legal dramas or courtrooms dramas in the early 1900s, such as the French silent film, \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928).\n\nOther legal drama films have not focused on even the practice of law, such as \"Paper Chase\", a film presenting the difficulty and anxiety of entering law school.\n\nEarly American television programs considered legal dramas include \"Perry Mason\", \"The Defenders\", \"JUDD for the Defense\", \"Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law\", \"Petrocelli\", and \"Matlock\". More recent examples of serious legal dramas are \"The Practice\" and \"Law & Order.\"\n\nThe two most notable examples of legal drama are \"Ally McBeal\" and \"Boston Legal,\" both of which David E. Kelley created and produced, with Suits as the most popular legal drama currently.\n\nLegal dramas are becoming more in demand from the public, more popular for many people to watch, and beginning to feature stronger female leads.\n\nIt is widely believed by most practicing lawyers that legal dramas result in the general public having misconceptions about the legal process. Many of these misconceptions result from the desire to create an interesting story. For example, because conflict between parties make for an interesting story, legal dramas emphasize the trial and ignore the fact that the vast majority of civil and criminal cases in the United States are settled out of court. Trials in legal dramas are often shown to be more emphatic by disregarding actual rules in trials that prevent prejudicing defendants from juries.\n\nBesides the actual practice of law, legal dramas may also misrepresent the character of lawyers in general. Some fictional lawyers may be portrayed as ambulance chasers, breaching rules of professional conduct by seeking out potential personal injury plaintiffs. Lawyers may also be portrayed as amoral, seeking only to win or financial gain, rather than do what is \"morally\" right. These negative portrayals reflect a long-standing cultural perception of lawyers since time immemorial. Another misrepresented character trait of attorneys portrayed by legal dramas is their sexual appetite. Characters such as Bobby Donnell and Ally McBeal portray lawyers who seemingly cannot keep from having sex with clients, colleagues, opposing counsel, or judges. Although attorneys appear a top preferred occupation for potential dating partners according to Bumble and Tinder, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct preclude lawyers from many of the relations portrayed in television.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46284", "title": "Milton Berle", "text": "Milton Berle\n\nMilton Berle (born Mendel Berlinger; July 12, 1908 – March 27, 2002) was an American comedian and actor. Berle's career as an entertainer spanned over 80 years, first in silent films and on stage as a child actor, then in radio, movies and television. As the host of NBC's \"Texaco Star Theater\" (1948–55), he was the first major American television star and was known to millions of viewers as \"Uncle Miltie\" and \"Mr. Television\" during TV's golden age.\n\nMilton Berle was born into a Jewish family in a five-story walkup at 68 W. 118th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. His given name was Mendel Berlinger. He chose Milton Berle as his professional name when he was 16. His father, Moses Berlinger (1873–1938), was a paint and varnish salesman. His mother, Sarah (Sadie) Glantz Berlinger (1877–1954), changed her name to Sandra Berle when Milton became famous. He had three older brothers (from oldest to youngest): Phil, Frank and Jack Berle. For many years the latter two worked as Berle's TV production staff members, while Phil Berle was a program executive at NBC.\n\nBerle entered show business at the age of five when he won an amateur talent contest. He appeared as a child actor in silent films, beginning with \"The Perils of Pauline\", filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The director told Berle that he would portray a little boy who would be thrown from a moving train. In \"Milton Berle: An Autobiography\", he explained, \"I was scared shitless, even when he went on to tell me that Pauline would save my life. Which is exactly what happened, except that at the crucial moment they threw a bundle of rags instead of me from the train. I bet there are a lot of comedians around today who are sorry about that.\"\n\nBy Berle's account, he continued to play child roles in other films: \"Bunny's Little Brother\", \"Tess of the Storm Country\", \"Birthright\", \"Love's Penalty\", \"Divorce Coupons\" and \"Ruth of the Range\". Berle recalled, \"There were even trips out to Hollywood—the studios paid—where I got parts in \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\", with Mary Pickford; \"The Mark of Zorro\", with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and \"Tillie's Punctured Romance\", with Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand and Marie Dressler.\" In 1916, Berle enrolled in the Professional Children's School.\n\nAround 1920, at age 12, Berle made his stage debut in a revival of the musical comedy \"Florodora\" in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which later moved to Broadway. By the time he was 16, he was working as a Master of Ceremonies in Vaudeville. By the early 1930s he was a successful stand-up comedian, patterning himself after one of Vaudeville's top comics, Ted Healy.\n\nIn 1933, he was hired by producer Jack White to star in the theatrical featurette \"Poppin' the Cork\", a topical musical comedy concerning the repealing of Prohibition. Berle also co-wrote the score for this film, which was released by Educational Pictures. Berle continued to dabble in songwriting. With Ben Oakland and Milton Drake, Berle wrote the title song for the RKO Radio Pictures release \"Li'l Abner\" (1940), an adaptation of Al Capp's comic strip, featuring Buster Keaton as Lonesome Polecat. Berle wrote a Spike Jones B-side, \"Leave the Dishes in the Sink, Ma.\"\n\nFrom 1934–36, Berle appeared regularly on \"The Rudy Vallee Hour\", and he attracted publicity as a regular on \"The Gillette Original Community Sing\", a Sunday night comedy-variety program broadcast on CBS from September 6, 1936 to August 29, 1937. In 1939, he was the host of \"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\" with panelists spontaneously finishing jokes sent in by listeners.\nIn the late 1940s, he canceled well-paying nightclub appearances to expand his radio career. \"Three Ring Time\", a comedy-variety show sponsored by Ballantine Ale, was followed by a 1943 program sponsored by Campbell's Soups. The audience participation show \"Let Yourself Go\" (1944–1945) could best be described as \"slapstick radio\" with studio audience members acting out long suppressed urges—often directed at host Berle. \"Kiss and Make Up\", on CBS in 1946, featured the problems of contestants decided by a jury from the studio audience with Berle as the judge. Berle also made guest appearances on many comedy-variety radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nScripted by Hal Block and Martin Ragaway, \"The Milton Berle Show\" brought Berle together with Arnold Stang, later a familiar face as Berle's TV sidekick. Others in the cast were Pert Kelton, Mary Schipp, Jack Albertson, Arthur Q. Bryan, Ed Begley, Brazilian singer Dick Farney, and announcer Frank Gallop. Sponsored by Philip Morris, it aired on NBC from March 11, 1947 until April 13, 1948.\n\nBerle later described this series as \"the best radio show I ever did ... a hell of a funny variety show\". It served as a springboard for Berle's emergence as television's first major star.\n\nBerle first appeared on television in 1929 in an experimental broadcast in Chicago which he hosted in front of 129 people.\n\nBerle would revive the structure and routines of his vaudeville act for his debut on commercial TV, hosting The Texaco Star Theatre on June 8, 1948 over the NBC Television Network.<ref>Sackett, Susan (1993) p.1954 quotation: \n"}

The awards sparked controversy amongst comic book fans with the announcement of Jim Balent's company Broadsword Comics receiving three of the twenty five awards, for their publication \"Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose\". Websites such as \"Chris's Invincible Super-Blog\" published sarcastic praise concerning the outcome of the awards while other websites such as \"Panels on Pages\" spoke highly of the publication which is quoted as saying, \"...making it easy to see how it walked away with three of the twenty-five awards at Project Fanboy this past March...\".\n\nIn the 55th issue of \"Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose\", Broadsword colorist, Holly Golightly appeared adorned in only the three Project Fanboy Awards the company received, again sparking the attention of bloggers and internet users. \"ComicBitsOnline\" spoke with Holly GoLightly after the awards ceremony and showcased a photo of the Broadsword team accepting the Project Fanboy Awards in the interview the site published.\n\nIn 2010 the site started its official comic book podcast, the Fanboy Buzz. In 2011 the podcast partnered with the website Comic Collector Live, making the Fanboy Buzz the official podcast of both Project Fanboy and Comic Collector Live.\n\nIn February 2012 Project Fanboy and the Fanboy Buzz sites merged and continued all operations under the Fanboy Buzz banner.\n\nOn November 10, 2012 DC Comics artist Ethan Van Sciver announced his intentions of joining the Fanboy Buzz podcast as a host on the show via his Facebook Page and Twitter pages. Van Sciver joined veteran Fanboy Buzz hosts Stephen Jondrew, Scott Williams, Jean Sebastian and Steve Boyd as a full-time host of the Fanboy Buzz podcast starting with episode 142 of the show.\n\nComic book editor, writer, and Project Fanboy columnist, Steven D. Forbes is commonly known for his ongoing columns at the site, where he offers advice for aspiring writers as well as offering his professional editorial thoughts on samples of work sent to him by his readers. An established columnist on the site since August 2008, Forbes was interviewed on \"Jazma Online\" and has been referenced on sites such as Newsarama, by columnist Randal Jarrell, and Tyler James. Forbes has also been spoken highly of on Today.com by Stacey David, author of the Bluewater Publishing mini-series GearZ.\n\nIn May 2009, the site began being used by the industry as a resource when interviews the site conducted with \"The Original Nutty Funsters\" author, Stephanie O'Donnell and Chumble Spuzz author, Ethan Nicolle were cited by the comic book news website Broken Frontier, as a primer to \"inter-reviews\" they conducted with the same authors.\n\nThe site has also appeared as a reference on the Internet Movie Database for an interview they conducted with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator, Peter Laird.\n\nArticles about the Project Fanboy website have appeared on Indy Comics Today as well as the e-newsletter for the Diamond Comic Distributors owned, Diamond International Galleries. Widely known for its reviews of Indy titles, excerpts of the site's reviews have been quoted on the back of numerous trade paper back comics and appeared on comic book news sites such as Comic Book Resources, Newsarama, and Comics Bulletin. The comic book awards the site is host to are listed as one of the main events for the MegaCon Convention in an article on the Comic Book Conventions website and is currently in its second year.\n\nThe site is host to the annual event, the Project Fanboy Awards (PFA), which is a fan voted competition similar to the Eagle Awards, where fans decide their favorite writers and artists among several other categories. Geoff Johns' inclusion in a list of the \"Top 20 Comic Book Writers of All Time\" in an article on Mania.com, was influenced at least in part by the 2008 award he won from the site as \"Best Writer\".\nThe PFA began as a monthly honor for deserving fan sites. The Green Lantern Corps fan site was the first winner when it received the award for February, 2008. In May 2008 however, the Project Fanboy Award was restructured and re slated as an annual event and dubbed the Project Fanboy Awards\"(plural)\". After the restructuring of the awards it now consisted of twenty-five different categories in which fans are encouraged to nominate and vote on via the Project Fanboy website.\n\nIn its first year, nominations in all categories were accepted until November 1, at which point voting began which lasted through the end of December. The same voting and nomination schedule as used for the 2008 awards also applies to following years.\n\nWinners of the 2008 awards were announced Sunday, March 1, 2009 at the MegaCon comic book convention in Orlando, Florida. Winners were given commemorative award plaques descriptive in the category for which they were won. Writers from the comic book website Newsarama attended and covered the awards ceremony. Jim and Holly Balent of Broadsword Comics were also present for the ceremony and executive editor of DC Comics, Dan DiDio accepted the award plaque for Geoff Johns for Best Writer.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the 2008 award winners; in March, 2009 the awards categories were amended, removing the three \"Best Comic Book to Movie Adaptation\" categories.\n"}
{"id": "33916642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33916642", "title": "Queer pornography", "text": "Queer pornography\n\nQueer pornography depicts performers with various gender identities and sexual orientations interacting and exploring genres of desire and pleasure in unique ways. These conveyed interactions distinctively seek to challenge the conventional modes of portraying and experiencing sexually explicit content. Scholar Ingrid Ryberg additionally includes two main objectives of queer pornography in her definition as \"interrogating and troubling gender and sexual categories and aiming at sexual arousal.\"\n\nQueer porn works to have authentic representations with respect to the sexual orientations, gender identities and desires of the performers in it. It differs from heterosexual pornography, gay pornography, or lesbian pornography, because queer porn will often be a partnering of performers outside traditional pornographic categories. Gay porn falls into a similar situation as heterosexual porn by putting an emphasis on androcentric imagery of pleasure, as scholar Richard Dyer argues, and often glorifies the homonormative, masculine body-type and behavior. To appear as inclusive, gay porn will exotify differences. Performers' bodies in queer pornography are key to providing a difference between it and other categories of pornography. For example, a DVD may have one scene which shows a transgender lesbian with a cisgender femme-identified queer woman, while the next scene may showcase two transgender queer-identified men.\n\nThe genre of queer pornography as defined above is relatively recent and has been popularized and distributed by adult film companies such as Pink and White Productions, Trouble Films, Real Queer Productions among others. While porn is not limited to adult cinema and can exist in the context of a variety of media such as queer written pornography, the currently produced queer porn is mostly in the form of video.\n\nSome prominent queer producers include Shine Louise Houston, Chelsea Poe, and April Flores who attempt to challenge the filming methods within the porn industry. Typically within the Porn Industry, the producer and director have the majority of control over how each scene will be performed, who is showcased in each set, and creating a differential of performers’ salaries based on their popularity. Queer pornography counters these practices by actively engaging performers in the creations of scenes allowing them to form more organically as a collaboration with a more horizontal access of control rather than a hierarchically vertical system.\n\nQueer porn similarly celebrates ejaculation but with some signification differences to conventional porn. Unlike in the mainstream industry, the performer does not have a financial bonus for providing such a \"money shot.\" Directors only encourage performers to perform an orgasm if/when the actors feel like it. Since the money shot in conventional porn relies of visibility for the camera, it necessarily centers on showing external ejaculation of the penis as the ultimate climax. This reflects attention back to the male centered gaze and a representative instance of phallic power and pleasure. Queer porn attempts to broaden such a delineation of phallic centered climax and the pornographic production.\n\nQueer Pornography has been attracting academic attention since the 2000s. A challenge within queer pornography is that some labeled queer porn may depict scenarios that could be part of any heterosexual mainstream pornographic film. This follows academic Niels van Doorn’s concept of the “pornoscript,” eroticizing heterosexual difference and focusing on the male subject position. For example, a scene from Real Queer Productions’s \"Fluid\" depicts a threesome with elements of submissions and dominance, rough vaginal and anal penetration, and external male ejaculation. The film’s adherence to the pornographic conventions is predictable and serialized. However, further inspection into queer porn that appears like heteronormative pornography reveals particular parody of serial strategy to expose gender construction within most conventional pornography. This process creates a queer version of the model of \"subversive repetition\" theorized by academic Judith Butler. Drawing particular attention to such a facet through imitation permits its productive act of deconstruction. Thus, queer pornography can disassemble the pornographic norm by mimicking it.\n\nAdditionally, queer pornography clearly reveals the imitative process of gender identification when introducing the figure of the transgender man. Compared to trans woman(male-to-female) individuals depicted across other types of pornography, female-to-male trans men appear significantly in feminist and queer pornography.\n\nFilms of queer pornography make \"deviant\" sexualities more visible by simultaneously starting a process of their normalization. So, in order to avoid creating a new kind of norm, queer pornography constantly works along the edge of the gender system. For example, when strap-on dildos made their appearance in queer pornography leaving viewers guessing whether they were faced with a \"real\" penis or a dildo, they soon became a common sight. While these strap-on dildos originally offered new ways of thinking about gender and sexuality, their ubiquitous use risked losing their subversive power.\n\nAs scholar Sarah Schaschek writes, “If heterosexual pornography accentuates clearly defined identity categories such as class, age, ethnicity, sexuality, or gender, queer films tend to reveal the high degree of stylization behind these identities”.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a Queen Anne style mansion that was built in 1889 and has now been gutted by the arson fire. It served as the private residence of ambassador and congressman Richmond Pearson. Its name derives from a combination of its builder, Richmond Pearson, and the designer, James G. Hill. At the time of its construction, the mansion was one of the most elegant structures in Asheville, with running water, ten fireplaces, and a pulley-operated baggage elevator. It served as a center for social and political activity for many years during Pearson's life. The Estate is located on French Broad River, surrounded by rolling grounds with gardens.\n\nIn 1984, the Pearson heirs sold the Richmond Hill estate. The Preservation Society saved the mansion from demolition and had it moved 600 feet. The mansion underwent a $3 million restoration before being opened as part of an Inn in 1989. The second and third floors housed 12 guest rooms, while the first floor contained a restaurant called Gabrielle's, a grand Oak Hall, library, and front parlor.\n\nTwo other additions have been made since the initial reopening, both designed by architect Jim Samsel. A manicured croquet court with 8 cottages overlooking the greens were built in 1990. A new building called \"The Garden Pavilion\" was added in 1996, containing 16 guest rooms and overlooking a Victorian Parterre-style garden.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, a fire destroyed the 120-year-old historic mansion. Due to the size of the fire, an arson investigation began immediately.\n\nWithin days of the blaze, officials with the Asheville Fire Department, confirmed the discovery of what they considered to be evidence indicating that the fire had been intentionally set. Further suspicions were aroused due to an ongoing legal battle which had led the Buncombe County Clerk of Court ordering that the inn be sold in a foreclosure auction on the Buncombe county court house steps. This foreclose notice was entered into three days before the 2009 fire. The owners at the time of the fire had failed to make mortgage payments on the property since August 2008. This failure to make payments led the previous owners, who had financed the purchase, to seek foreclosure. One day before the 2008 foreclose hearing Richmond Hill Inn (Hammock LLC) managing partner William G Gray and his half sister, The Hammocks LLC/Lake Norman pavilion LLC majority partner Virginia C Love (of the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC) filed suit against the former owners and mortgage holders for alleged faulty pipes on the property.\nIn addition, the Buncombe county tax assessor was seeking over $64,000 in property taxes from 2008 \n\nThe next transcript deals with testimony in regard to William Gray losing his license to practice medicine over charges of sexual misconduct with his under age male patients see medical board documents below.\n\nThe bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of North Carolina has granted a motion for the state lawsuit in regard to the alleged faulty pipes at the Richmond Hill Inn to proceed in state court.\n\nAt present, the investigation into the fire is ongoing with a sole person of interest in the case but no arrests have been made.\n\nThe Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company has filed a pleading in bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of North Carolina denying liability for the insurance claim for the arson and for the following reasons, \nquote\n\"9. The Policy excludes recovery for loss where the loss is caused by criminal, fraudulent, dishonest, or illegal acts committed by the insured or those with an interest in the property.\nDocument Page 2 of 9.\n11. As alleged in greater detail in the Complaint, Harleysville believes, and expects to be able to prove at trial, that under these exclusions it has complete defenses to the Demand, including that (a) the fire was caused by the Debtor's arson and (b) that in applying for the Policy the Debtor made material misrepresentations.\nDocument page 3 of 9 \"\nend quote. \n\nThe Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company filed a petition in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of North Carolina to remove the civil arson case from bankruptcy court to federal district court and to request a trial by jury. This has been so ordered by the court\nThe Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company deposed (questioned) William Gilman Gray under oath on June 10 and 11 2009.The questions and answers where wide-ranging as follows, William Gray did not take a lie detector test at the request of the Ashville fire department so the identity of the one person who did is still a mystery . Under questioning William Gray testified to a letter his sister Virginia C love,The Hammocks LLC/Lake Norman pavilion LLC majority partner(of the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC) sent to a Jim Sloggart demanding money for failure to perform as a partner in The hammocks LLC William Gray was asked to speculate as to whom may have burned down the Richmond Hill Inn he stated that he could not imagine the following people would have \"done it themselves\" but may have had motive to do so, Jim Sloggart, Mrs Micheal(the note holder)and Bland Holland a former Richmond Hill Inn manager. At some point before the arson the night watchmen had been laid off The next transcript discuses Virginia c love's law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC doing the accounting and tax returns for the Richmond hill Inn.this transcript also has William Gray stating that at an employee meeting held several days after the arson the entire staff of the kitchen and dining room resigned in mass.William gray testified that he provided copy's of an audit to all owners of the Hammocks LLC except his other sister Mary Mullins.William Gray testified that he knew at the time of the purchase of the Richmond Hill Inn that it was a financial failure The fourth transcript discusses the sell of the Richmond Hill Inn. Rockey Lapomardo from Florida is a friend of Virginia C love and has tried to sell the property so far without success. The Lapomardo firm still has images of the property for sell from before the arson the sixth transcript contains testimony from William Gray as to a call from Jim Sloggart right after the arson quote, \"well, you know they are going to blame us for doing it' And I said, probably.\" The next transcript contains testimony in regard to allegations that William Gray lost his license to practice medicine do to sexual misconduct with his under age male patients. William Gray gives testimony in regard to 1977 California Medical Board allegations of sexual misconduct with male patients(the first California case) The bankruptcy court for the western district of North Carolina has granted a motion for the state lawsuit in regard to the alleged faulty pipes at the Richmond Hill Inn to proceed in state court.Further testimony was given in regard to whether William Gray told employees he was bipolar William Gray denied he made any such statement. Testimony on page 76 In a recently filed document in the Federal District Court for western North Carolina The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company makes the statement that it believes that the arson was set by The Hammocks LLC's \"Authorized agents\"\nOn January 20 in bankruptcy court for the western region of North Carolina there is a hearing scheduled to argue whether to convert the Richmond Hill Inn from a Chapter 11 to a chapter 7 liquidation, to decide whether to accept \"the plan\" submitted by the debtor, to appoint the US trustee for the estate and to examine the Hammocks LLC financial discloser statements.The US trustee an employee of the court has objected to the financial discloser statement, \"the plan\" and has asked the judge to convert the case to a liquidation bankruptcy. The US trustees motion to convert the case to a chapter 7 and/or appoint a chapter 11 trustee was denied in a hearing 20 January 2010 Thus The Hammocks LLC doing business as the Richmond Hill Inn shall remain as debtor in possession in till such time as there is a discharge from bankruptcy court.\n\nIt appears that the managing partners plan to shut down the Richmond Hill Inn soon under a chapter 11 \"liquidation plan\" and sell the real estate to satisfy the mortgage owed \nThe bankruptcy court for the western district of North Carolina has objected to this plan as it is not transparent. It does not disclose partner compensation. It does not disclose timing of this \"liquidation\"\nIt is noted it does not appear that employees or future guests have been notified of this plan.The Richmond hill Inn has closed for the winter but appears to be still taking reservations for April 2010.It is not known if Richmond hill inn is collecting deposits on wedding reservations.As of late February 2010 the Richmond Hill Inn website is reporting that it will not reopen in April 2010, due to arson by former employees.\n\nLocal paper Asheville Citizen-Times ran an article on Richmond Hill Inn managing partner William G Gray on his past criminal arrest record for allegedly molesting boys in several states over the last three decades and surrendering his license to practice medicine in lieu of a hearing or after a hearing in many states. The article generated intense controversy in the community as to its content.\nThere appear to be federal government documents that support the controversy in regard to William G Gray losing his DEA license to proscribe controlled substances for \"his prescribing or dispensing various controlled substances to several individuals, two of whom were minors, without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of professional practice\"\n\nand there appear to be state of California, North Carolina and state of Virginia documents in regard to alleged criminal behavior in regard to minors And a Revocation of license to practice for a \"mental abnormality\" in regard to behavior towards his male minor patients \nIt is a public policy question to note that William Gilmans Gray's 1977 surrender of his California license to practice medicine still does not appear on the California's medical board website.\n\nThe ownership management team at the Richmond Hill Inn did release a statement prepared by the public relations firm of Dan Kellerby Media of Nashville, TN. It tells of the hardships in the hotel industry in the last years of the economic crises and alleged forced cutbacks on staff and the ownership structure's family and emotional attachment to the community.\nThis is an example of a case study of multi-media tourism marketing before the fire \n\nThe Richmond Hill Inn re-opened after the 2009 fire and continued to operate under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , even though the mansion was destroyed and Gabrielle's Restaurant was destroyed due to the arson. In August 2011, Oshun Mountain Sanctuary (OM Sanctuary) purchased the Richmond Hill Inn to transform the property into a holistic education retreat center.\nIt appears that this non profit has a website here http://www.omsanctuary.org/\nthe non profit's mission https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n74W8aYVxY0\n\n"}

It is based on the \"Rising Star\" franchise created by Keshet Broadcasting. The show is a continuation of the former program \"Kokhav Nolad\" (meaning \"A Star is Born\") which featured aspiring singers competing for a winning title. The program's format combines the internet, smartphones and television and is filmed live.\n\nThe shows inaugurative season in 2013 was won by Evyatar Korkus. Since season 2, the winner is given the opportunity to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest. 2014–2015 winner Nadav Guedj represented Israel in 2015 with \"Golden Boy\" 2015–2016 winner Hovi Star represented Israel in 2016 with \"Made of Stars\", 2016–2017 winner Imri Ziv represented Israel in 2017 with \"I Feel Alive\", and 2017–2018 winner Netta Barzilai who went on to win the 2018 contest with \"Toy\".\n\nAs the season begins, each contestant is asked to perform a well-known song in front of judges. After the song, a vote is taken among judges whether to transfer the applicant to the test stage facing the audience at home. If the judges are not sure about how to vote, the contestant is required to perform another song, and then a decision is made.\n\nContestants who do move forward must then sing in front of an audience. Viewers then connect with an app at makoTV and decide in real time whether a contestant passes or does not pass.\n\nJudges also influence the test stage - all judges may support the promotion of the contestant and thereby add 7% percent. Once the contestant reaches 70% of votes they \"pass\" and the screen opens and the contestant goes to the next level. 14 singers then move on to a section where the judges and the audience at home vote. At the final stage, four singers are left and one will be elected \"The Next Star\".\n\nThis season host is Assi Azar and the co-host is Esti Ginzburg.

She went on to win the contest in Lisbon with the song \"Toy\" earning 529 points.\n\nAfter the success of the Israeli series in 2013, many television stations throughout the world bought the rights and started broadcasting similar series.\n\nThe American television network ABC began airing its first series of \"Rising Star\" in June 2014 from Los Angeles. The US edition was also carried in Canada, with advertising simultaneous substitution and voting access on CTV. The show was canceled after its full 10-episode season due to low ratings in its target demographic, and extremely low ratings on the German and French versions.\n\nAnother major broadcaster RTL Television launched a German language version in Germany.

{"id": "692709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=692709", "title": "Rob Pilatus", "text": "Rob Pilatus\n\nRob(ert) Pilatus (8 June 1965 – 2 April 1998) was an American-born German model, dancer, and singer. Pilatus was half of the pop music duo Milli Vanilli, the other one being Frenchman Fabrice Morvan.\n\nRob Pilatus was born in New York, the son of an American soldier and a German mother. He was adopted as a baby by a Munich family. Pilatus worked as a model and breakdancer, also appearing as a backing singer with the group Wind at the 1987 Eurovision Song Contest in Brussels, finishing in second place, before joining Fab Morvan in 1988 to form the pop group Milli Vanilli.\n\nBoth Pilatus and Morvan were noticed by German music producer Frank Farian, who signed them to be part of a musical act. Shortly after a trip to Turkey, where the duo reputedly took its name from a local advertising slogan, Milli Vanilli was born. Pilatus and Morvan served as the public faces for singers Charles Shaw and Brad Howell, who Farian thought were vocally talented, but lacked a marketable image.\n\nThe first Milli Vanilli platinum album was \"Girl You Know It's True\", which became a worldwide hit. The album produced five hit singles including three number 1 hits: \"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You\", \"Baby Don't Forget My Number\" and \"Blame It On The Rain\". Milli Vanilli won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 21 February 1990, for \"Girl You Know It's True\".\n\nDespite the enormous success, the duo were a frequent target of rumours and allegations of onstage lip-synching and not having sung on the album. Charles Shaw, one of the actual vocalists, told a reporter the truth, but retracted his statement after Farian paid him $150,000.\n\nWhen Pilatus and Morvan pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian admitted to reporters on 15 November 1990 that they had not performed on the recordings. Milli Vanilli's Grammy Award was withdrawn four days later, and Arista Records dropped them from its roster and deleted their album and songs from their catalog, making \"Girl You Know It's True\" the largest-selling album to ever be taken out of print. A court ruling in the United States allowed anyone who had bought the album to receive a refund.\n\nFarian later attempted an unsuccessful comeback for the group without Pilatus and Morvan. Months after the scandal, Pilatus and Morvan appeared in a commercial for Carefree sugarless chewing gum. In it the duo lip-synched to an opera recording. An announcer asked, \"How long does the taste of Carefree Sugarless Gum last?\" The record began to skip and the announcer added, \"Until these guys sing for themselves.\"\n\nIn 1992, Pilatus and Morvan signed with a new label, Taj, and released \"Rob & Fab\", an album featuring their own voices, but the album only sold around 2,000 copies. The label went bankrupt shortly thereafter.\n\nIn the years following the collapse of Milli Vanilli, Pilatus struggled with substance abuse and even suicide attempts. After their unsuccessful comeback, Morvan and Pilatus stopped speaking to each other. In 1996, Pilatus served three months in prison for assault, vandalism and attempted robbery. Farian paid for Pilatus to spend six months in drug rehabilitation, before returning to Germany from the United States.\n\nOn 3 April 1998, on the eve of a promotional tour for a new completed Milli Vanilli album entitled \"Back and in Attack\" featuring Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan on lead vocals, Pilatus was found dead at the age of 32 from a suspected alcohol and prescription pill overdose in \"Kent's Cube\" at Friedrichsdorf, near Frankfurt. His death was ruled accidental, and their final album has never been released.\n\nHe was survived by his son and his sister.\n\nPilatus is buried in the Waldfriedhof in Munich.\n\n\n\n"}

The film was a Chinese-French collaboration produced by Dream Factory, Laurel Films, Fantasy Pictures and Sylvain Bursztejn's Rosem Films. It was made in association with France's Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, Ministère des Affaires Étrangères and Centre National de la Cinématographie (CNC). The film is the first from mainland China to feature the full-frontal adult nudity of both its male and female leads, though earlier films such as \"Xiao Wu\" (1998),\n\"Lan Yu\" (2001), \"Green Hat\" (2003), and \"Star Appeal\" (2004), have featured full-frontal adult male nudity.\n\nThe film deals with a young student played by Hao Lei who leaves her small hometown to study at the fictional \"Beiqing University\" (a homage to Peking University). There she meets a fellow student and begins an intense romantic relationship in the backdrop of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The film also follows the eventual disillusionment of these young idealists after the crackdown, as the years progress through the 1990s and into the 2000s (decade). The film is named after the Summer Palace located in Beijing.\n\n\"Summer Palace\"'s sex scenes and political undertones made the film tinder for controversy in China, leading both the director, Lou Ye, and his producers into conflict with China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT). After screening \"Summer Palace\" in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival without government approval, the film was placed under a de facto ban in Mainland China, and its filmmakers officially censored.\n\nSpanning several cities and over a decade, \"Summer Palace\" tells the story of Yu Hong (played by Hao Lei), a young woman from the border-city of Tumen, who is accepted to the fictional Beiqing University, a name that evokes either Peking University (\"Beida\") or Tsinghua University (\"Qinghua\"). While in school, Yu Hong meets Li Ti, her best friend (played by Hu Lingling), and Zhou Wei, her college boyfriend and the love of her life (played by Guo Xiaodong). The film is divided into two parts. The first begins in the late 1980s (subtitles inform the audience of the place and year at various points in the film), as Yu Hong enters the university. Lonely and isolated despite the cramped living conditions, Yu Hong eventually befriends another student, Li Ti, who introduces her to her boyfriend Ruo Gu (played by Zhang Xianmin), and Ruo Gu's friend Zhou Wei. Yu Hong and Zhou Wei embark upon a passionate but volatile love affair just as political forces are moving towards Tiananmen Square.\n\nTwo events then bring the first half of the film to a close: First, Zhou Wei, incensed at the jealousy and emotional instability of his girlfriend, begins to have an affair with Li Ti; and second, the crackdown occurs on the students on Tiananmen Square and on the campus of Beida. During all of this, Yu Hong's old boyfriend Xiao Jun (played by Cui Jin) from Tumen arrives and the two of them leave, Yu Hong deciding that she will drop out from the university.\n\nThe film then fast forwards several years, as Lou Ye intersperses the travels of his three main characters with news footage of the end of the Cold War, and the 1997 Hong Kong handover. Yu Hong has left Tumen again, first for Shenzhen, and then for the central China city of Wuhan, while Li Ti and Ruo Gu have moved to Berlin. Yu Hong is unable to forget Zhou Wei, and has empty affairs with a married man and a kind but quiet mailroom worker. The film follows her disaffection with society and her use of sex as a substitute for contentment. Eventually discovering that she is pregnant, Yu Hong gets an abortion and moves to Chongqing where she marries.\n\nLi Ti, Ruo Gu, and Zhou Wei, meanwhile, live a quiet life as expatriates in Berlin. While Li Ti and Zhou Wei still occasionally make love, the former quietly realizes that the latter does not love her. Though the three friends appear happy, when Zhou Wei plans to return home to China and settle in the city of Chongqing, Li Ti suddenly commits suicide. There he connects with former classmates who in turn point him to Yu Hong's email address.\n\nAfter more than ten years, Zhou Wei and Yu Hong at last reunite in the resort city of Beidaihe. While they embrace, they ask each other, \"Now what?\" When Yu Hong leaves, ostensibly to buy drinks, Zhou Wei understands that they can never be together and leaves as well.\n\n\nLou Ye picked Hao Lei from over 400 candidates because she was the only one who turned him down, fearing the sex scenes would hurt her love relationship. As Lou said later, \"That was something Yu Hong would say, so I had to have her play (Yu).\" The entire crew waited patiently for Hao to accept, for so long that the original choice for Zhou Wei, Liu Ye, had to abandon the project. Hao was very touched and agreed, but her relationship with actor Deng Chao did end as a result. Lou's 2012 film \"Mystery\" reunited him with Hao.\n\nIranian composer Peyman Yazdanian did the film score.\n\nThe film also features a number of songs from all around the world, including a song by Hao Lei (which she recorded in 2003 for \"Rhinoceros in Love\")：\n\n\"Summer Palace\" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006, and was released theatrically in France a year later on April 18, 2007 by Océan Films, under the title Une Jeunesse Chinoise (in English, \"A Chinese Youth\"). The film received its American debut in the Mill Valley Film Festival on October 10, 2006, and a limited theatrical release beginning on January 18, 2008 through distributor Palm Pictures.\n\n\"Summer Palace\" was released on Region 2 DVD in France on January 28, 2008. The single disc edition includes the film in its original Mandarin with French subtitles, along with special features such as a making-of documentary, a featurette on censorship, Lou Ye's film notes, and cast and crew biographies.\n\nA Region 1 DVD was released in the United States on March 11, 2008 by Palm Pictures.\n\n\"Summer Palace\" was screened at several international film festivals, most notably Cannes, where it was the only Asian film in competition. However, the Palme d'Or eventually went to the Irish film, \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\", directed by Ken Loach. Besides Cannes, \"Summer Palace\" was also screened at a handful of top-tier festivals including Toronto and Mill Valley.\n\nCritics were generally positive in reviews, citing the film's ambition and scope with the most common complaint being the film's excessive length at 140 minutes. Derek Elley of \"Variety\" claimed the film was \"half an hour too long.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\", meanwhile, also mentioned the \"thirty minutes too long\" complaint but stated that the film was nevertheless \"a raw and unsettling new work.\" \"The Guardian\" also found the film \"over-long and meandering,\" but also \"stylish [and] atmospheric.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave a particularly glowing review for the film with film critic A. O. Scott writing that \"...[despite] its 2-hour-20-minute length, 'Summer Palace' moves with the swiftness and syncopation of a pop song. Like Jean-Luc Godard in the 1960s, Mr. Lou favors breathless tracking shots and snappy jump cuts, and like Mr. Godard’s, his camera is magnetized by female beauty.\"\n\nThe film was released unrated in the United States. Several American film critics have described \"Summer Palace\" as one of the most sexually-explicit films in years; indeed David Denby of \"The New Yorker\" noted that he never seen so much lovemaking in an \"aboveground\" film, however, he also noted that these scenes are not pornographic, that is, never separated from emotion.\n\nThe film was in competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival but failed to garner any awards. Though \"Summer Palace\" was the only Asian film in competition for the Palme d'Or, Lou and his producers had not received approval from Chinese censors, thus instigating an official censure by the Chinese State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT). Ultimately, both Lou and his producer, Nai An, were forbidden by the Chinese Government to make any new films for five years.\n\nBesides the filmmakers, \"Summer Palace\" itself was de facto banned when SARFT refused to grant a certificate to distribute in the Mainland because the film was not up to the official standards for picture and sound quality.\n\n\n"}

The channels provides tickers and commentary with up-to-the-minute odds, field and dividend information. Between races, they feature on-track interviews, in-studio analysis, live footage of horses warming up for races, replays of previous races, and recaps of betting odds.\n\nThe live broadcasting of horse racing in the New Zealand dates back to the launch of a racing radio network in 1978. The station, originally known as Radio Pacific and later as bSport and LiveSport, is now TAB Trackside Radio. A racing television station launched in 1992, initially known as Action TV and later as Trackside, is now TAB Trackside 1. A second racing television station launched in 2007, known initially as TAB TV, is now TAB Trackside 2.\n\nRacing network Radio Pacific began in Auckland in 1978, and became one of the first stations to be networked across the country in the 1990s. The network combined news, news talkback, sports talkback and live racing commentaries.\n\nRadio Pacific became a listed company on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and the Totalisator Agency Board became its major shareholder. The company also owned the North Island music station group Energy Enterprises and merged with the South Island radio company Radio Otago in 1999. Between May 2000 and January 2001 it was purchased by CanWest Global Communications, becoming part of RadioWorks and later part of MediaWorks New Zealand. Part of the company was purchased in July 2004, and the entire company was sold off in June 2007.\n\nRadio Pacific's Waikato station began as Radio Waikato, New Zealand's third privately owned station. It originally broadcast in 930AM in 1971, before moving 954AM in 1978. In 1986 Radio Waikato changed to a country music format and was renamed Country Gold - Waikato 954. In 1988 it was sold to Radio Pacific and transitioned into a local talk radio format with national racing commentary. It changed its name to Radio Pacific and eventually replaced local programmes with Auckland networked programmes. A new station of the same name also operated in Hamilton between 1993 and 1994.\n\nBefore 2005 live races and betting odds had been broadcast on Radio Pacific in pre-determined, limited periods during the race day under a contract with the New Zealand Racing Board. Between 2001 and 2005, this was also complemented by a trial Radio Trackside station in the Southland market dedicated to racing coverage.\n\nIn 2005 MediaWorks launched new talkback network Radio Live and moved many of Radio Pacific's talkback personalities across to the new network. John Banks continued to host Radio Pacific's breakfast programme, and Alice Worsley and Martin Crump co-hosted a new morning talkback programme. A Trackside TV simulcast, branded as Radio Trackside, was broadcast in the afternoon.\nOn 29 October 2007 Radio Pacific became BSport and its tagline became \"BSport, the station you can bet on\". The general talkback format was replaced with a sports talkback format. MediaWorks New Zealand and Trackside shared the network's Auckland studios, with live sports talk and betting odds in the morning, and live races and betting odds in the afternoon.\n\nIn January 2010 BSport was renamed LiveSport, the sister network to Radio Live. It became TAB Trackside Radio on 13 April 2015, when it came under the full ownership of the New Zealand Racing Board.\n\nTAB Trackside began television broadcasting in 1992 as Action TV - a free-to-air UHF station that only broadcast during live racing events. In 1993, it changed its name to Trackside. From 1994, Sky Television began using broadcasting Discovery Channel to subscribers when Trackside was in closedown. The station received a dedicated channel on the new Sky Digital platform in 1999, which began broadcasting 18 hours a day from 2004 and 24 hours a day from 2007. In addition to live New Zealand racing, the channel introduced racing replay, preview and review shows, and live racing and racing shows from Australia. The channel began broadcasting on Freeview Satellite from 2 May 2007, on Freeview terrestrial on 14 April 2008, and in widescreen from 15 December 2008.\n\nIn October 2009, TAB introduced a second channel - TAB TV - to accommodate live racing from Hong Kong and Singapore. In October 2013 it changed the TVNZ metadata on the Freeview satellite service to unlock access to Trackside TV, keeping TAB TV as a pay-TV channel. On 14 April 2014, it ceased operations on Freeview, becoming only available to Sky subscribers. In August 2014, Trackside TV and TAB TV were relaunched as TAB Trackside 1 and TAB Trackside 2, extending racing coverage from all codes and enabling up to 5000 additional races to be broadcast each year that were previously not scheduled.\n\n\n\n\nTAB Trackside 1 broadcasts racing from all codes, both domestic and international, alongside specialist shows. TAB Trackside 2 broadcasts racing from all codes, alongside simulcasts of TAB Trackside Radio weekday mornings from 6am. In 2011, it live simulcast Fill the Basin, a February 2011 Christchurch earthquake fundraiser cricket match, with Canterbury Television. The channels area available on the Sky Television DHS encrypted satellite services (062 Trackside 1, 063 Trackside 2) and Vodafone InHome TV service in Wellington and Christchurch (062 Trackside 1, 063 Trackside 2).\n\n"}

He is best known for capturing, performing with, and selling a number of orcas during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nHe established and owned the Seattle Marine Aquarium on Pier 56 on the Elliott Bay waterfront in Seattle, which opened in 1962 and was originally known as the Seattle Public Aquarium (not to be confused with the contemporary Seattle Aquarium).\nIn 1965 Griffin purchased the orca Namu after it was accidentally caught in a fishing net, and then displayed it and performed with it at his aquarium. Namu was only the third orca ever captured and was the first to perform and swim with a person for audiences. Namu survived just over one year in captivity and died in his pen on July 9, 1966. Griffin also captured the original Shamu in 1965 and leased (and eventually sold) her to SeaWorld in San Diego. Altogether, Griffin and his partner Don Goldsberry captured and sold about 30 orcas in and around Puget Sound between 1965 and 1972. They charged buyers $20,000 to $25,000 per captured orca. Their largest capture took place in August 1970, when they netted most of all three pods of the Southern Resident orca population. When activists attempted to cut the nets, four animals drowned, included three calves. Griffin and Goldsberry attempted to conceal the deaths by weighting and sinking the bodies, but months later the carcasses washed up. This operation also resulted in the capture of the orca Lolita, who is currently kept in Miami and has been subject of petitions and legal actions to retire her to more natural life conditions. In May 1972, in response to rising regulation, Griffin retired from orca capture and sold his portion of the Seattle Marine Aquarium to Goldsberry, who soon after sold it to Sea World. \n\nIn 1982 Griffin published \"Namu, Quest for the Killer Whale\", a non-fiction account of his time with Namu and the transformation of public views of killer whales.\n\n"}

People who live in Switzerland and receive television services are required by law to pay a television licence fee, which is used to finance the public radio and television service SRG SSR. Licence fee-payers in all the linguistic regions of Switzerland all pay the same amount (462 CHF for 2008, counting both radio and television licences) and, in return, are entitled under the law to services of equal quality.\n\nThe history of television in Switzerland began in 1939 when the first test transmissions commenced. Regular transmissions started in 1953, at first only one hour a day for five days a week, and only in German: transmissions in French started in 1954 and in Italian only in 1958.\n\nRomansh-speaking Swiss had to wait until 1963 for the first programme in their language, a full decade after regular television transmission were initiated. To this day, there is no dedicated Romansh-language channel; instead the German and Italian channels air a few hours of Romansh programming per day. The 1960s also saw the arrival of television advertising, in 1964, and of colour television, in 1968.\n\nTélévision suisse romande broadcast their first evening programme in colour in 1968. 1968 was also the first year where more than one million Swiss households had a television.\n\nIn 1984, the Swiss teletext service, SwissTXT, was started. In 1993 a fourth SRG SSR channel was created, first named \"S Plus\" but later renamed Schweiz 4 (Switzerland 4). However, this was short-lived: during its existence the channel constantly suffered low ratings and was hence shut down in 1997. In the same year, as a result, all the SRG SSR subsidiaries started a second channel, and SRF zwei, RTS Deux and RSI La 2 came into existence.\n\nAnalogue television was phased out starting July 2006, when TSI (now RSI) began the analogue switchoff. The process continued until January 2008, when the end of analogue broadcasting in Valais and Chablais completed the digital television transition in Switzerland.\n\nIn September 2018, SRG SSR announced that it would discontinue over-the-air broadcasting in DVB-T in 2019, citing costs, rather than implement DVB-T2. The services will remain available via encrypted free-to-air satellite, which offers all SRG SSR channels in high definition.\n\nThe following is a list of television channels broadcast in Switzerland:\n\n\n\n\nThere is not a television channel broadcasting exclusively in Romansh language; instead, Radio Television Rumantscha's productions are transmitted on SRF 1, RSI La 2 and SRF info a few minutes a day. Programming includes Telesguard (a newscast), Cuntrasts and l'Istorgia da buna notg (bedtime story).\n\nLocal radio and television networks in Switzerland are entitled to 4% of the licence fee every year (about 50,000,000 CHF for 2007). The number of subsidised television broadcasters is limited to 13, one for each designated coverage area. Also, the support share cannot exceed 50% of the operating costs of each network.\n\nA vast majority of the country is covered by cable networks; the major cable television operators is upc cablecom.\n\nIn 2007, the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM) applied a must-carry regulation, requiring the local cable companies to transmit all the SRG SSR network stations and the following foreign channels: arte, 3sat, Euronews, TV5MONDE, ARD, ORF eins, France 2, Rai Uno.\n\nAll public and most commercial channels from the neighbouring countries are widely available in Switzerland through digital television services.\n\n\n"}

The book is a sequel to \"The Cat in the Hat\".\n\nOnce again, Sally and her brother are being left home alone for the day, but this time, their mother has left them with instructions to clear away a large amount of snow while she is out for the day. However, they are soon interrupted in their work by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat. Sally warns her brother not to talk to the Cat, because, he plays lots of bad tricks. Telling him not to let him come near. As they \"remember what he did the last time he was there.\"\n\nBut the Cat lets himself into their house to get out of the snow, and when the brother follows him in, he finds the Cat eating a cake in the tub with the hot and cold water on. He glares at the Cat, turns off the water, and drains the tub only to find that a long pink ring has formed around the sides of the bath tub. The Cat offers to help, but his preliminary attempts to remove the pink spot fail as he only transfers the mess to a succession of other objects: their mother's white dress, the wall, their father's pair of $10 shoes, a rug, and their father's bed. Unsure of how to remove the stain from the bed, the Cat calls on the help of Little Cat A, who lives inside his hat, who lifts his hat to reveal Little Cat B, and then Little Cat C. The three Little Cats go to work, sending the stain to the television, then a pan, and finally outside.\n\nSeeing the spot cover the snow, Little Cat C lifts his hat to reveal Little Cats D through G. The seven Little Cats wage war on the snow spots, shooting at pink snowballs with pop guns. This only spreads the spots more, so Little Cat G lifts his hat to reveal Little Cats H through V. All the cats work more, but the spot keeps spreading, until all the snow is pink, so Little Cat V takes off his hat to uncover Little Cats W, X, Y and the microscopic Little Cat Z. Z takes his hat off and unleashes a \"Voom\", which cleans up the spot, clears all the snow from the paths, and puts all of the Little Cats back into the Cat's hat. The Cat leaves, with the promise that he and the Little Cats, from A through Z, will return someday.\n\nThe book ends in a burst of flamboyant versification, with the full list of little cats arranged into a metrically perfect rhymed quatrain, designed to teach the reader the alphabet.\n\nAfter the 2003 film adaption of the original story, it was planned to make a sequel based on \"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back\". However due to negative reception, Theodore Geisel's widow, Audrey Geisel, decided to not allow any future live-action adaptions of her husband's works and the plans for the sequel were cancelled.\n\nThe book has included other stories, Fox in Socks & There's a Wocket in My Pocket.\n\n"}

It is the sequel to the 2011 film \"The Raid\" and stars Iko Uwais, Arifin Putra, Oka Antara, Tio Pakusadewo, Alex Abbad, Julie Estelle, Ryuhei Matsuda, Kenichi Endō, and Kazuki Kitamura. \n\nIn the story, special forces officer Rama is sent undercover to expose the corrupt police officials colluding with the crime families of Jakarta's criminal underworld. Like Evans' previous films \"Merantau\" and \"The Raid\", the fight scenes showcase the Indonesian fighting style of Pencak Silat.\n\nThe film was released on 28 March 2014.\n\nTwo hours after the events of the first film, Jakarta crime boss Bejo executes Rama's brother Andi who took over from Tama, a gang boss operating under Bangun. Rama meets Lt. Bunawar, head of an internal investigation unit. He sends Bowo for treatment but has Lt. Wahyu executed. Bunawar assures Rama it was to protect him from crooked cops like Wahyu, saying courts cannot fix the problem. Testifying would only endanger him and his family. He asks him to go undercover to expose Reza's and other police officials' dealings with the Bangun and Goto crime syndicates. Rama agrees after Bejo murders Andi.\nBunawar tasks him to infiltrate the underworld, befriending Bangun's son Uco. Using the alias \"Yuda\", Rama is told to assault the politician's son responsible for putting Uco in prison. Bunawar can arrest him and befriend Uco. In a riot a year into Uco's prison term, several assailants attempt to kill him. They are led by Benny who betrays Uco's trust before Yuda saves him. When Yuda is released two years later, Uco takes him to meet his father, who hires him out of gratitude. He proves his value to the family through his work under Uco and his father's consigliere Eka.\n\nUco is frustrated with his limited role in the organization and is furious when a bar girl calls him a \"debt collector\". When he leaves the room, Rama plants a bug in his wallet. Bangun meets the hitman Prakoso, who assassinates another of Bangun's targets.\n\nBejo invites Uco to dinner and tells him he has his eye on Gotos' controlled land. He shares rumors of a plot to turn Reza and others against his father. Bejo brings the assailants from the prison riot. Uco kills them. He notices a gang tattoo on Benny's wrist. They hatch a plot to start a gang war to disrupt the truce between the two families. Uco can prove himself to Bangun; Bejo can profit from carving up Hideaki Goto's territory. Uco lures Prakoso into an ambush. Prakoso is killed by The Assassin. Uco lies to his father saying the Japanese were responsible. Bangun will not counterattack. Frustrated, Uco phones Bejo saying \"Just do it.\" Bejo's hitmen – Hammer Girl, Baseball Bat Man, and The Assassin – kill several of Goto's men, sparking a gang war between the families.\n\nRama is attacked during the conflict. He defeats the assailants and discovers a police ID on one of the attackers. When the families meet to reconcile, Uco lashes out in anger, embarrassing Bangun into conceding territory. Rama learns from Lt. Bunawar the attackers were Reza's corrupt cops sent after him. He receives a call from Eka to save Uco. Bangun beats Uco when they return to his office. While Yuda is on the way, Bejo and The Assassin barge in with a mob of henchmen. Revealing his betrayal, Uco kills his father and shoots Eka. Before Bejo can finish him off, Yuda arrives and Eka flees. The Assassin subdues Rama. Bejo commands his men to get rid of him. Eka follows. In a car chase several vehicles are destroyed before Yuda is rescued and driven to safety. Ryuichi informs Goto and Keichi that Reza was seen entering Bejo's restaurant. Goto tells Ryuichi to \"take care of him\". Ryuichi tells him Bejo is not alone. He informs him of Uco's betrayal of his father. Goto declares war against Bejo, Uco, and Reza. When his son Keichi interjects, Goto responds, \"They're not cops anymore. They're in my world now.\" A bleeding and exhausted Eka tells Rama he knows he was also undercover. Rama calls Lt. Bunawar, who informs him the gang war escalated. The police commissioner was shot dead. Bunawar claims Eka \"went rogue\" and ten honest cops died. He informs him that Reza, the true objective, is meeting Bejo and Uco at the restaurant. Rama breaches its warehouse and fights through Bejo's men.\n\nBejo and Uco meet Reza to discuss terms against Goto. Still shaken from his act of patricide, Uco discovers the bug in his wallet. Uncertain who planted it, he notices Bejo has the same tattoo as Benny, suggesting the prison attack may have been another attempt to spark a gang war. Uco sits in shock realizing he has been used. Rama defeats Bejo's three hitmen and disrupts the meeting carrying The Assassin's pair of karambit. Bejo attempts to shoot him. Uco grabs another gun and shoots Reza dead. He shoots Bejo, before turning his gun towards Rama who throws the karambit at Uco then stabs him. Uco dies in his arms. Rama limps from the premises and encounters Keichi, Ryuichi and their men sent to attack the meeting. While Lt. Bunawar drives to the site, Keichi smirks as he shares a silent dialogue with Rama. Rama is heard saying, \"No...I'm done.\"\n\n\nOther cast members include and , who reprise their roles as Rama's father and wife Isa, respectively. Veteran actors and make cameos as the mediator and police commissioner, respectively.\n\nFollowing \"Merantau\", director Gareth Evans and his producers began to work on a project called \"Berandal\" (which is Indonesian for \"thugs\"), a large-scale prison gang film intended to star not only \"Merantau\" actors Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian, but also an additional pair of international fight stars. A teaser trailer was shot, but the project proved to be more complex and time consuming than they had anticipated. After a year and a half, Evans and the producers found themselves with insufficient funds to produce \"Berandal\", so they changed to a simpler, but different story with a smaller budget. They called the project \"Serbuan Maut\" (\"The Raid\"), which led to the creation of the first film.\n\nWhile developing \"The Raid\" in script form, Evans considered the idea of creating a link between it and the initial project, \"Berandal\". Following the release of \"The Raid\", it was later confirmed that \"Berandal\" would serve as a sequel to \"The Raid\". Evans also said that he wanted to include car chases in the sequel, as well as a third \"Raid\" film being \"a lot further down the line.\"\n\nWith the title for the North American market announced as \"The Raid 2\", the sequel has a \"significantly larger\" budget than its predecessor, and its production schedule took approximately 100 days. Pre-production began in September 2012 with filming in January 2013.\n\nIn December 2012, Twitch confirmed that Julie Estelle was cast as \"Hammer Girl\"; Evans also tweeted that internationally renowned silat practitioner Cecep Arif Rahman was also given a major part in the film. Marsha Timothy, Mathias Muchus, Tio Pakusadewo, and Alex Abbad, who worked with Evans in \"Merantau\", were also cast in the film. Japanese actors Matsuda Ryuhei, Kenichi Endō, and Kitamura Kazuki also joined the cast.\n\nEvans also revealed on his Twitter that Yayan Ruhian, who played Mad Dog in \"The Raid\", will return for the sequel as a new character called Prakoso, the machete-wielding chief assassin of Bangun. He claimed that he would not do a martial arts film without Ruhian being involved. Ruhian, who is a choreographer of the film, also trained Estelle in pencak silat.\n\nIn January 2013, PT Merantau Films and XYZ Films announced the start of production. The filming process took about seven months and ended in July 2013.\n\nThe film's lead cinematographer Matt Flannery tweeted that at least three RED cameras were used in a test shoot of a chase scene. Gareth Evans mentioned on his Twitter that they were using RED Scarlet for 95% of the shoot, Epic for slow mo, and Go Pro 3 for quick cuts during the car chase.\n\nA teaser trailer was released at Twitch Film on 6 November 2013. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that the trailer \"unleashes more action than most Hollywood blockbusters.\"\n\nA longer Indonesian trailer was released on 31 December 2013. The American trailer was released on 21 January 2014.\n\nOn 26 March 2014, a deleted scene from the film titled \"Gang War\" was released to promote the film.\n\nThe film was marketed internationally through Celluloid Nightmares, a partnership between US-based XYZ Films and France's Celluloid Dreams.\n\nSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions acquired the film's distribution rights for the United States, Latin America and Spain; and Kadokawa Pictures for Japan. Distribution rights to other countries were sold to eOne Entertainment for Canada and the United Kingdom; Koch Media for Germany, Switzerland and Austria; Calinos Films for Turkey; HGC for China; and Madman Entertainment for Australia.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2014. It also screened at South by Southwest on 10 March 2014 and ARTE Indonesia Arts Festival on 14 March 2014. Following a wide release on 11 April 2014, due to low returns the majority of theaters closed the film one week later. This was similar to what occurred during the theatrical run of the first film.\n\n\"The Raid 2\" was banned in neighboring Malaysia. The film was scheduled to hit Malaysian screens on 28 March, but had not been shown anywhere in the country due to its excessive violence. Indonesian politician, and former , Pramono Edhie Wibowo criticized the decision and demanded an explanation. He further asked the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to \"actively perform its mediation function with the Malaysian government.\"\n\nThe US release was given an R rating by the MPAA for \"strong bloody violence throughout, sexuality and language\", cutting a few frames of graphic violence. Director Evans stated the cuts are very minimal and similar to his original cut. The film received an R-15 rating in Japan with 4 minutes cut, and an R-18 uncut version which was screened in the Tokyo metropolitan area.\n\n\"The Raid 2\" has received positive reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 80% approval rating, with an average score of 7.4/10, based on reviews from 165 critics. The site's consensus states: \"Although its high-energy plot and over-the-top violence may play better with genre aficionados, \"The Raid 2\" definitely delivers more of everything audiences loved about its predecessor.\" The film has a score of 71/100 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 33 critics.\n\nDuring its world premiere at Sundance, \"The Raid 2\" received an overwhelming reaction. Mark Olsen of the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that \"The screening caused an explosion of excitement and enthusiasm for the film on social media.\"\n\nIn a 3-out-of-5 mixed review, Joey Magidson of the website \"Awards Circuit\" wrote that he \"appreciate(s) the directing skills on display in \"The Raid 2\", but at a certain point, all of the fighting and killing nearly got to be too much for me. I’m recommending the film, but not in the same way as the last one.\" He added that while it is \"creative enough to be worth a recommendation, it lacks the originality of the first flick\" and concluded that \"\"The Raid 2 \"will delight genre fans, but might not impress to many others.\"\n\nChris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said, \"\"The Raid 2\" will make you feel like Christmas came nine months early. Some action sequels don't know when to say when. But here's one where too much is just the right amount.\"\n\nSimon Abrams of \"RogerEbert.com\" praised the film for its \"involving plot\"; calling the cast, especially Uwais, \"charming\" and dialogue \"winningly precise\" while noting that the sequel is \"a great step up after the already-impressive \"The Raid\".\"\n\nDavid Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a positive review, remarking, \"Evans gives the audience a knowing wink by having Rama endure repeated batterings that would leave mere mortals in traction, not to mention some nasty blade wounds. Yet he keeps coming back, finding the stamina to snap more limbs and crush more skulls. Taking place inside moving vehicles, a subway car, a noodle bar, warehouses, a porn factory, tight corridors and in the most electrifying mano-a-mano clash, a gleaming nightclub kitchen and wine cellar, the fights are dynamite.\"\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" chief critic Peter Travers wrote, \"\"The Raid 2\" lets its warriors rip for two and a half thrilling hours. With the precision of dance and the punch of a K.O. champion, Evans keeps the action coming like nobody's business.\"\n\nMany have praised the film for matching the action sequences that made the first film so great, as well as improving upon the plot and the dialogue, which its predecessor was criticized for.\n\nAmber Wilkinson of \"The Daily Telegraph\" commented, \"Hyper-violent it may be but there is beauty in its brutality,\" and wrote, \"To say a martial arts movie brings something fresh in terms of choreography may sound like fighting talk, but Gareth Evans's sequel to his 2011 film is endlessly inventive.\"\n\nMatt Risley of \"Total Film\" gave the film 5 stars and wrote: \"Sumptuously shot, perfectly paced and flat-out exhilarating, \"The Raid 2\" cements Evans as the best action director working today and may not be the best action, gangster, or even martial-arts movie ever made. But as a combination of all three, it's unparalleled in recent memory and offers a tantalising glimpse into a post-Bayhem action-movie world. Brutal, beautiful and brilliant\" and also wrote, \"The sheer imagination on show, both in the cinematography and choreography, guarantees each brawl is instantly iconic. Immaculately edited, each traumatic, tensely tactile fight would blur into chaos if not for Evans's pinpoint pacing something that refreshes all the more in the face of modern blockbusting's tendency to start big and just keep getting bigger, until burnout.\"\n\nThe film appeared on several critics' year-end lists.\n\n\"The Raid 2\" has garnered a number of nominations and wins from both domestic and international awards.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, it won the award for Best Foreign Language Film from the Florida Film Critics Circle over Sweden's \"Force Majeure\" and Poland's \"Ida\"; a first for an Indonesian film. It also received two nominations at the 2014 Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, for Best Stunts, and Best Foreign Language Film; losing the former to \"Edge of Tomorrow \"and the latter to Polish film, \"Ida\". Another nomination came from the 2014 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards on the Best Foreign Language Film category, which it lost to Ruben Östlund's \"Force Majeure\" from Sweden. For the 8th Houston Film Critics Society Awards, it also received a nomination in the foreign film category, again losing to \"Force Majeure\".\n\nThe film received 10 nominations at the local 2014 Maya Awards, organized by online film community \"Piala Maya\". On 20 December 2014, it won four of its ten nominations: Best Cinematography for Matt Flanery and Dimas Subono, Best Editing for Evans and Andi Novianto, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actor for Arifin Putra. It was also nominated for Best Film, Best Original Score, Most Memorable Featured Appearance for Julie Estelle as 'The Hammer Girl' (all three lost to \"\"); Best Hair & Make-Up and Best Sound Mixing (both lost to \"Killers\"), as well as another nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category for Oka Antara (who lost to co-star Arifin Putra).\n\nOn 6 January 2014, media outlets quoted director Gareth Evans stating that \"The Raid 3\" will take place two hours before the end of \"The Raid 2\". On 19 April, during an interview with \"Metro\", director Evans said that he is planning to take a break from martial arts movies for two or three years before filming it. \"The Raid 3\" was planned for a 2018 or 2019 release.\n\nHowever, in a 21 November 2016 interview with \"Impact Online\", director Evans revealed the sequel was on hold with the franchise likely having ended, stating \"Moving back to UK felt like a closing chapter on that franchise—we ended the story pretty neatly (I feel) in Part 2. I'm aware there's an interest for it So never say never, but it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.\"\n\n"}

It aired in its entirety on October 3, 2011, on AMC's official website.\n\nThe web series tells the origin story of Hannah, also known as \"Bicycle Girl\", the walker whom Rick Grimes killed in the first episode. Rick risks a walker encounter to go back and find Hannah before he sets out for Atlanta. After telling her he is \"sorry this happened to you,\" Rick shoots her in what is clearly a humanitarian gesture, which reveals much about Rick's own character and sets a tone for the rest of season one.\n\nThese webisodes were followed by a second set of webisodes, titled \"\", which were released on October 1, 2012.\n\nHannah, a mother of two kids, awakens from a car crash to find her two children missing. She runs to her ex's house, and finds them there. Andrew, her ex, had previously shot and hid his walker wife, who comes back and almost kills the two kids before Hannah kills her. In a flashback, it is revealed that after going to his neighbor's house to scavenge supplies, Andrew was asked to shoot his living neighbor, Mike Palmer, who had been bitten. Mike also asked that he shoot his two children upstairs who have already turned, which he neglects to do. Later in a desperate attempt to flee with his family, Andrew tries to get the keys to Mike's truck, but is killed in the process by Mike's undead children he had failed to shoot. A helicopter hovering over the neighborhood announces to any survivors to make their way to the concession stand at the park, where they are evacuating refugees. Hannah and her children leave on foot in an attempt to get there, but Hannah is bitten along the way. After she is bitten, Hannah hands a pistol to her daughter and tells her and her brother to run to safety at the concession stand, and then she is devoured and torn in half by a horde of walkers. The last shot is of her waking up as a walker and then starting to pull herself along the ground.\n\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n"}

He began searching for people from all around the world with incredible talents. The circus currently has performers from at least 24 different countries around the world. It is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe UniverSoul Circus was founded in 1994. The history section of the official website states that \"We had the idea to present ... to a wide demographic of spectators.\"\n\nRecruiting, training and production began in 1993. The first performance took place in 1994 in the parking lot of Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. The first season of operations brought formidable debt upon the organization. By 1997 the circus tour grew to 10 cities, 19 cities in 1999, 31 cities in 2000, and 32 cities in 2005. A tour of South Africa, the first international destination, was completed in 2001.\n\nThe UniverSoul Circus through some of its animal vendors have had many animal cruelty violations dating from 1997 to the present time.

{"id": "30862992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30862992", "title": "Women in Refrigerators", "text": "Women in Refrigerators\n\nWomen in Refrigerators (or WiR) is a website created in 1999 by a group of feminist comic book fans that lists examples of the comic book trope whereby female characters are injured, raped, killed, or depowered (an event colloquially known as fridging) as a plot device, and seeks to analyze why these plot devices are allegedly used disproportionately on female characters.\n\nThe term \"Women in Refrigerators\" was coined by writer Gail Simone as a name for the website in early 1999 during online discussions about comic books with friends. It refers to an incident in \"Green Lantern\" #54 (1994), written by Ron Marz, in which Kyle Rayner, the title hero, comes home to his apartment to find that his girlfriend, Alexandra DeWitt, had been killed by the villain Major Force and stuffed into a refrigerator. Simone and her colleagues then developed a list of fictional female characters who had been \"killed, maimed or depowered\", in particular in ways that treated the female character as merely a device to move a male character's story arc forward, rather than as a fully developed character in her own right. The list was then circulated via the Internet over Usenet, bulletin board systems, e-mail and electronic mailing lists. Simone also e-mailed many comic book creators directly for their responses to the list.\n\nThe list is infamous in certain comic book fan circles. Respondents often found different meanings to the list itself, though Simone maintained that her simple point had always been: \"If you demolish most of the characters girls like, then girls won't read comics. That's it!\"\n\nJournalist Beau Yarbrough created the initial design and coding on the original site. Technology consultant John Bartol edited the content. Robert Harris, a librarian and comic-book fan, contributed to site maintenance and updates along with fan John Norris. The idea for placing the list online originated with software developer Jason Yu, who also served as the original site host.\n\nSimone received numerous e-mail responses from comic book fans and professionals. Some responses were neutral and others were positive. Additionally, arguments on the merits of the list were published on comic-book fan sites in early 1999.\n\nSimone published many of the responses she received on the website. \n\nSeveral comic book creators indicated that the list caused them to pause and think about the stories they were creating. Often these responses contained arguments for or against the use of death or injury of female characters as a plot device. A list of some responses from comic book professionals is included at the site. Marz's reply stated (in part) \"To me the real difference is less male–female than main character-supporting character. In most cases, main characters, \"title\" characters who support their own books, are male. ... the supporting characters are the ones who suffer the more permanent and shattering tragedies. And a lot of supporting characters are female.\"\n\nIn response to fans who argued that male characters are also often killed, content editor John Bartol wrote \"Dead Men Defrosting\", an article arguing that when male heroes are killed or altered, they are more typically returned to their status quo. According to Bartol, after most female characters are altered they are \"never allowed, as male heroes usually are, the chance to return to their original heroic states. And that's where we begin to see the difference.\"\n\nIn 2000, several national newspapers ran articles that referenced the site, generating discussion on the topic of sexism in pop culture and the comic-book industry. Some universities also list the content of Women in Refrigerators as related to analysis and critique of pop culture.\n\nWomen in Refrigerators Syndrome was coined in various forms via online discussions and articles. The term describes the use of the death or injury of a female comic book character as a plot device in a story starring a male comic book character. It is also used to note the depowerment or elimination of a female comic-book character. Cases of it deal with a gruesome injury or murder of a female character at the hands of a supervillain, usually as a motivating personal tragedy for a male superhero, to whom the victim is connected. The death or injury of the female character, then helps cement the hatred between the hero and the villain responsible. Kyle Rayner is a particularly cited example, due to the common tragedies that befall women in his life.\n\nDiscussing the site in his book \"Dangerous Curves: Action Heroes, Gender, Fetishism and Popular Culture\", Bowling Green State University professor Jeffrey A. Brown noted that while male comic book heroes have tended to die heroically and be magically brought back from the dead afterwards, female characters have been likelier to be casually but irreparably wounded or killed, often in a sexualized fashion. To support his claim, he cited the Joker shattering the original Batgirl's spine just for fun, resulting in her being restricted to a wheelchair for over a decade, and the villain Black Mask binding, torturing and killing the first female Robin from DC Universe, Stephanie Brown.\n\nSeveral contributors to the site and the original list later became comic book creators and entertainment industry professionals. \n\n"}
