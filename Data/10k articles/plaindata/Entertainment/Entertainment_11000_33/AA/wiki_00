All major HDTV broadcasting standards (such as SMPTE 292M) include a 720p format, which has a resolution of 1280×720; however, there are other formats, including HDV Playback and AVCHD for camcorders, that use 720p images with the standard HDTV resolution. The frame rate is standards-dependent, and for conventional broadcasting appears in 50 progressive frames per second in former PAL/SECAM countries (Europe, Australia, others), and 59.94 frames per second in former NTSC countries (North America, Japan, Brazil, others).\n\nThe number \"720\" stands for the 720 horizontal scan lines of image display resolution (also known as 720 pixels of vertical resolution). The \"p\" stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. When broadcast at 60.00 frames/s frames per second, 720p features the highest temporal resolution possible under the ATSC and DVB standards. The term assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of , thus implying a resolution of 1280×720 px (0.9 megapixels).\n\n720i (720 lines interlaced) is an erroneous term found in numerous sources and publications. Typically, it is a typographical error in which the author is referring to the 720p HDTV format. However, in some cases it is incorrectly presented as an actual alternative format to 720p. No proposed or existing broadcast standard permits 720 \"interlaced\" lines in a video frame at any frame rate.\n\nProgressive scanning reduces the need to prevent flicker by anti-aliasing single high contrast horizontal lines. It is also easier to perform high-quality 50↔60 Hz conversion and slow-motion clips with progressive video.\n\nA 720p60 (720p at 59.94 Hz) video has advantage over 480i and 1080i60 (29.97/30 frame/s, 59.94/60 Hz) in that it comparably reduces the number of 3:2 artifacts introduced during transfer from 24 frame/s film. However, 576i and 1080i50 (25 frame/s, 50 Hz), which are common in Europe, generally do not suffer from pull down artifacts as film frames are simply played at 25 frames and the audio pitch corrected by 25/24ths. As a result, 720p60 is used for U.S. broadcasts while European HD broadcasts often use 1080i50 24* frame, with a horizontal resolution of 1920 or 1440 depending on bandwidth constraints. However, some European broadcasters do use the 720p50 format, such as German broadcasters ARD and ZDF, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) and Spanish Radio and Television Corporation (TVE HD). Arte, a dual-language French-German channel produced in collaboration by ARD, ZDF and France Télévisions, broadcasts in German at 720p50 but in French at 1080i50. The Flemish Broadcasting Company (VRT) in Belgium was using 720p50, but switched to 1080i50 a few years ago.\n\n"}

It was released following the success of the 1979 film \"Alien\" as an unofficial sequel, albeit having little connection to the film.\n\nThe film features a score by Guido De Angelis and Maurizio De Angelis, performed by the composers under the pseudonym Oliver Onions. The film co-starred a young Michele Soavi, years before he became a famed Italian horror film director in his own right, and a cameo appearance by Ciro Ippolito himself (in the role of \"Joe\"). It was filmed in California, the Cinecittà studios in Rome, and in the Castellana Caves.\n\nAs the world awaits the return of a crew of astronauts from a deep space mission, a young woman named Thelma Joyce appears on a television talk show to discuss caves. Soon after her interview begins, Thelma has a horrible psychic vision. After the spacecraft returns to Earth missing its occupants, a girl on a beach discovers a weird, blue, pulsating rock. Her mother soon finds her with her face ripped off.\n\nThelma and her husband Roy meet up with their friends for a trip to explore a cave. The group stops at a roadside café to buy food and change into their caving gear. Thelma's friend Burt discovers a blue rock that he decides to keep in his pack.\n\nThe group arrives at the cave, and quickly rappels to the bottom to set up camp for the night. Before falling asleep, Thelma tells Roy that she feels that something horrible is about to happen, but Roy calms her down.\n\nThe next day, Thelma's friend Jill discovers the blue rock that Burt found appears to be pulsating. The rock opens up and a creature attacks her face. Thelma witnesses the attack and panics. Roy calms her down, then decides to go find Jill's body.\n\nRoy rappels down into a hole and finds Jill, alive and with her face intact. The rest of the group rappels down the hole as well and they strap Jill to a lifter so that she may be lifted out of the hole. Jill is set aside by herself, still unconscious. While the group prepares to climb out of the hole, a creature erupts from Jill's face and attacks Phil's neck. Phil is dragged upside down as the creature slices his neck repeatedly until his head falls off.\n\nThe group retreats though they are forced to initially go back to retrieve their equipment. The group splits up into teams to search for a way out, but to no avail. During the search Thelma reflects on what is happening and wonders if the disappearance of the astronauts is connected. Maurine stumbles upon a group of aliens who kill her and Burt who tries to save her. Roy hurts his ankle and is forced to sit and rest. Cliff opts to go and locate Burt and Maurine while the others rest. Thelma telepathically warns Cliff of a nearby alien after their radio goes dead, though Cliff is killed by the alien. Thelma and the others find Cliff who is actually an alien in disguise. Thelma uses her abilities to explode the imposter's head revealing the alien. The alien attacks the other member of the group while Thelma and Roy outrun the alien and escape the caves. On their way back to the city, they discover a police car, but no police officers are in sight. They stop at the roadside café again, but no one is there. Roy tries to call for help on a payphone, but no operator is available. They get back into the car and continue to drive to the city.\n\nThelma and Roy finally get back to the city, but strangely, they cannot find anyone. They stop at the bowling alley, only to find that it is also empty. Roy goes to the back, only to be killed by an alien waiting there. The alien chases Thelma through the bowling alley, until she hits it in the head and leaves. Thelma runs through the empty city streets, calling for help but getting no answer. She finally stops yelling and sits down in an intersection. Suddenly, text shoots at the screen, warning the audience \"You may be next!\", implying that the aliens have taken over Earth.\n\n\nThe film was released theatrically in Italy on April 11, 1980 as \"Alien 2: Sulla Terra\" ('\"Alien 2: On Earth\") and in West Germany on March 19, 1982 as \"Alien, die Saat des Grauens kehrt zurück\" (\"Alien, the Seed of Horror Returns\").\nThe English-dubbed version was released theatrically in a limited way by Cinema Shares International Distribution (which distributed films such as \"Creature from Black Lake\", \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\" and \"The Pod People\").\n\nOn March 22, 2011, Midnight Legacy re-released the English-dubbed version of the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States under its original title, \"Alien 2: On Earth\", in a 30,000 copy pressing. The re-release includes fully remastered picture and audio, although during the process, it was noted that some of the audio was missing and it had to be mixed from a variety of sources. This version of the film was believed to be longer than any other version, but a prior Italian television version contained additional scenes not present in the Midnight Legacy version. Midnight Legacy's release contains special effects outtakes and a Dutch trailer.\n\nAdam Tyner of \"DVD Talk\" wrote, \"James Cameron once summed up his followup to Alien as 'forty miles of bad road'. Alien 2, meanwhile, is 'eighty-four minutes of bad, period'.\"\n\nDaryl Loomis of \"DVD Verdict\" said, \"Some people will say that Alien 2: On Earth is a blatant ripoff and some will say that it's a terrible movie. All of those people are right, but given my track record, nobody should be surprised that I love it.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "683269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=683269", "title": "Blading (professional wrestling)", "text": "Blading (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling, blading is the practice of intentionally cutting oneself to provoke bleeding. It is also known as \"juicing\", \"gigging\", or \"getting color\". Similarly, a blade is an object used for blading and a bladejob is a specific act of blading. The act is usually done a good length into the match as the blood will mix with the flowing sweat to make it look like much more blood is flowing from the wound than there actually is. The preferred area for blading is usually the forehead, as scalp wounds bleed profusely and heal easily. Legitimate, unplanned bleeding which occurs outside the storyline is called \"juicing the hard way\".\n\nPrior to the advent of blading, most storyline blood in wrestling came from one wrestler deliberately splitting the flesh over their opponent's eyebrow bone with a well placed and forceful punch. In his third autobiography, \"The Hardcore Diaries\", Mick Foley cites Terry Funk as one of the few remaining active wrestlers who knows how to \"bust an eyebrow open\" in this way. However on a most rare occasion, in the 2012 Extreme Rules event, Brock Lesnar caused John Cena to bleed without blading with a vicious elbow to his head and further hard strikes to Cena's body, though Cena ultimately won the match. The forehead has always been the preferred blading surface, due to the abundance of blood vessels. A cut in this area will bleed freely for quite some time and will heal quickly. A cut in this location will allow the blood to mix in with the sweat on the wrestler's face, giving them the proverbial \"crimson mask\" effect. \n\nIn modern North American professional wrestling, blading is almost exclusively performed by and on male performers; blading of women is extremely rare due to the risk of adverse publicity and the increasing use of female performers as \"eye candy\". Typically, a wrestler will use a razor blade that is hidden somewhere on their body. However, the wrestler always runs the risk of cutting too deeply and slicing an artery in the forehead. In 2004, Eddie Guerrero accidentally did this during his match with JBL at \"Judgment Day\", resulting in a rush of blood pouring from the bladed area. Guerrero lost so much blood because of the cut that he felt the effects from it for two weeks.\n\nSome wrestlers like Abdullah the Butcher, Dusty Rhodes, New Jack, Steve Corino and Devon Hughes (Brother Devon/D-Von Dudley) have disfiguring scars on their heads from frequently blading throughout their careers. According to Mick Foley, the scars in Abdullah's forehead are so deep that he enjoys holding coins or gambling chips in them as a macabre party trick.\n\nToday, blading is a lot less popular than in the past, due to the prevalence and heightened awareness of AIDS and hepatitis. In the 1980s, the willingness to blade was seen as an advantage of new wrestlers. From July 2008 onward, due to its TV-PG rating, WWE has not allowed wrestlers to blade themselves. In most cases, any blood coming from the wrestlers is unintentional. To maintain their TV-PG rating, WWE television programs shift to black-and-white if a wrestler bleeds in front of the camera. \n\nImpact Wrestling, formerly known as Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling used blading frequently until adopting a new no blood policy in 2014. Wrestlers Abyss and Raven were famed for the matches involving the most blood in TNA before the new policy in 2014.\n\nPerhaps the most famous such incident was a bladejob performed by Japanese wrestler The Great Muta in a 1992 match with Hiroshi Hase; the amount of blood Muta lost was so great that many people to this day judge the severity of bladejobs on the \"Muta Scale\".\n\nAnother such incident was during an ECW house show when a young wrestler known as Mass Transit forged documents and lied to ECW Owner/Promoter Paul Heyman about his age and amount of training. He then asked his opponent, New Jack, to blade him. Jack cut through two arteries in Mass Transit's head when he bladed the young man, and fifty stitches were required to close the wound. A wrestler allowing someone else to blade him is extremely rare.\n\nIn Bret Hart's autobiography \"\", Hart stated that he bladed Stone Cold Steve Austin during the infamous No Disqualification Submission Match at WrestleMania 13, at a time when blading was forbidden, and Austin had never bladed during a match before. Contrary to Hart's biography, Austin actually had bled during matches many times before. His own autobiography states that he often 'got color' during matches with earlier opponents including Dustin Runnels during his run in WCW. Video footage of the event shows Austin's wrist tape unravelling after he began to bleed, as if he had removed a blade from about his person, to use willingly on himself.\n\nDuring an interview on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", Mickey Rourke spoke about his experience with gigging himself for a scene in the 2008 movie \"The Wrestler\". Rourke agreed to gig at the initial request of director Darren Aronofsky in hopes that he would revoke the demand come production time. Indeed, later during filming, Aronofsky admitted that Rourke needn't actually gig; however, by his own will, Rourke decided to go through with it anyway. In the film itself, Rourke's character is seen preparing for a match by wrapping a razor blade inside his wrist tape.\n\nThere is one notable incident of blading in association football. In 1989, Chilean national team goalkeeper Roberto Rojas bladed himself to prevent a loss, by blaming the injury on fireworks thrown by opposing fans. FIFA saw through the ruse and ended up banning Rojas for life and banning Chile from the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Rojas's ban was lifted in 2001.\n\nCanadian wrestler Devon Nicholson pressed charges against Abdullah the Butcher, claiming that he contracted hepatitis C after Abdullah bladed him without consent. An Ontario court ruled in favor of Nicholson and ordered Abdullah to pay $2.3 million dollars.\n\nDuring their King of the Road match at Uncensored 1995, Dustin Rhodes and The Blacktop Bully bladed, which was against the policy of World Championship Wrestling at the time, and they were both fired as a result.\n\n"}
{"id": "1886390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886390", "title": "Bohemia Interactive", "text": "Bohemia Interactive\n\nBohemia Interactive is a video game development studio and publisher, based in Prague, Czech Republic. The company focuses on creating military simulation games such as \"\" and the \"ARMA\" series. It was also known for working on a game conversion of the \"DayZ\" mod created for \"ARMA 2\".\n\nFounded by Marek Španěl in 1999, the studio released its first game in 2001, a military shooter titled \"\", which received critical acclaim and brought recognition for the studio. Following \"Operation Flashpoint\" was a series of downturns, such as porting the game to Xbox, which led to financial losses and the development of a sequel later abandoned by the publisher Codemasters. The studio fell into financial troubles until the United States Marine Corps employed the studio to create simulation games to train soldiers. A new division called Bohemia Interactive Simulations was created, and later spun off and become a standalone business entity. Following Codemasters' decision of not supporting the studio, Bohemia Interactive decided to develop a spiritual successor to \"Cold War Crisis\" titled \"\". It was both a critical and financial success, spawning a number of sequels. Smaller projects such as \"Take On Helicopters\" were also released.\n\nIn 2012, Dean Hall produced \"DayZ\" a mod for \"ARMA 2\", that prompted the studio to develop a standalone game. The same year saw the arrest of two employees of Bohemia, who were charged with espionage by Greece and jailed for 129 days. This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the \"ARMA 3\"s setting to a fictional one. The company is working on several new projects, including making a survival game named \"Vigor\", preparing \"DayZ\" for an eventual full release and developing \"Ylands\", a sandbox game which was part of Bohemia Incubator, a platform for Bohemia Interactive to release small, experimental projects\n\nBohemia Interactive was founded by Marek Španěl, Ondřej Španěl and Slavomír Pavlíček. He aspired to become a game developer in the 1980s, after his brother was convinced to buy a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A computer. Španěl first worked as a salesman for a game distribution company and made a 3D hovercraft simulator \"\" for Atari Falcon in 1995, which sold 400 copies only. He, along with his brother and another partner, decided to develop a game in 1997 using the money given by his former employers. He officially founded Bohemia Interactive in 1999.\n\nThe team initially wanted to develop a shooter named \"Rio Grande\", which was described by Španěl as \"a 3D clone of \"River Raid\"\". However, the team did not see the potential of the project and shifted their focus to make an open world game. It then became \"Poseidon\", which was a first-person shooter with a heavy focus on realism. At that time, the team expanded significantly, from having only one full-time programmer, to having 12 full-time employees by the end of the game's development. According to Španěl, the entire development team was very enthusiastic about the game and was focused on creating a game that they \"wanted to play\", thus opting not to study the works of another development team. \"Poseidon\" suffered from an extended development cycle of over three years, causing some of its technologies to become outdated. Original publisher Interactive Magic was sold in 1999 and another publisher which signed the project later wanted to abandon it. The frequent changes of publishers caused uncertainties regarding the game's funding. Despite these development issues, \"Poseidon\" was successfully released in June 2001 under the official title \"\" by Codemasters to critical acclaim. It was shipped without any game-breaking bugs, and it became an international success, selling more than 500,000 copies in its first three months of release, as well as reaching a top position in retail sales chart across the world including US, UK, Germany and Australia. The team was satisfied with the game's release, with Španěl describing it as a dream coming true. Bohemia Interactive won Best Debut at the Game Developers Choice Awards, defeating strong opponents including Remedy Entertainment (\"Max Payne\").\n\nFollowing the release of \"Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis\", the team intended to continue updating the game with post-release content, develop a port for the Xbox console, and create a sequel. Projected to take only nine months to develop, the Xbox version also known as \",\" was released in 2005, four years after the game's initial release. The reason for the long development cycle stemmed from the team's unfamiliarity with the console's structure. With the release of a new generation of hardware including a new Xbox console, \"Elite\"s release did not gain its audience's attention. Sales were lackluster and the development suffered a huge financial loss. In 2005 the company also founded the Independent Developers Association (IDEA) with Black Element Software and Altar Games. The organization aimed at supporting other independent game development studios with services including marketing support and negotiation with publishers.\n\nThe team started developing a sequel to \"Operation Flashpoint\", codenamed \"Game 2\", after they canceled their open world Western-themed project, which was described as \"\"Flashpoint\" in Western\" by Španěl. The team had lots of ambition for \"Game 2\" and hoped that it would become a perfect game, thus the team began spending an excessive amount of time on small details, from doing 3D scanning of real-life weapons to modeling the player character's eyeball. However, in doing so some basics were neglected by the team, and many goals remained unattained due to the team's skill and technology status. As a result, the team constantly missed the deadlines set by publisher Codemasters. Codemasters was dissatisfied with the team's work and began looking for outside help. Bohemia disagreed with the search for outside assistance, and the two studio decided to part way with each other. With Codemasters no longer supporting the studio financially, Bohemia entered a series of financial troubles. In addition, Codemasters retained the rights to \"Operation Flashpoint\" preventing Bohemia from using the title in the future.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the US Army began using a mod of the first \"Operation Flashpoint\", named \"DARWARS Ambush!\", to train soldiers. In financial distress, Bohemia capitalized on its use and made a small sum of money, saving the company from falling into immediate bankruptcy. Bohemia also set up a new division called Bohemia Interactive Simulations, specializing in creating military simulation games with its \"Virtual Battle Space\" titles for armies around the world to use. Meanwhile, the main studio, realizing that they should release a game as soon as possible, decided to rework on \"Elite\" engine and make a spiritual successor to \"Cold War Crisis\" called \"Armored Assault\", later renamed \"\". According to Španěl, the team hated the title. Bohemia decided to self-publish the game, and launched in an early access form. The game received high critical praise and great sales, sufficient to save the company.\n\nThe development of a sequel to \"ARMA\" commenced afterward. The team decided to reuse some of its assets of \"Game 2\" for \"ARMA 2\", and did not hold unrealistic ambitions for the game. A Xbox 360 version was planned but was later scrapped after the team thought that its power was inferior to that of personal computers. During this period, Codemasters announced \"\", a game falling into competition with Bohemia's own \"ARMA\" titles, as it was marketed as the true successor to \"Cold War Crisis\". Španěl was not happy with how \"Dragon Rising\" is being marketed as a return to the \"Operation Flashpoint\" series despite being created without the involvement of Bohemia. The team became anxious, but found relief after viewing gameplay footage \"Dragon Rising\", which they considered to be subpar and \"[did] not come even close to what they promised\". \"ARMA 2\" was released in mid-2009 to high critical praise and high sales. The development team soon began work on an expansion titled \"\", though Codemasters took legal actions to force Bohemia to change its name due to its similarity with \"Operation Flashpoint\". In early 2010s, the company continued to develop expansions for \"ARMA 2\", and released smaller titles such as \"Take On Helicopters\".\n\nFollowing the release of \"Operation Arrowhead\", the company started development of a new \"ARMA\" game, this time set in the future. The game was titled \"Arma Futura\", in which players fight aliens, and its direction once shifting to role-playing. All of these futuristic elements were later scrapped, and were remade into a more realistic setting. The title eventually became \"ARMA 3\". The Greek media reported in 2012 that two Czechs were arrested on the Greek island Lemnos, the setting for \"ARMA III\" after being charged with espionage. This was later confirmed to be Martin Pezlar and Ivan Buchta, both of them employees at Bohemia Interactive. The main reason for their charge is that they took photos of military installations, which under Greek law threatened their national security. Charges were refuted, and both of them insisted that they were traveling the island for entertainment only. If convicted, the duo faced a 20-year sentence. This soon became a diplomatic concern, with Czech President Václav Klaus urging the Greek President to solve this issue with \"special attention\". Bohemia also made efforts by motivating its \"ARMA\" communities to petition to pressure Greece for the pair's release. During this period of time, team morale dropped. \"\" was released by the studio, but according to Španěl, \"nobody at the studio really cared\" because their friends were stranded in a foreign jail. Regardless, Pezlar and Buchta were held in prison for 129 days until the Greek government allowed them to be released on bail. After this incident, the team decided to renamed \"ARMA 3\" setting from Lemnos to a fictional island called \"Altis\". \"Arma III\" was eventually released in August 2013 to positive critical reviews. Two mobile \"ARMA\" games, \"ARMA Tactics\" and \"ARMA Mobile Ops\", were released in 2013 and 2016 respectively. In January 2013 the investment copmany Riverside Co. bought Bohemia Interactive Simulations. While both companies share the engine technology due to the shared past they are now completely separate entities.\n\nIn 2012, Dean Hall, an employee at Bohemia working on \"ARMA 3\", released a massively popular mod for \"Arma II\" named \"DayZ\", which includes zombies as the game's main enemies. Its popularity led to a resurgence in \"ARMA 2\"s sales, with registered players count being raised from 500,000 to one million. Impressed with the success of \"DayZ\", Bohemia appointed Hall to fully capitalize on it by leading the development of a standalone \"DayZ\" video game, which ensured that he would not be limited by the restraints of \"Arma 2\". While the main goal is to transit the mod into an entirely new game, the team also intended to add more content such as base-building and improved crafting. Hall eventually left Bohemia in 2014, and the game remained in early access more than four years after its release in December 2013.\n\nIn November 2016, the company announced Bohemia Incubator, a platform for the development of experimental games. According to Bohemia Interactive, the incubator aimed at testing designs and concepts and getting the community involved in game development, as well as being the guidance of Bohemia's other technologies including its Enfusion engine and supporting services. Two titles were announced as part of the incubator. This includes \"Ylands\", a sandbox game, and \"Argo\", a free-to-play shooter without microtransactions released in June 2017. The company is also working on \"Vigor\", a survival game powered by Unreal Engine for the Xbox One.\n\nBohemia Interactive prides themselves on open communication with players. The company laid out road maps in an effort to offer details on some of their post-release content, such as in the case of \"ARMA 3\" and \"DayZ\". The company also sometimes let players to help out with game design process. It invited players to the Czech studio to help with the design of the first \"Operation Flashpoint\", and released several titles via early access, a way in which early build of a game is released for the community to test and play. Many of Bohemia Interactive games are moddable, a focus since the release of the \"ARMA: Armed Assault\". The company awarded players who create user-generated content with their games in 2009 during the BIS Community Awards and announced a modding competition called \"Make \"Arma\" Not War\", in which modders must create mods that shift \"ARMA\" focus from war into anything else. Bohemia Interactive also took a stance against pirating with their DEGRADE technology, which would automatically create technical issues to pirated copies. For instance, in \"Take On Heliciopters\", pirated copies' visuals would be extremely blurry, whereas copies bought legitimately would not suffer from the same issue. The team also bought a T-72 tank in order to express gratitude, stating: \"A massive tanks goes out to everyone who has supported the studio and its games throughout the past 16 years\".\n\nAccording to Joris-Jan van ‘t Land, the project lead for \"ARMA 3\", Bohemia Interactive gives their employees a lot of freedom and autonomy. Employees can brainstorm ideas and exchange with each other, and some of these ideas may be implemented as official releases, shown through one of \"ARMA 3\"s downloadable contents, \"Zeus\". Bohemia Interactive also had a close relationship with International Committee of the Red Cross, in which they partnered together for a special award named Health Care in Danger Special Award at the Make Arma Not War competition, and Bohemia also promised to follow some of Red Cross' suggestions on how video games should handle war crimes.\n\nBohemia Interactive specialized in making simulation games with a focus on realism. They had created the military simulation game \"\" as their debut game, and followed it with an expansion called \"\". While Codemasters developed two \"Operation Flashpoint\" sequels, \"\" and \"\", the series was put on hiatus when Codemasters announced their plans to refocus on racing games. Meanwhile, Bohemia followed up their first game, \"Cold War Crisis\" with a spiritual successor called \"\", which was followed up by two sequels, \"Arma 2\" and \"Arma 3\", both of which have been critically acclaimed. The developer also had another simulation franchise called \"Take On\", which includes \"Take On Helicopters\", which allows players to play as a helicopter pilot, and \"Take On Mars\", in which players explore Mars. However, both titles are smaller in scope when compared with the \"ARMA\" franchise.\n"}

{"id": "1896071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896071", "title": "Bumblebee (Transformers)", "text": "Bumblebee (Transformers)\n\nBumblebee is a fictional robot superhero character from the Transformers franchise. In most versions, Bumblebee is a small, yellow with black stripes Autobot, with most of his alternative vehicle modes inspired by several generations of the Chevrolet American muscle cars – with the live-action film versions being a yellow Camaro with black racing stripes. The original vehicle-mode design was based on a classic European Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle. The character is named after the Bumblebee, a black-and-yellow striped bee which inspired his paint scheme.\n\nBumblebee (known as Abejorro in Mexico, Bumble in Japan, Moscardo in Portugal, Űrdongó in Hungary, Maggiolino in Italy, Bourdon in France) is the \"little brother\" of the heroic or protagonistic Autobot faction and a mascot, constantly striving to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots—especially his leader, Optimus Prime. This often causes him to take risks that put him in danger. Although a bit of a smart aleck, he is a capable and reliable messenger and spy, his small size allowing him to go places that his larger commanders cannot. He is highly fuel-efficient, has great visual acuity, is particularly adaptable to undersea environments and transforms into a Saturn yellow Volkswagen Beetle. He was later reconstructed into a stronger, more mature form as Goldbug.\n\nAt BotCon 2010, Hasbro named Bumblebee as one of the first five robot inductees in the Transformers Hall of Fame. \n\nBumblebee holds the distinction of being the second character to appear on-screen in the original \"Transformers\" animated series, while on a mission to recover a small clutch of energy conductors with Wheeljack, illustrating the energy crisis holding sway over their home planet of Cybertron. These two characters were often seen together in the first season and beginning of the second season, sometimes going on missions. Bumblebee is subsequently among the Transformers aboard the \"Ark\" as it set off searching for new worlds and new energy sources, which crashed on Earth, causing the Transformers within to be trapped in stasis for four million years. Awakening in 1984, Bumblebee helps Ironhide quell a raging river and uses his small size to help the human Autobot ally Sparkplug Witwicky plant explosives in the midst of a Decepticon mining operation.\n\nHe later befriends Sparkplug's son Spike, but on their first adventure together they are both kidnapped by the Decepticons, and Bumblebees memory chip were altered as he unintentionally lured the other Autobots into a trap. Bumblebee recovered in time to help his fellow Autobots stop the Decepticons from sending Spike to Cybertron. After their first adventure, Bumblebee and Spike became best friends for life as they both realized that they make a good team.\n\nBumblebee got injured with Spike inside from a battle with the Decepticons at a rocket base. While Bumblebee gets repaired by Ratchet, Spike's mind was transferred into Autobot X, a robot created by Sparkplug, while his real body was getting fixed at the hospital, due to his injuries from the battle being more severe then his were. When Spike left base as there was a side effect of the mind transfer, Bumblebee left afterwards to go look for his best friend but his radio transmitters weren't fixed yet. After finding Spike, Bumblebee tries to get his pal to come to his senses but failed when Spike believed that he was tricking him. Bumblebee sees the Decepticons arriving at their location but they didn't see him so he was able to hear Megatron tell lies to his best friend then left to go get Optimus and the rest of his Autobot friends for help, as they were helping with repairs at the rocket base they were battling at before. Bumblebee tells Optimus, after arriving at the rocket base, that Megatron is manipulating Spike and he's starting to believe him. Bumblebee was asks to lead the way of their location by Optimus, who feared that the Decepticons would find and take adventage of Spike messed up mind, so they can help their friend. After finding Spike, Bumblebee and Optimus tried talking some sense into him but it didn't work as they hoped it would but they were both relieved when he did when Sparkplug was endangered. After the Decepticons left, Bumblebee gave his best friend a high five when he returned to his real body when it got all fixed up.\n\nBumblebee accompanies Spike and Sparkplug with Jazz to test out his new speakers but decided to head to headquarters so wouldn't have to deal with his loud music. When Bumblebee return to headquarters he saw no one but Bluestreak there and that Telatran One was damaged then was dragged to the recharging chamber by Bluestreak, due to Megatron putting a personality destabilizer in their recharging chamber to turn all the Autobots evil. However, Bumblebee was saved when Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug arrived back just in time as Jazz knocked Bluestreak out for a while. After Sparkplug fixed Telatran One, Bumblebee, Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug became shocked when Telatran One tells them that Megatron turned their friends from good to evil. With Bumblebee and Jazz being the only ones who weren't affected from the personality destabilizer. Bumblebee decided to stop his comrades when he hears about Optimus Prime with Brawn and Prowl attacking an Air Force jet base with Spike accompanying him. Once they arrived, Bumblebee tried a few times to get through to Optimus but to no success. Bumblebee was relieved that his friends were free from the Decepticons control, after Sparkplug invented Attitude exchanger to counteract the personality destabilizer effects, except for Optimus. Bumblebee took the last one, as there was no other ones left, as he wanted to make one final attempted to get Optimus back to his senses. Bumblebee tells his friend/leader that he's not evil and he believes in him then encourages him to fight off Megatron's control also to not give in. Bumblebee quickly put the Attitude exchanger on Optimus, who heard his voice, leg which freed him from the Decepticons control. Bumblebee was given a hug by Optimus as a thank you for not giving up on him and for saving him. After stopping the Decepticons, Bumblebee was thanked again by Optimus, who also thanked everyone for their help, for what he did for him. Bumblebee with Spike gave Ratchet and Sparkplug tools as they them to fix the Air Force jets the Autobots destroyed while under Megatron's control. \n\nWhen the body of the deceased Optimus Prime is recovered from space by a pair of Transformer-hating human scientists who intend to use it to lure the Autobots into a trap, Bumblebee is part of the rescue team led by Rodimus Prime to recover it. Entering the lab, some of the Transformers are exposed to rage-inducing alien spores that could infect them with the Hate Plague, which causes them to run wild, and although Bumblebee avoids infection, he is seriously damaged by the infected rampaging Superion. A member of the alien race called the Quintessons subsequently repair and restore Optimus Prime to life, so he can stop the Hate Plague and repair Bumblebee. The little Autobot was so severely damaged, however, that he required an entire reconstruction and is rebuilt as a Throttlebot. In his new, shiny body, he comments that he has gone beyond just being plain old Bumblebee, and is now a \"gold bug\", prompting Optimus Prime to redub him Goldbug. Goldbug travels with Optimus Prime to the Decepticon planet of Chaar in order to secure a heat-resistant alloy that can protect him from the plague, only to be infected on the mission and later cured when Prime uses the power of the Matrix of Leadership to purge the plague. Goldbug also makes a brief appearance in the fourth and final season of the series, defending Autobot City and Cybertron against a massive Decepticon attack. Because of an animation error, Bumblebee appears in his Bumblebee incarnation during a wide shot in a celebration during the series' final episode.\n\nIn \"\", Goldbug and the other Throttlebots were on Cybertron when Vector Sigma began to destabilize as a consequence of Optimus Prime releasing the Matrix's energy to cure the Hate Plague the previous year. The Decepticons soon invaded the planet in an attempt to take control of the computer, and Goldbug and the Throttlebots joined Dinobots Grimlock and Slag in holding the line against them. Unfortunately, they were knocked unconscious by the hypnotic power of the new Decepticon Headmaster Mindwipe, but they had managed to delay the Decepticons long enough for the Autobot Headmasters to arrive and take up the fight.\n\nThe Throttlebots disappeared after this encounter, suggesting they might have been destroyed, but they eventually resurfaced months later as the Decepticons were carrying out their final plan to destroy the Earth. Goldbug and the Throttlebots teamed up with Fastlane and Cloudraker to investigate the emergence of a \"Death Tower\" in Santiago, Chile, only to find Predaking there waiting for them. Naturally, the small 'bots were no match for the powerful combiner, but they fought bravely, clinging onto his limbs before being hurled aside. Luckily, the Autobot Targetmasters arrived in time to bail them out and take Predaking down. This is also because of the budget cut that happened in the middle of the movie.\n\nBumblebee was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior books \"Dinobots Strike Back\" by Casey Todd and \"Battle Drive\" by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel.\n\nBumblebee was featured in the 1985 audio and book adventure \"Satellite of Doom\" publishing by Kid Stuff Records & Tapes.\n\nBumblebee was featured in the 1993 \"Transformers: Generation 2\" coloring book \"Decepticon Madness\" by Bud Simpson.\n\nBumblebee has appeared in numerous comic books and related media printed by various publishers.\n\nBumblebee appeared in the voice actor play performed at BotCon 2004, in which a device built by Rhinox to stop Unicron from pulling victims from other dimensions inadvertently transports an Autobot shuttle under Bumblebee's command into the middle of a battle between Rattrap, Silverbolt, and Waspinator and a team of Unicron's agents. Bumblebee's shuttle is able to scoop up Rattrap and company when their ship is destroyed. After saving more of Unicron's victims from the Decepticons, Bumblebee's team returns to their own time.\n\nIn a story called \"By their Blasters you shall know them ...!\" from \"Transformers Comic-Magazin\" issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Bumblebee is one of those he displays to the Autobots.\n\nIn Devil's Due's first \"G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers\" crossover, the evil terrorist organization Cobra are the first to uncover the \"Ark\" and the Transformers slumbering within it, capturing and reformatting a large number of them to use them as war machines. Bumblebee and Wheeljack are able to avoid this fate, contact the team created to respond to the threat of Cobra, G.I. Joe, and help to free their fellow Autobots. Unlike most Autobots, who had new alternate modes, Bumblebee and Wheeljack had their original Generation 1 alternate modes in this series.\n\nIn the second crossover, Bumblebee is among the Autobots sent back in time due to an accident with the spacebridge computer Teletran-3. As part of a small group transported to the 1970s, Bumblebee is reformatted as a small economy car (this time, resembling an AMC Pacer) before the teamed-up Joes and Cobras return all the Transformers to present-day Cybertron.\n\nBumblebee takes center stage in the third crossover series, as he, Grimlock, Arcee, and Perceptor are sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. Sporting his original alternate mode again, he is shown to have something of a crush on Arcee. When Cobra attacks the base, the Autobots help repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. Journeying to Cybertron to stop Serpentor, the mismatched group is ambushed first by Cannibalizers, then by Serpentor, Piranacon, Predaking and the Stunticons, with Bumblebee being badly injured as he runs right into Predaking's leg. He is then executed by Serpentor, who would later comment that Bumblebee's death is the only thing that ever really made him feel emotion. Despite the character being notoriously difficult to kill, it seems his death is permanent, as Serpentor comments that he felt something leave him, most likely his spark. A statue to his memory was seen in the final issue. His death would continue to have repercussions, as seen in the fourth series, in which Prime insists on journeying to Earth personally rather than expose any of his troops to the same fate.\n\nWhen Dreamwave Productions introduced their re-imagined version of Generation 1 continuity for the 21st Century, Bumblebee was present for the Autobots' new adventures once again. \"The War Within\", set in Cybertron's past, chronicled Bumblebee's early adventures in the Battle of Altihex and the defense of Iacon in the face of an attack by Shockwave.\n\nWhen Optimus Prime and Megatron vanish in an early spacebridge experiment, causing the Autobots and Decepticons to splinter into smaller factions, Bumblebee remains with the Autobots under Prowl's command.\n\nAs usual, Bumblebee is among the Transformers trapped in stasis aboard the crashed \"Ark\" who are reactivated on Earth in 1984. Although not depicted in fiction, the general events of the television series pilot seemed to take place in the Dreamwave continuity - with Bumblebee meeting and befriending Spike Witwicky.\n\nClassic Bumblebee was featured on the cover of \"Transformers Club Magazine\" #14.\n\nIn a possible future chronicled in the exclusive comic book available at BotCon 2005, Bumblebee featured as the espionage director of the Autobots. Having been on the trail of the Decepticon agent Flamewar for a long time, Bumblebee interrupts a communication between Flamewar and the Tripredacus Council and reveals that his agent, Ricochet, has installed a degenerative virus into Deathsaurus's clone army. With Flamewar now exposed, Bumblebee points out that she was nothing more than a liability to the Council, who blow her ship up.\n\nBased on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and \"Generation 2\" comics). Megatron has survived the crash of the \"Ark\" on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form, and now leads Ramjet, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream, and the Constructicons. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Grimlock, Jetfire, Mirage, and Rodimus (formerly Hot Rod).\n\nIn \"Crossing Over\", when the Cybertronians Skyfall and Landquake arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.\n\nBumblebee appears in the story \"\" in which he is among the reinforcements from Autobot City to respond to the Decepticon attack at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Once there, the Autobots are able to defeat the Decepticons, but during the fight the Autobots are exposed to refined Forestonite, which enhances and mutates Cybertronian systems. He gets enhanced to his \"Generation 2\" form.\n\nFall of 2005 was the third re-launch for the \"Transformers\" comic series, this time under the management of IDW Publishing.\n\nIDW's core universe was introduced with the six-issue mini-series, \"\", making it clear that the company's take on the Generation 1 universe was radically different. Bumblebee appears as a member of a small team of Autobots under the command of Prowl, operating in secret on Earth out of \"Ark-19\". Still a Volkswagen Beetle, he (like the other Autobots) possesses the added ability to generate a \"holo-matter\" avatar of a young female to masquerade as a driver and to otherwise interact with humans. Working with Ratchet and a trio of young humans to search an abandoned Decepticon base, Bumblebee is able to take down Skywarp during a Decepticon attack, out-thinking the Decepticon and shooting him out of the sky despite his teleportation system. After Blitzwing and Skywarp bring the base down, Bumblebee helps save the humans, despite commenting previously that they would be acceptable losses. As Megatron then engages the traitorous Starscream in battle, Bumblebee does what he does best by spying on the fight; almost shot by the Battlechargers, he is saved by Prowl and Jazz. In the follow-up, \"\", he is left to run the \"Ark-19\" on his own.\n\nBumblebee was among the Autobots who opposed the Decepticons serving the elder gods in the IDW Publishing \"Infestation 2: Transformers\" comic.\n\nBumblebee, voiced by Dan Gilvezan, appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play \"Bee for, Bee now\".\n\nBumblebee appears among the characters in \"Re-Unification\", the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic.\n\nBumblebee was one of eight playable characters in the 1986 Commodore 64 video game \"\".\n\nThe \"Classic\" toy line appeared in a simple Flash-based video game on the Hasbro web site called \"Transformers Battle Circuit\". In this one-on-one fighting game, players press the right and left arrow keys to try to overpower their opponent. Playable characters include Rodimus, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Jetfire, Starscream, Astrotrain, Trypticon, and Menasor. Optimus Prime and Megatron each appear as the boss the player must defeat to win the game.\n\nBumblebee appears in the 2003 video game \"Transformers\", voiced by Jack Merluzzi.\n\nBumblebee is one of the light-blue robots in the 2010 card game \"Monopoly Deal Transformers\".\n\nPopular Bumblebee-specific merchandise includes shirts and costumes based on the character.\nA parody of the \"Generation 1\" Transformers was aired in the December 23, 2008, episode of \"Frank TV\", called \"Frank the Halls\". In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots (Bumblebee, Jazz, and Wheeljack) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot Prius Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city.\n\nBumblebee appears in the \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Junk in the Trunk\". In the segment he is in, he is whipped by a towel used by Grimlock in the locker room and later appears at Optimus's bedside before he dies of prostate cancer.\n\nMaggie Simpson appeared as Bumblebee in one episode's opening sequence to \"The Simpsons\" alongside the rest of the Simpson family rendered as Autobots.\n\nBumblebee is a clone of the original Bumblebee.\n\nIn \"Flash Forward, Part 3\", Jhiaxus, seeking to create a new unified faction of Transformers, \"borrowed\" personality components, forestonite, Hi-Q, and blueprints from Quantum Laboratories. One of these Transformers was a clone of Bumblebee. Bumblebee, along with the other clones, were introduced to Pyro as a second generation of Transformers. In \"Flash Forward, Part 5\", Bumblebee and Mirage greeted a clone of Sideswipe, unaware the clone was actually the original Sideswipe. In \"A Flash Forward, Part 6\", Bumblebee, Mirage, and Ironhide confronted the escaping Autobots, but Pyro convinced them to return to Earth with him.\n\n\nA redeco of Go-Bot High Beam, transforming into a yellow sports car. He features through-axle construction for incredibly fast zipping on flat, smooth surfaces, and is compatible with many tracks and playsets from Hot Wheels and Matchbox. This figure was later repurposed as the second-generation Bumblebee. This mold was also used to make \"Robots in Disguise\" (2001) Crosswise and Nightracer.\n\nBumblebee is the Japanese name of Perceptor in \"\". The Mini-Con Sparkplug was also based on the original Bumblebee, while Hot Shot was in fact going to be named Bumblebee but had his name changed due to trademark reasons.\n\nA PVC figurine was made for Perceptor/Bumble, part of the tenth act of Super Collection Figures made by Takara. There are two versions: one in cartoon colors and one in a silver color scheme.\n\nBumblebee is a member of Rodimus's crew from \"\". He appears only in a flashback and looks exactly like his Generation 1 counterpart.\n\nLed by Rodimus, the crew left Cybertron 8,000 years ago and created a new home world on the planet Omnitron.\n\nBumblebee appears as one of the main Autobot characters in the live-action \"Transformers\" film series. He retains some elements from his Generation 1 design, such as the iconic horn-like pieces in his head, which are articulated in the films. The cautious but brave Bumblebee was given a different alternate mode from his original G1 incarnation, instead of a Volkswagen Beetle, he transforms into a rally yellow Chevrolet Camaro (the model year of which is upgraded in the first film). Director Michael Bay states in the special features of disc two of the first film's DVD release, that the change of Bumblebee's alternate mode was due to the fact that a Volkswagen Beetle reminded him of Herbie. Due to a battle injury, he is rendered effectively mute, and communicates through use of selected playback of radio and television signals. Though his original voice is restored at the end of the first \"Transformers\" film, he communicates solely through his radio in \"Revenge of the Fallen\", \"Dark of the Moon\" and \"Age of Extinction\". The biography for the Decepticon Hardtop figure states that he and Bumblebee are old rivals and it was not Megatron who damaged Bumblebee's vocal processor, but a shot from Hardtop's gun. This, however, is in almost direct opposition of the film's prequel.\n\nBay stated in an early interview that Bumblebee stands about , but the official guide to the \"Transformers\" video game says he is .\n\nThe vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz and Ratchet were put on display by General Motors at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.\n\nIn \"Hot Rod\" magazine's Nov. 2006 issue, Bumblebee was a feature article. Originally a worn-out 1969 Camaro, producers settled on a 1977 model. It is painted yellow with black stripes, primer and rust patches, riveted hood scoop, Cragar SS wheels up front, Eric Vaughn Real Wheels in the back, marine-grade vinyl seats, and even an eight-track player. The Camaro Concept model was built using a 2005 Holden Monaro by Saleen, with the body built from the same GM R&D molds that were used in the original 2006 Camaro Concept (the Monaro and Camaro share the same Zeta platform). Bumblebee is armed with a plasma cannon that is capable of selective fire. The 1977 Camaro movie vehicle was sold on eBay with a winning bid of U.S. $40,100.01.\n\nAs a tribute to the original form of Bumblebee, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle appears next to him at the car dealership. Bumblebee damages the Beetle in order to ensure that Sam purchases him. He also has a bee-shaped air freshener attached to his rear-view mirror with the words \"Bee-otch\". The air freshener was the subject of a lawsuit for $850,000 due to its alleged resemblance to another design.\n\nSince his conversion from 1977 Camaro to 2006 Camaro Concept, Bumblebee's alternate mode continues to evolve throughout the film series. In \"Revenge of the Fallen\", he sports a different set of alloy wheels (apparently, in the first two films are actually hubcaps made from composite to look like a set of wheel-disc brake) and a custom front bumper. For \"\" (now a Camaro SS), his color changes from yellow to amber with thicker black stripes that run across his hood, roof and trunk. In addition, he will have dark-colored rims and side mirrors, as well as a rear spoiler. Also, in Transformers Dark of the Moon, he has a stealth force battle mode in which he can use his weapons in car mode without fully transforming and still being able to seat a driver and passengers.\n\nSometimes he is also known as N.B.E.-02.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" named Bumblebee as their fourth-favorite computer-generated character.\n\nIn \"\" #1, back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee, and Cliffjumper are tasked to watch over the AllSpark at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, Megatron learns that Optimus has broken into his room and sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl, and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus Prime for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but while en route to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, Frenzy, Starscream, , and Thundercracker, under orders to kill them all. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4, Arcee, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz, and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots. Arcee and Bumblebee later spy on the building of the Decepticon starship \"Nemesis\".\n\nThe \"\" reveals that in the battle of Tyger Pax, Megatron's forces attack, searching for the All Spark. Bumblebee's squad (which includes Arcee) attempts to hold off the Decepticons, but are eventually overwhelmed. They are captured and tortured by Swindle, with Megatron intervening personally to torture Bumblebee for information. However, they refuse to speak long enough for Prime's secret plan to take effect—launching the AllSpark into outer space. Megatron attempts to pursue it, but Bumblebee stops him. An enraged Megatron rips Bumblebee's arms off and crushes his voice capacitor, promising to seize the AllSpark for himself eventually. Bumblebee recovers and is repaired, although his voice is damaged beyond repair. Bumblebee then volunteers to head into space to stop Megatron from acquiring the All Spark.\n\nEventually arriving on Mars in his protoform mode, Bumblebee then proceeds to Earth in 2003, his arrival tracked by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nUpon landing in New York City, Bumblebee assumes the form of a beat-up Chevrolet Camaro, all the while avoiding the agents of the government organization known as Sector 7, who refer to him as NBE-2 (or Non-Biological Extraterrestrial 2). Bumblebee then downloads information on Captain Archibald Witwicky. Arriving at the asylum where he had once been incarcerated, he finds it now a dilapidated ruin. Damaged by a pursuing Barricade, he then finds AllSpark-like emissions somewhere in New Mexico—unaware it is a trap set by Sector 7. However, their plan to capture him is thwarted when Starscream, Barricade and Blackout arrive. As the Decepticons shoot Sector 7's trap to pieces, Bumblebee escapes—unaware the Decepticons had let him go so that they could follow him and see what he knew about the All Spark. He is last seen in the series heading for Tranquility, Nevada—home of Captain Witwicky's descendant Sam.\n\nIn the comic adaptation of the film, Bumblebee downloads information on the internet about the Concept Camaro car and took on its form instead of driving past in a tunnel, as seen in the film.\n\nHe also appears in the official movie sequel comic called \"The Reign of Starscream\".\n\nIn \"\", the Autobots aid the human soldiers after the battle in Mission City, destroying the All Spark-powered machines that were created. After Ratchet finishes repairing Bumblebee's legs, a trailer is obtained for Optimus Prime to carry the remains of Jazz. The Autobots then leave Mission City before the Sector 7 personnel arrive to claim the remains of the Decepticons. About a month later, Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to the naval yard. Unknowingly they are spied on by Barricade, who transmits the information to Starscream.\n\nBumblebee appears in \"\" #1, where Barricade kidnaps Sam in order to flush out Bumblebee and learn where the AllSpark fragment is. Bumblebee saves Sam and fights Barricade, who escapes in the process.\n\nBumblebee appears in \"\" #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, , Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first, Breakaway is warned by to leave, but unwilling to give in, the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes.\n\nThe drone calling itself Brains runs into Bumblebee and Sam Witwicky in Philadelphia.\n\nNote: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in \"italics\".\n\n\"In \"Twilight's Last Gleaming Part 3\", Bumblebee attempts to take on Megatron in the Sector 7 base. Meanwhile, Mikaela attempts to free Optimus Prime, but she is attacked by Frenzy.\"\n\n\"Bumblebee appears in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called \"Return to Cybertron Part 1\". In this story, he is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron.\"\n\n\"Bumblebee returns in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called \"The Decepticon who Haunted Himself.\"\"\n\nBumblebee also appears in the prequel novel \"\". Here, it is revealed he could still communicate with the other Autobots via digital link. Bumblebee is part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the All Spark, and is described as one of the Autobots' best scouts. He is sent after the human vessel \"Ghost-1\" (reverse-engineered from studies of Megatron) to make contact, but is ambushed and forced underground by Starscream. Encountering giant rock-chewing worms, he is saved by Optimus Prime. Heading into the atmosphere once again, he and Ratchet took on Barricade, but are unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human vessel.\n\nAccording to his extended biography from the Target store-exclusive Robo-Vision web site, Hardtop came to Earth and discovered the Witwicky home before any of the other Decepticons, but was unable to attack the Witwickys because Bumblebee found him first and buried him under a hundred tons of rubble in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nBumblebee appears in the 2007 live-action \"Transformers\" movie, returning to his role as the friend of the Autobots' human ally – in this case, Sam Witwicky. Sam possesses the glasses of his great-great-grandfather Captain Archibald Witwicky, a famous explorer. Unknown to Sam, the glasses are engraved with the coordinates showing the location of the life-giving All Spark. Bumblebee is assigned to guard Sam from the Decepticons, and poses as a dilapidated 1977 Chevrolet Camaro as Sam and his father are buying a car for Sam. They eventually purchase Bumblebee, due in no small part to Bumblebee damaging every other car at the dealership to ensure his purchase. Later, Bumblebee drives away from Sam's home to summon the Autobots. Sam thinks Bumblebee is being stolen, and chases the car on his bike. Sam then witnesses Bumblebee transforming into robot mode and reports it to the police, who believe he is on drugs. Bumblebee returns to Sam house to come get him but he ran away from him which resulted a chase through town. After Sam gets attack by Barricade Bumblebee came to his and his crush Mikaela Banes, who followed Sam, rescue as was able to get them away. Bumblebee battle Barricade while Sam and Mikaela battle Frenzy where they both ended up being victorious, although they weren't killed just defeated them for a while. Bumblebee was able to earn Sam's trust, as he understood that he's doesn’t want to hurt them. When Mikaela criticizes the poor condition of Bumblebee's vehicle mode, he scans a passing Camaro Concept and transforms into the same model. Bumblebee then drives Sam and Mikaela to an alley where they meet the other Autobots as they properly introduced Bumblebee, due to his voice being damage in battle, to Sam and tells him that Bumblebee is his guardian also they explain why he talks through the radio. They return to Sam's house and retrieve the glasses, but a secret government organization, Sector 7, arrests Sam and Mikaela. The Autobots attempt to rescue them but Bumblebee is captured and taken by Sector 7. There he is tested/tortured by the Sector 7 scientists using electric shocks that appear to hurt him. Sam eventually negotiates his release. Bumblebee survives the massive battle at the film's climax, although he loses the use of his legs after helping Ironhide deflect missiles from Starscream. With Mikaela's aid, he is able to rejoin the battle supported by a tow truck (later confirmed to be the Autobot Longarm), and destroys Brawl. After the battle, Bumblebee is fully repaired and asks to stay with Sam and is granted permission from both Sam and Optimus Prime. He is later seen alongside Ironhide, Ratchet, and Optimus watching the sunset while Sam and Mikaela recline on his hood at the end of the movie.\n\nBumblebee is voiced by Mark Ryan in the films, but he mostly speaks with his radio, having had his voice processor damaged (though his actual voice squeaks and whines laboriously through much of the movie). He also speaks with quotes from television shows and movies, in a way similar to Wreck-Gar from the 1986 film and season three of the G1 cartoon series. Screenwriter Roberto Orci explained Bumblebee regained his voice through the regenerative laser Ratchet fires at his neck as they meet, and it eventually works its magic by the end of the film. He agreed this was not made clear. Frenzy is regenerated upon coming into contact with the All Spark, and so it is entirely plausible that Bumblebee's voice, along with his legs, is also healed by the AllSpark, though no mention of this is made in the film. It was said that making Bumblebee mute was to show that his bond with Sam went beyond words.\n\nBumblebee also appears in the film's sequel, \"\". When a fragment of the AllSpark inadvertently turns the kitchen appliances in Sam's home into feral robots, Bumblebee intervenes to save him and his family. In doing so, he nearly destroys their house. He still uses his radio to speak, despite his vocal processors being repaired in the first film. However, he does respond half-way when Sam tells him to get in the garage by saying \"whatever.\" Bumblebee shows excitement at the thought of going with Sam to college, only to be disappointed later when Sam tells him that he can not come. Because of the incident at the Witwickys' he is also forced to leave their garage. Soon after Sam begins his semester at college, Bumblebee follows him and tries to alert him to the Decepticon Pretender (named Alice) that is following Sam. As both Sam and Alice are riding inside Bumblebee, the Autobot attempts to warn Sam through his radio. Having failed at this, Bumblebee intentionally brakes hard multiple times and throws Alice around the interior in an attempt to damage the Pretender. Bumblebee then proceeds to spray lubricant over Alice, thereby embarrassing Sam and forcing Alice to flee.\n\nSoon after Megatron and begin to torture Sam, Bumblebee arrives alongside Optimus Prime to fight Megatron, Starscream and . After Optimus dies, Bumblebee arrives with , Ironhide and Ratchet to cover Sam's escape. As they mourn for Optimus, Sam tells Bumblebee that he has failed the Autobots, but Bumblebee tells Sam through his radio, ... \"You are the person I care for most in my life, and if there is anything you need I won't be far away...\" After taking Sam, Mikaela, Leo and Simmons to the Smithsonian museum to reawaken , Bumblebee then travels with the humans through a Space Bridge to Egypt (caused by Jetfire) along with Jetfire, the Twins and , and Wheelie to find the Matrix of Leadership. While the twins have a sibling argument (resulting in a fist fight) inside the ruins of Petra (which supposedly houses the Matrix when everyone thinks it is a dead end), Bumblebee breaks them up and tosses them out before seeing their fight. But once seeing the Tomb's entrance after the Twins' brawl reveals it, Bumblebee helps the humans enter it by blasting the rest of the wall off.\n\nDuring the final confrontational battle, Sam and Mikaela inadvertently spring a trap set by (who uses Sam's parents as the bait). Bumblebee stays hidden from Rampage's sight, allowing Sam to put Rampage in a spot where Bumblebee can initiate a surprise attack. During the subsequent fight attacks him from behind and jumps on his back. After a brief struggle, Bumblebee gets a hold of Ravage and literally tears him apart with his hands, allowing him to finish off and kill Rampage. With Sam's parents free, Sam tells Bumblebee to take care of them, thus removing him from most of the final fight. After Sam is killed by Megatron, Bumblebee arrives with Sam's parents and sees Sam's body on the ground, he is heartbroken, overcome with sadness and stricken with sorrow, believing that he has failed in his duty to protect Sam, but is overjoyed to see him return. Bumblebee is among the remaining Autobots at the end of the film.\n\nIn \"\", Bumblebee no longer lives with Sam and goes on other missions with the Autobots such as dismantling an illegal nuclear facility in the Middle East. This is the first time the stealth force upgrade is shown in the movie. When Sam arrives with Carly, Wheelie and Brains, Bumblebee saves them from the soldiers taking them captive. Bumblebee is reassigned to protect Sam and moves back in with him. Bumblebee later teams up with Sideswipe and Dino/Mirage to take out Hatchet. While Dino/Mirage clings on to hatchet with his grapplers, Bumblebee and Sideswipe shoot their stealth force weapons. While trying to protect Sentinel Prime, Bumblebee and the other Autobots are betrayed and attacked by him. Sentinel brutally kills Ironhide, but Bumblebee manages to escape. After Sentinel forces the Autobots' exile from Earth, Bumblebee sadly says goodbye to Sam, but reunites with him in Chicago where he helps him rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak. After Sam kills Starscream, Bumblebee saves him and Lennox from a great fall. Bumblebee is captured by Soundwave and is nearly executed in front of Sam (telling Sam \"We gave them a hell of a run\") after Barricade executes Que before Wheelie and Brains save him at the cost of their own lives, allowing him to break free and attack Soundwave. Bumblebee battles Soundwave while the other Autobots fight the other Decepticons and proves more than a match for the Decepticon spy-master, even managing to kill another Decepticon during the fight. Finally Bumblebee knocks Soundwave off-balance with a shot to the leg, knocks his sonic cannon from his hand and uppercuts his plasma cannon into his chest, firing at the same time, destroying Soundwave's head and killing him. Bumblebee fights Sentinel alongside the other Autobots and humans; he is no match for him, but avoids injury. After Sam kills Dylan Gould, Bumblebee destroys the Control Pillar by crashing through it, shutting off the Space Bridge and destroying Cybertron and the remaining Decepticons. Bumblebee survives the battle and gives Sam a bunch of gaskets to use as rings while playing wedding music after Sam and Carly admit they love each other. Though Sam says to Bumblebee that he's thinking too fast. He replies by 'saying', \"I'm just trying to help out.\" Ratchet compliments Bumblebee for his bravery.\n\nBumblebee returns in \"\". He has a new vehicle mode, a modified 1976 Chevrolet Camaro, before he scans a yellow 2014 Camaro and turns into a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept, because of this his robot mode has been changed as well and resembles one design of Bumblebee from the Generation 1 IDW comics. In the end of \"Age of Extinction\", Bumblebee assumed the Autobot leadership and protecting the Yeager family as Optimus blasts off to space along with the Seed, finding the mysterious Creators. Though Bumblebee mostly can't speak in the film and still relies on radio communication, he is shown to be able to express limited speech but in a more high-pitched voice, possibly meaning his voice box is healing.\n\nBumblebee returns in \"\", and is scheduled to appear in his spin-off film. In the former, he now displays the ability to separate and reassemble himself during combat, as shown when he battles the TRF soldiers in order to protect Cade. He is also revealed to have helped the United States Army Air Force to fight the Nazi Party during World War II, and transformed into a Mercedes-Benz 770. He also regained his voice during his battle with Optimus Prime.\n\nThe upcoming film \"Bumblebee\" will explore Bumblebee's past, taking place in 1987 where he takes form of a Volkswagen Beetle, a reference to his classic portrayal in G1. On scouting mission tasked by Optimus Prime but traumatized by his prior experiences, the film will focus on his growing friendship with a teenage girl named Charlie Watson, in addition to evading Sector 7 and going against Decepticon operatives Blitzwing, Shatter, and Dropkick.\n\nIn 1, Bumblebee and Ironhide are protecting NEST Command when two Decepticons, Soundwave and invade the area. Ironhide goes outside to deal with Bludgeon, while Soundwave ambushes Bumblebee from inside. Bumblebee is easily thrown down by Soundwave. Bumblebee tries to fire a shot from his shoulder gun, but Soundwave redirects the acoustic energy back at him. Bumblebee deduces that he cannot deflect several rounds at once, and begins rapidly firing at Soundwave. The Decepticon is not able to take in so much, and finally falls. Later, Bumblebee traps Soundwave in a magnetically sealed bubble in \"Cyber Missions 2\".\n\nBumblebee is a playable character, and is the most-used character in the Autobot campaign, where the character uses Bumblebee in nine missions in the Autobot campaign, out of the total 18. He is playable in both the old and new Camaro cars. Bumblebee also appears as a boss in the Decepticon campaign, with a radial blast attack.\n\nBumblebee is among the playable characters in the 2009 \"Revenge of the Fallen\" video game by Activision. \n\nThe film version of Bumblebee is playable in Hasbro's Net Jet \"Transformers\" fighting game \"Transformers Battle Universe\". Although other playable Transformers in the game have several incarnations featured, no other versions of Bumblebee are playable.\n\nBumblebee is among the characters who appear in the \"TRANSFORMERS CYBERVERSE Battle Builder Game\".\n\nBumblebee is one of the Autobots featured in \"\" at Universal Studios theme parks. In the ride, Bumblebee disembodies Ravage while Evac escapes from the Decepticon attack on N.E.S.T. headquarters. Towards the end of the ride, Bumblebee saves Evac from falling off a building after Evac kills Megatron with the AllSpark shard.\n\nBumblebee appears in the episode of \"Robot Chicken\" called \"Tell My Mom\", voiced by Seth Green. Sam Witwicky finds Bumblebee in Bobby Bolivia's used car lot and they go on an adventure, while Scooter is the only thing cheap in the lot. Bumblebee is portrayed as a fifth-generation Camaro.\n\nDuring the final battle of the 2017 \"Power Rangers\" film, the Red Ranger, while piloting his T-Rex Zord, accidentally steps on a yellow Camaro of a similar model as the live-action Bumblebee. He throws the car at an army of Putties and shouts, \"Sorry, Bumblebee!\" as the car makes impact.\n\nBumblebee appears in the \"Transformers Animated\" series in 2008 as a yellow hot hatch undercover police car (scanned from a vehicle driven by Detroit Police Captain Fanzone). The character of Bumblebee in \"Animated\" is described as a hot headed racing young Autobot who likes video games, making him more akin to \"Armada\" than the original Bumblebee. He does however retain the traditional warm-heartedness and human-friendly attitude of the original due to his friendship with and Bulkhead. Although considered childish and self-centered by many of his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee shows a loyal and caring side for his friends, and can be considered protective of Sari Sumdac, to the extent of blocking shots, blasts, and missiles from harming her. This was first shown in \"Transform and Roll Out! Part 3\" when he deflected a shot from Starscream that was aimed at Sari. The blast rendered him unconscious until Sari healed him with her Key. He is the kid-friendly character of the show.\n\nBumblebee has a retractable face plate he uses when he goes into combat and a retractable weapon (called \"energy stingers\") in both hands. He can use the wheels on his feet in robot mode as motorized roller blades.\n\nIn the Japanese translation of \"Transformers Animated\", the story has been changed to make it a prequel to the 2007 \"Transformers\" live-action film. This makes this version of Bumblebee an earlier version of the film character.\n\nIn the episode \"Autoboot Camp\", Bumblebee has flashbacks to his days as an Autobot trainee. During training, he met Bulkhead, Longarm, Ironhide, and Wasp. The group was under the command of Drill Sergeant Sentinel Minor, who gave Bumblebee his name (after calling him a \"bumbler\"). Bumblebee would often say or do the wrong thing, resulting in the entire platoon receiving Transformation push-ups as a result, which made him unpopular with Wasp and Ironhide. One day, Bumblebee heard someone communicating with Megatron. Believing the traitor to be Wasp, Bumblebee (with help from Longarm) discovered evidence in Wasp's locker. For discovering the traitor, Sentinel was prepared to give Bumblebee Elite Guard membership. However, Bumblebee gave up that chance by taking the rap for Bulkhead, who had previously knocked a building onto Sentinel, and was about to be removed from training, joining his new friend as a Space Bridge technician. Bulkhead and Bumblebee were assigned to a Space Bridge repair ship under the command of Optimus Prime, along with Ratchet. Both he and Bulkhead were the first to encounter Prowl before he joins their group.\n\nIn the series finale, during a rescue mission to save Arcee, who was on the moon, Bumblebee manages to settle the score with Shockwave before he and Bulkhead put him under arrest. After the Autobots learn of Prowl's ultimate sacrifice, they take the sparkless body of Prowl and the captured Megatron, Lugnut, and Shockwave to Cybertron. On their arrival home, they are greeted and cheered on by the other Autobots for their victory over the evil and malevolent leader of the Decepticons.\n\nBumblebee appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play \"Bee in the City\", voiced by Bumper Robinson. In this story Professor Sumdac attempted to create a teleportation system to get the Autobots to Cybertron, but an interaction with Sari's key ended up transporting Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Sari to Transtech Cybertron, where they met Flareup and his friends were detained by Shockwave while he was deemed not a threat. Bumblebee teamed up with transformer named \"Joe\" to help him and Flareup get their friends. But after Joe exposed himself as a Megatron and uses Sari's key to create an army to begin a reign of terror, Bumblebee pointed out the world's bureaucratic nature that resulted in a mutiny. Afterwards the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension.\n\nSet shortly after the events of \"Total Meltdown\" is the \"Transformers: Animated\" comic issue #2 by IDW Publishing. In it, Bumblebee and Prowl apprehend the Angry Archer as the villain attempts to steal money from a used car salesman. In doing so, they reveal the holographic trickery of the Detroit superhero known as The Wraith. With the secret of his power revealed, The Wraith loses much of the respect he used to command in Detroit. The Wraith attempts to stop Cyrus \"The Colossus\" Rhodes from escaping prison, but is unable to fool the villain now that the secret is public, forcing the Autobots to stop Rhodes and making The Wraith look foolish. The Wraith then attempts to discredit Bumblebee at a college football game by trapping the Autobot with a car boot and using his holograms to make a fake Bumblebee attack the stadium. Bumblebee eventually escapes and the other Autobots help capture The Wraith before having him placed in a mental institution.\n\nBumblebee is one of the five playable characters in the 2008 \"Transformers Animated\" video game for the Nintendo DS.\n\nIn the \"Transformers: Timelines\" series, Goldbug is an evil alternate reality version of Bumblebee.\n\nAccording to his official biography, Goldbug was once a young drifter known as Bumblebee. He survived on the streets of Polyhex with no real purpose. He became skilled at sneaking around, stealing, eavesdropping and blackmailing. He eagerly joined the Autobots in hopes of finding a place to belong and where his unsavory activities would be tolerated. When the war began, Bumblebee showed extreme bravery in battle and often sought ways to be noticed by command. In time, he worked his way up the ranks of the Autobots and when the Autobot Seeker Drench was destroyed, Bumblebee was offered an upgraded form and a new identity as Goldbug, to take his place.\n\nGoldbug is paranoid that one of his fellow Autobots will betray him and try to take his place, as he did to his former superiors.\n\nThe Botcon 2008 set was chosen as the \"Action Figure Digest Hot Pick.\"\n\nGoldbug appears in the 2008 April Fool's comic \"Shattered Expectations\" by Fun Publications.\n\nGoldbug appears as a member of Optimus Prime's forces in the \"Transformers: Timelines\" story \"Shattered Glass.\" Goldbug and Blurr report to Optimus Prime the rumors that Megatron is planning an attack. When the Decepticons attack the Ark launch site Blurr, Goldbug and Rodimus compete for who could destroy the most Decepticons, but thanks to Cliffjumper the Decepticon attack is successful.\n\nGoldbug appears in the fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", a text-based story. He is among the Autobots who attack the Decepticons at the Arch-Ayr fuel dump. He is later sent to capture rogue Dinobots for the Autobots. He is part of the group that captures Swoop.\n\nIn \"Do Over\" Goldbug conspires with Rodimus to take over the Autobots. Together they steal the Ark, evicting any crew members who are loyal to Optimus Prime before blasting off to Earth. The Ark then crashes on Earth.\n\nGoldbug is among the Autobots brought back online. He initially commands a small group of Autobots who find Rodimus. After losing a fight with Rodimus for leadership Goldbug participates in the attack on Burpleson Air Force Base.\n\nBumblebee is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer-animated series \"\". Bumblebee is younger than most of the Autobots, and lost his voice box thanks to Megatron during the Great War. Bumblebee remains more playful than the other Autobots despite his lack of voice, and has come to rely on his speed as his most valuable asset in battle. Bumblebee is extremely similar to his movie counterpart, sharing the similar vehicle and robot forms, the same lack of voice, and his close relationship to a human boy. It is also revealed in the series finale episode \"Deadlock\" that Bumblebee's mouth was covered by a face plate vaguely resembling that of Optimus Prime's that helped him to create the alternative beeping noises he uses as his main form of communication throughout the series. Later in the series he changes his color scheme by reversing the colors, resembling Bumblebee's original 1976 paint scheme in the 2014 \"Age of Extinction\" film.\n\nBumblebee returns as the central character of the sequel series \"\", with Will Friedle reprising his role. Set five years after the events of \"Prime\", Bumblebee becomes the leader of a group of Autobots and they return to Earth to fight a new generation of Decepticons, when the re-emerge on the planet after a prison ship crash. A constant running gag throughout the first season is Bumblebee's inability to come up with a decent command for his team to mobilize, in the vein of Optimus Prime's famous order to \"roll out\". Bumblebee retains a similar vehicle mode as he did in \"Prime\", now a 1992 Chevrolet Camaro (And in the films Bumblebee is a Camaro) however, his robot mode has gone through a serious redesign. Notably retaking his original primarily yellow color scheme rather than the dominantly black one he took at the end of \"Prime\".\n\nBumblebee appears in the novels \"Transformers: Exodus\" and \"\".\n\nBumblebee losing his voice was the focus of the short story \"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\" By Alex Irvine.\n\nBumblebee appears as a playable character in the 2010 video game \"\". In the Autobot campaign, he is first seen racing across the war-torn streets of Iacon in search of . Upon rendezvousing with Optimus, he relays the message of Zeta Prime's death at the hands of ; after which, he joins Optimus and in their resistance against the Decepticons on the planet. He later appears in the final level of the game, where Bumblebee teams up with Optimus and Ironhide to prevent the Decepticon Titan, Trypticon from destroying Iacon.\n\nIn \"\", the sequel to \"War for Cybertron\", players start as Bumblebee in the first level. He appears throughout the game as well.\n\nWith the exception of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee is the only character to appear in all three TV shows set within the Aligned Continuity, including \"\" and \"\". Frank Welker recorded actual words written for Bumblebee which were later replaced with sound effects. When Bumblebee regains his voice, it's provided by actor, Will Friedle.\n\nBumblebee appears in the pilot episode of the series responding too late to a call for help from Cliffjumper, who is captured by the Decepticons and killed. Bumblebee soon is assigned to be Raf Esquivel's guardian, having grown close to the boy as he understands his language of beeps. In the \"Operation: Bumblebee\" two-parter, Bumblebee lost his transformation cog and its ability to have him transform before eventually retrieving the cog from human terrorist group M.E.C.H. and Starscream.\n\nBumblebee's goal in the series is to be promoted to warrior class, as he first states in \"Masters & Students\", however, Optimus does not believe him to be worthy of promotion at such a young age. Nevertheless, Bumblebee shows he is still a capable warrior, since he is able to fight the likes of Breakdown and Shockwave. When questioned by Smokescreen in \"Project Predacon\", Bumblebee admits he is holding back so that he can one day be promoted to warrior class on Cybertron.\n\nIn \"Deadlock\", during the final battle aboard the \"Nemesis\", Bumblebee tries to give Optimus Prime the Star Saber for him to fight Megatron, but is killed by the Decepticon. However, Bumblebee fell into the ship's Omega Lock and exposure to the Synthetic Energon powering it both revived him and restored his voice. As Megatron prepared to finish Optimus, Bumblebee used the Star Saber to stab him in his spark, killing him. Afterwards, once the Omega Lock restored Cybertron, Bumblebee gives Raf a goodbye before leaving for his home world where he is finally promoted to warrior class during the series finale \"Predacons Rising\". However, things quickly turn for the worse when Unicron appears on Cybertron in Megatron's body, and two new Predacons are cloned by Shockwave. With Optimus on a mission to retrieve the AllSpark, and Ultra Magnus having been severely wounded by the new Predacons, Bumblebee becomes Autobot leader at Ratchet's encouragement as he leads them, the newly defected Knock Out and the three Predacons in making a stand against Unicron's undead Predacon army at the Well of All Sparks, buying enough time for Optimus to return to defeat Unicron. Optimus reveals that he must sacrifice himself to restore the AllSpark to Cybertron's core, and does not pass on leadership to any one person present, stating that leadership will now be earned through actions. Bumblebee promises to keep the peace on Cybertron to Optimus, implying Bumblebee to be the new leader of the Autobots, and by extension, Cybertron's new age.\n\nBumblebee appears as the main character of the sequel series \"\", with Will Friedle reprising his role. In the series, Bumblebee is called to Earth when a new generation of Decepticons re-emerges on the planet. After receiving a vision from Optimus Prime, Bumblebee travels to Earth via a spacebridge and discovers that a ship full of Decepticon criminals has crashed on Earth and its inmates have escaped. Initially believing that Optimus' mission is intended for him alone, Bumblebee ends up with a team of ragtag Autobots, including a rebel bad boy bot named Sideswipe, a hyper active Mini-Con named Fixit, the bombastic ex-Decepticon and Dinobot Grimlock, and an Elite Guard female cadet named Strongarm, in order to combat the Decepticons. After befriending humans Denny and his son Russell and fighting the Chompazoid Underbite, the group is greeted by the inexplicably corporeal Optimus. Unable to explain his return, Optimus expresses his confidence in Bumblebee and his new team before departing.\n\nWhile leading the team, to recapture the escaped Decipticons, they come across Steeljaw, an escaped convict who has his own plan to lead the other escaped convicts. The Autobots would later receive a visit from Bumblebee's old comrade Jazz, who informed Bumblebee that his actions in departing Cybertron had angered the high council. After helping apprehend a fugitive named Ped, Jazz volunteered to return to Cybertron and inform the council of what had taken place. The team then received another group of Cybertronian visitors, in the form of Autobot bounty hunter Drift, Decepticon bounty hunter Fracture, and their Mini-Con teammates. Both Cybertronians arrived to collect a bounty placed on Bumblebee by the High Council for his actions, but Drift was convinced of Bumblebee's nobility after Bee saved his life. The team managed to defeat Fracture, and though his ship was lost they gained the use of his ground bridge.\n\nAfter all of them but Grimlock and Fixit were given Decepticon Hunters, Bee and his team would then be forced to deal with Steeljaw's gang again—now including Thunderhoof, Underbite, and Fracture and his Mini-Cons—as both pursued the Decepticon fugitive Clampdown. Bee's team managed to capture all the Decepticons, but were forced to let them escape when Steeljaw broke free and set an unmanned garbage barge loose in the path of a riverboat.\n\nDrift and his Mini-Cons would later return to Earth and subsequently join the team. The team continued to capture escaped convicts. Bumblebee was once again contacted by Optimus with further warnings, shortly before Steeljaw and his pack managed to briefly seize the scrapyard; however, the Autobots managed to recover their base. The team soon gained another new ally in the form of the Primus-chosen female Autobot warrior Windblade, who aided the team in securing the fugitives Razorpaw and Zizza before departing.\n\nUnfortunately for Bumblebee and his team, the threat that Optimus had warned them of soon revealed itself as Megatronus, a disgraced member of the Thirteen. Having struck a deal with Steeljaw's pack, Megatronus instructed them to construct several devices he needed, which they did after capturing Strongarm, Sideswipe, and the returning Windblade. Bumblebee led the remainder of his team against them, only for Optimus arrive shortly before Megatronus made his appearance. Deferring to his former commander, Bumblebee became more concerned with Optimus' well-being and leadership than trusting in his own previous experiences. Fortunately, his team rallied behind him and gave him the courage to stand firm, which enabled them to capture Steeljaw's Pack after the would-be Decepticon tyrant was ejected from the battle by Megatronus. The Autobots then fought to prevent Megatronus from destroying both Earth and Cybertron, and managed it after discovering the latent powers of Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm's Decepticon Hunters used in tandem and copying the sword form of Optimus' Prime Decepticon Hunter. With Megatronus defeated and possibly eliminated, the Autobots departed for home, with Bumblebee at last finding his rallying cry: \"Rev up and roll out!\"\n\nWith Megatronus defeated and most of the Pack apprehended, Bumblebee questioned whether his fellow Autobots wished to remain with him on Earth. To a one they agreed, with Windblade and Optimus formally joining the team, though Optimus did so as Bumblebee's equal rather than his superior. Turning their attention to Decepticon fugitives still scattered around the globe, Bumblebee decided to split his team by dispatching Drift, his Mini-Cons, and Windblade to seek out Decepticons in other locations while the rest of the team remained at the scrapyard. At their own insistence Optimus and Sideswipe joined the team, which ended up stranded in the Arctic after Optimus' altered state damaged their Groundbridge. Unfortunately, the remainder of the team soon had to deal with another problem: Overload, a Decepticon who had previously infiltrated the Autobot ranks and caused Bumblebee to suffer serious injuries, greatly embittering the former scout.\n\nBumblebee became consumed with bringing Overload in, even after the Mini-Con fugitives Backtrack and Ransack were freed during their initial battle; the two Mini-Cons subsequently joined forces with Overloard.\n\nBumblebee appears in the episode \"Bumblebee to the Rescue\", where he helps the Rescue Bots and their human partners investigate a fallen meteor. Optimus Prime briefly assigns Bumblebee to observe how the Rescue Bots and the Burns family work together. Cody and the rest of the Burns family are unable to understand Bumblebee and requires one of the Rescue Bots to translate. The Rescue Bot Blades also happens to be a big fan of Bumblebee (who is said to be a legendary scout and war hero by the Rescue Bots). When Heatwave, Boulder, and Chase are infected by a substance contained in the meteor, Bumblebee, Blades, and the Burns family work together to destroy the meteor and obtain a sample in a hope to find a cure. Bumblebee and Blades successfully destroy the meteor and retrieve the sample, but at the cost of being infected as well, but thankfully the Burnses use an analysis of the meteor sample Bumblebee found, They are able to find a cure in the Autobots database, curing Bumblebee and the Rescue Bots. At the end of the episode, Cody is revealed to have learned how to understand Bumblebee. Before leaving, Bumblebee asks the Burnses (with Cody acting as interpreter) if they can take a picture of him and Blades.\n\nBumblebee returns with Optimus Prime in \"It's a Bot Time\" and \"Bots to the Future\", where they go back in time to save the Rescue Bots from Dr. Morocco. They return to an alternate present with Dr. Morocco ruling Griffin Rock. They fight Morbots, while the Rescue Bots go into the city. They find out they left Dilther behind, which is how the Morbot army exists. They go back in time to take him back to the present, which is then changed back to the regular timeline. Bumblebee later returned in \"Odd Bot Out\", where he was sent to search for a missing Cybertronian artifact on Griffin Rock while Optimus searched the nearby seafloor. To the dismay of his biggest fan Blades, Bumblebee teamed up with Dani, who was temporarily unable to pilot Blades due to her pilot's license expiring.\n\nBumblebee is an Autobot warrior, and is based on the \"Generation 1\" version of the character.\n\nKreon Bumblebee appeared in the animated shorts \"Last Bot Standing\", \"Bot Stars\", \"My Ride is Better Than Your Ride\", \"The Big Race\", \"A Gift for Megatron\", \"Megatron's Revenge\", and \"Quest for Energon, Part 1\".\n\nKre-O Bumblebee appears in the flash video game \"Kre-O Transformers Konquest\". In this game Kreon Optimus Prime attempts to avoid bombs and collect parts to rebuild Kre-O Ratchet, Mirage, Prowl, and Bumblebee.\n\nIn the 10th installment of the Angry Birds series, Angry Birds Transformers Bumblebee appears. Here he is portrayed by Chuck (Better known as \"Yellow Bird\"). Bumblebee/Chuck will have two variations, one which is yellow with black stripes based on his pre-Age of Extinction look. And one that is based on his Age of Extinction appearance. Both resemble a Dodge Challenger in vehicle mode.\n\nBumblebee is one of the main characters of \".\"\n"}

The six men were drawn by way of raffle to make up three first-round fights. The winners of these three fights progressed to the next round along with one of the losers who would be granted a golden ticket again by way of raffle. The winners of the two second-round fights would progress to the final and a winner crowned.\n\nThe fight card was made up of a mix of amateur undercard fights and the professional six-man tournament which was the main event. The main event was won by English fighter Aaron Lambourne who returned via the golden ticket system following a first-round loss after a battle with local man Mervyn Mullholland.\n\nFrom the outset of the Cage Contender project Ferguson stated that he would first achieve a broadcast deal then go on to become the Irish market leader. Many thought that this was nonsense given that he had no experience within either the television or MMA industries. The first part of his claim became reality at Cage Contender 4 in May 2010 when Cage Contender was broadcast for the first time in Ireland and the UK.\n\nIts status as Irish market leader was confirmed on 24 July 2010 when Cage Contender 5 became the biggest non UFC event ever in Ireland being broadcast in 56 countries while 3500 fans packed Dublin's National Basketball Arena to witness the biggest Bantamweight fight in European MMA history between Paul McVeigh and Artemij Sitenkov.\n\nOn 28 August 2010 Cage Contender had its first event outside Ireland when welterweights Gunnar Nelson and Danny Mitchell headlined Cage Contender 6 at the Altrincham Leisure Centre in Manchester, England.\n\nGunnar Nelson also headlined Cage Contender 12 against Alexander Butenko on 25 February 2012 at Dublins' National Basketball Arena. The fight made a milestone in Nelson's native country of Iceland as it was the first ever MMA event to be shown live on Icelandic television. The Nordic fans got to see Nelson submit Butenko in the first round and few months later sign a deal with the UFC.\n\nCage Contender was the first MMA promotion in Europe where fans were able to bet on the outcome of the fights in a historic team-up with Irish bookmaking chain Boyle Sports. This historic event led the way to more mainstream betting on MMA promotions in Europe.\n\nCage Contender features a mix of Irish talent combined with many UFC veterans to give wider commercial appeal.\n\nIn December 2012 Cage Contender returned to its tournament-style roots with the £10,000 Cage Contender Fight Stars event in Liverpool, England. This tournament was won by The Ultimate Fighter veteran and former Royal Marine Commando Martin Stapleton.\n\n2013 saw Cage Contender sign international fighter Paul Daley to compete at Cage Contender 16 in Dublin, Ireland.

An enhanced port entitled Super Chariot was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 10, 2018, and will include the Royal Gadget Pack DLC.\n\n\"Chariot\" differs from most traditional Platform game as the objective is to lug around an object, the Chariot, to the end of each level. To do so, the players have to use physics-based mechanics such as pushing and pulling, adding a layer of Puzzle to the game.\n\n\"Chariot\" chronicles a princess' quest to fulfill her recently deceased father's final wishes and bury him in peace. As might be expected of royalty, his last request is that he be laid to rest with as much wealth as possible.\n\nThe entire game can be played solo or with a partner. The king's body is in a coffin and attached to it are four wheels. The player's character can push the chariot up and down small hills or attach a rope to pull it along. The rope can be extended or shortened to adequately maneuver the chariot throughout the environment. Everything behaves as it should, with real physics playing a big part in how things move.\n\nOn Metacritic, \"Chariot\" scores an average metascore of 76 on PlayStation 4, Wii U and PC and 73 on Xbox One. It achieved a 8.5 from Destructoid, as \"a memorable game that's hard not to like and recommend to others.\"\n"}

The compiled list was the subject of media attention around the time of its release.\n\nThe list contains 165 suggestions, including a single suggestion for all songs by Rage Against the Machine as well as certain songs recorded by multiple artists (for example \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" by Guns N' Roses and the original version by Bob Dylan). In some cases, only certain versions of songs were included on the list. For example, the cover of \"Smooth Criminal\" by Alien Ant Farm is on the list while the original Michael Jackson recording is not. Similarly, J. Frank Wilson's version of \"Last Kiss\" is included, but Pearl Jam's cover is not. Also, Martha and the Vandellas's original version of \"Dancing in the Street\" and Van Halen's version are included; David Bowie and Mick Jagger's recording was excluded from the list. Also, the song \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" by Peter, Paul, and Mary is included, but the version by the song's composer John Denver is not.

{"id": "720170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=720170", "title": "Comedian (comics)", "text": "Comedian (comics)\n\nThe Comedian (Edward Morgan Blake) is a fictional character, a superhero/anti-hero featured in the acclaimed 1986 comic book series \"Watchmen\", published by DC Comics. He was created by \"Watchmen\" writer Alan Moore and illustrator Dave Gibbons, although, like all characters in the series, he was based on a Charlton Comics character, in this case Peacemaker, created by writer Joe Gill and artist Pat Boyette.\n\nThe story of \"Watchmen\" starts with the aftermath of Edward Blake's murder in 1985. Fellow crimefighter Rorschach, independently investigating the murder, discovers that Blake was in fact The Comedian. The main plot of \"Watchmen\" initially involves Rorschach's suspicion of a plot to kill costumed heroes (\"masks\"); his continuing investigation into Blake's murder leads to a much larger, more horrifying secret. The Comedian appearances in \"Watchmen\" consist of flashbacks of the other characters, as well mentions in \"Under The Hood\", the fictional autobiography of Hollis Mason (Nite Owl I) that appears in \"Watchmen\" issues 1-3.\n\nThe Comedian was a cigar-chomping, gun-toting vigilante-turned-paramilitary agent. When he first became a costumed adventurer in 1939, he dressed in a clown-like costume with a simple domino mask. A brutal vigilante, Blake manages to expunge most organized crime from the New York harbor. He became the youngest member of The Minutemen, a prominent group of heroes. After a photography shoot, he attempts to rape fellow Minuteman Silk Spectre; she escapes only when another Minuteman, Hooded Justice, interrupted the assault and beat Blake, breaking his nose. The Comedian was expelled from the group—but Silk Spectre's agent persuaded her not to press charges against him for fear of what it would do to the group's image. He impregnated Silk Spectre with her daughter and successor, Laurie, during a secret, consensual encounter years later. In the 1940s, Blake updated his Comedian uniform, after being stabbed by a small-time hood. He adopted a leather outfit that served as light body armor, adorned with short star-and-stripe-themed sleeves and a small happy face button. He retained the small domino mask and began carrying a pistol. He fought in World War II, becoming a war hero in the Pacific theater. It is also implied, but not directly stated, that he murdered Hooded Justice in revenge for the beating he suffered.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Blake had begun working as a covert government operative. Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, had published his autobiography \"Under the Hood\" by this point and in it disclosed the Comedian's sexual assault on Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre. In 1966, he was invited to join the Crimebusters by Captain Metropolis, but he quickly ruined the older hero's hopes of a new team by mocking him, and pointing out that old fashioned crime fighting methods would not save the world from nuclear war.\n\nAlongside Doctor Manhattan, the Comedian played a major role in the United States' war with Vietnam. Shortly after Manhattan's godlike powers forced the North Vietnamese to surrender, Blake was confronted by his lover, a pregnant Vietnamese woman; she is referred to as \"Liao Lin\" in David Hayter's \"Watchmen\" draft. He told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country immediately without her, and in a rage she slashed his face with a broken bottle. Blake shot and killed her, but the attack left his face permanently disfigured with a scar running from his right eye to the corner of his mouth. After this incident, he began wearing a leather gimp-style mask when dressed as the Comedian.\n\nThe costumed adventurers faced massive backlash and rioting in 1977; in response, Congress passed the Keene Act, requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active. The majority of them \"retired\" in anonymity; while others, such as Rorschach, continued their activities in open defiance of the law. Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian were two of the few who registered and were employed by the government. Blake enjoyed his new role in the government and the protection it offered, even going so far as to suggest to members of President Nixon's staff that he had killed Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein before they could reveal the details of the Watergate scandal, as well as being behind the execution of John F. Kennedy (on Nixon's orders). The Iran hostage crisis in 1980 was resolved when Blake freed the captives after an assault.\n\nIt was during his return from a government mission that Blake discovered the island where Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias) was conducting his experiments that would ultimately destroy New York City. Shocked and appalled by what he finds, Blake realizes that no one will believe him if he reveals Veidt's plan. Veidt, to ensure that Blake does not compromise his operation, confronts Blake in his high-rise apartment and throws Blake out the window, killing him.\n\nIn \"Before Watchmen: The Minutemen\" #1, additional details are revealed about Comedian while material from the main story is somewhat retconned. It is revealed that the Comedian got his start as a costumed adventurer at the young age of sixteen and had a prior criminal record for assault. Unlike the rest of the costumed heroes of the Minutemen, he is shown to be driven by greed and an inherent love for violence. In particular, he assaults a bartender after breaking up a bar fight and steals liquor and money from the cash register. The issue also implies Blake may have been a victim of severe child abuse as he claims that a \"caseworker\" told him what he suffered was the cause of his violent outbursts, though Blake's status as an unreliable narrator makes the claim uncertain.\n\n\"Before Watchmen: Comedian\" #1 rewrites the character's back-story further. It is revealed that Blake was close personal friends with Robert Kennedy and John F. Kennedy as well as Jackie Kennedy. This contradicts the main \"Watchmen\" series, which cast Edward Blake as a close personal friend of Richard Nixon (for whom he had worked as an assassin). The mini-series reveals that Blake was responsible for the murder of Marilyn Monroe (ordered by Jackie Kennedy, behind her husband's back) as well as revealing that, despite strong innuendo from both Blake and Ozymandias, that he did not kill John Kennedy and was attempting to confront Moloch when he found the villain watching the live coverage of the assassination, including Kennedy's death, which caused the two foes to commiserate in their grief.\n\nIn the sequel \"Doomsday Clock,\" Comedian turns up alive when he confronts Ozymandias at the time when he was in the DC Universe meeting with Lex Luthor. It turned out that Comedian survived his fall from his apartment window and washes ashore outside the city where he is greeted by Doctor Manhattan. Comedian continues on the trail of Mime and Marionette. Comedian catches up to Joker, Mime, and Marionette when they attend an underground villain meeting held by Riddler to discuss the Superman Theory. He makes himself known by shooting Typhoon in the face. While pursuing them, he evades Giganta's attacks, shoots Riddler in the leg, and uses a grenade to defeat the other villains present. When Mime and Marionette are in bed together the next morning, Comedian catches up to them where he plans to use them to find Ozymandias. Before Comedian can do anything, Joker comes to Mime and Marionette's rescue where he uses a joy buzzer on Comedian. As Batman gets free and fights Joker, Mime and Marionette escape with Comedian and the Lantern Battery.\n\nIn the comic, Rorschach explains that Blake's moniker of \"The Comedian\" stems from his cynical and arguably selfish world perspective that \"in an insane world\", one can only laugh, as if everything is \"a joke\".\n\nThe Comedian was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant in excellent physical condition, even at the time of his death at the age of 61. Blake was proficient with his M1911 .45 caliber pistol, MAC-10 submachine gun and pump-action shotgun, and was shown using a variety of conventional weaponry in his adventures (flamethrowers, grenade launchers, etc.). His government-sanctioned activities suggest that he received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare.\n\nThroughout the work, the Comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the \"smiley face\" button which is closely associated with him, and has become the iconic symbol of the Watchmen series as a whole. At the beginning of the series, the button is smeared with a single drop of blood which, if the button is viewed as a clock face, is at the position of the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock at the time of the series, five minutes to midnight.\nJeffrey Dean Morgan portrays the character in the film based upon the series. Morgan commented on the brutality of The Comedian's character, and implied that the scene involving the murder of the Vietnamese woman would be included in the movie, as he does appear to have gained his facial scar due to the event. However, the scar does not connect to his mouth in the film, taking away the visually symbolic \"smile\" present in the comics. Prior to Morgan being cast, Ron Perlman, Dennis Farina, Mel Gibson, and Gary Busey were considered for the role. In David Hayter's \"Watchmen\" script draft The Comedian was born in 1944 and he dies in 2005.\n"}

It was released September 1, 2011 for iOS devices, and serves as the sequel to DrawRace. It is played by drawing an ideal racing line on the game's screen with a finger. The car then follows this line during a race. The game was well received by critics, and holds a four stars rating and an average score of 88/100 at review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n\"DrawRace 2\" is a racing game in which the player predetermines their vehicle's route around a given track by drawing an ideal racing line. The entire course is seen from a top down perspective, similar to the 1986 arcade game \"Super Sprint\". The game includes 30 tracks, 16 cars and 180 challenges for players to complete. Leaderboards and leagues are also included. Multiplayer can be played with 2-4 players.\n\nIt differs from most top-down racers in that players use their finger to draw the route their car will take for all given laps. Players can draw faster or slower to have the car accelerate and brake once the race begins. Once all laps are drawn by the player the race begins, and the player's vehicle will follow the drawn path, taking into account the speed at which the player drew the route. During the actual race players can control a turbo boost button to give their car an increase in speed. This boost recharges over time.\n\n\"DrawRace 2\" was released September 1, 2011 for iOS devices. On November 8, 2011 a free version entitled \"DrawRace 2 Free Multiplayer\" was released.

The site also reports five media outlets gave the game perfect scores: AppSpy, Slide to Play, AppSmile, TouchGen, and Vandal Online. The lowest score came from PocketGamer France's reviewer, who gave the game a 68% approval rating. The game was the top seller the week of its release in several European countries, and placed in the top ten in more than 45 countries.

He further stated that while the control scheme probably would not \"evolve the racing genre\", it worked well for touchscreen devices. In \"Metro\"'s review of the game critic Roger Hargreaves called it \"the most addictive and enjoyably infuriating turn-based game of the year.\" Hargreaves cited the large amount of content, multiplayer features, and presentation as high points of the game. Toby Moses of \"The Guardian\" also praised the game. He stated that it was an improvement over the original \"DrawRace\", and felt that it \"could well be the must-have app of the year.\"\n\nSlide to Play's Andrew Webster felt the game was a major improvement over its predecessor. He called it \"a more fleshed out and expansive experience\". Eurogamer's Kristan Reed thoroughly enjoyed the game — so much so that it prompted a change the site's mobile review format.

The first official Eurovision transmission took place on 6 June 1954. It showed the Narcissus Festival in Montreux, Switzerland. It has a radio counterpart in Euroradio.\n\nThe name \"Eurovision\" was originally coined by British journalist George Campey when writing for the \"Evening Standard\", and was adopted by the EBU for its network.\n\nEurovision is managed by the European Broadcasting Union’s Eurovision Operations Department and offers permanent coverage of Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as ad-hoc coverage of the African continent and the Pacific Rim.\n\nNot confined only to Europe, Eurovision currently encompasses 75 television broadcasting organizations located in 56 countries of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Furthermore, there are 61 associated broadcasting organizations in Europe, Africa, America, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nThe EBU in co-operation with the respective host broadcaster, organises competitions and events in which its Members can participate, if they wish to do so. These include:\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest () is an annual international song competition, that was first held in Lugano, Switzerland, on 24 May 1956. Seven countries participated – each submitting two songs, for a total of 14. This was the only contest in which more than one song per country was performed: since 1957 all contests have allowed one entry per country. The 1956 contest was won by the host nation, Switzerland. In this competition, only countries that are members of the EBU can participate. The first winner was Switzerland, and the most recent is Israel with a new voting system.

{"id": "637882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=637882", "title": "Frank Farian", "text": "Frank Farian\n\nFrank Farian (born Franz Reuther 18 July 1941, Kirn, Germany) is a German record producer and songwriter, best known as the founder and voice behind the 1970s' disco-pop group Boney M. and as the mastermind and voice behind the lip-syncing group Milli Vanilli. His tendency to create bands with a visual image distinct from the recorded musical performances has led to controversy throughout his career, especially in the case of Milli Vanilli. Farian is also the owner of the record label MCI and several subsidiaries.\n\nFarian started as a trained cook before moving into the music industry. In April 1967, he released \"Will You Ever Be Mine\" under the name \"Frankie Farian\".\n\nIn the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but he made little impact on the popular music scene until his song \"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\" (a remake of Prince Buster's song \"Al Capone\" from 1967), released under the pseudonym Boney M., became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with \"Was kann schöner sein\", a German version of \"When You've Gotta Go\" originally by Solomon King, co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Ron Roker. \nShying away from the spotlight, he hired performers to front for public performances. All records were recorded in Offenbach-Bieber, a small town in the center of West Germany. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, Marcia Barrett and Liz Mitchell, who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, Bobby Farrell, was only allowed to record vocals in the 1980s (although all four members of the group did sing live for all their concert tours). Bobby Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981.\n\nFarian also started the supergroup Far Corporation (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured Steve Lukather, David Paich, Bobby Kimball, Simon Phillips, and Robin McAuley, many of Toto fame. Far Corporation is notable for being the first act to chart with a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\", becoming a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in October 1985.\n\nIn 1986, Farian produced and mixed the Meat Loaf album \"Blind Before I Stop\". He also sang backing vocals on the first single from the album \"Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries\", which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring John Parr.\n\nIn 1990, he admitted orchestrating the events which led to the Milli Vanilli scandal, a musical equivalent of ghostwriting. As a producer, he had assembled a group from session musicians, fronting it with visually attractive dancers Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan. The story broke when Farian confirmed to the press that someone else had sung on the records. After these details emerged, Milli Vanilli had their 1990 Grammy Award for Best New Artist withdrawn, and at least 27 different lawsuits were filed in the United States under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws. Following the Milli Vanilli controversy, Farian went on to develop similar Eurodance groups La Bouche and Le Click.\n\nSome other groups that Farian has been involved with are Eruption (he became a manager in 1977) and No Mercy.\n\nOn 15 August 2006, the musical \"Daddy Cool\" opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End. The line-up included Michelle Collins, Michael Harvey, Javine Hylton, and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also features songs by Milli Vanilli and No Mercy. A second show opened on 23 April 2007 in Berlin, Germany and the show also toured in the Netherlands from August 2011 to February 2012, Spain (Palma de Mallorca) in July 2012, Switzerland from, November 2015 to January 2016 Anniversary tour in Germany 2016.\n\nAlso in 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing a new song, entitled \"Doin' Fine\", with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in this song were, Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, Peter Wilson, Chris Richards and George Reyam.) Described as paying tribute to the 'sound' of Boney M., the song was essentially a brand new composition, which featured the string arrangement from Boney M.'s 1976 number one hit, \"Daddy Cool\". The song was recorded by Australian pop singer, Peter Wilson. It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled \"Daddy's Cool 12\" Mix\", charting at number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007. The original version of \"Doin' Fine\" featured on Peter Wilson's debut album, \"Follow Me\", which was released in the UK on 8 October 2007. The song was also recorded in 2008 by Amanda Lear.\n\nOther acts he collaborated with include Gilla, Eruption, La Mama, Precious Wilson, Gift and Daniel Lopes.\n\nFarian resides in Miami, Florida.\n\n\n"}

It was founded by present headmaster Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, a founder of the Church of All Worlds. The school was reported to be \"the first wizard school to be officially recognized as an academic establishment.\" It is a secular institution, not a religious one, and is not affiliated with any religion or religious organization. Over 450 classes are offered in 16 magical departments. Graduates are certified as “Journeyman Wizards”, using the traditional title \"journeyman\" signifying one who has completed an apprenticeship.\n\nBefore the school opened, the Grey Council was established in 2002 by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart as an advisory group to determine the curriculum. The Grey Council was composed of some two dozen authors, mystics, magicians and leaders of neopagan communities around the world, including Raymond Buckland, Raven Grimassi, Patricia Telesco, Frederic Lamond, Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart, Donald Michael Kraig, Katlyn Breene, Robert Lee \"Skip\" Ellison, Jesse Wolf Hardin, Nicki Scully, Sam Webster, Trina Robbins, Ronald Hutton, Amber K, Ellen Evert Hopman, Luc Sala and Jeff McBride. The Grey Council worked through 2003 to produce a textbook—a grimoire—for the school, the \"Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard\" (2004). This was followed by the \"Companion for the Apprentice Wizard\" in 2006.\n\nThe Grey School of Wizardry first opened on the pagan holiday of Lughnasadh on August 1, 2004. In 2011 it reported 735 students. The school's motto is: \"Omnia vivunt, omnia inter se conexa\" (“Everything is alive; everything is interconnected” — Cicero). It is a nonprofit educational institute for children 11–17 years of age, and also for adults of any age. The name of the school may derive from the colors associated with the wizards in the J. R. R. Tolkien classic \"Lord of the Rings\" and, in particular, with the appendix to the name of the protagonist Gandalf (the Grey). It was incorporated as a non-profit educational institution in California on March 14, 2004, and received a 501(c)(3) tax exemption from the Internal Revenue Service on September 27, 2007.\n\nThe school provides a seven-year apprenticeship curriculum in wizardry. Faculty and students represent a wide variety of faiths, including Pagan, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim.\n\nThe curriculum begins with simple lessons, and increases in complexity as students progress. More than 450 classes are offered in 16 color-coded departments. These are: Wizardry (indigo), Nature Studies (silver), Magickal Practice (gold), Psychic Arts (aqua), Healing (blue), Wortcunning/Herbalism (green), Divination (yellow), Performance Magics (orange), Alchemy & Magickal Sciences (red), Lifeways (pink), Beast Mastery (brown), Cosmology (violet), Mathemagicks (clear), Ceremonial Magic (white), Lore (grey), and Dark Arts (black). Although some classes address mythology and comparative religion, the school's grimoire (textbook of magic), \"Companion for the Apprentice Wizard\", and the school's philosophy focus on magic rather than spirituality.\n\nThe program was partially inspired by the fictitious \"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\" from the \"Harry Potter\" novels by J. K. Rowling and, like Hogwarts, the Grey School hosts four youth houses: Salamanders, Undines, Sylphs, and Gnomes, that are associated with the Elements Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. Likewise, there are four equivalent Lodges for adults: Flames, Waters, Winds, and Stones. Houses and Lodges are moderated by faculty Heads and student Prefects. Despite this resonance with a fictional school, the Grey School of Wizardry is \"an entirely serious project\"; it is an institution for educational enrichment with offerings for children, as well as ongoing educational opportunities for adults. The Grey School provides an interactive social environment, with clubs, merits, challenges, awards, a quarterly student-run school magazine (“Grey Matters”), several week-long summer camps (“Conclaves”) around the US and overseas, and a virtual school which offers home schooling and a G.E.D. program. The virtual school was founded primarily to provide an education stream for modern Pagans and their children that is Pagan-focused.\n\nAccording to Isaac Bonewits, \"The Grimoire collects in one book a library of wisdom about ceremonial native and Earth-centered magic, Paleo- and Neopagan religions, the obligations of the wise to protect the defenseless, great wizards and witches of the past and present, and more.\" Bonewits also asserts that the school presents an opportunity for males who are unsatisfied by the teachings of the modern Wicca movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19455978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19455978", "title": "Horestes", "text": "Horestes\n\nHorestes is a late Tudor morality play by the English dramatist John Pickering. It was first published in 1567 and was most likely performed by Lord Rich's men as part of the Christmas revels at court that year. The play's full title is A new interlude of Vice containing the history of Horestes with the cruel revengement of his father's death upon his one natural mother. It has been proposed that John Pickering (John Pickeryng) is likely to be the same person as lawyer and politician Sir John Puckering.\n\nThe play dramatises the story of the ancient Greek myth of Orestes. Rather than Aeschylus' trilogy of Athenian tragedies \"Oresteia\" (458 BCE), however, Pickering's source for his version of the story is William Caxton's translation of the French romance \"Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye\" (translated in 1475). Consequently, the play's theme and dramatic structure are more medieval than classical.\n\nOnly one copy of the play is extant, which the British Museum holds. It was published by William Griffith of Fleet Street, London for sale at his shop in St. Dunstan's churchyard.\n\nAlong with Thomas Preston's \"Cambises\" (c.1561), the play has been identified as a \"hybrid morality\", due to its articulation of classical themes, stories and characters with the medieval allegorical tradition. Within this genre, the central allegorical figure of the Vice vies with a non-allegorical, classical protagonist (Horestes); though their roles are about the same size, Horestes controls the important action.\n\nThe play has an episodic structure, which alternates comic, slapstick scenes with serious, tragic ones, all unified by the theme of revenge. It is one of the earliest examples of an English revenge play, a genre that includes Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (1587), Marston's \"The Malcontent\" (1603) and Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (1601). Unlike traditional moralities, \"Horestes\" presents an ambiguous ending. In line with both the \"Orestia\" and the \"Historyes of Troy\", Horestes is forgiven for the murder of his mother and her lover; despite its interrogation during the course of the play, however, the justification for the murders remains an unresolved issue at its conclusion. In a further departure from the conventions of the morality, the forgiveness of Horestes is not prompted by his repentance.\n\nAs with other experimental moralities from Elizabeth's reign, \"Horestes\" is longer than most of the older examples of the genre, running to 1,205 lines. The play was designed to be played by a company of six players, with each actor performing between three and seven roles each. The respective size of the roles of Horestes (521 lines) and the Vice (557 lines), as well as the play's frequent alternation of tragic and burlesque scenes, suggest that the play demanded a playing company that included two leading actors who were adept at both serious and comic acting. The actor playing Horestes also played the Woman (who appears in a brief scene between lines 626–647), while a boy actor played Clytemnestra and Hermione, as well as Hempstring and Provision. Unusually for Elizabethan drama, the play shares a role (Idumeus) between two different actors.\n\n"}

{"id": "42223807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42223807", "title": "Juan Bobo (comic book)", "text": "Juan Bobo (comic book)\n\nJuan Bobo is a comic book series of folk stories from Puerto Rico, centered on the Juan Bobo children's character. For centuries, these folk stories have been passed from generation to generation amongst Puerto Rican schoolchildren, and the Juan Bobo comic books have been published in Puerto Rico, the United States and Spain, among other countries. For nearly two centuries a vast collection of books, songs, riddles and folktales have developed around the Juan Bobo character. Hundreds of children's books have been written about Juan Bobo in English and Spanish. There are at least 70 Juan Bobo stories. In 2002, the book \"Juan Bobo Goes to Work\" won the ALA Notable Books for Children Award and the Belpré Medal for its illustrations.\n\nJuan Bobo stories are also used as instructional models in public school districts and libraries throughout the United States, and on PBS Television. The series was first published in the United States in 1921 by the Journal of American Folklore; the most recent series is in the \"American Legends and Folktales\" series published by Benchmark Publishers. When the comic books appeared for public mass sale in 1974, they were printed as standard 26-page hardcover children's comic books. Some publishers chose the 8x8 format as the book sales matured. They are designed for kindergarten and early grade children, aged four to eight.\n\nOften a trickster, sometimes a fool, \"Juan Bobo\" depicts a boy with a special way of doing things: with a good heart but little common sense. Juan Bobo tries to do exactly as his mother tells him, yet things always seem to go wrong - until they end up spectacularly right, as though Juan Bobo had an otherworldly, God-given genius. Due to this errant genius, Juan Bobo is Puerto Rico's most beloved noodlehead. For example, sent off by his mother to find work, Juan Bobo causes one disaster after another and always manages to lose his payment. In a typical Juan Bobo story his mother asks him to clean up a pig, so that she will fetch a higher price in the town market. Instead, Juan Bobo dresses her for church in his mother's best Sunday clothes, complete with lipstick and high heels. The stories incorporate a pícaro young man who roams the Puerto Rican countryside, moving from job to job, and disaster to disaster. Though Juan and his tricks constitute the main story interest, the satirical comments on various trades and professions give a wealth of information on the social, political and religious fabric of Puerto Rico. Juan Bobo is Puerto Rico's Amelia Bedelia.\n\nThe first series of Juan Bobo stories published in the U.S. occurred in 1921. They appeared in the \"Journal of American Folklore\" under the title \"Porto Rican Folklore.\" The story collection consisted of 56 \"Picaresque Tales\" about Juan Bobo, and included such exotic titles as \"Juan Bobo Heats up his Grandmother\", \"Juan Bobo Delivers a Letter to the Devil\", \"Juan Bobo Throws his Brother Down a Well\", and \"Juan Bobo Refuses to Marry the Princess.\" The first known publishing of the Juan Bobo stories in comic book format occurred in 1973; they were printed by the Walker and Company publishing house, authored by Bernice Chardiet and produced in hardcopy format.\n\nThe origin and authorship of the stories presented a sociological lesson. The editors acknowledged that the stories absorbed many versions of African and European folk tales, and that the first draft of all 56 stories had been written by Puerto Rican school children. However, none of these children were named or credited in the story collection. Despite this open and wide-scale plagiarism, the \"Journal of American Folklore\" congratulated J. Alden Mason for authoring \"the most abundant and important Spanish folk-tale material collected in Spanish America.\"\n\nPublished both in hardcover and paperback, the Juan Bobo books are used as elementary school teaching books, for bilingual language programs, and in Spanish-language studies throughout the United States Juan Bobo lesson plans and literacy activities accompany many of the books. The McGraw Hill company uses the books in a reading instruction series, which is used in public school districts throughout the United States. The Scholastic publishing company also offers Juan Bobo instruction modules to teachers around the US. August House publishers has a series of Juan Bobo teaching materials for national distribution, and the Greenwood Publishing Group also developed Juan Bobo materials to promote child literacy in classrooms and libraries. The \"American Legends\" children's books included Juan Bobo in a series of four folkloric books. Juan Bobo books and stories are stocked, and actively promoted, in public libraries in New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and in library systems throughout the United States.\n\nBook sellers throughout the United States carry a broad selection of Juan Bobo books. These can be found at Barnes & Noble, Amazon Books,\nAbe Books, and Powell Books, Newspapers around the U.S. regularly run Juan Bobo stories. The Juan Bobo stories are known in many countries, from the United States to Central and South America, the Caribbean, Spain and the Philippines. Juan Bobo books are sold in Great Britain. The National Library Board of Singapore has a listing of Juan Bobo books. In the Philippines, Juan Bobo stories go by the name \"Lazy Juan\". The National Library Board of Singapore has a listing of Juan Bobo books.\n\nOn U.S. public television, the Juan Bobo stories are used by PBS stations in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Chicago, and Iowa, and in the nationwide PBS Learning Media system. Currently, Juan Bobo stories and radio dramas are regularly broadcast over radio stations in Puerto Rico. Juan Bobo CDs are also sold on the island and in the United States, as are Juan Bobo MP3 downloads.\n\nIn the theatrical arts, in New York City, Theatre Works USA developed and presented a Juan Bobo play, together with a children's study guide in 2008. The Teatro Círculo Theater Company mounted an Off-Broadway production of \"The Mischievous Juan Bobo\" in 2006. Also in 2006, the Open Eye Theater in Minneapolis performed \"The Adventures of Juan Bobo.\" This was followed in 2009 by the University Theater of Northeastern Illinois University presenting a Juan Bobo play titled \"Señora Tortuga.\" Children's theater companies enact the Juan Bobo stories, often in the form of puppet plays. In New York City, a group of grade school children made a Juan Bobo animated film, and children's Juan Bobo play scripts are available. In Colombia, the \"Corporación Artística La Polilla\" theatre company mounted a production of \"Juan Bobo y el Secreto de la Princesa\" (Juan Bobo and the Riddling Princess) in 2013.\n\nIn 1962, the Puerto Rican librarian Pura Belpré published the first Juan Bobo novel in the United States: \"Juan Bobo and the Queen's Necklace: A Puerto Rican Folk Tale\". Belpré, throughout her life, collected many other folktales from Puerto Rico, translated them into English and had them published as children's literature. \"Juan Bobo and the Queen's Necklace\" is still in print, and appears in book catalogues throughout the United States. Today, the Pura Belpré Award is given annually by the American Library Association, in recognition of a Latino or Latina writer and illustrator whose work best portrays the Latino cultural experience in a work of literature for children or youth. In 2002 the Pura Belpré Award was given to Joe Cepeda for his illustration of \"Juan Bobo Goes to Work.\"\n\nJuan Bobo children's books have been published in the U.S. and worldwide. Juan Bobo stories have been published by Harper Collins, Dutton Children's Books, Scholastic Books and many others, and reviewed by Kirkus Reviews, Library Journal, Publishers Weekly and Booklist.

During the next 12 years, the studios supported the production of thousands of hours of network content, and was simultaneously home to over 400 projects for an array of other global media companies. \n\nAmong the many projects were long-running, award-winning children's television productions; PBS's \"Where in the World is Carmen San Diego\" and \"Between the Lions\", Jim Henson Television's \"Bear in the Big Blue House\", and \"Out of the Box\" for the Disney Channel. Additionally, many music and entertainment programs originated from the studios, including; \"Top of the Pops\" for the BBC, MTV's \"Unplugged\", A&E's \"Live Upon Request\", and PBS's \"Great Performances\". For 10 years, one studio was exclusively dedicated for Lifetime's morning block of talk, cooking and craft programming, including, chef Bobby Flay's first show, \"Main Ingredient\". In 1995, HAVES had ABC News produce a two-hour political special for Lifetime, and then a daily live news show. \n\nBy 2000, entering the first dotcom era of emerging television and internet platforms, Lifetime Studios provided the facilities and technical expertise for some of the first interactive, cross-platform projects and companies; while also pushing to the forefront of the use of tapeless, server-based hardware and software for television production. Dubbed a \"studio of the future\", Lifetime Studios was an industry leader until operations ceased upon the expiration of its lease in 2005.\n\nViacom sold its stake in April 1994 to Hearst and Cap Cities/ABC becoming at some point Lifetime Entertainment Services (LES). For 1996, LES committed $100 million towards original programming. In 1996, the channel's website was launched, Lifetimetv.com. With its recent involvement in sponsoring and programming women sports, the company started a sports division. Lifetime in fall 1998 spins off a new cable channel, Lifetime Movie Network.\n\nIn November 1998, it was announced that CEO Douglas McCormick's contract would not be renewed when it was up at the end of the year.Although Lifetime staff members reportedly were \"dumbfounded\" because the network had been so financially successful during McCormick's tenure, board members wanted someone who would \"bring more vision\" to the company. Board members reportedly were so insistent upon hiring a woman to replace McCormick that at one point during negotiations when his contract was about to expire, McCormick threatened to bring a sex-discrimination lawsuit against them, but decided against it.\n\nIn 1999, LES started up its own in house production unit. In 2001, LES launched another spin off channel, Lifetime Real Women and published its first Lifetime imprint book. The company purchased a 4.6% equity stake in Women.com Networks Inc. in September 2000.\n\nIn April 2004, Lifetime launched \"Lifetime Radio for Women\", a daily nationally syndicated four-hour morning show mixing adult contemporary music, live caller interaction, celebrity guests and lively discussions about the topics relating to women. In partnership with Jones Radio Networks, the service aired Monday to Friday from 5 to 9 a.m. or 6 to 10 a.m., depending on the market.\n\nOn March 31, 2005, Betty Cohen, previously an executive at Turner Broadcasting System, was named CEO of Lifetime Entertainment Services.\n\nOn August 27, 2009, as part of a corporate restructuring A&E Television Networks (another subsidiary of ABC and Hearst that handled cable networks) acquired Lifetime Entertainment Services. Nancy Dubuc became Lifetime's president and general manager in April 2010.\n\n\n"}

The advertisement was pulled by the company one day after its distribution due to criticism.\n\nThe Pepsi commercial features American fashion model and television personality Kendall Jenner and the song \"Lions\" by Skip Marley. The ad begins silently with a person's hand cracking open a Pepsi can and then a shot of a young man playing a cello on a rooftop. The view pans backward on a city and then zooms in on the musician with sweat flying off of his face as he plays. The music soundtrack then begins, with no other sound accompanying the visual footage. The view switches to a protest with mostly young people walking displaying V signs as gestures of peace and carrying signs, including one that says \"Join the Conversation\" and others with peace symbols.\n\nThe view then switches to a young woman in a hijab, who appears to be a professional photographer going through her print photographs with a red marker. Then the view switches to Jenner's character, clad in a silver dress being photographed in a photo shoot, modeling but also showing a growing awareness of the protesters passing nearby. The cellist, shown indoors in a new location, notices the protest as well, then drinks a Pepsi while viewing passing marchers from a balcony. Below the balcony, two young women drink a Pepsi. Then two other women take selfies as the march passes behind them.\n\nThe view then switches to the photographer, growing frustrated and then sending her prints flying in a gesture of irritation. She then also notices the protest outside. The view then switches to the protesters, looking cheerful. The photographer looks captivated, grabs her camera, and heads outside toward the protesters. There are images of more young people marching, then the cellist playing music alongside a guitarist as two men dance. \n\nJenner's character is shown again, still modeling but increasingly focusing on the protest. The cellist passes her, and gestures with his head for her to join them. Jenner responds by pulling off her blond wig to reveal her dark brown hair, cutting to a shot of her hair being blown forward. She hands the wig to a woman assistant without looking at her, wipes off her dark lipstick, and heads toward the protest.\n\nThe camera then shows several police officers standing rigidly watching the protest, then two young protesters, then two men - one in a religious robe - and a woman, several of these characters displaying V signs. Jenner, now in a more casual outfit, passes swiftly through the crowd and advances toward the police officers. She hands a Pepsi can to one of the police officers, as the photographer, looking riveted, snaps multiple photographs of the interaction. The police officer drinks from the can, and the crowd of protesters cheers enthusiastically. The photographer puts aside her camera and hugs a protester in celebration. The commercial ends displaying the phrases \"Live Bolder\", \"Live Louder\", and \"Live for Now\".\n\nThe advertisement was pulled by the company one day after its distribution due to criticism. The company released a statement, saying: Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.\n\nThe advertisement's creators have been widely criticized on social media and by media outlets for attempting to capitalize on imagery imitating protests in the Black Lives Matter movement, including \"Taking a Stand in Baton Rouge\", the iconic image of a woman, named Iesha Evans, who approached heavily armed police alone and was arrested in a Baton Rouge protest in July 2016. Researchers of branding and marketing have observed the identity politics aspect of the spot depicted by the marching masses but called into question the credibility of subverting the police towards a \"melting pot\" model. Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr, remarked, \"If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi\". Initially, Pepsi stated, \"This is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony, and we think that’s an important message to convey\". According to marketing expert Mike Jackson, part of the problem was that Pepsi did not have a history of promoting social justice causes.\n\nThe advertisement was parodied in a YouTube video by comedian Vito Gesualdi, who filmed himself handing out cans of Pepsi at an April 15, 2017, protest in Berkeley, California. Gesualdi stated he was trying to \"bridge the divide\" in America with cans of Pepsi; however, almost all the cans distributed ended up being used as projectiles by the protesters. \n\nThe advertisement was also parodied in an pre-registration trailer for the mobile game \"Angry Birds Evolution\", with a blue bird named Paige and a member of the Bacon Corp's own security force replacing Jenner and the police officer, respectively. \n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" made reference to the commercial in a skit for the April 8, 2017 episode, where the ad's writer and director, played by Beck Bennett, is chastised by family and friends on the set of the commercial for the ad's content just before filming; however, when Jenner (Cecily Strong) does the same thing, she is seemingly praised.\n\n"}

A prequel to the first \"Panzer Dragoon\", it was developed by Team Andromeda, one of Sega's internal development studios. A PC version was planned for release on GameTap, but was never released.\n\nJean-Luc Lundi lives in a superstitious village where mutant coolias are killed. When Lundi discovers a mutant coolia, he decides to keep it and names it Lagi. Lagi has a strange green glow in his throat. After a few years the coolia begins to grow wings. Lundi takes the coolia out to try to get him to fly.\n\nWhen Lundi takes Lagi out, a huge ship called Shelcoof, controlled by the AI network Sestren, destroys Lundi's village in an attempt to kill Lagi, who is possessed by the Heresy Program. Lagi's green glow grows brighter, and Lagi fires arrows of light from his mouth, the trademark attack of dragons from the ancient age. The lasers do not reach Shelcoof. Lundi begins to chase Shelcoof on Lagi's back.\n\nAs with other \"Panzer Dragoon\" games (apart from \"Panzer Dragoon Saga\"), Zwei is a rail shooter. As in the first game, enemies can be defeated with either the rider's gun or the dragon's lasers. There is also the berserk attack, which is a rain of lasers from the dragon which automatically attack all enemies on screen for several seconds, during which the dragon is invincible. To use the berserk attack, the player draws on the accumulated energy in the power meter, which is filled by killing enemies. A radar in the corner of the screen displays the location of nearby enemies.\n\nZwei is considerably more in depth than \"Panzer Dragoon\", with alternate routes to be taken and a dragon that evolves based on the player's performance.\n\nIn response to player criticisms, Team Andromeda worked on making the game less difficult and more story-intensive than the first \"Panzer Dragoon\". The team received no help from Sega's technical division on \"Panzer Dragoon II Zwei\", and did not use any Sega-developed tools such as the Sega Graphics Library operating system; instead, Team Andromeda's programmers created all the development tools used to create the game.\n\n\"Panzer Dragoon II Zwei\" received generally positive reviews. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" applauded the game for its multiple routes, differing dragon transformations, and \"some of the best graphics ever seen on Sega's 32-bit powerhouse\". However, they criticized that the game's low difficulty leaves it with little longevity. In \"GamePro\", Scary Larry asserted that \"Panzer Dragoon II Zwei\" \"blows away anything resembling a shooter on the PlayStation thus far, in both graphics and imagination.\" He criticized that the game is much too easy, though he noted that the ability to choose from multiple paths increases the replay value in addition to making the gameplay more interesting. He also complimented the way the music reflects what is going on in the game. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said that while the gameplay makes only minimal innovations to the restrictive on-rails format, the game keeps the player hooked though its gorgeous visuals and absorbing story. He summarized, \"In a surprising victory for art and plot direction, \"Panzer Dragoon II Zwei\" proves that visual sophistication and compelling storylines can sometimes overcome less than revolutionary gameplay.\"\n\nRob Allsetter of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" praised the impressive attention to detail in the graphics and the multiple routes. He concluded that it \"belongs up there with VF2 and Sega Rally as the standard-bearer for its genre.\" \"Maximum\"'s Daniel Jevons concurred with Scary Larry that the game \"positively laughs in the face of any competing PlayStation 3D shooters.\" He pointed out that the much-maligned on-rails format is necessary to create the experience the game offers, noting as an example that it allowed the developers to synchronize the soundtrack with what is going on. He also praised the animation, 3D graphics, high frame rate, absence of pixelation even on the heavily detailed bosses, precise controls, lock-on attacks, and the ability to adjust the game's difficulty by choosing different routes.\n\n\"Panzer Dragon Zwei\" was a runner-up for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s Shooter Game of the Year (behind \"Alien Trilogy\") and Best Graphics of the Year (behind \"Super Mario 64\").\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game an A.\n\nIGN staff writer Levi Buchanan ranked \"Panzer Dragoon II Zwei\" fifth in his list of the top 10 Sega Saturn games, saying \"The original \"Panzer Dragoon\" that flanked the Saturn at launch was nothing short of revelation. But this sequel improves on almost everything, offering better graphics, smoother animations, changing dragon forms, and branching routes.\"\n"}

The earliest version listed in a catalog of American games compiled by the American Game Collectors Association in 1998, is dated 1899, and attributed to Charles Zimmerling. \n\nIt is common at birthday parties and other gatherings. A picture of a donkey with a missing tail is tacked to a wall within easy reach of children.\nOne at a time, each child is blindfolded and handed a paper \"tail\" with a push pin or thumbtack poked through it. The blindfolded child is then spun around until he or she is disoriented. The child gropes around and tries to pin the tail on the donkey. The player who pins their tail closest to the target, the donkey's rear, wins. The game, a group activity, is generally not competitive; \"winning\" is only of marginal importance. It is often seen as more entertaining, seeing the children stumble around and try to put their tail at the right place.\n\nThe game is also used in child development research.\n\nThe game can also be played by teenagers and adults, especially if the \"donkey\" is replaced with depictions of something or someone else. As a drinking game, the person with the worst tail pinning is awarded one shot of a selected alcohol, to be determined by house rules or the loser in a friendly environment.\n\nIdiomatically, the term can be used derisively for any assigned activity which is pointless or for which a person has been handicapped (blindfolded).\n\n\n"}

It was published by Proxima Software as part of their \"Fuxoft uvádí\" series. A newer version of the game (as opposed to a sequel) entitled Poklad 2 was designed in 1985 and released in 1992.\n\n\"Poklad \" is one of the oldest surviving games created in Czechoslovakia. František Fuka had previously created several games on the VIC-20 computer, however he would sell the computer along with its software to an unknown buyer, and those games would not survive. Fuka, a 16-year-old computer enthusiast, programmed the game on his friend's ZX Spectrum as he didn't have a computer of his own. Fuka first got interested in games after his uncle bought him a copy of Creative Computing magazine, which he wrote for; Fuaka began reading reviews and ads for text adventures. He had been inspired to make the game after playing a different game called \"Poklad\" (which the thesis \"The Beginnings of Czech and Slovak Digital Narrativity: The History of Text Computer games in Czechoslovakia\" surmises as a translation of a Western game) on the ZX81 computer. Fuka programmed it entirely from memory. \n\n\"Poklad \" is considered a beta version of \"Poklad 2\", for this reason Fuka himself deems \"Boxing\" (1985) his first video game and he expressly acknowledges the first game's non-existence. Poklad 2 was translated into English, although Fuka does not remember who did the translation. Polka is sometimes considered the first Czechoslovak game, however depending on the definition earlier video games may have existed through the 1970s. Text-based adventures would become the most popular video gaming genre throughout the second half of the 1980s, with over 500 games created; this is because they were easy to make (one developer could make a game in 2-3 weeks), and easy to translate to Western languages. \n\nFuka created the title without any expectation of financial gain. The Czechoslovak video gaming development industry was predominantly young high school or college aged males who attended computer clubs, and who made games individually. This made it difficult for the amateur one-team developers to complete with Western professional companies. Fuka would proclaim in 1998: \"The few individuals that make games in our country can naturally hardly compete with teams of specialists, for whom making games is not only fun, but also a job (a paid one, of course). One person can hardly be a good author of a game idea, a programmer, a graphic artist, a musician and also have enough time to pull it all off\".\n\nThe player finds themselves in a magical country and their task is to find five treasures. The game consists of a 4 x 5 room matrix in three levels. Gameplay consists of a classic text adventure game.\n\nTiscali.cz thought it was a very simple and short attempt at a game, but that it offered a great forshadowing of where Fuka's career would end up.\n"}

The division into a northern and a southern part is mostly for administrative purposes as Sachsenhausen is generally considered an entity. Both city districts are part of the \"Ortsbezirk Süd\".\n\nAs a whole, Sachsenhausen is the largest district by population and area in Frankfurt. It is located south of the Main river and borders the districts of Niederrad and Flughafen to the west and Oberrad to the east. Sachsenhausen-Süd is mostly comprised by the Frankfurt City Forest.\n\nSachsenhausen was founded as Frankfurt's bridgehead in the 12th century. The oldest documents point to the year 1193. Unlike Frankfurt's own historic city center, which burned to the ground after British bombing in 1944, Sachsenhausen's old town is partly preserved. The Frankfurt youth hostel is located on its riverside. The population of Sachsenhausen is 55,422.\n\nThe River Main embankment hosts the city's largest flea market and some of Germany's best-known museums; it is also called the \"Museum Embankment\" (or Museumsufer). Here it is where the annual Museum-Embankment-Festival / Night of the Museums (or Museumsuferfest / Nacht der Museen), with all museums open throughout the night and discounted entrance fees as well as many open-air events in the streets, is held. Sachsenhausen is known for its vibrant nightlife sporting over two dozen bars, taverns and restaurants in the southern part's old town.\n\nThe main street of Sachsenhausen is \"Schweizer Straße\", a cosmopolitan boulevard with bars and two of Frankfurt's most traditional cider houses, \"Zum gemalten Haus\" and \"Wagner\". Ciderhouses that produce their own 'Apfelwein' (applewine) can be identified by the presence of a wreath of evergreen branches hanging outside the location or a similar image included on their signpost. The \"Textorstraße\" and the old town or 'Altstadt' have the best known ciderhouses in Frankfurt, but such pubs can be found all over southern Hesse. Orchards of the Sperling apple can be seen across the countryside and, reputedly, local law requires that Apfelwein be the cheapest alcoholic beverage on sale in any public house.\n\nIn addition, there is a brand new part of Sachsenhausen, built on the grounds of the old slaughterhouse area.

When Irish people emigrated to America in great numbers during the early American Colonial period, or when escaping The Troubles in Ireland, they brought their dance culture with them. One of the many forms of Irish dance is sean-nós dance, which is an informal, spontaneous, solo form of dance. Sean-nós dance has both modified, and in turn been modified by, similar forms of traditional vernacular solo dance in America.\n\nThe most widely known form of traditional Irish dance is competition-oriented modern Irish stepdance. Other popular forms of Irish dancing are for couples and group social dancing, such as set dancing and céili dancing. Less known is the traditional solo dance form called \"sean nós\" or \"old style\" dance.\n\nSean-nós dance is characterized by its \"low to the ground\" footwork, free movement of the arms, improvisation, and emphasis upon a \"battering step\" (which sounds out the accented beat of the music). By its nature, sean-nós dance follows the music closely. Indeed, the rhythmic nature of sean-nós dance results in a percussive music of its own. It frequently is danced by only one person, and even when danced in pairs or small groups, there is no physical contact between the dancers. Because it is a freeform, solo type of dance, it is not necessary for a pre-arranged routine to be decided upon by the dancer; spontaneous expression is preferred in the tradition. It is less common to see groups performing synchronized sean-nós dance (which requires choreography in advance). Instead, the dancers may dance in turns, playing off of the energy of the other. Another more specialized form sean-nós dancing is the brush dance.\n\nSean-nós dance has made a significant contribution to American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing, which includes flat foot dance (or \"flat-footing\"), hoofing (or \"hoofin'\"), buck dancing, soft shoe (casual tap dancing performed in shoes without metal taps), clogging (in its older non-show form), Irish sean-nós dance, and the Irish jig. Various other names may be applied for this category of dance, depending upon the specific regional, language, cultural, or social group involved. Solo Southern dancing and solo mountain-style dancing show strong influences from sean-nós dance.\n\"I believe that to get some idea of the process of Southern vernacular dance development, we must consider it in parallel with its companion music and the dominant cultures that have mixed to produce it: British, African, and to some extent, Native American. These cultures began their intense musical interaction here in the 17th century, first among African-Americans and then in the 19th century among British-Americans, especially in small Southern towns and nearby rural areas. A good example of Anglo/Afro interaction in music is the introduction of the banjo, originally an African instrument. It is quite certain that the interaction between the European fiddle and African banjo changed the styles and repertoire of both. African-Americans first played these instruments together soon after being brought here, and the banjo/fiddle combination was the basis for the late 19th-century/early 20th-century mountain music to which most of our older dancers moved.\"\n\n- Mike Seeger, Musician, Documentarian, Ethno-Musicologist\nSean-nós dance is not widely found in America today. Small sean-nós dancing communities exist in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Seattle, New York, and Portland, Oregon. These communities are centered around American sean-nós dance teachers — some of Irish-American heritage — who learned their dancing in the west of Ireland. This new generation of younger American dancers now teaches and performs regularly. Kieran Jordan (Boston), Maldon Meehan (Portland, Oregon) and Shannon Dunne (Washington, DC) have produced instructional DVDs in sean-nós dance. Workshops in sean-nós dance can also be found at Irish festivals like the Sean-nós Northwest Festival, the Milwaukee Irish Fest Summer School, the Catskills Irish Arts Week, and the Minnesota Irish Fair. Sean-nós dancing workshops are also often incorporated into smaller workshop weekends focused on set dancing. Occasionally, sean-nós dancers from Ireland tour in the U.S. with well-known Irish traditional bands, such as The Chieftains and Dervish.\n\nThe Irish people's practice of sean-nós dance, sean-nós song, lilting (or \"mouth music\"), and \"the bones\" (a simple percussion instrument) represents a minimalist means of preserving their musical and dance heritage — despite concerted efforts by the English authorities to usurp Irish music, dance, modes of dress, language (see Irish Gaelic and Hiberno-English), Catholic religion, nationality, and history — or simply due to a dearth of resources when emigrating. Accordingly, the Irish in America have been able to promulgate the dance and musical aspects of the Culture of Ireland — even after large waves of migration subsequent to highly disruptive events in Ireland, such as the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or the Irish Potato Famine.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820218", "title": "Shadow of the Colossus", "text": "Shadow of the Colossus\n\nShadow of the Colossus, released in Japan as \"Wander and the Colossus\", is an action-adventure game developed by SCE Japan Studio and Team Ico, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. The game was released in North America and Japan in October 2005 and PAL regions in February 2006. It was directed by Fumito Ueda and developed at SCEI's International Production Studio 1, also known as Team Ico; the same development team responsible for the cult hit \"Ico\", to which the game is considered a spiritual successor.\n\nThe game's storyline focuses on a young man named Wander who enters a forbidden land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. \"Shadow of the Colossus\" has been described as a puzzle game, as each colossus can only be killed by attacking certain weak points which require specific actions to access.\n\nCited as an influential title in the video game industry and one of the greatest games of all time, \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to \"Ico\", due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games.\n\nA remastered version for the PlayStation 3 was developed by Bluepoint Games and released alongside \"Ico\" as \"The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection\" in September 2011. It features high-definition (HD) graphics, content previously missing from the North American version, PlayStation Network Trophies, and 3D support. The HD version was released separately in Japan. A high-definition remake for the PlayStation 4 was released in February 2018.\n\nProgression through \"Shadow of the Colossus\" occurs in cycles. Beginning at a central point in an expansive landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is then returned to the central point to repeat the process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.\n\nOnce a colossus is found, the player must discover its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells in a unique lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment. Every colossus has at least one weak point, indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's reflected light. Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him. While scaling a colossus, the player must act quickly, as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.\n\nWander and the colossi have life bars to indicate their remaining health. A colossus' health will decrease significantly when its weak points are attacked, while Wander can be harmed by a colossus' attacks or a fall from great height. Throughout the game, Wander is equipped with only a sword and a bow with arrows, but may obtain other weapons from completing the Time Attack trials.\n\nWhile the colossi are the only enemies, there are natural animals in the environment. Only one species, however, has any effect on gameplay: eating the tail of a certain kind of lizard increases Wander's stamina gauge. Likewise, the player may find fruit that increases Wander's maximum health.\n\nWander's horse, Agro, plays a large role in the game. In addition to serving as a means of transportation, fighting from horseback is vital to defeating some of the colossi. There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle. Agro is referred to as a male in the English-language version of the game, though director Fumito Ueda said that he saw Wander's horse as female.\n\nThe environment must be used to the player's advantage more often as the game progresses. The first two battles take place on simple, large, flat areas of land, with the only goal being to discover how to scale the colossi and attack their weak points. However, the majority of the following fourteen battles require that some aspect of the battlefield be used.\n\nDuring \"Shadow of the Colossus\", the player receives little information concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another. The game takes place in a fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.\n\nThe region is only accessible via a small cleft in the mountains to the north, leading to a massive stone bridge. This bridge spans half the distance of the landscape and terminates at a large temple called the \"Shrine of Worship\" located at its center. It is, however, forbidden to enter the land, which is characterized by diverse geographical features, such as lakes, plateaus, canyons, caves, and deserts in addition to human-made structures.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is , a young man whose goal is to resurrect a girl named . Little is known about Mono other than that she was a maiden who was somehow sacrificed because she was believed to have a cursed destiny. Wander and Mono were designed with long hair from the start of the design process, with Mono's long hair specifically as a contrast to Yorda of \"Ico\", who has short hair. Assisting Wander in his quest to revive her is his loyal horse, , who serves as his only ally in defeating the colossi. Wander also receives aid from an entity called . The story revolves around these characters but features a small supporting cast including Lord and his men.\n\nSpeaking with two voices at once (one male and one female), Dormin is a mysterious, disembodied entity. In legends of the game's world, it is said that Dormin has the power to revive the dead; it is for this reason that Wander enters the forbidden land, seeking its assistance in reviving Mono. Dormin offers to revive her in exchange for Wander destroying the sixteen colossi. \"Dormin\", which spells \"Nimrod\" backwards, has been speculated to be a reference to the body of the biblical King Nimrod which was cut up and scattered.\n\nLord Emon is a shaman who narrates a vision in the game's introduction, vaguely explaining the origin of the land Wander has come to, and emphasizing that entry to this place is forbidden. He is portrayed as having extensive knowledge regarding the nature and containment of Dormin, and the ability to use powerful magic. He has a small group of warriors at his command, and is pursuing Wander to prevent the use of \"the forbidden spell\", the ritual involving the destruction of the sixteen colossi and the restoration of Dormin's power.\n\nThe colossi are armored, most often enormous creatures with forms ranging from various humanoids to predatory animals, and live in all manner of surroundings and environments, including beneath water and flying through the air. Their bodies are a fusion of organic and inorganic parts such as rock, earth, fur, and architectural elements, some of which are weathered or fractured. Some colossi are peaceful and will only attack when provoked, while others are aggressive and will attack on sight. Inhabiting specific locations in the forbidden land, they do not venture outside their own territory. Once slain they will remain where fallen, as a mound of earth and rock vaguely resembling the original colossus. A pillar of light marks the location of each colossus after they are defeated. The Latin names of the colossi, though featured throughout fan related media, are not official and are never referred to within the game.\n\nThe story of \"Shadow of the Colossus\" begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge on his horse, Agro. Unknown to the player, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several man-like shadowy creatures appear and prepare to attack Wander before he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as \"Dormin\" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which Dormin states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall by using the ancient sword to kill the sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them.\n\nWhat Wander does not know is that the colossi contain portions of Dormin's own essence that were scattered long ago to render the entity powerless. As Wander kills each colossus, a released fragment of Dormin enters his body. Over time, the signs of Wander's deterioration from the gathered essence become clearer—his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon. Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. At the last second when it seems he will not make it, Wander is thrown to the other side by Agro before the horse falls into the distant river below.\n\nSoon after, Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus as Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship to witness the last temple idol crumble. Wander appears back in the temple soon after, the signs of his corruption readily apparent: his skin is clammy, his eyes are milky, and a pair of tiny horns has sprouted from his head. Emon orders his warriors to kill the \"possessed\" man as he approaches Mono and finally falls once stabbed through the heart by one of Emon's men. However, a newly whole Dormin takes control of Wander's body and transforms into a shadowy giant. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall to evoke a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander, sealing Dormin within the temple once again. After fleeing with the bridge connecting to the temple collapsing behind them, forever isolating the forbidden land from the rest of the world, Emon expresses hope that Wander may be able to atone for his crimes should he have survived. Back in the temple, Mono awakens and finds Agro limping into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head. She takes the child with her, following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship, and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\" is considered both a spiritual successor and prequel to \"Ico\". For several months during and after the game's release, the game's director and lead designer, Fumito Ueda, maintained that the game's status as a prequel was simply his personal take on the game and not necessarily its canon nature, as he largely intended for players to decide the specifics of the story for themselves, but he confirmed the two do have a connection. Moreover, the shadowy figures which appear in the Shrine of Worship are connected to the shadows which the player must fight in \"Ico\". Both games feature \"horned\" characters for protagonists (Wander sprouts horns at the end of the game). The Queen's Sword from \"Ico\" is also available as a bonus unlockable item. Both games also use unique fictional languages.\n\nWith a team of thirty-five people, \"Shadow of the Colossus\" began development in 2002 under the project name \"Nico\" (a portmanteau of \"ni\", 2 in Japanese, and \"Ico\") and was intended to be a sequel to \"Ico\". An early technology demo for the project shown at the DICE Summit in 2003 depicted a group of masked, horned boys riding horses while attacking and defeating a colossus. However, Fumito Ueda expressed that, at the time, it was simpler to reuse the character design of \"Ico\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s protagonist, and that he never explicitly desired a sequel to \"Ico\". Japanese pre-orders of \"Shadow of the Colossus\" later included a bonus DVD with the concept video, a trailer describing \"Nico\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s plot, and an introduction the development team states they wanted to use in \"Shadow of the Colossus\".\n\nUeda and producer Kenji Kaido held their team to a high standard throughout production. An admitted perfectionist, Ueda felt that only one or two out of 500 artists who applied to work on \"Shadow of the Colossus\" met his criteria, and often demanded thorough changes in design until it matched his vision. For his part, Kaido challenged the programmers to meet the concept of realistic physics in relation to the movement of the colossi and the subsequent effect this movement would have for Wander, both in terms of how he might be displaced and how he may be able to use this movement to his advantage. For instance, if a colossus were to shake, Kaido wanted Wander's position to shift realistically in response. Additionally, if a colossus' limb was currently horizontal, Kaido wanted the player to be able to run across the limb as though it were any other flat surface. He referred to these two concepts as \"player dynamics and reactions\" and \"organic collision deformation\". The realistic physics engine produced as a result required that faster colossi had to be smaller as well.\nUeda wished the game to have a unique presentation and change how both players and developers perceived the idea of what bosses should be in video games. To achieve this, he ensured that the game's only enemies would be the sixteen colossi, that they could only be approached one at a time, and that they would have various behavior patterns. Though limiting the presence of enemies to only bosses was partly intended to differentiate the game from others, Ueda also expressed that it was to ensure that the programmers' focus was entirely on the colossi so that their quality would be as high as possible. In accordance with this focus upon the colossi—and his preference for simple controls—he intended that one button on the game controller be used solely for targeting the colossi during battles. Ueda cited \"The Legend of Zelda\" as an influence on the boss design, referring to the bosses as \"inverted Zelda dungeons.\"\n\nA theme of companionship between the player and an AI-controlled partner was a concern for Ueda. In \"Ico\", this theme was presented through the protagonist and the character Yorda, whom the player was required to work with and protect while navigating the game's environments. Similarly, a key element in \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is the relationship between Wander and his horse, Agro. Intended to be a realistic representation of a horse, Agro will occasionally ignore commands. In Ueda's words, \"a real horse ... doesn't always obey. It's not like a car or a motorcycle, it won't always turn when you say 'turn!'\" However, he has admitted that the team had to seek a balance in how often Agro did not respond to commands so as to not sacrifice playability in the pursuit of realism.\n\nAll elements of the game—including audio, gameplay and visuals—were used to achieve an atmosphere of a \"lonely hero\", which Ueda considered important in the development of the game. Lighting, in particular, was used to establish a dark, fearsome setting for the forbidden land, while the protagonist's sword would provide a means of navigation that was \"direct and only expressible visually\". Like \"Ico\", \"Shadow of the Colossus\" uses a distinct style of lighting. The game's engine uses elements such as desaturated colors, motion blur and partial high dynamic range rendering, with a heavy emphasis on bloom lighting.\n\nA PlayStation 3 remastered version of \"Ico\" and \"Shadow of the Colossus\" was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2010 and released in September 2011. Developed by Bluepoint Games, both were improved graphically to take advantage of the PlayStation 3's hardware and HDTVs, with numerous other improvements implemented.\n\nThe PAL version of the game was released in February 2006. Much like the PAL release for \"Ico\", the game came in cardboard packaging displaying various pieces of artwork from the game, and contained four art cards.\n\nThe game also came with a \"making of\" documentary, a trailer for \"Ico\" and a gallery of concept art, accessible from the game's main menu. Sony Computer Entertainment also re-released \"Ico\" in PAL territories at the time of \"Shadow of the Colossus\"s release, both to promote the game through \"Ico\"s reputation, and to allow players who did not buy \"Ico\" during its original limited release to \"complete their collections\".\n\nSome confusion has arisen in PAL regions concerning the official name of the protagonist primarily because of the manual's usage of \"Wanda\", while the North American manual and the game itself uses the name \"Wander\". In fact, the Japanese version of the game spells the name \"Wander\" as ワンダ (\"Wanda\"), which is also the common transliteration of the English name \"Wanda\", hence the mistake in the manual.\n\nWhile the game has an extensive orchestral soundtrack, the music is only heard during cut scenes and colossus encounters, while time spent at the Shrine of Worship and traversing the landscape is silent save for the sounds made by the protagonist, his horse and their surroundings. The open nature of the game world and lack of life, coupled with this limited use of music, aids in establishing an atmosphere of solitude, similar to that of \"Ico\".\n\nOn December 7, 2005, a soundtrack album containing music from the game was released only in Japan, titled . There are currently no announced plans to release the album in other territories. The game's score was composed by Kow Otani, whose previous video game work included the soundtracks to the PlayStation 2 flight simulator \"Sky Odyssey\" and the PlayStation shooter \"Philosoma\". He has also worked on several of the 1990s-era Gamera films, as well as a variety of anime. \"Roar of the Earth\" won the award for \"Soundtrack of the Year\" in the US-based video game magazine \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\".\n\nSony announced a remake of \"Shadow of the Colossus\" for the PlayStation 4 during their Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 press conference. It was released on February 6, 2018. The remake is led by Bluepoint, who developed the earlier PlayStation 3 remaster. The developers remade all the game's assets from the ground up, but the game retains the same gameplay from the original title along with the introduction of a new control scheme. Ueda had since left Sony, but provided a list of recommended changes to Bluepoint for the remake; he stated that he does not believe many of them will be implemented, nor would they add any of the colossi that had been cut from the original game.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\"s commercial reception was positive, with sales of 140,000 copies in its first week at retail in Japan, reaching number one in the charts. Almost 80% of the initial Japanese shipment was sold within two days. These figures compare favorably with \"Ico\", which was well received by critics but failed to sell a significant number of units. The game was placed on Sony's list of Greatest Hits titles on August 6, 2006.\n\nUnlike \"Ico\", \"Shadow of the Colossus\" received far more exposure, due in part to Sony putting its weight behind a massive advertising campaign. It was advertised in game magazines, on television and on the internet, including a viral marketing campaign launched in October 2005. The site posted links to several websites claiming that the remains of five giants resembling certain colossi had been discovered in various parts of the world. The website has since been taken down. Some speculate that \"Ico\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sales figures could have been improved if similar advertising efforts were made before its release.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\" received critical acclaim, with an average critic score of 91% at GameRankings, making it the 11th-highest rated game of 2005. These include the Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\", who rated the game 37/40, the UK-based \"Edge\", who awarded an 8/10, and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", who granted 8.8/10. GameSpot's review gave it an 8.7, commenting that \"the game's aesthetic presentation is unparalleled, by any standard\", while multimedia website IGN hailed the game as \"an amazing experience\" and \"an absolute must-have title\", rating it 9.7/10. GameSpy described it as \"possibly the most innovative and visually arresting game of the year for the PS2\". A retrospective \"Edge\" article described the game as \"a fiction of unquestionable thematic richness, of riveting emotional power, whose fundamental artistic qualities are completely fused with its interactivity.\" Dave Ciccoricco, a literature lecturer at the University of Otago, praised the game for its use of long cutscenes and stretches of riding to make the player engage in self-reflection and feel immersed in the game world.\n\nMany reviewers consider the game's soundtrack to be one of its greatest aspects. In addition to \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s award of \"Soundtrack of the Year\", GameSpot commented that the musical score conveyed, and often intensified, the mood of any given situation, while it was described as \"one of the finest game soundtracks ever\" by a reviewer from Eurogamer.\n\nHowever, the game has been criticised for its erratic frame rate, which is usually smooth while traversing the landscape, but often slows down in fast-paced situations, such as colossus battles. Concern was also expressed about the game's camera, which was described by GameSpy as being \"as much of an opponent as the Colossi\", \"manag[ing] to re-center itself at the worst and most inopportune times\". Reviewers are often mixed about Agro's AI and controls; while gaming website Thunderbolt insists the realism of Agro's movement and behaviour \"create[s] a videogame experience unlike any other\", \"Edge\" commented that the controls were \"clumsy, crude, and unpredictable\". Other critics like Game Revolution and GameSpot felt the game was too short (average playthrough time estimated 6 to 8 hours), with little replay value given the puzzle elements to each colossus battle.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\" has received several awards, including recognition for \"Best Character Design\", \"Best Game Design\", \"Best Visual Arts\" and \"Game of the Year\", as well as one of three \"Innovation Awards\" at the 2006 Game Developers Choice Awards. At the 2006 DICE Summit, the game won the award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction\" at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, while it received one of two \"Special Rookie Awards\" at the Famitsu Awards 2005. It was nominated for \"Best Original Music\", \"Best Artistic Graphics\" and \"Best PS2 Game\", yet also \"Most Aggravating Frame Rate\" in GameSpot's awards for 2005, while it won \"Best Adventure Game\" and \"Best Artistic Design\" in IGN's Best of 2005 awards, who cited Agro as the best sidekick in the history of video games. Two years after its release IGN listed \"Shadow\" as the fourth greatest PlayStation 2 game of all time. Games Radar awarded it Best Game of the Year 2006 (being released in the UK in early 2006, later than the US), and appears in the site's \"The 100 best games ever\" list at number ten. The game's ending was selected as the fourth greatest moment in gaming by the editors of \"GamePro\" in July 2006. The readers of PlayStation Official Magazine voted it the 8th greatest PlayStation title ever released. Destructoid named the game #1 in their list of the top 50 video games of the decade. IGN named \"Shadow of the Colossus\" the best game of 2005, and the second best game of the decade, behind \"Half-Life 2\". In 2012, \"Complex\" magazine named \"Shadow of the Colossus\" the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time, behind \"God of War II\". In 2015, the game placed 4th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.\n\nThe game plays a significant role in the 2007 Mike Binder film \"Reign Over Me\" as one of the ways Adam Sandler's character copes with his primary struggle – with aspects of the game mirroring the tragedy that befell Sandler's character; \"Shadow of the Colossus\" falling giants mirroring the crashing towers of the September 11 attacks in which his wife and children died, and the game's lead character trying to resurrect his deceased love are two of the main themes which strike a similarity. Sandler is said to have ad libbed a detailed description of the control scheme in a scene with Don Cheadle, who plays his old friend. Both actors are said to have become experts at the game during the filming.\n\nIn April 2009, it was reported that Sony Pictures would adapt \"Shadow of the Colossus\" into a film. Kevin Misher, producer of \"The Scorpion King\", \"The Interpreter\" and the recent attempted remake of \"Dune\", negotiated to produce. It was announced that Fumito Ueda, the game's creator, would be involved in the film's production. On May 23, 2012, it was reported that \"Chronicle\" director Josh Trank would be directing the film adaptation. Seth Lochhead was due to write the film. In September 2014, Variety reported that \"Mama\" director Andrés Muschietti would direct the film after Trank dropped out due to his commitment to one of the upcoming \"Star Wars\" spin-off movies.\n"}

{"id": "2555739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2555739", "title": "Television in Germany", "text": "Television in Germany\n\nTelevision in Germany began in Berlin on 22 March 1935, broadcasting for 90 minutes three times a week. It was the first public television station in the world, named \"Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow\". The German television market had approximately 36.5 million television households in 2000, making it the largest television market in Europe. Nowadays, 95% of German households have at least one television receiver. All the main German TV channels are free-to-air.\n\nIn 1948 the British occupation forces allowed NWDR to broadcast television programmes for the British zone. Other regional networks also started to launch television in their own areas. Meanwhile, the GDR was launching its own television service, Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF), based on the Soviet model.\n\nA regular schedule began through the cooperation of all ARD members in 1954. Basic principles in the central areas of entertainment, information and enlightenment were established and television plays developed as the medium's own specific art form. Improvements in technology and programming, as well as reduced prices, led to a steady increase in licence holders, and the number of licenses passed the 1-million mark in October 1957.\n\nOn 1 April 1963, the long-promised second TV network, the Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (Second German Television) started. Unlike ARD, which was regionalized and had its roots in radio, ZDF was a centrally organized channel devoted solely to television. On 25 August 1967, at 9:30 a.m. on both ARD and ZDF, vice chancellor Willy Brandt started the era of colour TV in West Germany by pressing a symbolic launch button at the International Radio and TV Fair in West Berlin.\n\nEast Germany started DFF2 in 1969, and introduced colour programming on both channels. In 1972, the DFF was renamed, dropping the pretense of being an all-Germany service and becoming Fernsehen der DDR (GDR Television) or DDR-FS. Its two channels became known as DDR1 and DDR2.\n\nThe first two privately financed TV networks, RTL plus (short for Radio Television Luxemburg) and SAT 1, started their programming in West Germany in 1984. (Previously RTL broadcast from Luxembourg but was only received in parts of Southwestern Germany).\n\nAfter reunification, the TV stations of the German Democratic Republic were dissolved and the remnants were used to found new regional networks, e.g. the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (Central German Broadcasting), as part of the ARD. In addition, more private TV stations opened, becoming available through cable, satellite and in some cases, over the airwaves.\n\nToday, with almost 40 million TV households, 365 TV channels licensed in Germany and a total market volume of €9,615 million in 2008, Germany represents one of the biggest and most diversified TV markets in the world. The strongest revenue segment in Germany is public funding (€4,430 million in 2008), followed by advertising (€4,035 million) and subscription (1,150 € million). This dominant market position of public and advertisement funded free TV channels in Germany explains why the German pay TV segment is significantly underperforming in an international comparison.\n\nIn terms of total TV viewing market share Germany's market leaders in 2017 were again the two biggest public-service broadcasters (ZDF with 13.0% and Das Erste with 11.3%) and the two leading commercial channels (RTL with 9.2% and SAT.1 with 6.7%). The leading pay TV provider was Sky Deutschland (see below). The biggest teleshopping providers in Germany are QVC and HSE24.\n\nWith 18.1 million TV households satellite is the dominant TV infrastructure in Germany, followed by cable (17.9 million TV households) and terrestrial (3.8 million TV households). In a 2010 survey half of German television viewers said they often found nothing to watch on television.\n\nThe Germanophone sphere is the largest market for dubbing in Europe. Foreign TV shows and other formats are often dubbed into German, while subtitled formats with the original language are also becoming more popular.\n\nThe channels with the largest viewing share in 2017 are:\nThe combined share of ARD's so called Third Programmes (regional broadcasters WDR, NDR, SWR, etc.) was 12.4% in 2014\n\nGermany's sole subscription channel Premiere had its heyday around the millennium. Premiere offered telecasts of the German football league – the Bundesliga, but they lost the broadcasting rights in 2006 to a newly formed competitor – Arena. Premiere was the brainchild of the former television czar, Leo Kirch. He went into insolvency after a decade of losing viewers from his subscription channel, DF1 (Digital TV 1). The company regained some ground with its new manager Georg Kofler.\n\nIn 2005, several German cable companies created a new challenger to Premiere - ARENA. The participating companies are iesy (Hesse) and ish (TV) (North Rhine-Westphalia) through their combined partnership called \"Unity Media\". Arena, a rather small company, wanted to buy the pay-TV rights to the German Bundesliga and won by a decision of the marketing directorate of the DFL. The rights to broadcast the Bundesliga is regarded as lucrative in the German television market, so previous rights holders Premiere suffered a wounding blow to their business model. Arena held the rights from 2006 to 2008. Further negotiations were due in 2008 for the broadcasting of the Bundesliga.\n\nAs stated above, the ARD was the first German broadcasting station. It has a federally orientated structure. At present, nine regional TV stations cooperate to produce programs for the TV network known as \"Das Erste\" (\"The First\"):\n\n\nSeven of these broadcasters run their own regional TV programs (\"The Third\"), most of them use several frequencies and show local opt-outs.\nWhile multi-state-broadcasters NDR, RBB, MDR and SWR have state versions (e.g. RBB Berlin, MDR Sachsen, NDR Hamburg), BR and WDR have regional opt-outs below state level (BR: North and South, WDR: 11 versions).\nSome small regions, such as Bremen (RB) and the Saarland (SR), have their own broadcasting stations, mainly for historical reasons. They only contribute to the nationwide TV program \"Das Erste\" and produce a state opt-out for their neighbour broadcaster (SR-Fernsehen on SWR, Radio Bremen TV on NDR).\n\n\nGermany has run a regular Teletext service since 1 June 1980 on the public broadcasting channels. Almost all German TV stations have teletext.\n\n\nDigital satellite television has been officially available in Germany since 1996. Prior to May 2012, most of the 30+ TV stations broadcast their \"satellite\" signal using both analogue and digital (DVB-S); however, all analogue satellite broadcasts ceased on 30 April 2012.\n\nThere is currently a single pay TV satellite operator in Germany - Sky Deutschland. Prior to being known as Sky, the service was named Premiere; it (along with its former owner Leo Kirch) got into serious financial trouble due to its early and proprietary usage of encryption (Betacrypt, D-box). Subsequently, Premiere was bought by News Corporation and renamed Sky, in keeping with their satellite services elsewhere in Europe (Sky (UK and Ireland) and Sky Italia).\n\nIn late 2004 German channel group ProSieben showed a BBC documentary and a self-produced TV movie in 1080i via MPEG-2 DVB-S, followed by the Hollywood films \"Spider-Man\" and \"Men in Black II\" in March 2005. These were intended to be a test for future commercial HD services.\n\nRegular free to air broadcast of the HD versions of ProSieben and Sat.1 began on 26 October 2005. Unlike the test broadcasts, DVB-S2 and MPEG-4 AVC were used. Both ProSieben HD and Sat.1 HD ceased their unencrypted broadcasts in 2008; encrypted HD broadcasting of both channels resumed under the HD+ brand (which also included other commercial channels; see below) in January 2010.\n\nPremiere, after several delays, started broadcasting three HD channels — one each dedicated to films, sports and documentaries — in November 2005, although there were virtually no suitable, certified receivers available on the market. The content was also sparse and thus often repeated. Sky (formerly Premiere) reuses its proprietary digital rights management system embedded into its content scrambling system (Nagravision) from SD broadcasts to block analogue output of the movie channel from the receiving set-top box altogether, only allowing HDCP-secured transmissions; the other channels are less restricted.\n\nOn 1 November 2009 the premium HD+ service launched with two channels, RTL HD and Vox HD, with Sat.1 HD, ProSieben HD and Kabel eins HD joining the service in January 2010. DSF HD (now called Sport1 HD) began test broadcasts in August 2010 and launched fully on HD+ on 1 November 2010, followed by Sixx HD and RTL2 HD on 1 December 2010. In June 2011, Comedy Central HD, Nickelodeon HD and N24 HD joined service, bringing the number of channels offered to 11. In April 2011, HD+ became available to Sky Deutschland subscribers without the need for an HD+ CAM and viewing card (although an additional subscription is still required).\n\nCurrently (as of May 2012) all satellite HDTV channels are broadcast using the h.264 codec. As of July 2014, most material is upscaled SD content.\n\nPrior to 30 April 2012 there were eight free-to-air HDTV channels originating in Germany broadcast via satellite: Das Erste HD, ZDF HD, Arte HD, Anixe HD, EinsFestival HD, sonnenklar.TV HD, QVC HD and HSE24 HD. After 30 April 2012, when all analogue satellite broadcasts ceased, ten additional FTA HD channels became available (all of which are public service channels): Phoenix HD, NDR HD, WDR HD, BR HD, SWR HD, ZDFneo HD, ZDFinfo HD, ZDFkultur HD, 3sat HD and KiKa HD. \nFrom December 2013 on all PSB channels except ARD-alpha, SR Fernsehen and Radio Bremen TV are available in HD.\n\nCable transmission is still mostly analog with usually about 30 available channels. DVB-C transmission started in 2004 with pay TV Premiere and digital versions of the analogue channels.\n\nThe rather late changeover to DVB was caused both by the long process of selling the infrastructure of former monopolist Deutsche Telekom to others and the fact that the cable network ends at the curb or property, with the in-house cable in large apartment buildings being operated by a different company. Due to this, the new owners of Deutsche Telekom's cable network were in many cases not able to offer new products directly to the viewer.\n\nBy 2006, there were three major cable operators, Unity Media in Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg and by far the largest, Kabel Deutschland in the other 13 states. Today, all companies offer about 200 TV channels by DVB-C, which includes some 70 channels at no extra charge as well as a number of pay-per-view offers and subscription-based packages (like the HD-broadcasts of privately owned channels, comparable to HD+ on satellite). In addition to that pay TV broadcaster Sky Deutschland is also available.\n\nIn some very large apartment complexes a number of local and national companies operate an in-house cable network which is fed solely by its own satellite antenna on the building, not the local cable operator. The satellite channels are either transcoded into analogue transmission, receivable by any TV set without extra equipment, or into DVB-C.\n\nAs of 2014, still 17.2% of Germany transmits television with analogue cable signals, compared to 29.1% of digital cable; this similar to the situation in the Netherlands, Sweden and Belgium, where analogue cable is also still widely used.\n\nTerrestrial reception had lost most of its users by the 1990s due to extensive cable and satellite coverage. In a two step process analogue terrestrial TV broadcasting in the states of Berlin and Brandenburg was switched off in 2003 and replaced by DVB-T, in 2005, about two-third of Germany's states began to replace analogue transmission. By 2006, all metropolitan and most rural areas had moved to digital transmission. Today, only foreign army bases and some local TV stations still broadcast on analogue.\n\nWhile the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF transmit throughout Germany, commercial stations often are only available within metropolitan areas, so the number of available channels varies between about 10 and 30. All DVB-T1 channels were free-to-air and the broadcasters rented transmission services directly from a transmitter operator, usually Media Broadcast. ARD stations also use their own transmitters.\n\nIn June 2016, a gradual switch-over from DVB-T with MPEG-2 encoding to DVB-T2 with HEVC encoding has commenced. The first phase included one new multiplex broadcasting six channels in selected urban areas, in addition to the old DVB-T standard. The DVB-T2 channels are broadcasting in 1080p50. The commercial channels are encrypted and part of the \"Freenet TV\"-Package. The final switch-over to DVB-T2 occurred in steps, starting with major metropolitan areas who switched on 29 March 2017. The last transmitter is planned to switch in 2019.\n\nAlmost all fictional programs on German television are regular TV series. While the public broadcaster(s) predominantly own(s) the productions that are broadcast, the private stations/networks often put on series licensed from abroad, mainly the United States. Peaking in the 1990s, the private channels had aired self-produced series such as \"Der Clown\" (1996–2000), \"Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei\" (Alarm for Cobra 11 - The Motorway Police) (since 1996), \"The Sentinel\" (1994–1996), \"Alpha Team - The Lifesaver in OP\" (1996–2005) or \"Wolff's Turf\" (mainly from 1992 to 2006) with great success. Since the late 2000s, the amount of original series on the private broadcasters has markedly declined.\n\nThe highest-rated series is the crime drama \"Tatort\", which airs almost every Sunday on public broadcaster ARD. It has run since 1970 and has featured several casts, that are not related to each other.\n\n"}

The feature's creative staff came largely from Magazine Management's sister company, Marvel Comics.\n\nA bawdy but non-pornographic, tongue-in-cheek secret agent comics feature, \"Pussycat\" was launched following the success of Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder's color comics feature \"Little Annie Fanny\", published in \"Playboy\" magazine from 1962 to the 1980s. Long-established comic-book artist Wally Wood — whose own similar 1968-1974 \"Sally Forth\" would run in armed services publications — created the 1965 premiere, in which Pussycat, a secretary for S.C.O.R.E. (Secret Council of Ruthless Extroverts) is recruited to fight the agency's archenemsis, L.U.S.T. Artist Jim Mooney retouched over Wood's work for the reprint in the 1968 stand-alone issue.\n\nThe feature premiered in \"Male Annual\" #3 (1965), and ran in at least \"Male Annual\" #4-5 (1966–1967), \"Stag Annual\" #3 (1966), and in issues of \"Men\" and \"Stag\".\n\nAs Mooney recalled in 2000, \"[I]n the early '70s, I did work for Goodman's men's magazines, a strip called 'Pussycat'. Stan [Lee] wrote the first one I did, and then his brother Larry [Lieber] wrote the ones that came later\".\n\nThe later strips abandoned this \"ditzy spy\" format and turned her into a savvy investigative reporter, who continually managed to find herself in situations where her clothes were torn off, voluntarily removed, or otherwise caused to \"be elsewhere\" by various events and situations. Usually, this was played to her advantage, as she used the distractions to stop the nefarious plots of the bad guys and get her story.\n\nOther talent from Goodman's Marvel Comics who contributed to the \"Pussycat\" series include writer Ernie Hart, and artists Al Hartley and Bill Everett. Contributing separately was the notable \"good girl art\" cartoonist Bill Ward.\n\nEight five-page episodes were collected in a one-shot, black-and-white comics magazine cover-dated October 1968, and titled \"The Adventures of Pussycat\" on its trademarked cover logo and simply \"Pussycat\" in the copyright information in its postal indicia. The cover price of 35 cents matched that of the same publisher's black-and-white Marvel Comics magazine \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\", released the same year but with an original, newly published story.\n\nThe one-shot has no ads except a back-cover advertisement for Jade East cologne. It also contains an unclothed but non-nude centerfold. In addition to seven reprinted stories, the comic included an original five-page Pussycat tale, \"The Hidden Hippie Caper\", by writer Larry Lieber and artist Jim Mooney.\n\nLarry Graber is credited as the comic book's art director, and Lew Holloway as associate art director.\n\n\"This list is incomplete, and except for the first episode, the order is uncertain\"\n\n\n\n"}

The poem was intended for a spring fertility ritual and recited by one of his brides.\n\nThe Call to Poetry featured readings from contemporary Egyptian poet Hesham Al-Gak, a 2011 contestant on the Arab world's popular American Idol-style TV program based in Abu Dhabi called \"Prince of Poets\". During the Egyptian revolution, Al-Gak used the competition to recite poems critical of Egyptian leaders and departed \"Prince of Poets\"'s Abu Dhabi studios to visit Cairo to compose and recite verse at the height of protests there.\n\nCall to Poetry organizer, American writer Dan Boylan cited Beat Generation figure Allen Ginsberg as an influence on the evening. Having met Ginsberg as a teenager, Boylan premiered Istanbul-inspired sound poetry during the event, which included music and an over-capacity crowd that listened from outside the venue. American journalist David Trilling served as the first Call to Poetry's master of ceremonies and New Zealand Poet Fred Simpon released his book of verse, “Lucky Me!” during the event.\n"}

The authors were supportive of the new stereophonic recordings. Their first sentence stated “Let us begin by stating, unequivocally that good stereo on quite modest equipment is infinitely superior, domestically, to any other form of sound reproduction”.\n\nThe arrangement of the discographies is alphabetical by composer, except that volume 9 covers anthologies (orchestral music, instrumental music, vocal music, and humour on records) and is organised by artist.\n\nRecordings receive brief critical reviews which consider the music, performance standards, and recorded sound. Manufacturers catalogue numbers are included. Records are rated with a star system from *** to *.\n\nFour reviewers compiled these books: Edward Greenfield, Ivan March, Denis Stevens, and Robert Layton. Layton joined the reviewers with volume 5-6 (1968), and Stevens left the project after those volumes were published (he died in 2004).\n\nTwo volumes titled \"A Guide to Bargain Classics\" (1962-1964) were also compiled by these authors and published by the Long Playing Record Library.\n\nPenguin Books published three volumes of guides to bargain records (1966, 1970 and 1972).\n\nPenguin Books took over publication of these discographies in 1975, starting with the \"Penguin Stereo Record Guide\". Four decades after the first publication; Greenfield, March, and Layton continued to review thousands of recordings.\n\n"}
