{"id": "509261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=509261", "title": "Apidya", "text": "Apidya\n\nApidya (titled in Japanese characters below the title) is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed by Kaiko and released by Play Byte in 1992 for the Amiga. It was Kaiko's second game developed. Despite being labelled II in the title it is not a sequel to any game, but has the digits placed there simply for a gag. \n\nThe story revolves around Ikuro, whose wife Yuri has been poisoned by Hexaae, an evil lord of black magic. Ikuro uses magic to transform into a deadly bee and vows to find an antidote for Yuri and wreak revenge on Hexaae.\n\nThe game is a horizontally scrolling shooter, with some elements similar to early, classic shoot 'em ups. The player controls a bee capable of launching a number of projectiles which can damage or destroy enemy targets. The game uses the power-up bar system pioneered by \"Gradius\". Destroyed enemies sometimes leave a power-up in the form of a red-and-yellow flower. The player may collect these flowers and activate new weapons and enhancements. A 'build-up' weapon, similar to the 'beam' weapon in \"R-Type\", also features. If the fire button is held down for a second or two, the bee produces a hissing noise and releasing the fire button will then cause the bee to fire a large, organic projectile (a giant bee sting) which can wipe out waves of small enemies, or damage larger ones. If the player's bee is hit by enemy fire or crashes into the terrain, a life will be lost and the current stage is restarted except for the end bosses of the first 3 stages, that will continue till all lives are lost. Once all lives are lost the game ends. A co-operative two-player mode is possible, in which the second player controls a smaller companion drone, which can launch small projectiles and shield the first player. The drone can sustain 5 small projectiles per life but won't survive large projectiles or collisions and the stage doesn't reset if it dies, the large bee is the alpha which must survive to advance. The alpha bee dying resets the stage as with normal play minus end stage bosses for the first 3 stages.\nAn alternating two player mode is also possible.\n\nThe game consists of five themed levels: a meadow, a pond, a sewer filled with mutated enemies, a bio-technological machine and a final level where the player must battle five final bosses. The final level offers plenty of points for slain enemies, offering a semi status quo for players as they will recover some lost lives from restarting the level.\nEach level is divided up into a number of stages (usually three where the last is the end boss, that doesn't reset upon losing a life only on credit). There are also a number of hidden bonus levels. In the first two levels, nearly all the enemies are real creatures which may be found in a meadow or pond. The later levels feature mutant and inorganic creations. During \"Techno Party\", the bee morphs into a more mechanized form for the duration of that level. The first boss is unique, it cannot be harmed so the player must survive till it vacates the game.\nThere are four difficultly settings. When the difficulty is set to \"easy\", it is not possible to play the last level, the ending sequence is skipped and the player is directed straight to the end credits.\n\nThe musical soundtrack to the game was composed by game musician Chris Hülsbeck. A high-quality arrangement of the soundtrack was released as a CD album in 1992. The soundtrack of level 4 features several samples from L.A. Style's \"James Brown Is Dead\".\n\nThere have also been live performances of the game's music:\n\n\nThe game was largely praised as a fine example of the shoot 'em up genre. Amiga Power magazine described the game as offering \"more playability than any other shoot 'em up\" and awarded the game 89% in 1992. Amiga Format magazine awarded the game 90%.\n\nAn unofficial GBA Apidya technical demo followed years later and an unofficial Windows remake of the first level was released in 2002 but neither was ever completed.\n"}

Some who walk also dance; others compete in drag categories, designed to emulate other genders and social classes. Most participants in ball culture belong to groups known as \"houses\".<ref name=\"HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for\"></ref>\n\nHouses serve as alternative families, primarily consisting of Black and Latino gay, gender nonconforming and transgender youth, and are meant to be safe spaces. Houses are led by “mothers” and “fathers,” providing guidance and support for their house “children.” Most houses operate in the same way. Houses exist across the United States and in over 15 cities, most being in the northeast. The major cities are New York, Newark, Jersey City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., as well as Oakland and the San Francisco Bay Area. Houses that win a lot of trophies and gain recognition, reach a rank of \"legendary.\" Notable houses include House of Ninja (founded by Willi Ninja), House of Aviance (founded by Mother Juan Aviance), House of Xtravaganza (founded by Hector Xtravaganza, né Hector Valle), House of Princess, House of Infiniti, House of Mizrahi (founded by Jack and Andre Mizrahi), House of LaBeija (founded by Crystal LaBeija), House of Dupree (founded by Paris Dupree), House of Amazon (founded by Leoimy Maldonado), House of Mugler (founded by David, Raliegh and Julian), House Balenciaga (founded by Harold Balenciaga), House of Ebony (founded by Larry Ebony), and the House of Garcon (founded by Whitney and Shannon Garcon). Typically house members adopt the name of their house as their last name. Historically, four categories of gender exist within houses: Butch queens, femme queens, butches, and women.\n\nHouses \"walk\" (compete) against one another in \"balls\" judged on dance skills (voguing), costumes, appearance, and attitude. Participants dress according to the category in which they are competing, and are expected to display appropriate \"realness\". Balls are influenced by hip hop fashion and music. The largest balls last as long as ten hours, with dozens of categories in a single evening. With fewer spectators, nearly everyone comes to compete; some trophies are tall, and a grand-prize winner can earn $1,000 or more. Although some competitive walks involve crossdressing, in other cases the goal is to accentuate a male participant's masculinity or a female participant's femininity as a parody of heterosexuality. Voguing consists of five elements: duckwalk, catwalk, hands, floorwork, and spins & dips.\n\nSome categories include: \n\nAs a countercultural phenomenon, ball culture is rooted in necessity and defiance.\n\nAccording to findings by Dr. Genny Beemyn addressed in their book \"Trans Bodies, Trans Selves\", members of the underground LGBTQ+ community in large cities of the late nineteenth century began to organize masquerade balls known as \"drags\" in direct defiance of laws banning citizens from wearing clothes of the opposite gender.\n\nIn his essay \"Spectacles of Colors\", Langston Hughes describes his experience at a drag ball in the 1920s.\"Strangest and gaudiest of all Harlem spectacles in the '20s, and still the strangest and gaudiest, is the annual Hamilton Club Lodge Ball at Rockland Palace Casino. I once attended as a guest of A'Lelia Walker. It is the ball where men dress as women and women dress as men. During the height of the New Negro era and the tourist invasion of Harlem, it was fashionable for the intelligentsia and social leaders of both Harlem and the downtown area to occupy boxes at this ball and look down from above at the queerly assorted throng on the dancing floor, males in flowing gowns and feathered headdresses and females in tuxedoes and box-back suits.\" —Langston HughesIn the subsequent decades, drag balls eventually developed the modern, mainstream format we know today.\n\nThe modern ballroom culture has existed for at least five decades. However, it remains largely underground and unknown for this particular community of Black and Latino queer youth. It began in Harlem more than 50 years ago, and has now expanded rapidly to other major cities such as Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia. Moreover, with the advancements of social media, it has migrated to other countries such as Canada, Japan, and the UK. Ball culture also known as \"house ball culture,\" was first captured in Jennie Livingston's documentary, \"Paris is Burning\" (1990).\n\nCross dressing balls had existed since the thirties, consisting of primarily white men, they competed in fashion shows in bars 2 or 3 times a year. Black queens would sometimes participate but rarely won any prizes. Due to discrimination, Black queens Crystal Labeija and her friend Lottie began their own drag ball titled 'House of Labeija,' kickstarting the ballroom scene in New York. In 1989, The House of Latex was created as a call to action in the ballroom community to bridge the gap between HIV-STI prevention and ballroom culture.\n\nThis account from the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area describes how ball culture and drag houses developed about 1960:\n\nSome regular house parties became institutionalized as drag \"houses\" and \"families.\" The leader, or \"mother,\" often provided not only the opportunity for parties but also instruction and mentoring in the arts of make-up, selecting clothes, lip-synching, portraying a personality, walking, and related skills. Those taught became \"drag daughters,\" who in turn mentored others, creating entire \"drag families.\" Drag houses became the first social support groups in the city's gay and lesbian community. House names often came from addresses of the house 'mother', such as Mother Billy Bonhill's Belmont House at 15th and Belmont NW, or associations with the \"mother's\" chosen personality, as Mame Dennis's Beekman Place.\n\nThe dance styles which later characterized drag houses had not been developed; competitions between houses involved standard drag performances in which entertainers lip-synced or, rarely, sang. In contrast to the New York houses in Paris Is Burning, some of the Washington, D.C. house mothers were white. However, African-American drag queens were a prominent part of the community:\n\nVenues for drag shows and competitions were a constant challenge in the 1960s. The Uptown Lounge sponsored monthly drag contests, an event later duplicated at Johnnie's on Capitol Hill. Chunga's drag shows at the Golden Key Club in North Beach, Maryland were a popular Sunday event. The major hotels' resistance to drag events was not broken until February 1968 when African-American drag impresario Black Pearl staged the gala Black Pearl International Awards at the Washington Hilton. It was the drag event of the year.\n\nThe Washington, D.C. ball community consists primarily of African-American and Latino participants, and has adopted many attributes seen in Paris Is Burning. Nineteen-sixties-style drag shows and competitions still exist, with their own audience. Ball patrons will find similar categories (such as \"banjee thug realness\" and \"vogue\") as an audience member.\n\nThe Washington ballroom scene was founded in 1986 by Icon Lowell Adonis-Khanh (Lowell Thomas Hickman) and Icon Eric Christian-Bazaar. During the 1990s, more houses appeared in the area due to the efforts of Twain Miyake-Mugler (\"father\" of the House of Miyake Mugler, D.C. Chapter), Icon Harold Balenciaga (founder of the house of Balenciaga), Icons Shannon Garcon and Whitney Garcon (founders of the House of Garcon and charter members of The Legendary House of Miyake-Mugler). The city hosts a series of annual balls, in which contestants compete for trophies and cash prizes.\n\nNew York's legendary ballroom culture has had a huge culture impact from the 1980s until the present day.\n\nThe most notable influence of ball culture on mainstream society is voguing, a dance style originating in Harlem ballrooms during the first half of the 20th century and popularized by the video for Madonna's \"Vogue\", released in 1990 (one year before the documentary \"Paris Is Burning\"). The dance group Vogue Evolution, from \"America's Best Dance Crew\", has again sparked interest in voguing. \n\nVogueing was a powerful dance movement that originated in '70s and '80s New York among the predominantly black gay community in Harlem. Vogueing started in Drag Balls that were held by the queer community of color. The competitions were divided up into Houses that then competed in different categories, in which one of the categories was Voguing. It was during these dance offs that 'vogueing' was born. It was a non-violent battle of elegance and femininity named after a certain fashion magazine as it mirrored the poses held by models. It was all about arm and hand movements, with dancers often playing out elaborate scenes such as applying makeup or taking phone calls while dancing down the catwalk.\n\nWilli Ninja was recognized as the \"Grandfather of Vogue.\" Vogueing with its angular body movements, exaggerated model poses and intricate mime-like choreography and the colorful characters who populated Willi Ninja's world were introduced to the public at large by “Paris Is Burning,” the award-winning 1990 documentary about New York’s drag vogue-ball scene. Vogueing had been around for years, but Willi Ninja brought it to a level of visibility and perfection in performance that no one had ever reached.\n\nBall-culture terms are sometimes used more generally; \"drag mother\" may apply to any drag queen in a mentorship role, and \"drag house\" may refer to a group of drag performers allied personally or professionally. \"Fierce\" and \"fierceness,\" \"work it\" and \"working it,\" \"fabulous\" and \"fabulousness\" are heard in \"Paris Is Burning\" and appeared in the lyrics of \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", a 1992 hit by drag queen RuPaul. These terms became more widely used in gay slang, fashion industry jargon and mainstream colloquial language.\n\nBall culture has been fertile ground for new forms of house music and other genres of electronic dance music through its DJs. The culture has also influenced a wave of queer hip hop artists such as Zebra Katz, House of Ladosha and Le1f .\n\nBall culture has influenced \"the über-puffed-up peacock sexuality\" of contemporary mainstream hip hop. A professor at New York University said about gay black culture, \"Today's queer mania for ghetto fabulousness and bling masks its elemental but silent relationship to even more queer impulses toward fabulousness in the 1980s.\"\n\nIn 2006, Beyoncé told a reporter from \"The Independent\" \"how inspired she's been by the whole drag-house circuit in the States, an unsung part of black American culture where working-class gay men channel ultra-glamour in mocked-up catwalk shows. 'I still have that in me', she says of the 'confidence and the fire you see on stage...'\"\n\nMost of the New York-based houses appeared in the 1991 documentary film \"Paris Is Burning\". The 2016 film \"Kiki\" provided an updated portrait of the ball culture scene. In 2017, as part of a documentary series on New Zealand cultural identity, Vice Media produced an episode about New Zealand's ball culture, entitled \"FAFSWAG: Auckland's Underground Vogue Scene\".\n\nIn 2018, Viceland aired a docuseries, \"My House\", following six people in the New York City ball culture. In the spring of 2018, the television series \"Pose\" premiered. Set in New York City 1987, it follows participants in Ball Culture, as well as others in 1980s New York. The show was created by Steven Canals, Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy.\n\n\n"}

All the same skills apply in both genres. The first takes place in a theatre, and typically involves the theatre's permanent fly system. The other in an arena or \"exposed structure venue\" such as a convention center, ballroom, warehouse etc. Many arena riggers find themselves hanging a full proscenium theater in an arena environment.\n\nCircus rigging, comprising aerial acrobatic apparatuses that support human beings under dynamic loading conditions, and stabilization rigging for large scale fabric tension structures (big tops), is, perhaps, under appreciated in the general rigging field, and may be considered by some to be a separate field. However, the principles of physics and the standards of engineering that apply to theatrical and arena rigging still hold true in circus rigging, and much of the same equipment and many of the same devices are commonly used. All the same skills apply in this genre as well.\n\nChain motors and trusses are not used as often in tented circuses as in arena or theater rigging, however arena circuses make regular use of them. In both tented and arena circuses, crane-bars or frames stabilized by guy cables, hung from fiber rope block and tackle systems are common, as are systems supporting and tensioning safety nets.\n\nHigh (or low) wire rigging, while simple in principle and application, requires substantial load-path capacity, as wire walkers generally require high tension in their systems.\n\nAutomation rigging is used by many circuses, to fly both human beings and scenic or prop elements.\n\nIn theatrical rigging the venue may have anything from a dead pull scenery flying system, a hemp rigging system, a counterweight rigging system, a winch or hoist driven automated rigging system, or any hybrid of the aforementioned, used to fly props, people and scenery.\n\nBoth of these rigging disciplines have four basic stations.\n\nMaintains safe perimeters underneath high work being done, maintains a safe path and perimeter around aerial work platforms, monitors the movement of aerial work platforms, assembles rigging on the ground for high work being done, attaches gear and assemblies to lines for high work being done, marks or \"lays \" out points on the floor and moves designators for high work (rigging points and laser plumbs), assembles and checks out motion control systems, makes attachments to lifting frames, lighting trusses, audio, video and scenery for hoisting or flying, does visual and mechanical safety inspections.\n\nHas all of the skills and responsibility of a ground rigger and must also be able to operate an aerial work platform, must be able to identify suitable structure and attachment for rigging, must be able to lift 100 lbs, must have advanced rope skills, be able to apply rope work mechanical advantages, as well as knowledge of materials, manufacturing methods and the proper applications of different rigging systems..\n\nIs virtually identical to a bucket rigger, only they apply their trade while standing, sitting on or hanging from an exposed structural member.\n\nHas all of the previous skills and responsibilities of the other 3 riggers and they must also have exceptional rope skills. They must also be very physically fit and able to pull their own body weight up into structural ceilings on belay while applying personal fall protection as they go. They must be proficient with harness positioning systems and advanced rope friction and hauling systems.\n\nMost entertainment rigging training is done either by apprenticeship or formal training through unions i.e. IATSE. The recognized entertainment rigging certification is the E.T.C.P. arena and theater rigging certification programs.\n"}

Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the seventh entry in the \"Hitman\" video game series and is the sequel to the 2016 game \"Hitman\". The game was released on 13 November 2018 and was met with generally positive reviews.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Hitman\", Agent 47 embarks on a mission to hunt the mysterious \"Shadow Client\" and disassemble his militia. His first lead is the location of one of the Shadow Client's lieutenants, Alma Reynard. 47 is able to gain some intel on the Shadow Client's activities from Reynard's home in New Zealand before eliminating her. Impressed with 47's performance, Providence authorizes him and the ICA to hunt down the rest of the Shadow Client's militia. When 47 asks Diana why the ICA would be willing to work with Providence, she replies that both organizations share interests in putting a stop to the Shadow Client, whose activities are now causing a global panic. She also reveals that Providence secretly promised to her to reveal 47's past.\n\nFollowing the intel gained from Reynard, 47 is sent to Miami to assassinate tech giant Robert Knox and his daughter Sierra, the owner and heir of Kronstadt Industries. Not only have they secretly sold advanced weapons to war criminals, but they are also Providence members who defected to the Shadow Client's side, presumably to protect themselves from his attacks. Meanwhile, the remaining members of Providence descend into consternation as more of their operatives are killed worldwide. Despite this, Providence manages to identify the Shadow Client as Lucas Grey, the former head of security to deceased Providence key-holder Eugene Cobb. Grey, now located in Central Europe, pursues his own plans with hacktivist Olivia Hall and insists that they need 47's help if they are to dismantle Providence.\n\n47 heads to Colombia next in order to assassinate drug lord Rico Delgado and his top lieutenants, who have been using their smuggling network to aid Grey and his militia. Diana reports the mission's success to Providence while visiting the graves of her family in Surrey. Flashbacks reveal that she witnessed her parents being killed by a car bomb after they attempted to bring the company responsible for her brother's death to court. Shortly after Grey steals an item from the Ether Corporation in Johannesburg, his militia use a hostage situation to publicly reveal Providence's existence. 47 is then sent to Mumbai to track down and eliminate the pirates who killed a Providence operative in Shanghai. After the mission, 47 follows Grey's trail to Romania, back to the very same asylum where he was created by Dr. Ort-Meyer. He encounters Grey, who reveals that they were both previously kept in the lab to be raised as assassins for Providence. 47 regains some of his memories, remembering that Grey was Subject 6, and that they both made a pact to take revenge on those responsible for turning them into assassins.\n\nThe revelation leads to Diana meeting with Grey and Hall in Berlin. Grey reveals that Ort-Meyer, the scientist responsible for his and Agent 47's creation, was a member of Providence, who are controlled by a leader known as \"the Constant\" and three executive members known as \"the Partners.\" After Grey and 47's original plan to take down the Partners failed, they decided to erase 47's memories, though Grey was able to escape before his memories were wiped. Grey's current objective is to capture the Constant, as he is the only person who knows the identities of the Partners. His only lead, however, is that 47 knew the identity of the first Constant. Grey then reveals that the item he had stolen from the Ether Corporation was an antidote that may counteract 47's memory loss. Initially reluctant to work with Grey, Diana eventually abides by 47's wish to take the antidote. The antidote allows 47 to remember that the first Constant was a legendary Cold War spymaster codenamed \"Janus\". In order to get close to Janus, Diana files a false report implicating Janus as the true Shadow Client while claiming Grey was just a subordinate, giving 47 pretext to infiltrate Janus' home in the suburbs of Vermont.\n\nInvestigating several clues, Agent 47 finds evidence that Janus was planning to meet the Constant at a gala held by \"The Ark Society,\" a plutocratic survivalist group created within Providence. Hall is able to pinpoint the meeting location on a remote island in the North Atlantic, but they find out that the Constant, revealed as the man who hired Diana and 47 at the end of \"Hitman\", has implanted himself with a suicide chip that will instantly release lethal poison into his body if he is compromised. 47 is then dispatched to eliminate Zoe and Sophia Washington, twin sisters and newly appointed chairwomen of the Ark Society who each hold a kill-switch for the Constant. Once the Washington sisters are neutralized, 47 and Grey proceed to capture and extract the Constant. 47, Grey, and Diana interrogate the Constant, pointing out that by being captured, his life is forfeit to the Partners. Defeated, the Constant reveals that Providence is made up of the Ingram, Carlisle, and Stuyvesant families, with each family having a representative that serves as a \"Partner.\"\n\nAs 47 and Grey head out to confront the three families, the Constant taunts Diana about facts she still doesn't know about Agent 47. A final flashback reveals that 47 was responsible for the car bomb that killed Diana's parents all along.\n\n\"Hitman 2\" gameplay is similar to its 2016 predecessor, as Agent 47, a contract assassin working for the International Contract Agency (ICA), travels to various locations around the globe to eliminate high-profile targets. The game features six missions, which are set in six distinct locations. One of the missions in the game will take place at a racetrack in Miami, where 47 must assassinate one of the drivers and her tech mogul father, while another, set in the fictional area of Santa Fortuna, Colombia, has him hunting the leaders of a local cartel.\n\nThe other four missions of the game were announced on 23 October 2018. The locations are Hawke's Bay, Mumbai, a fictional Vermont suburb, and the mysterious Isle of Sgàil in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe game introduces concussive gadgets, which can be used to render an NPC unconscious, and reintroduces the briefcase, which allows the player to conceal and carry large weapons, such as sniper rifles, in public without arousing suspicion. The game's announcement was accompanied by the release of a cooperative multiplayer mode titled \"Sniper Assassin\", available immediately to those who pre-order \"Hitman 2\". This mode is also bundled with all copies of \"Hitman 2\" when the game releases. In this mode, players are tasked with eliminating targets using a sniper rifle within a set time limit. In addition to Agent 47, players can play as Knight and Stone, both of whom have access to unique ammo types.\n\nAs with its predecessor, \"Hitman 2\" features the time-limited \"Elusive Targets\" missions. British actor Sean Bean portrays the first Elusive Target in the game.\n\nThe game was announced on 7 June 2018 during a livestream by WB Games. \"Hitman 2\" was released on 13 November 2018, although those who have pre-ordered the game's gold edition or collector's edition gain access to the game four days early: on 9 November. Unlike its predecessor, \"Hitman 2\" is not episodic.\n\nThe game has two paid expansions following its release, adding locations, missions, sniper maps, outfits, and weapons. Gold edition owners get both expansions at no cost while silver edition owners get only the first expansion for free.\n\n\"Hitman 2\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nGamespot gave the game a positive review writing, “Hitman 2 is a familiar experience, but in the Hitman world, familiarity is an incredible strength“. The Verge also praised the game writing, “Hitman 2 is the most refined and rewarding game in the series” noting it was a flawless execution.\n\nTrusted Reviews rated the game 9/10, writing, “Hitman 2 is an iterative rework of the formula set up by 2016’s bold Hitman reboot. It’s the best Hitman game so far, and I’d absolutely recommend it wholeheartedly”. The Guardian gave the game 4/5 stars, writing, “Assassination missions that reward subterfuge – such as wearing a giant flamingo suit or loosening a racing driver’s wheel – make this a surprisingly creative sequel”. Screen Rant also spoke highly positive of the game, giving it 4/5 stars, adding that the game is an Impressive Assassination Simulation. Geek.com also spoke positive of the game, writing, “Hitman 2 is the New Gold Standard for Stealth Games”.\n\n\"Hitman 2\" debuted at tenth place in the UK's all-format sales charts, selling 90% fewer copies than \"\". It released in a competitive week that also saw the launch of new releases including \"\", \"Spyro Reignited Trilogy\" and \"Fallout 76\".\n"}

After retiring from the stage in the 1910s, he became a prolific art collector and dealer and also painted his own original works.\n\nDecades after his death, art conservators discovered that Bloom was the perpetrator of an art forgery involving an oil portrait that he claimed depicted the wife of President Abraham Lincoln, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln.\n\nBloom was born Ludwig Pflum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Ludwig and Louisa (\"née\" Moyer) Pflum. His parents, who immigrated from Germany, had six other children: Susannah, Susan Deborah, Louisa, Charles, Edward and Adolph (who died as a child). Bloom's father worked as a cooper. The family eventually moved to Reading, Pennsylvania where Bloom attended Poplar Street School. Around 1871, the family moved to Williamsburg where Bloom began working as a jockey. In 1873, he joined the Potter Hart Colossus Circus where he performed a \"bounding jockey act\" in which he rode horses and performed acrobatics. During his time at the circus, \"Ludwig Pflum\" changed his name to \"Lew Bloom\" and would use that name for the remainder of his performing career.\n\nBloom spent several years touring in variety shows with his jockey act before relocating to Dover, Delaware where he competed in horse match races. He then returned to Reading where he and a friend opened the Drovers' Hotel. The establishment was the first to introduce cabaret to Reading. Bloom performed song and dance acts at the hotel and also began competing as a lightweight boxer.\n\nBloom later became the stage manager for his friend's second establishment, The General Taylor Hotel. He left after two years to work as a clown in the Shelby, Pullman & Hamilton Circus. After a year, Bloom returned to Reading where formed a partnership with vaudevillian Howard Monroe. The duo performed song and dance numbers and comedy skits in blackface until Bloom left the duo and went to New York to perform comedy as a solo act.\n\nIn 1885, Bloom was cast in the play \"Nobody's Claim\", followed by a role in \"The Red Spider\" in 1888. It was his role in the latter production where he first conceived of the tramp persona.\n\nBloom's \"Society Tramp\" character was a philosophical, shabbily dressed homeless man who drank frequently and was generally treated poorly by other characters. Despite his lowly status, the tramp would make light of his predicament and maintained a positive and comicial outlook. Typically, tramp characters like Bloom's included slapstick comedy routines as well as dancing or pantomime. One of Bloom's tramp character's jokes was, \"I don't spend all my time in saloons. I can't. They have to close up some time.\"\n\nBloom's tramp character became a big hit with audiences and was quickly copied by hundreds of other performers of the era including Nat M. Wills and Charles R. Sweet. Charlie Chaplin and W. C. Fields also established long and successful stage and film careers portraying their version of the tramp persona. Bloom would later insist he originated the character and that he was \"the first stage tramp in the business\".\n\nBloom's stage career peaked in the 1890s. Throughout the decade, he continued to portray tramps in various stage productions by Charles Hale Hoyt including \"A Black Sheep\", \"On the Bowery\", \"A Milk White Flag\", \"A Day and a Night\" and \"A Society Tramp\". After leaving Hoyt in 1892, Bloom and his wife (whom he married in 1892), known as \"Miss Jane Cooper\", toured the vaudeville circuit with their comedy act \"A Picture of Life\". Bloom played his usual tramp role while his wife played the comic foil - a \"New England spinster\" or a \"city maiden.\"\n\nBy 1909, Bloom's tramp persona had run its course and his career began to wane. At least one critic during that time said that Bloom had become \"the worst act on the bill\" of vaudeville shows.\n\nAfter retiring from performing in the late 1910s, Bloom lived in Mount Penn, Pennsylvania where he spent his time painting in his studio and collecting and dealing art. He began purchasing artwork during his stage career. Between 1889 and 1892, he purchased thirty to forty paintings from artist Ralph Albert Blakelock. Upon his sister Susan's death in 1910, he inherited her art collection. In April 1907, Bloom exhibited seven pieces of his original works at the Reinhard Rieger Gallery in Mount Penn. The exhibition also included a copy of \"The Brooklet In the Meadow\", by Herman Rheudesela that Bloom painted (the original painting was also exhibited).\nBloom later moved to New York and occasionally returned to his hometown of Reading to spend time with his family and attend Elks Club meetings. He also trained horses for Metropolitan Race Clubs in the New York and Pennsylvania area and in Cuba.\n\nOn December 10, 1929, Bloom was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. He died there two days later of \"complication of diseases\" at the age of 70. Bloom's funeral was held at the Seidel Funeral Chapel in Reading on December 16. He was buried at Charles Evans Cemetery the following morning.\n\nIn early 1929, Bloom made news when he announced that he had acquired a previously unknown oil portrait of former First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln, the widow of slain president Abraham Lincoln. Bloom claimed shortly before President Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, Mary Lincoln commissioned painter Francis Bicknell Carpenter (who had lived at the White House for six months during Lincoln's presidency and had previously painted \"First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln\") to paint a portrait of her as gift to her husband. After the President's death, Bloom claimed that Mary Lincoln was unable to pay Carpenter for the painting and asked him to destroy it. According to Bloom, Carpenter kept the painting and eventually sold it to a wealthy Philadelphia shipbuilder named Jacob G. Neafie who was a great fan of President Lincoln's. After Neafie died, Bloom said that Neafie's daughter inherited the portrait who then gave it to Bloom's sister Susan as gift for taking care of her mother, Anna \"Annie\" Neafie, who died in 1860. Upon Susan's death in 1910, Bloom inherited her art collection which he said included the portrait of Mary Lincoln.\n\nTo validate his claim of the portrait's authenticity, Bloom attached a notarized affidavit to it and displayed the portrait at Milch Galleries in Manhattan. Shortly before his death in December 1929, he sold the portrait to President and Mary Lincoln's granddaughter Jessie Harlan Lincoln, the daughter of the Lincolns' eldest and only surviving son Robert Todd Lincoln. The exact sale price is unknown, but is believed to be between $2,000 to $3,000 (approximately $ to $ today). The portrait was the subject of considerable media attention and was written about in the February 12, 1929 edition of the \"New York Times\" and the \"Chicago Tribune\". It was later mentioned in various books about the Lincolns, including Carl Sandburg's 1932 biography \"Mary Lincoln: Wife and Widow\".\n\nIn 1976, Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, the last undisputed Lincoln descendant, donated the portrait to the Illinois State Historical Library (now known as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum). At the time, the portrait was estimated to be worth $400,000 (approximately $ today). In 1978, art conservators at the Art Institute of Chicago noted that the portrait had been \"heavily retouched\" and contained significant elements that were added after the original painting had been completed. After a partial restoration, it was discovered that the facial area of the subject had been altered. The woman in the portrait was noted to have coloring that was brighter than the original 1929 portrait and that the face of the woman was \"different, plainer\" than Mary Todd Lincoln's. The conservators also discovered that the subject was wearing a cross necklace which Mary Lincoln would not have worn as she was not a Roman Catholic. As the painting had been owned by the Lincoln family, the authenticity of the painting was not immediately questioned. The conservators that worked on the initial restoration reasoned that the added paint was likely the result of \"heavy handed\" retouches by other conservators or by Francis Bicknell Carpenter who was known to \"fiddle with\" his finished paintings. The lack of resemblance to the woman in the portrait to the real Mary Lincoln was rationalized as \"artistic idealization\". For the next 32 years, the portrait hung at the Illinois Executive Mansion in Springfield, Illinois.\n\nIn April 2010, art conservator Barry Bauman was hired to clean the portrait as it had accumulated dirt and grime after years of being displayed. Bauman also hoped to restore the portrait to its previous 1929 appearance. During the restoration, Bauman soon discovered that a layer of varnish sat on top of the paint indicating that someone had altered the original. After removing the varnish, Bauman discovered that the woman Bloom claimed was Mary Todd Lincoln was an unknown woman who bore no resemblance to the former First Lady. It was noted that the woman's coloring was \"...much fresher, a much warmer, a much redder toned, flesh toned...\" than the original painting depicted. Bauman also discovered that a brooch bearing the face of Abraham Lincoln worn by the subject covered a floral brooch. Bauman also inspected the signature of Francis Bicknell Carpenter and the date, both of which were added on top of the varnish layer. After comparing the signature to Carpenter's other paintings, the signature was deemed a forgery.\n\nAfter the portrait was completely restored, Bauman determined that while it had been painted in the 1860s (likely around 1864), the woman in the portrait was not Mary Todd Lincoln and the painting was not the work of Francis Bicknell Carpenter. The real subject of the portrait and the artist remain unknown. Bauman also determined that Bloom, who also painted his own works, had likely altered the original portrait himself. Bauman also believed Bloom painted over the original portrait, forged Carpenter's name and created the fake affidavit. Bloom's claim that the portrait was given to his sister Susan by Jacob G. Neafie's daughter in appreciation of her care for the ailing Anna Neafie was proven to be false. Susan Bloom was born in 1855 and was only five years old when Anna Neafie died in 1860. James M. Cornelius, the curator of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, believes that Bloom was able to pull off the hoax because all the participants in his story were dead. Cornelius also believes that Bloom sought the Lincolns out to not only make money from the sale of the portrait but to legitimatize its authenticity. Bloom was likely aware that the surviving Lincolns were eager to portray Mary and her son Robert Todd Lincoln in a more sympathetic light after the family had received a great deal of negative publicity after Robert had his mother forcibly institutionalized in 1875.\n\n"}

In 2012 it was adapted into a feature film directed by Ang Lee with a screenplay by David Magee.\n\nThe novel begins with a note from the author, which is an integral part of it. Unusually, the note describes entirely fictional events. It serves to establish and enforce one of the book's main themes: the relativity of truth.\n\n\"Life of Pi\" is subdivided into three sections:\n\nIn the first section, the main character, by the name of Piscine Patel, an adult Canadian, reminisces about his childhood in India. His father owns a zoo in Pondicherry. The livelihood provides the family with a relatively affluent lifestyle and some understanding of animal psychology.\n\nThe narrator describes how he acquired his full name, Piscine Molitor Patel, as a tribute to the swimming pool in France. After hearing schoolmates tease him by transforming the first name into \"Pissing\", he establishes the short form of his name as \"Pi\" when he starts secondary school. The name, he says, pays tribute to the transcendental number which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.\n\nIn recounting his experiences, Pi describes several other unusual situations involving proper names: two visitors to the zoo, one a devout Muslim, and the other a committed atheist, bear identical names; and a 450-pound tiger at the zoo bears the name Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, in which human and animal names were reversed.\n\nPi is raised as a Hindu who practices vegetarianism. At the age of fourteen, he investigates Christianity and Islam, and decides to become an adherent of all three religions, much to his parents' dismay, saying he \"just wants to love God.\" He tries to understand God through the lens of each religion, and comes to recognize benefits in each one.\n\nA few years later in February 1976, during the period when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declares \"The Emergency\", Pi's father decides to sell the zoo and immigrate with his wife and sons to Canada.\n\nThe second part of the novel begins with Pi's family aboard the \"Tsimtsum\", a Japanese freighter that is transporting animals from their zoo to North America. A few days out of port from Manila, the ship encounters a storm and sinks. Pi manages to escape in a small lifeboat, only to learn that the boat also holds a spotted hyena, an injured Grant's zebra, and an orangutan named Orange Juice. Much to the boy's distress, the hyena kills the zebra and then Orange Juice. A tiger has been hiding under the boat's tarpaulin: it's Richard Parker, who had boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself some time before the hyena attack. Suddenly emerging from his hideaway, Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena.\n\nFrightened, Pi constructs a small raft out of rescue flotation devices, tethers it to the bow of the boat and makes it his place of retirement. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer, and seasickness as a punishment mechanism, while using a whistle for signals. Soon, Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal, and is eventually able to share the boat with his feline companion, admitting in the end that Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal.\n\nPi recounts various events while adrift in the Pacific Ocean. At his lowest point, exposure renders him blind and unable to catch fish. In a state of delirium, he talks with a marine \"echo\", which he initially identifies as Richard Parker having gained the ability to speak, but it turns out to be another blind castaway, a Frenchman, who boards the lifeboat with the intention of killing and eating Pi, but is immediately killed by Richard Parker.\n\nSome time later, Pi's boat comes ashore on a floating island network of algae and inhabited by hundreds of thousands of meerkats. Soon, Pi and Richard Parker regain strength, but the boy's discovery of the carnivorous nature of the island's plant life forces him to return to the ocean.\n\nTwo hundred and twenty-seven days after the ship's sinking, the lifeboat washes onto a beach in Mexico, after which Richard Parker disappears into the nearby jungle without looking back, leaving Pi heartbroken at the abrupt farewell.\n\nThe third part of the novel describes a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale, but the officials reject it as unbelievable. Pi then offers them a second story in which he is adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with the ship's cook, a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor's leg for use as fishing bait, then kills the sailor himself as well as Pi's mother for food, and soon he is killed by Pi, who dines on him.\n\nThe investigators note parallels between the two stories. They soon conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger represents Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck, so he asks the officials which story they prefer: the one without animals or the one with animals. They eventually choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says: \"And so it goes with God.\" The investigators then leave and file a report.\n\n\"Life of Pi\", according to Yann Martel, can be summarized in three statements: \"Life is a story... You can choose your story... A story with God is the better story.\" A recurring theme throughout the novel seems to be believability. Pi at the end of the book asks the two investigators \"If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for?\" According to Gordon Houser there are two main themes of the book: \"that all life is interdependent, and that we live and breathe via belief.\"\n\nPBS has described Martel's story as one of \"personal growth through adversity.\" The main character learns that \"tigers are dangerous\" at a young age when his father forces him to watch the zoo's Royal Bengal tiger patriarch, Mahisha, devour a live goat. Later, after he has been reduced to eking out a desperate existence on the lifeboat with the company of a fully grown tiger, Pi develops \"alpha\" qualities as he musters the strength, will and skills he needs to survive.\n\nIn a 2002 interview with PBS, Martel said \"I was sort of looking for a story, not only with a small 's' but sort of with a capital 'S' – something that would direct my life.\" He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life, and found that writing the novel met this need.\n\nThe name of Martel's tiger, Richard Parker, was inspired by a character in Edgar Allan Poe's nautical adventure novel \"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\" (1838). In this book, Richard Parker is a mutineer who is stranded and eventually cannibalized on the hull of an overturned ship (and there is a dog aboard who is named Tiger). The author also had in mind another occurrence of the name, in the famous legal case R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) where a shipwreck again results in the cannibalism of a cabin boy named Richard Parker, this time in a lifeboat. A third Richard Parker drowned in the sinking of the \"Francis Spaight\" in 1846, described by author Jack London, and later the cabin boy (not Richard Parker) was cannibalized.\n\nHaving read about these events, Yann Martel thought, \"So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something.\"\n\nMartel has mentioned that a book review he read of Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella \"Max and the Cats\" accounts in part for his novel's premise. Scliar's story describes a Jewish-German refugee crossing the Atlantic Ocean with a jaguar in his boat. Scliar said that he was perplexed that Martel \"used the idea without consulting or even informing me,\" and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before deciding whether to take any action in response. After talking with Martel, Scliar elected not to pursue the matter. A dedication to Scliar \"for the spark of life\" appears in the author's note of \"Life of Pi\". Literary reviews have described the similarities between \"Life of Pi\" and \"Max and the Cats\" as superficial. Reviewer Peter Yan wrote: \"Reading the two books side-by-side, one realizes how inadequate bald plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each book,\" and noted that Martel's distinctive narrative structure is not found in Scliar's novella. The themes of the books are also dissimilar, with \"Max and the Cats\" being an allegory for Nazism. In \"Life of Pi\", 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi's experience in the lifeboat, compared to \"Max and the Cats\", in which 17 of its 99 pages depict time spent in a lifeboat.\n\nAccording to the reviewer Peter Yan,\n'Life of Pi' is told from two alternating points of view, the main character Pi in a flashback and Yann Martel himself, who is the \"visiting writer\" (Martel 101) interviewing Pi many years after the tiger in the boat story. This technique of the intrusive narrator adds the documentary realism to the book, setting up, like a musical counter-point, the myth-making, unreliable narrator, Pi. The reader is left to ponder at the end whether Pi's story is an allegory of another set of parallel events.\n\nThe novel is a work of fiction set in the summer of 1977 that draws on places and historical events in India. The Patel Family's discussions of the political situation refer to the Emergency period of the mid-1970s, when Indira Gandhi's administration ruled by decree, curtailed press freedoms, and imprisoned political opponents. Pondicherry is a former French colony in India. It does have an Indian Coffee House and Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Garden had a zoo in 1977 but did not have any animals bigger than a deer. Munnar, the destination for the Patel family's vacation, is a small but popular hill station in Kerala. Madurai, also referenced in the novel, is a popular tourist and pilgrimage site in Tamil Nadu.\n\nPiscine Molitor Patel, known to all as just \"Pi\", is the narrator and protagonist of the novel. He was named after a swimming pool in Paris, despite the fact that neither his mother nor his father particularly liked swimming. The story is told as a narrative from the perspective of a middle-aged Pi, now married with his own family, and living in Canada. At the time of main events of the story, he is sixteen years old. He recounts the story of his life and his 227-day journey on a lifeboat when his ship sinks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a voyage to North America.\n\nRichard Parker is a royal Bengal tiger who is stranded on the lifeboat with Pi when the ship sinks. Richard Parker lives on the lifeboat with Pi and is kept alive with the food and water Pi delivers. Richard Parker develops a relationship with Pi that allows them to coexist in their struggle.\n\nIn the novel, a hunter named Richard Parker is hired to kill a panther thought to have killed seven people within two months. Instead, he accidentally immobilizes a female Bengal tiger with tranquilizer darts while her cub escapes hiding in a bush. Parker names the cub Thirsty after his enthusiasm when drinking from a nearby river. The paperwork that accompanies the shipment of the two tigers to Pi's family's zoo in Pondicherry states that the cub's name is \"Richard Parker\" and the hunter's given name is \"Thirsty\" and his surname is \"None Given\", due to a mix-up with the names. Pi's father finds the story so amusing that they continue to call the tiger \"Richard Parker\".\n\nBrian Bethune of \"Maclean's\" describes \"Life of Pi\" as a \"head-scratching combination of dense religious allegory, zoological lore and enthralling adventure tale, written with warmth and grace\". \"Master Plots\" suggested that the \"central themes of \"Life of Pi\" concern religion and human faith in God\".\nReutter said, \"So believable is Pi's story telling that readers will be amazed.\" Gregory Stephens added that it \"achieves something more quietly spectacular.\" Smith stated that there was \"no bamboozlement here.\" Gary Krist of \"The New York Times\" praised the book, but added that at times Martel \"pushes the didactic agenda of his story too hard.\"\n\nIn 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama wrote a letter directly to Martel, describing \"Life of Pi\" as \"an elegant proof of God, and the power of storytelling.\"\n\nIn October 2005, a worldwide competition was launched to find an artist to illustrate \"Life of Pi\". The competition was run by Scottish publisher \"Canongate Books\" and UK newspaper \"The Times\", as well as Australian newspaper \"The Age\" and Canadian newspaper \"The Globe and Mail\". Croatian artist Tomislav Torjanac was chosen as the illustrator for the new edition, which was published in September 2007.\n\nA 2012 adaptation directed by Ang Lee and based on an adapted screenplay by David Magee was given a wide release in the United States on 2012. At the 85th Academy Awards it won four awards from eleven nominations, including Best\n\nThis novel has also been adapted as a play by Keith Robinson, artistic director of the youth-oriented Twisting Yarn Theatre Company. Andy Rashleigh wrote the adaptation, which was directed by Keith Robinson. The premier/original cast contained only six actors – Tony Hasnath (Pi), Taresh Solanki (Richard Parker), Melody Brown (Mother), Conor Alexander (Father), Sanjay Shalat (Brother) and Mark Pearce (Uncle). The play was produced at the Alhambra Theatre in Bradford, England, in 2003. The company toured England and Ireland with the play in 2004 and 2007.\n\nKeith Robinson also directed a second version of the play. He brought some of his company to work with students of the BA (Hons) Drama, Applied Theatre and Education Course at the Central School of Speech and Drama. The joint production was performed at the Minack Theatre, in Cornwall, England, in late June 2008. It was well received by the press and community.\n\n\n\n"}

Andean influences can perhaps be best heard in wind instruments and the shape of the melodies, while the African influences can be heard in the rhythm and percussion instruments, and European influences can be heard in the harmonies and stringed instruments. Pre-Columbian Andean music was played on drums and wind instruments, not unlike the European pipe and tabor tradition. Andean tritonic and pentatonic scales were elaborated during the colonial period into hexatonic, and in some cases, diatonic scales.\n\nThe earliest printed polyphonic music in Peru, indeed anywhere in the Americas, was \"Hanacpachap cussicuinin,\" composed or collected by Juan Pérez Bocanegra and printed in 1631.\n\nPeruvian music is dominated by the national instrument, the charango. The charango is member of the lute family of instruments and was invented during the Viceroyalty of Peru by musicians imitating the Spanish vihuela. In the Canas and Titicaca regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking mermaids with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the Indigenismo movement (1910–1940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the walaycho, chillador, chinlili, and the larger and lower-tuned charangon.\n\nWhile the Spanish guitar is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin bandurria. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere 4 courses. Violins and harps, also of European origin, are also played.\n\nThe cajón is an important percussion instrument developed by African slaves. People imply the cowbell may also be of African origin. While the rhythms played on them are often African-influenced, some percussive instruments are of non-African origin. For example, of European origin is the bombo, and of Andean origin are the wankara and tinya respectively.\n\nIn addition to the ocarina and waqra phuku, there are Peruvian wind instruments of two basic types, panpipes and flutes, both of Native Andean origin and built to play tritonic, pentatonic and hexatonic scales, though some contemporary musicians play instruments designed to play European diatonic scales. Of the former variety, there are the siku (or \"zampoña\") and antara. Of the latter variety, there are the pinkillu, tarka, and quena (qina) flutes.\n\nSee Peruvian dances\n\nManuelcha Prado (born 10 June 1955) is a guitarist, singer, composer, compiler and troubadour of Andean music. He is also known for many people as \"The \"Saqra\" of the Guitar\".\n\nJaime Guardia (born 10 February 1933) is a Peruvian singer and charango player. He has performed and recorded as a solo act and with the group Lira Paucina.\n\nRaul Romero's recordings of saxophone and clarinet ensembles from the Mantaro Valley have proved extremely influential.\n\nOne important space for Peruvian contemporary classical music is Circomper, the Peruvian Composition Circle.\n\n\n1"}

Many Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom veterans suffer physical and emotional injuries making it difficult to transition back to civilian life. Pets for Vets helps military veterans reclaim normalcy in their lives through companion dogs.\n\nEach companion dog is rescued in connection with local animal rescue groups. They are then given basic obedience training and any additional training that will help them assimilate into their new lives and then finally placed in their \"forever\" home.\n\nEstimates that anywhere from one in eight to one in five of all Iraq war veterans have some degree of PTSD and two thirds of those who screened positive for PTSD are not receiving treatment. People who suffer from PTSD experience anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, flashbacks, and extreme wariness. It may manifest right away or show up months or even years later. Some of those who suffer from PTSD commit suicide.\n\nAccording to the ASPCA, every year between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats are abandoned at shelters in the United States. Nationally five out of ten shelter dogs and seven out of ten shelter cats are euthanized because there is no one to adopt them from the shelter These dogs and cats can make excellent companion animals but never have that chance.\n\nAnimal-assisted therapy has typically been used to treat physical disabilities; it is becoming increasingly useful in treating patients with psychological complications including PTSD and combat stress and even reducing symptoms of PTSD in as many as 82% of patients studied.\n\nMore and more veterans are being written prescriptions for companion animals to help combat PTSD. Pets can help alleviate stress, loneliness and anxiety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says pets can decrease your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels and feelings of loneliness. Pets can increase your opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities and opportunities for socialization. Caring for a pet encourages responsibility and adherence to a daily schedule.\n\nPets for Vets developed a program focusing on addressing these issues by bringing together animals needing to be rescued and veterans needing a companion for a better quality of life. Not every veteran qualifies for a psychiatric service dog, however everyone who wants one can benefit from a companion or pet animal.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1303884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1303884", "title": "Pit orchestra", "text": "Pit orchestra\n\nA pit orchestra is a type of orchestra that accompanies performers in musicals, operas, ballets, and other shows involving music. The terms was also used for orchestras accompanying silent movies when more than a piano was used. In performances of operas and ballets, the pit orchestra is typically similar in size to a symphony orchestra, though it may contain smaller string and brass sections, depending upon the piece. Such orchestras may vary in size from approximately 30 musicians (early Baroque and Classical opera) to as many as 90–100 musicians (Wagnerian opera). However, because of financial, space, and volume concerns, the musical theatre pit orchestra in the 2000s is considerably smaller (at most 20–30 musicians, including not more than ten string players).\n\nTypically, pit orchestras play in a lowered area in front of the stage called an orchestra pit. Inside the pit, the conductor stands facing towards the stage with his or her back towards the audience to coordinate the music with the vocals and actions of the singers, dancers and actors, while the orchestra sits facing the conductor. The conductor may also sit at one or more keyboards and conduct as well as play, which often means the use of more head and facial gestures rather than hand gestures. This is often the case when a show only requires a small orchestra, or on national tours, where the instrumentation is often reduced from the original arrangement and one or two keyboard players substitute for several instruments. In some cases, theatres do not have a pit; in this case, the pit orchestra may play in a room near the stage, watching the conductor's gestures using a video monitor. \n\nMusic parts for pit orchestra woodwind players in musical theatre are normally divided into \"reed books\". Orchestration varies with each show based on the type of music that will be performed, such as jazz, classical, or blues. For example, a Reed 1 Book may contain music for piccolo, flute, Eb alto saxophone, Bb clarinet, and/or oboe. A musician handed a reed book would be expected to play each part. Because the musician plays so many different instruments, he or she is referred to as a \"doubler\" (even though the Reed Books may have up to eight instruments each). \n\nMusicians who play in pit orchestras are not only required to play multiple instruments at times, but they must also be familiar and able to play in multiple keys, styles, and tempos and make a switch instantaneously. The orchestration for a musical is written in a key best suited to range of the singer. Some keys are more difficult to play in than others because of the increased attention that greater amounts of sharps and flats require. Musicals also tend to have a number of styles which can range from a soulful ballad to a syncopated funk tune to a driving hard rock song. Many musicians have been trained to play in a certain style, such as classical music, but in order to play in pit orchestras, musicians must be able to play a range of different styles. Because musicals are live, many elements can change from show to show; pit orchestra musicians consequently should be able to play different tempos every night and even skip through their music to a new spot if an actor or singer makes an error.\n\nAs with any orchestra or similar ensemble, a pit orchestra rehearses with the singers and dancers before the public performances commence. The rehearsals are led by the conductor/music director, who sets the tempos, starts the songs and musical interludes and indicates pauses and endings of sections.\n\nAlthough members of a pit orchestra are not required to demonstrate great stage presence, and they may work out of sight from much of the audience, they can generally be seen from the balcony seats and are thus required to adhere to standard rules of dress and appearance (e.g., formal clothes) \n\nPreparation by musicians in a pit orchestra consists of much more than attending rehearsals. Before the first rehearsal, ensemble musicians individually practice their parts, particularly difficult sections (rapid passages, very high or low-register sections) and exposed passages (e.g., instrumental solos). Performers often listen to a recording of the show to learn the tempos and playing styles, particularly if there are sections where the pit orchestra has complex parts which depend on the onstage actors or singers' parts (e.g., a big orchestra chord might have to coincide with the firing of a prop gun onstage).\n\nPit orchestras can range from large orchestras to small rock combos (e.g., guitar/keyboards/bass/drums). While a pit orchestra usually plays in the orchestra pit, there are times when they are on stage in the background (this is usually for rock musicals). In some cases, one or more members of the pit orchestra may have to appear in costume on stage with their instrument and play music as part of a scene. Below are pit orchestra examples from five major theatrical license companies: Music Theatre International, Tams-Witmark, Samuel French, Inc., Rodgers and Hammerstein Theatricals, and Theatrical Rights Worldwide (excluding any conductor scores unless needed). These show the varying sizes of pit orchestras. Note that string parts are often written with the intent of having two musicians play a specific part, especially in older musicals.\n\nIn the 2000s, due to budget constraints, some musicals have replaced instruments from musical arrangements with keyboards. For example, instead of hiring a small string section, a musical may hire one or two synthesizer players to perform the string parts or the horn parts. Some musicals have used prerecorded backing track music for shows, which has led to controversy.\n\nThe score was orchestrated by Robert Ginzler.\n\nNote that this orchestration is slightly different from the orchestration of the original Broadway production, which also called for a third trombone, a fifth reed, a harp, and did not have a dedicated piano player. \n\n\nThe score was orchestrated by Albert Sendrey.\n\nNote that the owner who holds the license to this show was originally Samuel French, Inc. until 2013 when Music Theatre International purchased the rights to it.\n\nThe score was orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal following detailed instructions from composer Leonard Bernstein, who then wrote revisions on their manuscript (the original, heavily annotated by Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein himself is in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at Columbia University). Ramin, Kostal, and Bernstein are billed as orchestrators for the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe score was orchestrated by Eddie Sauter.\n\n\n"}

However no licences have been issued since 1975. In modern Lebanon prostitution takes place semi-officially via 'super night clubs', and illegally on the streets, in bars, hotels and brothels. UNAIDS estimate there to be 4,220 prostitutes in the country.\n\nCases of child prostitution are known and prosecuted, however no measures are taken to rehabilitate these juveniles. \n\nSex trafficking is a problem in the Lebanon.\n\nStreet prostitution occurs in the country, the prostitutes are mainly Lebanese or Syrian. Prostitution also occurs in 'bars', especially in the Hamra area of Beirut and in Maameltein. The bars are licensed, but not for prostitution. They usually have 'secret' rooms at the back and the women, mostly Egyptians, Syrians and Sudanese, are controlled by a \"Mom\". They keep their liquor licenses and a blind eye is turned to the illegal activities because of bribes to the police.\n\nSome Lebanese prostitutes work independently from hotels or rented apartments.\n\nMale prostitution is on the rise in the country.\n\nSuper night clubs serve as places of introduction between prostitutes and clients. The clients may chat with an 'artiste' if they buy a bottle of champagne. During the chat a 'date' may be arranged for the next day. No sexual services are permitted on the premises, and the woman negotiates her own price for the 'date'.\n\nThe clubs operate with the implicit consent of the Sûreté Générale (General Directorate of General Security), who set strict regulations. The women working in the clubs must be foreign nationals, Lebanese women are not allowed in the clubs. The migrant women must have a contract to enter the country, and are issued with an 'artiste' visa, to which strict conditions are attached.\n\nThe women must be at the club between 8pm to 5am, Sûreté or police may enter the club at any time to check the artistes are all present. The women must live in a hotel room, often adjacent to or in the same building as the club. They must be in the hotel between finishing work (5am) until 1pm. After 1pm they may leave the hotel on a 'date'. The telephone number and car registration number of the client must be recorded when the women leave the hotel.\n\nThere are about 130 clubs, mainly in Maameltein. A lot of the women working in them are of East European and North African origin. 11,284 women entered Lebanon under the 'artiste' program in 2016, more than double the number of women that entered under this program in 2015. Their artiste visas do not exceed six months, and they are deported if they are caught overstaying their visa.\n\nIn 1931, whilst the country was under French control, a new law regulated prostitution. Prostitutes needed to be registered and were only allowed to work in licensed brothels. To obtain a licence they had to be over 21, not be a virgin and have undergone a medical examination. The law criminalised working anywhere else. It also criminalised anybody facilitating working outside licence requirements.\n\nAt the start of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, all of the licensed brothels were located near Martyrs' Square in the Zeitoun district of downtown Beirut. All these brothels were destroyed during the fighting. No licences have been issued since to prostitutes or brothels.\n\nAs a result of licences not being issued, brothels operated illegally until a new law was passed in 1998 criminalising businesses making rooms available for commercial sex.\n\nThe \"super night clubs\" were originally regular night clubs catering to the tourist trade in the 1960s. They closed down during the Civil War, and after the end of the war there were insufficient tourists to make them viable. The business model was changed to its current format and the clubs reopened.\n\nThe Civil War in Syria has led to an influx of Syrian refugees into the sex trade in Lebanon. Syrian women and girls are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Some adult refugee women have been coerced into prostitution. A forced prostitution ring, run by a Syrian pimp, was dismantled in 2016 by Lebanese police, which raided the \"Chez Maurice\" and \"le Silver\" brothels, both located in the Maameltein, known for its red-light district. The majority of the women and girls were recruited from Syria with false promises of work and subjected to commercial sexual exploitation where they experienced mental, physical, and sexual abuse and forced abortions.\n\nLebanon is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking and a transit country for Eastern European women and children subjected to sex trafficking in other Middle Eastern countries. Women from Eastern Europe and North Africa enter Lebanon to work in the adult entertainment industry through Lebanon’s artiste visa program, which sustains a significant commercial sex industry and enables sex trafficking. Some women from East and West Africa are subjected to sex trafficking in Lebanon.\n\nSyrian women and girls are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Syrian girls are brought to Lebanon for sex trafficking, sometimes through the guise of early marriage. Lebanese pimps coerce some Syrian LGBTI refugees into prostitution.\n\nThe 2011 anti-trafficking law prohibits all forms of human trafficking. Prescribed penalties for sex trafficking range from five to 15 years imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.\n\nIn 2016, the internal security forces (ISF) anti-trafficking unit investigated 20 cases of suspected trafficking, involving 87 victims of sexual exploitation and child trafficking, and referred 26 suspected traffickers to the judiciary. The directorate of general security (DGS) investigated 14 potential trafficking cases involving artiste visa holders and four were referred to judicial or law enforcement authorities for further investigation.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Lebanon as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\n"}
{"id": "37523519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37523519", "title": "Psychology of music preference", "text": "Psychology of music preference\n\nThe psychology of music preference refers as the psychological factors behind peoples' different music preferences. Music is heard by people daily in many parts of the world, and affects people in various ways from emotion regulation to cognitive development, along with providing a means for self-expression. Music training has been shown to help improve intellectual development and ability, though no connection has been found as to how it affects emotion regulation. Numerous studies have been conducted to show that individual personality can have an effect on music preference, mostly using personality, though a recent meta-analysis has shown that personality in itself explains little variance in music preferences. These studies are not limited to Western or American culture, as they have been conducted with significant results in countries all over the world, including Japan, Germany, and Spain.\n\nVarious questionnaires have been created to both measure the big five personality traits and musical preferences. The majority of studies attempting to find the correlation between personality and musical preferences administered questionnaires to measure both traits. Others used questionnaires to determine personality traits, and then asked participants to rate musical excerpts on scales such as liking, perceived complexity, emotions felt, and more.\n\nIn general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness), but each trait is still worth discussing. The personality traits have also been shown to correlate significantly with the emotional effect music has on people. Individual personality differences can help predict the emotional intensity and valence derived from music.\n\nOf all the traits, openness to experience has been shown to have the greatest effect upon genre preference. In general, those rated high in openness to experience prefer more music categorized as complex and novel like classical, jazz, and eclecticism, and intense and rebellious music. In the study, reflective and complex genres included classical, blues, jazz, and folk music, while intense and rebellious genres included rock, alternative, and heavy metal music. One of the facets of openness to experience is aesthetic appreciation, which is why researchers generally explain the high positive correlation between openness and liking complex music.\n\nOne study looking at how personality traits affect music-induced emotion found that of all the traits, openness to experience was the best predictor of higher emotionally intense reactions to sad and slow music. The most common feelings described from sad music were nostalgia, peacefulness, and wonder, and openness to experience correlated positively with all these feelings. Sad music has also been theorized to allow for greater experience of aesthetic experiences and beauty. Furthermore, open individuals show a preference for diverse musical styles, but do not prefer popular forms of contemporary music, indicating that there are limits to this openness. However, this is only true up to a certain point, as another study looked at music's ability to produce \"chills\" in the listeners. Although this study found that openness was the best predictor of genre preference, there is no way to use openness to experience to predict who gets chills from music. Instead, the only measure for that was frequency of listening to music and the self-rated value of the importance of music in one's life.\n\nAnother study examined how openness to experience and frequency of listening are related and how they affect music preference. While listening to classical music excerpts, those rated high in openness tended to decrease in liking music faster during repeated listenings, as opposed to those scoring low in openness, who tended to like music more with repeated plays. This suggests novelty in music is an important quality for people high in openness to experience.\n\nOne study had people take a personality test before and after listening to classical music with and without written lyrics in front of them. Both the music with and without lyrics showed some effect at actually changing people's self-rated personality traits, most significantly in terms of openness to experience, which showed some significant increase. Instead of personality affecting music preference, here classical music altered the assessment of their own personalities and make people assess themselves as more open.\n\nOpenness to experience is also positively correlated with intellectual or cognitive use of music, which means that this individual enjoys analyzing complex musical compositions. Furthermore, individuals more open prefer a greater number of melodic themes in a work of music.\n\nConscientiousness is negatively correlated with intense and rebellious music, such as rock and heavy metal music. While previous studies have found a relationship between conscientiousness and emotional regulation, these results do not apply cross culturally—specifically, researchers did not find this relationship in Malaysia.\n\nExtraversion is another good predictor of music genre preference and music use. Energetic extroverts have been linked to preferences in happy, upbeat and conventional music, as well as energetic and rhythmic music, such as rap, hip hop, soul, electronic, and dance music. Additionally, extroverts tend to listen to music more and have background music present in their lives more often. One study compared introverts and extroverts to see who would be more easily distracted by background music with and without lyrics. It was assumed that since extroverts listen to background music more they would be able to tune it out better, but that was proved untrue. No matter how much music people listen to they are still equally affected and distracted by music with lyrics. Cheerful music with fast tempos, many melodic themes, and vocals are also preferred by extroverts. They are more likely than others to listen to music in the background while doing other activities, such as running, being with friends, or studying. This group also tends to use music to counter the monotony of everyday tasks, such as ironing. In a Turkish study, researchers found that extroverts preferred rock, pop, and rap because these genres facilitated dance and movement.\n\nAnother study examined music teachers and music therapists, assuming that people who like and study music would be more extroverted. The results showed that music teachers were definitely higher in extraversion than the general public. Music therapists were also higher on extraversion than introversion, though they scored significantly lower than the teachers. Differences can probably be attributed to teaching being a profession more dependent on extraversion.\n\nAgreeable individuals preferred upbeat and conventional music. Additionally, listeners with high agreeableness displayed an intense emotional response to music which they had never before listened to. Agreeableness is also a good predictor of the emotional intensity experienced from all types of music, both positive and negative. Those scoring high in agreeableness tend to have more intense emotional reactions to all types of music.\n\nThe more neurotic a person is, the less likely they are to listen to intense and rebellious music (such as alternative, rock and heavy metal); they will likely prefer upbeat and conventional music, such as country, sound tracks, and pop music. Additionally, neuroticism is positively correlated with emotional use of music. Those who scored high in neuroticism were more likely to report use of music for emotional regulation and experience higher intensity of emotional affect, especially negative emotion.\n\nSituations have been shown to influence individual’s preferences for certain types of music. Participants in a study from 1996 provided information about what music they would prefer to listen to in given situations, and indicated that the situation greatly determined their musical preferences. For example, melancholic situations called for sad and moody music, while an arousal situation would call for loud, strong rhythm, invigorating music.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to respond to music in a more emotional way. Furthermore, females prefer popular music more than males. In a study of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music, researchers found that males demonstrated more of a preference for bass music than females. This preference for bass music is also correlated with antisocial and borderline personalities.\n\nAge is a strong factor in determining music preference. In a study of adolescent preferences of music in England, researchers found that girls regarded music as a worthwhile activity more than boys, but both boys and girls agreed that it does not need to be taught in schools. There is also evidence that preferences and opinions toward music can change with age. In a Canadian study concerning how adolescent music preferences relate to personality, researchers found that adolescents who preferred heavy music demonstrated low self-esteem, higher levels of discomfort within the family, and tended to feel rejected by others. Adolescents who preferred light music were preoccupied with doing the proper thing, and had difficulty balancing independence with dependence. Adolescents who had eclectic music preferences had less difficulty negotiating adolescence, and were flexible using music according to mood and particular needs at the time.\n\nSeason of the year can also affect preferences. After reflecting upon fall or winter seasons, participants preferred reflective and complex music, whereas after reflecting upon summer or spring, participants preferred energetic and rhythmic music. However, \"pop\" music seems to have a universal appeal, despite the season.\n\nFamiliarity and complexity both have interesting effects on musical preferences. As seen in other types of artistic media, an inverted U relationship is apparent when relating subjective complexity on liking music excerpts. Individuals like complexity to a certain degree, then begin to dislike the music when complexity gets too high. Furthermore, there is a clear positive monotonic relationship between familiarity and liking of music.\n\nMusic preferences can also be influenced by how the individual wants to be perceived, especially in males. Music preferences could be used to make self-directed identity claims. Individuals might select styles of music that reinforce their self-views. For examples, individuals with a conservative self-view preferred conventional styles of music, while individuals with an athletic self view preferred vigorous music.\n\nActive mood is another factor that affects music preference. Generally whether people are in a good or bad mood when they hear music affects how they feel about the type of music and also their emotional response. On that line of thinking, aggression has been shown to improve creativity and emotional intensity derived from music. People with aggressive disorders find music to be a powerful emotional outlet. Additionally, the value people put on music and frequency of listening affects their reactions to it. If people listen to a certain type of music and add emotional experience to songs or a genre in general, this increases the likelihood of enjoying the music and being emotionally affected by it. This helps explain why many people might have strong reactions to music their parents listened to frequently when they were children.\n\n"}

{"id": "23536155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23536155", "title": "Rock &amp; Chips", "text": "Rock &amp; Chips\n\nRock & Chips is a British television comedy-drama and prequel to the sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\". The show is set in Peckham, south-east London, during the early 1960s, focusing primarily on the lives of Del Trotter, Freddie Robdal and Joan and Reg Trotter. Nicholas Lyndhurst, who played Rodney in \"Only Fools and Horses\", plays Robdal alongside James Buckley (Del Boy), Kellie Bright (Joan), Shaun Dingwall (Reg) and Phil Daniels (Grandad). The Shazam Productions and BBC co-production was written by \"Only Fools and Horses\" creator John Sullivan, directed by Dewi Humphreys and produced by Gareth Gwenlan.\n\nThe 90 minute production was conceived in 1997 and commissioned in 2003, with the premise established in the final episode of \"Only Fools and Horses\" in 2003. It was shelved and \"Only Fools and Horses\" spin-off \"The Green Green Grass\" was developed; its success led to the prequel being recommissioned in July 2009. Filming began in October in London and the production was first broadcast on BBC One and BBC HD on 24 January 2010. It was the second most watched programme of the day but gained mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe story starts in February 1960, by setting up the characters. Joan Trotter (Kellie Bright) is in an unhappy marriage with the lazy Reg (Shaun Dingwall), whose father Ted (Phil Daniels) has just moved in. Her 15-year-old son Derek, often shortened to Del Boy, (James Buckley) and his friends Boycie, Trigger, Jumbo Mills and new-in-town Denzil (Stephen Lloyd, Lewis Osborne, Lee Long and Ashley Gerlach) are still in school, following an increase in the school-leaving age. Joan works at the local cinema with Trigger's aunt Reenie Turpin (Emma Cooke) and Raymond (Billy Seymour) for cinema manager Ernie Rayner (Robert Daws), and at the Town Hall as \"a part-time filing clerk who sometimes makes the tea\". Convicted thief Freddie Robdal (Nicholas Lyndhurst) has just been released from Dartmoor Prison and returned to Peckham with explosives expert Gerald \"Jelly\" Kelly (Paul Putner).\n\nAt the Town Hall, Joan asks Mr Johnson (Colin Prockter) about applying for a flat in the new high-rise estate; she is told she is unlikely to get a tenancy, as preference will be given to those with young children. At the \"Nag's Head\", Freddie and Reg meet, and Reg invites him to his house to continue drinking. After meeting Joan and buying her a drink, Freddie realises that she is a Trotter, a family he has a dislike for. After they return to the Trotters' house, Freddie shows his affection for Joan.\n\nAt the cinema, Joan is promoted to part-time assistant manager and Rayner tells her that the safe sometimes contains over £2,000 at weekends. She later tells Freddie, after he goes round to her house to offer Reg some work (Reg was not at home as Freddie told him to meet him at the pub). They talk about art, and he invites her (and Reg) to his house-warming party.\n\nIn March, Joan has a Marilyn Monroe hairstyle and the safe at the cinema is broken into. Ahead of the party, Freddie gives Reg the use of his car, to return unused decorating materials to Guildford and he takes his father, Reenie and her boyfriend Clayton Cooper (Roger Griffiths) with him. They run out of petrol on the way, leaving Freddie and Joan the only ones at the party. They dance, and Freddie admits that he wanted to be alone with Joan so they could talk about art. They end the night by sleeping together.\n\nIn June, Reenie accompanies Joan to a pregnancy testing clinic, while the boys are on the Jolly Boys Outing to Margate (providing Freddie and Jelly the opportunity to burgle a jewellers). On their journey home, Reenie tells Joan about Freddie's time in prison and she realises he burgled the cinema. After Freddie tells Kelly he thinks he's in love with Joan, Reg announces her pregnancy in the pub. While Joan is completing a housing request form, Freddie goes to see her and she fails to acknowledge the baby is his.\n\nThe Trotters' housing application is successful in August, and September sees them view a flat in the new Sir Walter Raleigh House, which they have moved into in October. In November, Joan has her baby, which she calls Rodney (after the \"handsome actor\" Rod Taylor, and to the surprise of everyone else). The closing scene sees Joan enter the balcony of her flat with Rodney in her arms. After telling him that Del will be very rich one day, Joan sees Freddie on a balcony in a tower opposite; she shows him Rodney and nods her head, to his delight.\n\nThroughout, the story tells of Del's strained relationship with his father and his affection for his mother; Reg's affair with the barmaid at the Nag's Head; Del and Jumbo selling goods from the docks out of the back of a van; Del and Boycie's attempt at dating Pam and Glenda (Jodie Mooney and Katie Griffiths); Joan fending off advances from her perverted boss and provides an introduction to Roy Slater (Calum MacNab) and Albie Littlewood (Jonathan Readwin).\n\nWriter John Sullivan had the idea for a prequel to the sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\" in 1997; its commission was announced in 2003 and the premise for the series was established in the final \"Only Fools and Horses\" episode \"Sleepless in Peckham\" in 2003, where Rodney discovers a photograph of Freddie Robdal from 1960. His uncanny resemblance to Rodney confirmed that he, and not Reg, was Rodney's biological father. A lot of the groundwork for this had been both laid and explored in the Episode \"The Frog's Legacy\" the 1987 Christmas Day hour-long special. In the episode Rodney goes to ask about his father to which Albert diplomatically replies 'They're rumours Rodney. That's all. Rumours.' The proposed prequel, was to be titled \"Once Upon a Time in Peckham\", it would see young versions of Del, Boycie, Denzil and Trigger, and Sullivan said \"Joanie will be a key character, and during the film will give birth to Rodney.\" However, the prequel was shelved, and spin-off \"The Green Green Grass\" was developed to follow secondary characters, Boycie, Marlene and their son Tyler, as they escape the London Mafia and attempt to live in the Shropshire countryside. It was reported in January 2009 that the prequel was being considered again, following the success of \"The Green Green Grass\". In April 2009, Sullivan told \"The Mail on Sunday\" that he had started writing the prequel, and that Lyndhurst was \"keen\" to play Robdal, a local criminal and Rodney's biological father, although the production had yet to be commissioned.\n\nOn 3 July 2009, the BBC announced that the prequel had been commissioned as a 90-minute comedy drama, titled \"Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Chips\", to be co-produced by the BBC and Sullivan's production company, Shazam Productions. Originally scheduled for August, filming began in October 2009 in London, lasting 19 days. Nicholas Lyndhurst, who played Rodney in \"Only Fools and Horses\", would play villain and art connoisseur Freddie Robdal in a reprise of his role in the \"Sleepless in Peckham\" photograph, Kellie Bright (\"Bad Girls\", \"The Archers\") would play the \"glamorous\" Joan Trotter, her husband Reg would be portrayed by Shaun Dingwall (\"Soldier Soldier\", \"Doctor Who\"), and his father by Phil Daniels (\"Quadrophenia\", \"EastEnders\"). James Buckley (\"The Inbetweeners\"), would play the teenage Derek, Joan and Reg's son, portrayed by David Jason in \"Only Fools and Horses\". Dewi Humphreys (\"The Green Green Grass\") would direct. It was announced in January 2010 that the production would be shown on 24 January on BBC One with the title \"Rock & Chips\".\n\nThe drama was produced by Gareth Gwenlan, who worked on \"Only Fools and Horses\" between 1988 and 2003. Speaking to the \"Western Mail\", he described it as \"essentially a love story\" between Joan and Freddie, and he said that Lyndhurst \"told me he thinks it's the best thing he's ever done\". Speaking about the casting of Lyndhurst, he said he \"would make a marvellous villain, which is something people will never have seen him do on TV before\".\n\nSpeaking about continuing the story, Gwenlan said that the production was \"run on the idea it'll be turned into a series. This one lays the groundwork and John [Sullivan] has enough for about two more series.\"\n\nOn 13 September 2010, while promoting the third series of \"The Inbetweeners\" on BBC Radio 5 Live, James Buckley confirmed that \"Rock & Chips\" would return for two more specials, one for Christmas 2010, and the other for Easter 2011. John Sullivan died on 23 April 2011, five days before the final episode was broadcast.\n\nThe 'Nags Head' pub used in the pilot episode is a de-furbished version of the existing 'Pelton Arms' pub in Greenwich, which maintains the 'Only Fools And Horses' look, style and 'feel'. The prefabricated Excalibur Estate in Catford was used as a location in the opening episode.\n\nSullivan said when the production was announced that it would \"give us a bit of an insight into why Del and Rodney turned out way they did\" in a period \"before The Beatles and Mary Quant made London the coolest place on the planet\" when \"the staple diet was rock salmon and chips and the flicks offer the only hint of glamour\". Expanding further on the basis for the prequel, he said:\n... the most important person in the flat [in \"Only Fools and Horses\"] was never, ever seen; it was the spirit of Del's (and Rodney's) beloved mother Joan who had passed away 17 years before, and throughout the run of the series Del constantly referred to her and past events within the Trotter Family. ... But much of his historical information was at best contradictory, and outright lies. We were left with a situation where the only person who really knew what had happened was an unreliable witness, so I decided to return to those misty days of 1960 to meet all those characters we'd only ever heard about ...\n\nIn an interview in the press pack for the production, Lyndhurst described Freddie Robdal as \"a villain – charming, but nasty\", and comparing him to Rodney, said that: \"They're from two entirely different suitcases as far as I'm concerned. I didn't want to bring into it anything that I'd already done with Rodney and fortunately there wasn't any opportunity to do so. They're like chalk and cheese.\" Speaking about the 19-day filming schedule and the \"not great\" budget, he also told Michael Deacon of \"The Daily Telegraph\" that:\n\nI was very pleased it was made at all. ... There were people who said, 'I don't think we're going to do this', and we had to wait months to get the green light. We thought, 'Well, we haven't got the budget we want, we haven't got the schedule we want, so we're going to have to make it as brilliant as we can.' It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.\n\nOvernight figures estimated \"Rock & Chips\" was seen by 7.4 million viewers with a 28% audience share, winning the slot against ITV's \"Wild at Heart\" and the \"Dancing on Ice\" results show. It was the second most-watched programme of the day, behind the first \"Dancing on Ice\" programme of the evening. Final figures showed it was seen by 8.42 million viewers on BBC One and 279,000 on BBC HD.\n\nSam Wollaston for \"The Guardian\" said he was missing the interplay between Rodney and Del Boy from the original, and that the only fun in the drama was \"recognising the nods, working out who's who and how it all fits into place. Otherwise, it's pretty lame.\" The \"Daily Mirror\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline \"interesting or convincing\", finding Lyndhurst's performance as Freddie \"laughable\" and saying it was \"bizarre\" that the storyline \"virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him\". In \"The Independent\", Tom Sutcliffe said that \"the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite a lot of the time you were well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you\". Benji Wilson from \"The Daily Telegraph\" also wasn't impressed saying the viewer would have been disappointed if they \"tuned in wanting to be entertained, enthused, or anything in between\", and that it was an \"ocean-going stinker\".\n\nHowever, \"The Scotsman\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Paul Whitelaw said that, despite a \"disjointed\" plot and it being \"overstretched at 90 minutes\": \"It was actually pretty good. Not great, not perfect, but a watchable production from which everyone emerged with their dignity intact.\" He said that Buckley \"delivered a charming performance in what was effectively a supporting role. Wisely choosing to suggest Del's familiar mannerisms without opting for outright impersonation, he carried off a difficult task with modest élan.\" Writing for \"The Stage\", Harry Venning found the performances \"top notch\" and praised the script as \"first class\", saying \"the comic moments were of the highest quality and beautifully crafted into the narrative\". Andrew Billen from \"The Times\" described Bright's portrayal of Joan as \"winsome\", said Lyndhurst \"produced a detailed performance\" and that \"\"Rock & Chips\" was better than the sequel that preceded it.\" Keith Watson in the \"Metro\" also praised the performances of Buckley and Bright, saying \"They deserved a show all to themselves.\" Although he found the period detail \"squeaky clean\" and \"unconvincing\", he closed his review by saying: \"Somehow it made me care about the Trotters in a way decades of \"Only Fools and Horses\" never came close to.\"\n\nThe pilot of \"Rock & Chips\" was released on Region 2 DVD on 5 April 2010. The Christmas special \"Five Gold Rings\" was released on DVD on 28 March 2011. On 2 May 2011 a three-disc DVD set titled \"Rock & Chips - The Complete Collection\" was released, comprising all three of the episodes.\n\n"}

The Second Circuit affirmed, with Judge Jon O. Newman writing for the panel that \"suppressing an artistically relevant though ambiguous[ly] title[d] film\" on trademark grounds would \"unduly restrict expression.\" The court held that \"In sum, we hold that section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not bar a minimally relevant use of a celebrity's name in the title of an artistic work where the title does not explicitly denote authorship, sponsorship, or endorsement by the celebrity or explicitly mislead as to content.\"\n\nJudge Thomas Griesa concurred in the judgment, but wrote separately to argue that the Second Circuit had not needed to establish a general rule.\n\nThe \"Rogers test\", so-called, has since been cited by numerous courts, adopting its reasoning to protect the use of trademarks in works of creative expression.\n"}

During the 1920s and 1930s it was often censored and even temporarily stopped. In autumn 1938 the party was abolished and during the German occupation and World War II that came soon afterwards the newspaper became an underground mimeographed pamphlet. After the communist take-over in 1948 it became the leading newspaper in the country, the Czechoslovak equivalent of the Soviet Union's \"Pravda\", highly propagandistic and sometimes obedient to the government.

It can also be an artist or a band temporarily switching to a different style.\n\nUsually these projects emphasize a different aspect of that person's or that band's musical interests that they feel they cannot explore within the boundaries established by their main project. Side projects can later become full-time endeavours, but should not be confused with quitting a band for a solo career or another band. Peter Hartlaub of \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called the solo side project \"the biggest longshot bet in mainstream music\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" described the side project as \"a break from the other band members, a chance to toy with different genres and recording methods, a fling with no long-term commitment\". There can be aesthetic reasons to pursue side projects, and side projects can have the benefit of protecting indie credibility.\n\nOne example of musical side projects is Kiss's decision in 1978 to have each member of the band, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, simultaneously release solo albums. In 1992, The Melvins released solo EPs in a similar fashion.\n\n\"Side project\" may also refer to pursuits of famous individuals outside of their primary fields. For instance, Wicked Wisdom is a \"side project\" of actress Jada Pinkett Smith. Side projects often occur at a crossroads of a celebrity's career.\n\nA side project can also be a band that takes on an \"alter ego\", usually in order to play a different style of music that their fans are not used to. An example of this type of side project would be the band Weezer, who is also the Nirvana cover band Goat Punishment.\n\nAnother example of a side project is when in 1990, Jesper Strömblad of Ceremonial Oath decided to start a side project known as In Flames because he wanted to start a new project that combined Iron Maiden and death metal all together which he said he had never heard of before, the side project then grew into a band in 1995 and is now one of the most influential Metal bands of all time, and still together without Jesper.\n\n\n"}

The book was first published by Ambo Anthos in 2009. It was translated into English by Sam Garrett, published in Great Britain in 2012, and the United States in 2013. The book became an international bestseller with many translations and has been adapted into three films.\n\nThe story is narrated by Paul Lohman, a former history teacher. He and his wife Claire meet at a fancy restaurant in Amsterdam with his elder brother Serge, a prominent politician and contender for the position of Dutch prime minister, and his wife Babette. The plan is to discuss over dinner how to handle a crime committed by their teenage sons, Michel and Rick, respectively. The violent act of the two boys had been filmed by a security camera and shown on TV, but, so far, they have not been identified. The parents have to decide on what to do. They debate over dinner causing tension throughout the evening.\n\nThe book belongs to the genre of stories told by an unreliable narrator. The story is organized in sections that are headed by the sequential courses of the dinner, from aperitif to digestif, and frequently interrupted by some form of disruption during the meal as well as flashbacks. The novel starts with what appears to be a skeptical \"attitude towards the fashionable, the fancy and the fussy\" that may appeal to the reader only to turn—\"slowly and fiendishly\"—to make the reader think about the nature of their own indignations.\n\nBy 2012 the book had already sold a million copies in Europe. Arifa Akbar (\"The Independent\") noted that the \"sly\" and \"riveting\" novel seems to head in one direction, then \"is galloping down another, unexpected path\" and finds that it \"may thrill, chill or cheat\", whereby its \"spectacular style triumphs over substance\". The book was twice reviewed by \"The New York Times\". Janet Maslin found the morality of the story \"really sickening\", none of the four characters at the dinner is \"really sane\" and compared it negatively to Gillian Flynn’s \"Gone Girl\" where the characters are vicious but also sympathetic. Claire Messud noted a \"bracing nastiness\" in the book as more and more secrets are disclosed. She opines that \"The Dinner\" is, to some extent, \"attuned to a distinctly European society, one simultaneously more ostentatious in its apparent \"civilization\" and more ashamed of its underlying savagery\". Alex Preston (\"The Guardian\") indicated that the book is about the nature of evil and found it to be a well-paced and entertaining novel that shows \"brutal violent creatures\" under \"the thin facades of decency and manners.\" Lisa Zeidner (\"The Washington Post\") recognized black humor in the novel as in the unlikely choice of a public restaurant for the delicate discussion. She opined that Koch illustrates the absurdities of our privileged daily lives and pokes fun at \"Dutch mediocrity\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1043328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1043328", "title": "The Speech of Polly Baker", "text": "The Speech of Polly Baker\n\n\"The Speech of Polly Baker\" (1747) is the fictional story of a woman put on trial in 1747 for having an illegitimate child. She had been convicted four times in the past for this same crime. Each time, she said, the full blame was placed on her shoulders but not the father's. In later versions, the story ends as she is set free and marries one of the magistrates in charge of her trial.\n\nThis story was actually written by Benjamin Franklin as a protest to the unfairness of the early judicial system charging women for having illegitimate children while not charging the fathers, although he did not disclose this until decades later; therefore Polly Baker is one of Franklin's many aliases. Franklin himself had an illegitimate son named William Franklin. See Illegitimacy in fiction.\n\nThe speech of Polly Baker, before a Court of Judicature, at Connecticut near Boston in New England; where she was prosecuted the Fifth Time, for having a Bastard Child: Which influenced the Court to dispense with her Punishment, and induced one of her Judges to marry her the next day.\n\nMay it please the Honourable Bench to indulge me a few Words: I am a poor unhappy Woman; who have no Money to Fee Lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to it to get a tolerable Living. I shall not trouble your Honours with long Speeches; for I have not the presumption to expect, that you may, by any Means, be prevailed on to deviate in your Sentence from the Law, in my Favour. All I humbly hope is, that your Honours would charitably move the Governor’s Goodness on my Behalf, that my Fine may be remitted. This is the Fifth Time, Gentlemen, that I have been dragg’d before your Courts on the same Account; twice I have paid heavy Fines, and twice have been brought to public Punishment, for want of Money to pay those Fines. This may have been agreeable to the Laws; I do not dispute it: But since Laws are sometimes unreasonable in themselves, and therefore repealed; and others bear too hard on the Subject in particular Circumstances; and therefore there is left a Power somewhere to dispense with the Execution of them; I take the Liberty to say, that I think this Law, by which I am punished, is both unreasonable in itself, and particularly severe with regard to me, who have always lived an inoffensive Life in the Neighbourhood where I was born, and defy my Enemies (if I have any) to say I ever wrong’d Man, Woman, or Child. Abstracted from the Law, I cannot conceive (may it please your Honours) what the Nature of my Offence is. I have brought Five fine Children into the World, at the Risque of my Life: I have maintained them well by my own Industry, without burthening the Township, and could have done it better, if it had not been for the heavy Charges and Fines I have paid. Can it be a Crime (in the Nature of Things I mean) to add to the Number of the King’s Subjects, in a new Country that really wants People? I own I should think it rather a Praise worthy, than a Punishable Action. I have debauch’d no other Woman’s Husband, nor inticed any innocent Youth: These Things I never was charged with; nor has any one the least cause of Complaint against me, unless, perhaps the Minister, or the Justice, because I have had Children without being Married, by which they have miss’d a Wedding Fee. But, can even this be a Fault of mine? I appeal to your Honours. You are pleased to allow I don’t want Sense; but I must be stupid to the last Degree, not to prefer the honourable State of Wedlock, to the Condition I have lived in. I always was, and still am, willing to enter into it; I doubt not my Behaving well in it, having all the Industry, Frugality, Fertility, and Skill in Oeconomy, appertaining to a good Wife’s Character. I defy any Person to say I ever Refused an Offer of that Sort: On the contrary, I readily Consented to the only Proposal of Marriage that ever was made me, which was when I was a Virgin; but too easily confiding in the Person’s Sincerity that made it, I unhappily lost my own Honour, by trusting to his; for he got me with Child, and then forsook me: That very Person you all know; he is now become a Magistrate of this County; and I had hopes he would have appeared this Day on the Bench, and have endeavoured to moderate the Court in my Favour; then I should have scorn’d to have mention’d it; but I must Complain of it as unjust and unequal, that my Betrayer and Undoer, the first Cause of all my Faults and Miscarriages (if they must be deemed such) should be advanced to Honour and Power, in the same Government that punishes my Misfortunes with Stripes and Infamy. I shall be told, ’tis like, that were there no Act of Assembly in the Case, the Precepts of Religion are violated by my Transgressions. If mine, then, is a religious Offence, leave it, Gentlemen, to religious Punishments. You have already excluded me from all the Comforts of your Church Communion: Is not that sufficient? You believe I have offended Heaven, and must suffer eternal Fire: Will not that be sufficient? What need is there, then, of your additional Fines and Whippings? I own, I do not think as you do; for, if I thought, what you call a Sin, was really such, I would not presumptuously commit it. But how can it be believed, that Heaven is angry at my having Children, when, to the little done by me towards it, God has been pleased to add his divine Skill and admirable Workmanship in the Formation of their Bodies, and crown’d it by furnishing them with rational and immortal Souls? Forgive me Gentlemen, if I talk a little extravagantly on these Matters; I am no Divine: But if you, great Men, (*) must be making Laws, do not turn natural and useful Actions into Crimes, by your Prohibitions. Reflect a little on the horrid Consequences of this Law in particular: What Numbers of procur’d Abortions! and how many distress’d Mothers have been driven, by the Terror of Punishment and public Shame, to imbrue, contrary to Nature, their own trembling Hands in the Blood of their helpless Offspring! Nature would have induc’d them to nurse it up with a Parent’s Fondness. ’Tis the Law therefore, ’tis the Law itself that is guilty of all these Barbarities and Murders. Repeal it then, Gentlemen; let it be expung’d for ever from your Books: And on the other hand, take into your wise Consideration, the great and growing Number of Batchelors in the Country, many of whom, from the mean Fear of the Expence of a Family, have never sincerely and honourably Courted a Woman in their Lives; and by their Manner of Living, leave unproduced (which I think is little better than Murder) Hundreds of their Posterity to the Thousandth Generation. Is not theirs a greater Offence against the Public Good, than mine? Compel them then, by a Law, either to Marry, or pay double the Fine of Fornication every Year. What must poor young Women do, whom Custom has forbid to sollicit the Men, and who cannot force themselves upon Husbands, when the Laws take no Care to provide them any, and yet severely punish if they do their Duty without them? Yes, Gentlemen, I venture to call it a Duty; ’tis the Duty of the first and great Command of Nature, and of Nature’s God, Increase and multiply: A Duty, from the steady Performance of which nothing has ever been able to deter me; but for its Sake, I have hazarded the Loss of the public Esteem, and frequently incurr’d public Disgrace and Punishment; and therefore ought, in my humble Opinion, instead of a Whipping, to have a Statue erected to my Memory.\nOn the surface \"The Speech of Polly Baker\" appears to be a light-hearted and \"amusing story\". However, Franklin presents a protest against legislation that punished women for out-of-wedlock sexual relations by imposing fines and whippings while the father of the child went without punishment. Through her use of rhetorical questions to the magistrates, Franklin shows the inequity of the prevailing justice system.\n\nFranklin creates a sympathetic fictional character in Polly Baker. According to literary critic Etta Madden, Baker's assertion that she's worthy of a statue in the town square reflects and mocks \"Mather's memorializing of saints in his \"Magnalia Christi Americana\"\" as well as the execution sermons Puritans espoused to make \"lessons of wayward females.\" Furthermore, Madden explains that Baker's rational speech shows echoes of Anne Hutchinson, although some might not find her speech rational at all. Therefore, Madden argues, the piece shows more complexity that is initially apparent. Another critic (Aldridge) argues that if taken out of the context of American literature, \"The Speech of Polly Baker\" can be considered as a \"universal myth along the lines of Don Juan and Faust.\"\n\n\"The Speech of Polly Baker\" was first published in April or May 1747 in \"The Gentleman's Magazine\". Initially the piece was published anonymously, but in 1905 it was included in \"The Writings of Benjamin Franklin\", although the editor had yet to prove Franklin's authorship. Max Hall, in \"Benjamin Franklin and Polly Baker: The History of a Literary Deception\" (1960) proved conclusively that Franklin wrote the piece, a conclusion accepted by scholars.\n"}

{"id": "245614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245614", "title": "Tin Pan Alley", "text": "Tin Pan Alley\n\nTin Pan Alley is the name given to the collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the Flower District of Manhattan; a plaque (see below) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.\n\nThe start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut. Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph, radio, and motion pictures supplanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll, which was centered on the Brill Building.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Tin Pan Alley\" are unclear. One account claims that it was a derogatory reference to the sound of many pianos (comparing them to the banging of tin pans). Others claim it arose from songwriters modifying their pianos to produce a more percussive sound. After many years, the term came to refer to the U.S. music industry in general.\n\nVarious explanations have been advanced to account for the origins of the term \"Tin Pan Alley\". The most popular account holds that it was originally a derogatory reference by Monroe H. Rosenfeld in the \"New York Herald\" to the collective sound made by many \"cheap upright pianos\" all playing different tunes being reminiscent of the banging of tin pans in an alleyway. This article has not been found.\n\nSimon Napier-Bell quotes an account of the origin of the name which was published in a 1930 book about the music business. In this version, popular songwriter Harry von Tilzer was being interviewed about the area around 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, where many music publishers had their offices. Von Tilzer had modified his expensive Kindler & Collins piano by placing strips of paper down the strings to give the instrument a more percussive sound. The journalist told von Tilzer, \"Your Kindler & Collins sounds exactly like a tin can. I'll call the article 'Tin Pan Alley'.\"\n\nWith time, this nickname was popularly embraced and came to describe the American music publishing industry in general. The term then spread to the United Kingdom, where \"Tin Pan Alley\" is also used to describe Denmark Street in London's West End. In the 1920s the street became known as \"Britain's Tin Pan Alley\" because of its large number of music shops.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, copyright control of melodies was not as strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit. Songwriters would literally bang on the doors of Tin Pan Alley businesses to get new material.\n\nThe commercial center of the popular music publishing industry changed during the course of the 19th century, starting in Boston and moving to Philadelphia, Chicago and Cincinnati before settling in New York City under the influence of new and vigorous publishers which concentrated on vocal music. The two most enterprising New York publishers were Willis Woodard and T.B. Harms, the first companies to specialize in popular songs rather than hymns or classical music. Naturally, these firms were located in the entertainment district, which, at the time, was centered on Union Square. Witmark was the first publishing house to move to West 28th Street as the entertainment district gradually shifted uptown, and by the late 1890s most publishers had followed their lead.\n\nThe biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers – often connected with commercial printers or music stores – continued to flourish throughout the country, and there were important regional music publishing centers in Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, and Boston. When a tune became a significant local hit, rights to it were usually purchased from the local publisher by one of the big New York firms.\n\nThe song publishers who created Tin Pan Alley frequently had backgrounds as salesmen. The background of Isadore Witmark was selling water filters. Leo Feist had sold corsets, and Joe Stern and Edward B. Marks had sold neckties and buttons respectively. The music houses in lower Manhattan were lively places, with a steady stream of songwriters, vaudeville and Broadway performers, musicians, and \"song pluggers\" coming and going.\n\nAspiring songwriters came to demonstrate tunes they hoped to sell. When tunes were purchased from unknowns with no previous hits, the name of someone with the firm was often added as co-composer (in order to keep a higher percentage of royalties within the firm), or all rights to the song were purchased outright for a flat fee (including rights to put someone else's name on the sheet music as the composer). An extraordinary number of Jewish East European immigrants became the music publishers and song writers on Tin Pan Alley – the most famous being Irving Berlin. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses.\n\n\"Song pluggers\" were pianists and singers who represented the music publishers, making their living demonstrating songs to promote sales of sheet music. Most music stores had song pluggers on staff. Other pluggers were employed by the publishers to travel and familiarize the public with their new publications. Among the ranks of song pluggers were George Gershwin, Harry Warren, Vincent Youmans and Al Sherman. A more aggressive form of song plugging was known as \"booming\": it meant buying dozens of tickets for shows, infiltrating the audience and then singing the song to be plugged. At Shapiro Bernstein, Louis Bernstein recalled taking his plugging crew to cycle races at Madison Square Garden: \"They had 20,000 people there, we had a pianist and a singer with a large horn. We'd sing a song to them thirty times a night. They'd cheer and yell, and we kept pounding away at them. When people walked out, they'd be singing the song. They couldn't help it.\"\n\nWhen vaudeville performers played New York City, they would often visit various Tin Pan Alley firms to find new songs for their acts. Second- and third-rate performers often paid for rights to use a new song, while famous stars were given free copies of publisher's new numbers or were paid to perform them, the publishers knowing this was valuable advertising.\n\nInitially Tin Pan Alley specialized in melodramatic ballads and comic novelty songs, but it embraced the newly popular styles of the cakewalk and ragtime music. Later on jazz and blues were incorporated, although less completely, as Tin Pan Alley was oriented towards producing songs that amateur singers or small town bands could perform from printed music. In the 1910s and 1920s Tin Pan Alley published pop-songs and dance numbers created in newly popular jazz and blues styles.\n\nA group of Tin Pan Alley music houses formed the \"Music Publishers Association of the United States\" on June 11, 1895, and unsuccessfully lobbied the federal government in favor of the Treloar Copyright Bill, which would have changed the term of copyright for published music from 24 to 40 years, renewable for an additional 20 instead of 14 years. The bill would also have included music among the subject matter covered by the Manufacturing clause of the International Copyright Act of 1891.\n\nThe American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) was founded in 1914 to aid and protect the interests of established publishers and composers. New members were only admitted with sponsorship of existing members.\n\nThe term and established business methodologies associated with Tin Pan Alley persisted into the 1960s when innovative artists like Bob Dylan helped establish new norms. Referring to the dominant conventions of music publishers of the early 20th century, \"Tin Pan Alley is gone,\" Bob Dylan proclaimed in 1985, \"I put an end to it. People can record their own songs now.\"\n\nDuring the Second World War, Tin Pan Alley and the federal government teamed up to produce a war song that would inspire the American public to support the fight against the Axis, something they both \"seemed to believe … was vital to the war effort.\" The Office of War Information was in charge of this project, and believed that Tin Pan Alley contained \"a reservoir of talent and competence capable of influencing people's feelings and opinions\" that it \"might be capable of even greater influence during wartime than [George M. Cohan's \"Over There\" during World War I].\" The song \"Over There\" can be said to be the most popular and resonant patriotic song associated with World War I. Due to the large fan base of Tin Pan Alley, the government believed that this sector of the music business would be far-reaching in spreading patriotic sentiments.\n\nIn the United States Congress, congressmen quarrelled over a proposal to exempt musicians and other entertainers from the draft in order to remain in the country to boost morale. Stateside, these artists and performers were continuously using available media to promote the war effort and to demonstrate a commitment to victory. However, the proposal was contested by those who strongly believed that only those who provided more substantial contributions to the war effort should benefit from any draft legislation.\n\nAs the war progressed, those in charge of writing the would-be national war song began to understand that the interest of the public lay elsewhere. Since the music would take up such a large amount of airtime, it was imperative that the writing be consistent with the war message that the radio was carrying throughout the nation. In her book, God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War, Kathleen E.R. Smith writes that \"escapism seemed to be a high priority for music listeners,\" leading \"the composers of Tin Pan Alley [to struggle] to write a war song that would appeal both to civilians and the armed forces.\" By the end of the war, no such song had been produced that could rival hits like \"Over There\" from World War I.\n\nWhether or not the number of songs circulated from Tin Pan Alley between 1939 and 1945 was greater than during the First World War is still debated. In his book \"The Songs That Fought the War: Popular Music and the Home Front\", John Bush Jones cites Jeffrey C. Livingstone as claiming that Tin Pan Alley released more songs during World War I than it did in World War II. Jones, on the other hand, argues that \"there is also strong documentary evidence that the output of American war-related songs during World War II was most probably unsurpassed in any other war.\"\n\nLeading Tin Pan Alley composers and lyricists include:\n\n\n\n\nTin Pan Alley's biggest hits included:\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

It is the only Ukrainian TV channel covering over 97% of Ukraine's territory. Its programs are oriented toward all levels of Ukrainian society and national minorities. Among priority directions of the network are information, popular science, culture, entertainment and sports. The channel traces its origin to the original Soviet UT (Ukrainian Television) and after dissolution of the Soviet Union UT-1. In 2002 it changed its name to Pershyi Natsionalnyi (First National). Since 2015 it carries its current name.\n\nThe first attempt at Ukrainian television broadcasting was on February 1, 1939, and lasted for 40 minutes. The second attempt was well over six years after the conclusion of World War II, on November 6 and 7, 1951, in time for October Revolution Day, when the Kiev studio broadcast two shows. The next attempt was conducted on May 1, 1952 when the studio broadcast a concert anchored by Novela Separionova featuring local singers. The new television studios at 26 Khreschatyk for television broadcasting opened their doors in 1953. It was the third official telecenter established in the Soviet Union after Moscow (1934) and Leningrad (1937-38). Until 1956 the studio was only presenting a couple of shows per day; from November that year regular programming started. Live broadcasting (which makes the first generation TV announcers proud today) was the only form of broadcasting up to the introduction of videotape recording in the mid-1960s.\n\nOn 20 January 1965, TV viewers in some Ukrainian oblasts (regions) could see a screen with two big capital letters \"УТ\" (\"UT\") that symbolized the beginning of the united national station for the Ukrainian SSR, by now named \"Ukrainian Television\". Its time on air was over 200 hours in 1965. On 6 March 1972, UT started to go on air on two channels at a time – УТ-1 (UT-1) and УТ-2 (UT-2), and adopted SECAM colour in 1976. At the end of the 1970s the building of the UT on Khreshchatyk was reconstructed and the employees got three new studios, but the question of building a new modern TV-center was raised soon. The construction of the new UT headquarters started in 1983 and was finished in 1993. (By this point in time the former Soviet Union had dissolved and Ukraine was one of the resultant newly-independent countries.) The new center was built at 42 Melnykov Street and was officially inspected by the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk.\n\nIn 2002 the National Television Company of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Space Agency started to broadcast Pershyi Natsionalnyi (as First National) (UT-1) through a satellite abroad. In 2004 UT2 ended its operations and as a result UTR started its broadcasting on UT-2's frequency. UT-1 was renamed \"First Channel\". In 2005 Taras Stets'kiv became the president of the National Television Company of Ukraine. First Channel prepared to and held the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 successfully in Kiev. In 2006 Vitaliy Dokalenko was appointed as the president of the National Television Company of Ukraine by former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko. In 2010 Yehor Benkendorf, former chief producer of Inter TV channel, was appointed as the president of the National Television Company of Ukraine by Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich.\n\nOn 1 September 2008, State Television went through a major rebranding that included an updated logo, idents change and new program openers. The new logo consisted of the word \"Pershyi\" (\"First\").\n\nOn 7 April 2015, the channel went through another rebranding. The logo has changed to a newly created public broadcaster's after signing the bill \"On amendments to some laws of Ukraine on Public Television and Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine\" into law by Petro Poroshenko.\n\nIn May 2018, this channel broadcasting Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in 1080p and stereo sound for several cable, satellite and IPTV operators. It's currently unknown when this channel will broadcast for this resolution majorly.\n\nBetween 1972 and 1997 the logo was in the top left corner. From 1997–present, it is in the top right corner.\n\n\n\n"}
