The film is from the point of view of the New York City Fire Department. The film was directed by Jules and Gédéon Naudet, and FDNY firefighter James Hanlon, and produced by Susan Zirinsky of CBS News.\n\nFilmmakers James Hanlon and the Naudet brothers were given permission by New York City Fire Department to film a documentary about a probationary firefighter. Their subject was Tony Benetatos, assigned to the Engine 7/Ladder 1/Battalion 1 Firehouse on Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. They intended to make a film about the \"probie's\" first experiences as a firefighter. On the morning of September 11, the firehouse, under the direction of Battalion Chief Joseph W. Pfeifer, was called out on a reported \"odor of gas\" at Church and Lispenard streets. Jules Naudet rode with Pfeifer to investigate, while Gédéon stayed behind at the firehouse to film the \"probie.\"\n\nAs the Battalion 1 firefighters examined the supposed gas leak, American Airlines Flight 11 flew overhead. Turning his camera to follow the plane, Jules Naudet taped one of only three known recordings of the first plane hitting the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center in the 9/11 attacks. The others were a video shot by Pavel Hlava and a sequence of still frames taken by Wolfgang Staehle.\n\nThe firefighters under the direction of Chief Pfeifer were the first responders on the scene. Naudet was allowed to follow the chief during the attempted rescue operation. Naudet, Chief Pfeifer and several other FDNY chiefs were inside the lobby of Tower 1 when Tower 2 was hit by the second aircraft and when Tower 2 eventually collapsed. (Gédéon Naudet was still at the firehouse, where he filmed Benetatos and the rest of the firefighters from the next shift as they tried to deal with the disaster). The film gives various firemen's accounts of the events of the remainder of the day: from the initial crash to the building's collapse, to the attempts to rescue the few survivors from the rubble, as well as the aftermath of the events and acknowledging those who were lost, including Chief Pfeifer's brother, Engine 33 Lieutenant Kevin Pfeifer.\n\nCBS aired \"9/11\" commercial-free on March 10, 2002, to mark the six-month anniversary since the attacks. It was produced by Susan Zirinksy. The film was watched by 39.4 million viewers, bringing in a rating/share of 22.3/33, and was the highest-rated program that week. Hosted by actor Robert De Niro, CBS's broadcast was repeated on the first annual anniversary as well. The film aired in 103 countries in 2002 alone. \n\nThe film was noted for the subjects' use of profanity. Under regular circumstances on American broadcast media, this language would have been subject to censorship by the broadcaster or the Federal Communications Commission. At the time of the documentary's broadcast, the FCC took no action against the network for violating indecency rules, because it believed such action would have a negative connotation and would be interpreted as sanitizing history.\n\nIn addition, a recent ruling by a federal appeals court had successfully granted a \"temporary halt\" to the FCC's enforcement of its indecency rules. This allowed CBS and any affiliates to air the documentary without edits and without fear of facing stiff fines.\n\nThe DVD of the documentary was released in proximity, with De Niro's footage edited from it. CBS re-aired the film, hosted again by De Niro, on September 10, 2006, the night before the fifth anniversary of the attacks. This version contained updates from the principal subjects of the documentary,as of 2006.\n\nOn Sunday, September 11, 2011, CBS broadcast \"9/11: Ten Years Later,\" once again hosted by Robert De Niro. The aftershow was updated by the Naudet brothers, Hanlon and CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky to include new interviews and footage on the lives of those who had been shown in the documentary ten years later. The program also focused on the construction of the new One World Trade Center, and on the health problems faced by many of the firemen who had served at Ground Zero, where they were exposed to burning contaminants. DeNiro was joined by the Naudet brothers and James Hanlon, a former New York fireman-turned-film director who was also present that day. As with all previous broadcasts of the film, CBS aired repeated viewer discretion warnings before and during the broadcast.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, CNN picked up the rights to show the film for the 15th anniversary, this time hosted by Denis Leary.\n\n\"9/11\" was nominated for and won multiple awards, including an Emmy for Outstanding Non-Fiction Special (Informational) and a Peabody Award.\n"}

The exhibition combines a trade exhibition and an air show. \n\nThe AAD began in 1975 when the South African based aviation magazine World Airnews determined that a professional aerospace exhibition was appropriate, as distinguished from the traveling \"barnstorming\" air shows that were then prominent.\n\nThe first event was held October 1975 as \"Aviation Africa\", at Lanseria Airport near Johannesburg, South Africa under the sponsorship of the Commercial Aviation Association of Southern Africa. The same year, Lt. General Bob Rogers of the South African Air Force instituted an open day at AFB Waterkloof, in Centurion, which eventually turned into the Defence Exhibition of South Africa (DEXSA).\n\nIn 2000, Aviation Africa and DEXSA combined to become AAD. In 2006, the exhibition moved to AFB Ysterplaat in Cape Town. It returned to AFB Waterkloof in 2012.\n\nThe next AAD is scheduled for 19-23 September 2018.\n"}

It was originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and later ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, and Game Boy.\n\n\"The Ultimate Team\" is a crossover of both Technos Japan's \"Double Dragon\" and Rare's own \"Battletoads\" game franchises, although Technos had little or no credited involvement in the production of the game outside of the \"Double Dragon\" license. The game features the characters from the \"Double Dragon\" series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, two young martial arts experts; also included are the three humanoid toad protagonists from the \"Battletoads\" game. It is also the first \"Battletoads\" game to feature all three toads as playable characters. The game's engine and design are directly based upon the \"Battletoads\" series.\n\nThe player has a choice of five playable characters: Billy and Jimmy Lee from \"Double Dragon\", and Zitz, Pimple and Rash from \"Battletoads\". The player must then proceed through seven stages, kicking and punching each enemy that comes onscreen. A boss is included at the end of each stage, challenging the player before they can progress to a higher level of the game.\n\nWith two players, the continues are overlapping: whenever one player continues, then both players have to start at the beginning of the level (this is the opposite of games like \"Contra\", where a strong player can tow a weak player along to advanced levels; in \"Battletoads Double Dragon\", a weak player will hold a strong player back).\n\nAfter being defeated by the Battletoads, the evil Dark Queen flees to the outer reaches of the universe and the 'Toads and their mentor get on with their lives. However, one day the Earth's military is neutralized and a giant spaceship called \"Colossus\" emerges from the moon. Apparently, the Dark Queen is back with another plan to dominate the galaxy, and she has allied herself with the Shadow Warriors (from the \"Double Dragon\" series) to supplement her forces. Deciding to even the odds, the Battletoads get in contact with Billy and Jimmy Lee and ask them for their help. The brothers agree, and all five immediately take off for the Colossus in a mission to stop this two-pronged threat.\n\nThe initial NES version of the game features 3D scrolling and other advanced special effects not commonly found on the console. The Game Boy version is similar to the NES version, but it is only for one player. The sprites are the same size although the screen is smaller (leaving less room for movement) and the 3D effects were removed.\n\nThe later Genesis and Super NES versions of the game are quite similar, the only differences being the SNES version has better graphics and higher quality sound, while the Sega version runs more smoothly, features more music tracks, has sharper sprites for the 'toads, and more comical reactions from the characters and from defeated enemies, as well as blood from said enemies' post-defeat portraits.\n\nThe game was very well received upon its release, receiving scores in range of 80-100% in most reviews.\n\n\"Nintendo Power\" staff rated it as the second-best NES game of 1993. The NES version was also nominated for Nintendo Power Awards 1993 in the categories \"Graphics & Sound\", \"Theme & Fun\", \"Play Control\", \"Villain\" (The Dark Queen) and \"The Best Overall Game\". The game was featured on the lists of top 11 video game crossovers\" by UGO Networks and the 15 most bizarre crossovers in gaming by GamesRadar. \n\n"}

The series is published by Dark Horse Comics and ran from March 2014 to August 2016.\n\nThe \"Season Ten\" brand continues the two ongoing component series that formed \"Season Nine\": \"Buffy\" and \"Angel & Faith\". The creative team of \"Angel & Faith\" in \"Season Nine\", writer Christos Gage and penciler Rebekah Isaacs, are the creative team behind \"Buffy Season Ten\". Victor Gischler and Will Conrad took over \"Angel & Faith\" in this season. Unlike with \"Season Nine\", there were no spin-off series in addition to the two core series. There was however a short story titled \"Where Are They Now\", published in Dark Horse Day Sampler 2016.\n\nThe series was followed by \"Season Eleven\" which began November 23, 2016.\n\nAs in the preparation for the previous season, there was a writer's summit in spring 2013, months before \"Season Nine\" ended. Along with all the creators from \"Season Nine\", Victor Gischler and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" actor Nicholas Brendon joined the team.\n\nBuffy and her friends must quickly get to grips with the new rules of magic created at the end of \"Season Nine\" when they encounter a new breed of vampires which can shapeshift, walk in sunlight, and which is generally harder to kill. Another consequence is that Buffy's sister Dawn, though alive again thanks to the recreation of magic, has had a traumatic time adjusting to life; she feels her mother's death as if the event was recent, and her feelings for her boyfriend Xander have reset as well. Meanwhile, Xander is secretly haunted by apparitions of his dead ex-fiance Anya; he does not know if she is real or a hallucination. However, all is not bleak, as Buffy's old mentor Giles is delivered to her by Faith alive and mentally intact, but in the body of a child, following the events of \"Angel & Faith\" in the previous season. The group soon learn that the now-blank \"Vampyr\" book given to Buffy back in 1997 can be used to write new rules for magic, and quickly realizing what a danger this book is, the gang forms an alliance with the demon D'Hoffryn and other interested parties to keep the book safe and act as stewards over the new and unstable rules of magic. They consider the needs of various mystical groups willing to make peace with humans including a mutually non-lethal agreement with the majority of the world's vampires, led by Harmony Kendall.\n\nThe gang does some growing up. Willow prevents Andrew from making a terrible mistake with the \"Vampyr\" book when he attempts to resurrect her long-dead girlfriend Tara, whose death he feels responsible for, and confronts his tendency to act impulsively – sometimes with good motivations – but without regard for other people's consent or feelings. He does however activate a digital recording of the personality of his friend and victim Jonathan Levinson. Some time later, after some soul searching, Andrew realizes he is gay. Meanwhile, Willow, ends her relationship with the demon witch Aluwyn, having grown apart, and Xander and Dawn decide to take things slow. Buffy and Spike confront the fact that they've grown closer to each other, and Buffy realizes she loves Spike, and they become a couple. Buffy stands by Spike when it appears that an evil outside force is controlling him at night, and they soon track this force down: an ancient vampire named Archaeus who is part of the same lineage as Spike and Angel, Archaeus having directly sired the Master. Temporarily getting away from the powerful demon, the group realize they will have to bring Angel in on the development. Buffy is able to put the events of \"Season Eight\", in which Angel was influenced by a higher power into being a villain, behind her, but there is initial awkwardness in the group as they attempt to confront Archaeus. However, working together, Buffy, Angel and Spike are able to wound Archaeus and kill his servants with the Scythe, so Archaeus flees. D'Hoffryn informs Buffy that a portal Archaeus was using, which opens into hell dimensions, is called the Restless Door and is being repaired by an alliance of enemies faced by the gang this season: the Old One, the Soul Glutton; the siren, Mistress; and the flesh demon, the Sculptor, who wish to overrun Earth with demons. Angel leaves to warn his friends in London, giving Spike his blessing and accepting a place as a friend in Buffy's life, but confides in Willow that he believes Spike's self-destructiveness will doom his relationship with Buffy.\n\nWhen Buffy's father Hank announces he doesn't want Buffy to be a part of his wedding due to her being a Slayer, she finds herself surprisingly hurt by this. On a different mission, a demon triggers Buffy's memories of her attempted rape by a soulless Spike. She explains to Spike that she doesn't blame him for his actions when he didn't have a soul, but that she will always remember them, and that he has to respect that she will always have to deal with them in her own way. Meanwhile, Anya's ghost transpires to be the puppet of an unseen force and completely unaware that she is not Anya; it is exploiting Xander as a weak link in Buffy's circle. Later, demon invasions caused by the Restless Door become a global threat. The Slayer Satsu, who once had a fling with Buffy, attempts to convince Buffy that she needs to work with the military as they are the only ones with the resources to help and since she forgave Angel, the military also deserves another chance. The military needs Buffy and Spike to recruit both types of vampires to help battle the demon invasions. The vampires are represented by Harmony and Vicki who have Buffy and Spike win trials of combat to gain the vampires alliance. The two vampire leaders also point out the insecurities in Buffy's and Spike's relationship. Spike later meets with a woman from his past, Dylan, first seen in the \"Spike: Into the Light\" (2014) comic. Dylan thanks Spike for giving her the courage to grow as a person and wants a friendship with both him and Buffy. Meanwhile, Buffy is outraged at Willow's eagerness to work for the military, helping them understand magic. Willow believes this is right and has an attraction to Lake Stevens, a woman who leads the military's supernatural unit. Willow and Buffy acknowledge they are changing but agree to not let this disagreement divide them. \n\nTo help battle the invasions Buffy reluctantly agrees to use the \"Vampyr\" book to increase the powers of D'Hoffryn's Demon Council with the limit that the powers are for the one in office, not the demon themselves. Giles grows close to the Fae folk who accept him in both mind and body, though his favoritism of them leads to some tension with Buffy. The Sculptor offers to make Andrew a human body for Jonathan's digital personality if Andrew steals the Scythe. Andrew tricks the Sculptor into thinking he complied but he actually told Buffy beforehand and she kills the Sculptor. Realising his new body will disintegrate, Jonathan runs off, furious at Andrew betraying him again. Though Andrew is hurt, he has stopped living out his fantasies and is ready to face the real world with the Scoobies. Xander admits to Ghost Anya he knows she isn't actually Anya and decides to ignore her. The Scoobies find and overwhelm the Siren Mistress and Soul Glutton, to escape, the two destroy the Restless Door; creating an unstable portal that will consume Earth unless Dawn as The Key can close it. Being in a magical dimension gives Dawn great power but she can only close the portal from the demon's side and will be stuck there if she does. To save Earth she agrees and convinces the others this is the right choice and they promise to find another way to bring her home. Xander stays with Dawn, leaving Ghost Anya alone and vengeful on Earth. As the Scoobies leave, Buffy wishes D'Hoffryn's Council could just kill the Soul Glutton and Siren Mistress without their help. Ghost Anya secretly grants this wish. After killing the two, D'Hoffryn tells Ghost Anya she was a copy he made and now that she has activated her vengeance powers she becomes corporeal. D'Hoffryn is now ready to take the \"Vampyr\" book to give himself power.\n\nWhile the Scoobies are desperate to reach Dawn and Xander in the hell dimension Anharra, D'Hoffryn kills all the other members of the Magic Council and takes their expanded abilities. The Scoobies are powerless to stop him from taking the book. Meanwhile, Xander and Dawn make the demons of the dimension more civilised but attract the attention of Wolfram & Hart, which has an office there. They reject an offer from W&H lawyer Lilah Morgan to help them find a route home, as that would allow the Senior Partners to return as well. Lilah instead tracks Xander and Dawn as they make their own way home through the multiverse. After D'Hoffryn effortlessly backfires the military's own missiles on them, the military dismisses Willow for the Scoobies' lack of judgement, which leads Willow and Lake to break up. Jonathan returns, tormenting Andrew in an attempt to break up the Scoobies, after he is offered a living body and a life as a vengeance demon by D'Hoffryn. Jonathan shakes Andrew by showing him what his friends really think of him, allowing Jonathan to become the first male vengeance demon, but Andrew realises these comments were taken out of context, and returns to the Scoobies with high-tech weaponry to help fight D'Hoffryn. Giles is disgusted the Fae and the rest of the magical community have agreed to terms with D'Hoffryn, believing him too powerful to fight. Buffy's increasingly aggressive tactics over the book and finding Xander and Dawn put a strain between her and all the Scoobies leading Spike to want to break up with her. Buffy refuses saying their relationship is worth fighting for even if they both have doubts and Spike agrees. Buffy has an idea to stop D'Hoffryn that requires their allies to do nothing. As the Scoobies come together, Dawn and Xander return just in time to join the battle. D'Hoffryn's alterations to the book are rejected as Buffy's plan was to make the magical community believe he would fail; the book only allows rules that the majority of people believe in and will follow. D'Hoffryn broadcasts his battle with the Scoobies to everyone so they will believe he is unstoppable, bringing the Anya copy and Jonathan with him. The Scoobies are quickly overwhelmed while D'Hoffryn claims this is vengeance for taking Anya from him. However, Anya betrays D'Hoffryn and grants Buffy's wish to remove D'Hoffryn's expanded abilities. After D'Hoffryn fatally burns her, the other vengeance demons reject him, and the Scoobies pursue him back to his homeworld, Arashmahar, and kill him, having given Dawn the ability to open portals. Weeks later, the Scoobies decide to own the responsibility of the book, putting Buffy, Willow and Giles on the newest Magical Council, which also includes Dracula, Riley, and other demons, while Lilah and a new cadre of demonic lobbyists and journalists appeal to the Council members for favours. Buffy is excited and nervous about her new responsibilities, but accepts it as part of life. \n\n\"Where are They Now?\" is a brief story released in a free sampler celebrating Dark Horse's 30th anniversary. Harmony, Clem, and a two-person film crew of a vampire and human are filming Harmony's documentary of how the world has changed now that the supernatural is known. She annoys Buffy over three days, calling her a relic that is no longer special since she broke the rules to give all the Slayers power, but also warns her that someone is apparently trying to kill her. Buffy is electrocuted by wires left in water in the laundry room. Harmony interrupts Buffy and Spike's date night, implying they have relationship problems, and the three of them stop an out-of-control streetcar from hurting anyone. On the third night she walks in on Buffy and Giles looking over old spell-books, and Giles remembers the human from the film crew as a former Watcher-in-training, deducing that he and the vampire cameraman are trying to kill Buffy, tired of her messing with primordial forces. Buffy slays the vampire, and the would-be Watcher is turned over to the police. Harmony believes that if a Watcher and vampire hate Buffy enough to work together, she should realise that rules exist for a reason, and that if she keeps breaking them she might break everything. Buffy ignores this, and Harmony is unsure if that makes her the best Slayer ever, or the worst.\n\nAngel begins as the self-appointed guardian over London's new Magic Town ghetto created by events of \"Angel & Faith\" in the previous season, while Faith is on a journey to find herself, initially in the United States. Many of the town's residents have mutated into magical creatures, and Angel is forced to adjust to this new status quo, making an ally in London police officer Detective Brandt and relying on previous local friends Alasdair Coames and the Fairweather sisters Lavinia and Sophronia. He learns that the aggressive Slayer Nadira has survived her injuries at the conclusion of \"Season Nine\" and mutated into a benevolent seer who can commune with the unique magic of Magic Town, which she says is sentient. Angel is initially frustrated by the half-demon Pearl from \"Season Nine\" and a plot run by mutated magical pixies that leads him to the witch Amy Madison. Amy is vengeful for the events of \"Season Eight\", and has gained great power from Magic Town's energy intending to kill Willow. However, Nadira easily overpowers Amy. Soon after, Angel is stunned to find his deceased friend Fred Burkle walking the streets – alive following the events of \"Buffy\" in \"Season Nine\", when Illyria, the demon wearing Fred's former body, appeared to die during the event which restored magic to the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Faith begins working for Kennedy's Slayer bodyguard corporation but doesn't fit in and prepares to quit until she learns Buffy's ex Riley Finn has gone missing in South America. Faith rescues him and his wife Samantha from tribal vampires and Riley forgives her for the events of the \"Buffy\" episode \"Who Are You\", where she slept with Riley while leading him to believe she was Buffy. Faith is then recruited by Kennedy's client, pharmaceuticals owner Reese Zane, to come to Magic Town to help her study the magic there; she appoints Faith her head of security. Angel learns following the creation of the new Seed of Wonder, responsible for all magic in the universe, in \"Buffy\", that Fred's essence was brought back when Illyria's body reconstituted. However, both entities are capable of surfacing and taking control of her body. Divorced again from her human traits, Illyria is convinced that Angel and the others want to destroy her to save Fred. Eldre Koh, a contemporary of Illyria from last season's \"Buffy\" title shows up to learn from Illyria who had him falsely imprisoned for killing his own family, only to discover it was Illyria herself. With coaxing from Nadira, Koh is able to give up his need for vengeance. After Illyria goes on a rampage, Fred is able to reassert control and contain Illyria inside her. Illyria and Fred fascinate Reese, who discloses her intent to research them further.\n\nWhile Angel is away, Faith and Fred are called by Detective Brandt to look into a recent trend of murders caused by vampires in the London area. Realizing the connection to the deaths in Angel's dreams and a local Prep School, Faith & Fred go undercover as the gym teacher and lunch lady respectively. Faith notices a girl named Mary being bullied by her classmates. The bullies are all new vampires that have been ordered to convince their classmates to want to become vampires. Faith & Fred slay the bullies. Mary discovers the vampires want her to join them, while they are led by Drusilla. Archaeus has recruited Drusilla to sire the students and wants Mary sired for a special reason. Faith, Fred and Koh save Mary while dusting the vampire students, though Drusilla escapes. Faith and Fred decide to wait for Angel to return to figure out their next move, while Mary visits her father who is researching an ancient statue. Angel's return causes Drusilla's vampires to wreak havoc on Magic Town while they capture Nadira. Archaeus explains he can offer the energy of Magic Town a gift and wants Nadira to be his ambassador to the energy, intending to take over Magic Town with his vampire forces. Nadira warns him the energy of Magic Town will lash out at him like a bomb and unsuccessfully tries to fight her way out. Nadira is locked up as Drusilla has a plan to get the statute and Angel's team is on Archaeus' trail. With the statue on its way to Archaeus, Detective Brandt gives Angel a tip on his whereabouts, though nobody realizes Brandt is now a vampire. Archaeus and Drusilla try and talk Angel into coming \"home\" to them, but Archaeus' attempt to control Angel seems to awake Angelus. Archaeus sends Drusilla and some of his vampires to eliminate Faith and her team while taking Angelus to Nadira. Nadira claims she is worried The Magic may decide to side with Archaeus. Angel reveals he was putting on an act, allowing everyone to escape with Nadira. Archaeus has the statue unloaded in the middle of Magic Town. The sentient magic merges with it to give itself physical form and lashes out at any who approach. Angel confronts Brandt and Faith dusts the Detective. Nadira tries to calm The Magic down, saying she knows it wants to be like a real person, but it attacks Fred which summons an angry Illyria. Koh is able to convince Illyria they do not need to fight each other and forgives her for what she did to him, letting Fred return to the body. Nadira is able to get The Magic to stop fighting, but Archaeus shows up and offers it a place at his side as an equal. When Angel and everyone attack him, Archaeus claims it's proof that they only know violence and they would never treat The Magic fairly. Drusilla and hundreds of vampires reveal themselves as Archaeus's \"family.\" The citizens and mutants of Magic Town rush to Angel & Faith's aid out of respect for all the help they've given them. The vampires are overwhelmed and many including Drusilla flee. Even alone, Archaeus proves powerful, and attacks Nadira. The Magic defends her by vacating the statue and locking Archaeus inside. Afterwards Nadira says she can sense it has gone somewhere quiet to think. The team toast their victory in protecting their new home of Magic Town.\n\n"}

At times the player may have to choose to either fly through a blizzard, typhoon, hailstorm, rain storm, hurricane, or pick another city than the one intended. If the player chooses to go through the storm, they may make it, or they may be redirected back to the original city. If there are any items on board when flying through inclement weather, they will be roughed up, and be worth less points when turned in.\n\nThe player starts with a set number of tickets at the beginning of the round (60 in beginner, 50 in intermediate, 40 in advanced). One ticket is used per flight, and if a player chooses to fly through a storm and does not make it to the desired destination, between one and three tickets need to be cashed in to pay for damages to the plane. When the player returns items to the home base, 10 additional tickets are given per item returned.\n\nEach city has an \"infobox\" which pops up either when the player flies into the city, or when the player clicks on the city in the pointer mode. The infoboxes contain varied interesting information about the city, from famous people from there to who founded it, and have an underlined feature such as a monument or attraction present in that city.\n\nClues are available at certain cities as indicated by a little black box on the map. Five clues are available for each item, and the clues get progressively more helpful as the player finds them. City features, historical facts, and pop culture references, as well as infobox information is used.\n\nThe game has three levels of skill: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.\n\nAs a \"Beginner\" the player faces a stereotyped French person called Pierre. On Beginner, there is a gauge on the left on the screen that shows how close the player is to an item. So in theory, the player could follow the gauge until, by a process of elimination, the item is found. The European version of the game features instead a typical Texan person that goes by the name of John.\n\nOn the \"Intermediate\" level the player faces a stereotyped Russian person called Natasha. On Intermediate, the gauge is removed and is replaced by a button with an eye on it. When the player is in the right city, the eye lights up, which when pressed gives the item over to the player.\n\nWhen playing on \"Advanced\" the player faces a German aristocrat called Otto. On Advanced, the eye remains, but the lighting up feature is removed so the city which the item is in must be pinpointed exactly to reveal the item in question.\nOtto occasionally flies long distance flights that the player cannot. He sends the player to the wrong country, not the city the player clicked. If the player happens to be in the same city as Otto when an item is found, Otto will take it. Also, if the player flies to a country Otto has visited, a picture of Otto appears above the infobox with a speech bubble saying \"Otto vaz ere!\"\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" called the graphics and audio mediocre, but recommended the game to children and adults interested in geography and maps.\n"}

The game combines a game board mechanic and cross-platform online multiplayer gameplay. Cabals: The Card Game was published on November 30, 2011 for iPhone, iPad, Android devices and Internet Browsers. The newly named Cabals: Magic & Battles cards was released on April 11, 2014\n\nIn Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards, two players struggle for dominance by playing and moving cards on a game board. Both players use their own deck of cards that gives them a selection of unique units and abilities. Two different ways to win makes sure that there are countless different ways to try and overcome the opponent. The board introduces a completely new tactical aspect to trading card games. It makes clever positioning a big part of the game, and changes shape from match to match, inviting the players to alter their approach depending on the environment. The board also keeps the gameplay intuitive, making Cabals: The Card Game very approachable.\n\nOn May 14, 2015 a crowdfunding project was launched by Kyy Games to fund a tabletop adaptation of the digital game.\n\nThe world of Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards is inspired by various real mystical and esoteric traditions. It has been developed specifically for Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards with the help of an award-winning author Johanna Sinisalo, and brought to life by original paintings for each individual card.\n\nSet in Europe between the two world wars, Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards takes the players in the middle of a different kind of struggle, one fought in shadows. It's a war between cabals, secret societies dedicated to harnessing the forbidden powers to their own ends. It's a war over influence and a chance to shape the future of humankind.\n\nThe power struggle is between six cabals:\n\nGameplay takes place between two players - either against an AI opponent in single player, or another person in online multiplayer. Matches are played on a random game board with each player using their own pre-constructed deck of cards. A typical game board will have two stronghold locations, several resource locations, and in some cases additional deployment locations. The objective of the game is to win either by capturing your opponent's stronghold, or collecting 60 Domination points (the game's internal scoring mechanic for controlling locations). Each player has a special Hero unit with a once-per-game ability and plays their turn by commanding unit cards and casting action cards.\n\nPlayers must manage their resources to play cards. Each card has a base cost and a loyalty cost – a base cost is the minimum that a card will cost the player (in resources) and the loyalty cost is a bonus that is reduced if other cards from the same suit are already in play.\n\nUnits (cards that can be placed on the board) can only be placed on a deployment location controlled by that player. Most unit cards have a single move per turn - and some units have special abilities that can usually only be cast once per turn. This creates a game play mechanic for the player where they must carefully manage not only the cards in their hand, but also the movement of their units on the game board while defending against the movements of their opponent.\n\nActions (cards that can be played directly from the hand) usually indicate a target, or sometimes have a global effect that affects all cards on the board.\n\nCombat takes place when two units try to occupy the same position on the game board. A unit has a power number that determines how much damage it can deal and absorb. When a unit receives more damage than its power number, it is destroyed. Some units are given special abilities that modify their power.\n\nConstructing a card deck is a major part of gameplay in Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards. A deck may contain any number of cards, but must maintain a minimum of 30 cards. There is a limit of three repeat cards per deck. Each deck contains a special Hero unit which has a powerful once-per-game ability. Cards that can be placed into a deck are limited by the special Hero unit that is chosen - meaning that some cards are available only to certain heroes, while other cards are prohibited.\n\nCassandra Khaw of TouchArcade gave \"Cabals: The Card Game\" a review of 4/5 stars, stating \"Cabals is easy to grasp and surprisingly deep for something that can, at times, feel like a distilled version of the genre.\"\n\nAdam Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun gave \"Cabals: The Card Game\" a generally positive review (no ranking), stating \"I do like the art style [though] and for some reason the use of a board makes this somehow more gripping. I reckon I’m either going to be addicted to it by the end of the month or I’ll have all but forgotten it exists.\"\n\nBrad Cummings of BoardGameGeek gave \"Cabals: The Card Game\" a review of 4/5 stars, stating \"The cross-platform features generally work well and it offers a lot of content at a low entry fee. The tactical play is a great direction to take deck building and makes the game about more than chaining combos.\"\n\nGeoff Gibson of DIY Gamer gave \"Cabals: The Card Game\" a generally positive review (no ranking), stating \"... anybody who enjoys card games should get a kick out of Cabals, especially given very detailed card designs.\"\n"}

Due to the rubber boom and the arrival of foreigners, film interest began in the early 20th century, along with the evolution of cinema of the United States in Hollywood. Cinema in Iquitos had no established date of origin. The first film, however, was made in 1900. The first films were shown in the Casa de Fierro with an Edison machine, which reproduced the images using a carbide lamp and the constant movement of the operator. Iquitos is mentioned as a metonym of cinema in the Peruvian Amazon.\n\nThe most important pioneer of cinema in Iquitos and the Loreto Region is Antonio Wong Rengifo, also a pioneer of film art in Peru, with his most important work being \"Bajo el sol de Loreto\". Alongside this, other filmmakers such as Werner Herzog, Armando Robles Godoy, Nora Izcue, Federico García, and Dorian Fernandez Moris prolonged the cinematic presence in the city.\n\nUntil around the 1880, Iquitos did not have a film set. Interest in film production grew alongside the film industry booming elsewhere in the world. There is not enough accurate visual record the exact birth of cinema in Iquitos. In 1890, following the rhythm of the European organization of the city, scientific technology began arriving.\n\nThe first film made in 1900 was recorded. A movie was projected for the first time in the Iron House with an Edison machine, which reproduced the images using a carbide lamp and the constant movement of an operator. Before the fact, in 1898, Clement Alcala and Francisco de Paula Secada obtained land on the north side of the Plaza de Armas, and built a rustic-roof building, naming it Alhambra. They installed a tiny carousel brought from Manaus, Brazil. In 1902, with the rubber boom and its international impact, Edward Fuller purchased Alhambra. It hence became the first movie theater in town with Lumière brand projectors.\n\nIn the continuous city growth following the success of the rubber extraction, and its connection with Europe, the bourgeoisie grew in the city. Arnaldo Reategui traveled to France in 1905, and bought a projector with a large collection of movies—in black-and-white and technicolor—from cinema house Pathé Freres and Léon Gaumont. He was affiliated with Luis Pinasco and built a cinema called Jardín Strassburgo, located on the first block of Sargento Lores street. The first stage of Iquitos film concluded in 1914, with a prominent presence of French filmmakers. Georges Méliès and Gaumont sent several films on celluloid for the aristocratic film billboard of Iquitos. The film making attracted audiences, and blockbusters were reaching £4,500.\n\nAlthough the crisis hit Iquitos and had its effect on the industry, the arrival of new films did not stop. Films with a theatrical demeanor were gradually replaced by those more directed towards fiction. The filmmaking attracted new aspirations and acting talents, and the star system was present in the market. The distribution of Charlie Chaplin silent films were introduced by the Spanish businessman Jose Altimira.\n\nThe most important pioneer of cinema in Iquitos and the Loreto Region in general was , also a pioneer of film art in Peru. It is mainly known for shaping their ideologies, aspirations and other thoughts in his films. Wong Rengifo, in the course of his film making, followed the changing technology in the United States. In 1936, he premiered his film \"Bajo el sol de Loreto\", a film which examines the main economic engine, and the valuation of the Peruvian Amazon (called \"Selvak\" in the film). He is thought to give an active representation of the amazonian culture in his films. Wong worked as a cameraman, developed his own films and edited them, and wrote his scripts inspired by Iquitos culture.\n\nIn October 1957, Wong started the production of a film, with Mexican actress Amalia Aguilar, to be shown at the First International Fair of Iquitos. Due to a fire, however, his film study was consumed by fire and never made it to cinemas. The same year, a group of filmmakers came from Hollywood, accompanied by Harma Lewis and Keith Larsen, to shoot 29 short films for the anthology \"Adventure in the Amazon\", directed by Tom McGowan (a little-known, recherché filmmaker in database), and produced by Warner Bros. The series was eventually canceled due to transportation spending.\n\nBy the 1960s, film was representing the beauty and calm of the jungle, and Iquitos was home to most regional and international filmmakers. In the 1970s, the cinema of Iquitos was influenced by Decree Law Number 19327, entitled \"Law for the Promotion of Film Industry.\" The decree facilitated the production of new films, and the presentation of the Amazon image.\n\nThe film went on to a more complex film language with themes about the richness of the jungle, the imperialist power, mining and resource processing, and use of the natives as a portrait of tourism. During these years, there were notable films such as \"No Stars in the Jungle\" (1966) and \"The Green Wall\" (1969) by Armando Robles Godoy; \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" (1972) and \"Fitzcarraldo\" (1982) by Werner Herzog; \"The Ayahuasca Wind\" (1983) by Nora Izcue and \"The Partner of God\" (1986) by Federico Garcia. In 1990, Iquitos was gradually used as a stage for national and international soap operas; it was the backdrop for \"Anaconda\" (1997) by Luis Llosa; \"Captain Pantoja and the Special Services\" (2000) by Francisco Lombardi; \"The Motorcycle Diaries\" by Walter Salles and \"Daughters of Belén\" (2004) by Javier Corcuera.\n\nIn 2002, publicist Dorian Fernandez-Moris founded Audiovisual Films—founded as Audiovisual—and began with a team of twenty people. He began with short films like \"El otro lado\", \"Runamula\" and \"501\", and subsequently made a series of workshops to increase interest in Iquitos cinephile. In 2006, he released \"Chullachaqui\" (based on an Amazon known legend), \"Immortal\", and the film \"El último piso\" (18 February 2010). The latter was filmed at the tallest building in the city. In 2012, Audiovisual Films produced \"General Cemetery\" in Iquitos, and is scheduled for release in October 2012.\n"}

In 1970, students approved \"Knights of the Pegasus\" as the second official university mascot, which remains to this day.\n\nThe Citronaut was designed by Norman Van Meter, the brother-in-law of FTU's then-president Charles N.

Research and literature over the past decade, has shown the main reasons for having classroom pets is to capture the attention of students, improve relationships, provide the opportunity for creative activities, be a resource for humane education, and act as a motivator for students.\n\nIn 1987, The National Institute of Health reported evidence on the health benefits of pets and further studies have shown positive effects from children’s relationships with pets.  It has thus been assumed that similar benefits would present themselves with classroom pets on students.\n\nClassroom pets can support young children's social-emotional development.  Classroom pets help build positive relationships through discussions about classroom pets, such as what to name it, and how to care for it, and then working together to do so. This also aids in the development of friendships within the classroom. It has been found that students develop a sense of caring about others other than themselves through tending to the needs of the animals in the classroom. It has also been seen that discussions about the behaviors of the animals in the classroom, what they mean, and what the students can do about it can help students become empathetic towards others. Teachers have claimed that classroom pets also teach children the value of routines and rules. One study compared students in a classroom with class pets to one without for 8 weeks. The study found that both parents and teachers reported that the students in the class with the guinea pigs had greater increases in social skills and decreases in behavior problems at the end of the 8 weeks. These results support similar previous study results.\n\nYoung children's interaction with classroom pets can also help them manage feelings and emotions. Research has shown that children need an empathetic listener whenever they feel troubled. Children can be encouraged to share their feelings with their animals if they do not want to express them with an adult. A study surveying 75 elementary teachers, revealed that most teachers believed students displayed an increase in compassion and empathy when pets were used in the classroom.  Additional findings have shown that classroom pets, not only improve compassion and empathy but also teach children to have respect for the living things in the world around them.\n\nClassroom pets can also have a positive effect on the socio-emotional development of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  After engaging in animal-assisted activities for 8-weeks, children with ASD displayed an increase in social skills and a decrease in social withdrawal.\n\nTeachers conveyed that classroom pets contribute to the academic development of students and have identified pets as important sources for students.  They have found them to expand learning and increase development. Academic lessons, ranging from science to language arts, have been enriched by this valuable source and have improved academic competence among students. Classroom pets create an object of observation and research for children during science class. Children will learn how to care for the animal, what it eats, and what type of surroundings it needs to live. Science can also be linked with language arts using classroom pets. Students can write books and create presentations from their research. Students academic skills in math also increase by having a classroom pet. Students can measure its physical attributes and how quickly or how far it moves using graphs or charts (Benham, 1991, p.21).\n\nThrough the use of a Dog-Assisted Activity Program in a multi-cultural elementary classroom, researchers found that teachers are more aware of student difficulties and strengths after interacting with dogs.  After engaging with dogs, it was found that students expressed emotions and displayed behaviors more clearly, helping teachers recognize student qualities that were hidden prior to the dog-assisted activity. This suggests that the presence of classroom pets does not only benefit students but also results in increased teacher awareness. Despite these results, survey research shows that only about 17% of elementary teachers have classroom pets.\n"}
{"id": "78806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78806", "title": "Contralto", "text": "Contralto\n\nA contralto () is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type.\n\nThe contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to the mezzo-soprano, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although, at the extremes, some voices can reach the D below middle C (D) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.\n\n\"Contralto\" is primarily meaningful only in reference to classical and operatic singing, as other traditions lack a comparable system of vocal categorization. The term \"contralto\" is only applied to female singers; men singing in a similar range are called \"countertenors\". The Italian terms \"contralto\" and \"alto\" are not synonymous, the latter technically denoting a specific vocal range in choral singing without regard to factors like tessitura, vocal timbre, vocal facility, and vocal weight.\n\nThe contralto has the lowest vocal range of the female voice types, with the lowest tessitura.\n\nThe contralto voice range is between tenor and mezzo-soprano. Although tenors, baritones, and basses are male singers, some women can sing as low (albeit with a slightly different timbre and texture than their male counterparts). Unfortunately, they are often erroneously referred to as \"female tenors\", \"female baritones\", \"female basses\" or \"androgynous.\" In reality, such terms are usually derogatory informal (slang). Factual formal terminology would be \"contralto profundo\" (tenor) and \"contralto basso\" or \"oktavistka\" (baritone) but these are not traditionally named among the fach system.\n\nSome of the rare contraltos that can sing the female equivalent of tenor and baritone include Zarah Leander, Ruby Helder, and Bally Prell.\n\nThe earliest cited role for the contralto is traditionally accepted to be that of the Saracen princess Clorinde in André Campra's 1702 opera \"Tancréde\", and most famously performed by (and was originally written for) Julie d'Aubigny. Within the contralto voice type category are three generally recognized subcategories: coloratura contralto, lyric contralto, and dramatic contralto. These subtypes do not always apply with precision to individual singers; some exceptional dramatic contraltos, such as Ernestine Schumann-Heink and Sigrid Onégin, were technically equipped to perform not only heavy, dramatic music by the likes of Wagner but also florid compositions by Donizetti.\n\nThe coloratura contralto has a light, agile voice ranging very high for the classification and atypically maintains extensive coloratura and high sustaining notes, specializing in florid passages and leaps. Given its deviations from the classification's norms, this voice type is quite rare.\n\nThe lyric contralto voice is lighter than a dramatic contralto but not capable of the ornamentation and leaps of a coloratura contralto. This class of contralto, lighter in timbre than the others, is the most common today and usually ranges from the E below middle C (E) to the second G above middle C (G).\n\nThe dramatic contralto is the deepest, darkest, and heaviest contralto voice, usually having a heavier tone and more power than the others. Singers in this class are rare.\n\nTrue operatic contraltos are rare, and the operatic literature contains few roles written specifically for them. Contraltos sometimes are assigned feminine roles like Angelina in \"La Cenerentola\", Rosina in \"The Barber of Seville\", Teodata in \"Flavio\", Isabella in \"L'italiana in Algeri\", and Olga in \"Eugene Onegin\", but more frequently they play female villains or trouser roles. Contraltos may also be cast in roles originally written for castrati. A common saying among contraltos is that they may play only \"witches, bitches, or .\"\nExamples of contralto roles in the standard operatic repertoire include the following:\n\n indicates a role that may also be sung by a mezzo-soprano.\n\n\n\n"}

Generally he is described as helpful or positive, and serves as a seed for the creation of the world, such that after death parts of his body became physical parts of the universe. He also represents the oneness of human existence, or the universe. \n\nFor example, in Chinese legend, Pangu is thought to have given the natural features of the Earth their form, and when he died his body became the Sacred Mountains of China. The Persian equivalent, Keyumars, released semen when he died, out of which came the first human couple. \n\nIn some Jewish legends, Adam was created from dust from the four corners of the Earth, and, when bent down, his head was the East and his feet the West. In another legend, he contained the soul of everybody who would ever be born. In the teachings of \"Kabbalah\", such a primordial man is referred to as Adam Kadmon. In Indian mythology, Purusha is a similar figure, who is considered the part of the individual which is immortal. \n\nThe Cosmic Man corresponds within Islamic Sufi teachings with al-Insān al-Kāmil, meaning 'The Perfect Being\", a honorific title often ascribed to Prophet Muhammad. The concept of al-Insān al-Kāmil was first coined and discussed by Ibn Arabi.\n\nIn many myths, the Cosmic Man is not just the beginning but also the final goal of life or creation. This is not necessarily a physical event, but may refer to the identification of the conscious ego with the self. \n\nIn the religious sciences of Islam, a more detailed explanation is furnished wherein the first Cosmic Man is identified as Adam. According to the sciences, Adam is a Cosmic Being because, apart from having an all-embracing power over the Universe, he also has the most privileged spiritual rank and status of a human being. \n\nIn more recent elaborations, the Cosmic Man is an awaited Leader who is to destined to appear in order to establish a new and golden Age on earth for all mankind.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8858", "title": "Digital compositing", "text": "Digital compositing\n\nDigital compositing is the process of digitally assembling multiple images to make a final image, typically for print, motion pictures or screen display. It is the digital analogue of optical film compositing.\n\nThe basic operation used in digital compositing is known as 'alpha blending', where an opacity value, 'α', is used to control the proportions of two input pixel values that end up a single output pixel.\n\nAs a simple example, suppose two images of the same size are available and they are to be composited. The input images are referred to as the foreground image and the background image. Each image consists of the same number of pixels. Compositing is performed by mathematically combining information from the corresponding pixels from the two input images and recording the result in a third image, which is called the composited image.\n\nConsider three pixels;\nand \n\nThen, considering all three colour channels, and assuming that the colour channels are expressed in a γ=1 colour space (that is to say, the measured values are proportional to light intensity), we have:\n\nNote that if the operations are performed in a colour space where γ is not equal to 1 then the operation will lead to non-linear effects which can potentially be seen as aliasing artifacts (or 'jaggies') along sharp edges in the matte. More generally, nonlinear compositing can have effects such as \"halos\" around composited objects, because the influence of the alpha channel is non-linear. It is possible for a compositing artist to compensate for the effects of compositing in non-linear space.\n\nPerforming alpha blending is an expensive operation if performed on an entire image or 3D scene. If this operation has to be done in real time video games there is an easy trick to boost performance.\n\nBy simply rewriting the mathematical expression one can save 50% of the multiplications required.\n\nWhen many partially transparent layers need to be composited together, it is worthwhile to consider the algebraic properties of compositing operators used. Specifically, the associativity and commutativity determine when repeated calculation can or cannot be avoided.\n\nConsider the case when we have four layers to blend to produce the final image: F=A*(B*(C*D)) where A, B, C, D are partially transparent image layers and \"*\" denotes a compositing operator (with the left layer on top of the right layer). If only layer C changes, we should find a way to avoid re-blending all of the layers when computing F. Without any special considerations, four full-image blends would need to occur. For compositing operators that are commutative, such as additive blending, it is safe to re-order the blending operations. In this case, we might compute T=A*(B*D) only once and simply blend T*C to produce F, a single operation. Unfortunately, most operators are not commutative. However, many are associative, suggesting it is safe to re-group operations to F=(A*B)*(C*D), i.e. without changing their order. In this case we may compute S:=A*B once and save this result. To form F with an associative operator, we need only do two additional compositing operations to integrate the new layer S, by computing F:=S*(C*D). Note that this expression indicates compositing C with all of the layers below it in one step and then blending all of the layers on top of it with the previous result to produce the final image in the second step.\n\nIf all layers of an image change regularly but a large number of layer still need to be composited (such as in distributed rendering), the commutativity of a compositing operator can still be exploited to speed up computation through parallelism even when there is no gain from pre-computation. Again, consider the image F=A*(B*(C*D)). Each compositing operation in this expression depends on the next, leading to serial computation. However, associativity can allow us to rewrite F=(A*B)*(C*D) where there are clearly two operations that do not depend on each other that may be executed in parallel. In general, we can build a tree of pair-wise compositing operations with a height that is logarithmic in the number of layers.\n\nThe most historically significant nonlinear compositing system was the Cineon, which operated in a logarithmic color space, which more closely mimics the natural light response of film emulsions (the Cineon system, made by Kodak, is no longer in production). Due to the limitations of processing speed and memory, compositing artists did not usually have the luxury of having the system make intermediate conversions to linear space for the compositing steps. Over time, the limitations have become much less significant, and now most compositing is done in a linear color space, even in cases where the source imagery is in a logarithmic color space.\n\nCompositing often also includes scaling, retouching and colour correction of images.\n\nThere are two radically different digital compositing workflows: node-based compositing and layer-based compositing.\n\nNode-based compositing represents an entire composite as a tree graph, linking media objects and effects in a procedural map, intuitively laying out the progression from source input to final output, and is in fact the way all compositing applications internally handle composites. This type of compositing interface allows great flexibility, including the ability to modify the parameters of an earlier image processing step \"in context\" (while viewing the final composite). Node-based compositing packages often handle keyframing and time effects poorly, as their workflow does not stem directly from a timeline, as do layer-based compositing packages. Software which incorporates a node based interface include Natron, Apple Shake, Blender, Blackmagic Fusion, and The Foundry's Nuke.\n\nLayer-based compositing represents each media object in a composite as a separate layer within a timeline, each with its own time bounds, effects, and keyframes. All the layers are stacked, one above the next, in any desired order; and the bottom layer is usually rendered as a base in the resultant image, with each higher layer being progressively rendered on top of the previously composited of layers, moving upward until all layers have been rendered into the final composite. Layer-based compositing is very well suited for rapid 2D and limited 3D effects such as in motion graphics, but becomes awkward for more complex composites entailing a large number of layers. A partial solution to this is some programs' ability to view the composite-order of elements (such as images, effects, or other attributes) with a visual diagram called a flowchart to nest compositions, or \"comps,\" directly into other compositions, thereby adding complexity to the render-order by first compositing layers in the beginning composition, then combining that resultant image with the layered images from the proceeding composition, and so on. An example of this exists in the Adobe program After Effects.\n\n\n"}

They are toys that expand after putting them into water for several days. Also, it shrinks with saltwater, though most shrink simply from air after being removed from water. They are made from polymers that can absorb and retain extremely large amounts of a liquid relative to their own mass. \n\nGrow Monsters come in many different shapes and sizes. Reptiles and dinosaurs are common figures, but there are many others, such as: sharks, squid, seahorses, lobster, insects, humans, and mechas from popular anime are among them. Many of the companies that distribute them are Chinese trading companies.\n\nWater Balz look like marbles, but expand to the size of a racquetball in water.\n\nThe introduction and popularity of these toys has followed the development of superabsorbent polymers. In the early 1970s, the superabsorbent polymer was used commercially for the first time for disposable hygienic products. The first product markets were feminine sanitary napkins and adult incontinence products. The development of superabsorbent technology and performance has been largely led by demands in the disposable hygiene segment. Strides in absorption performance have allowed the development of the ultra-thin baby diaper which uses a fraction of the materials – particularly fluff pulp – that earlier disposable diapers consumed. Over the years, technology has progressed so that there is little if any starch-grafted superabsorbent polymer used in disposable hygienic products. These super absorbents typically are cross-linked acrylic homo-polymers (usually sodium neutralized).\n\nStarting from January 15, 2007 there have been several recalls on these toys. Ireland, Poland, Cyprus, Lithuania, Hungary and the United Kingdom have recalled the Magic Grow Reptile and Dinosaur Eggs Wild World due to a choking risk. They claim the products pose a risk of choking due to the fact that after 72 hours in water, the toys expand more than 500% in three directions, and that the products do not comply with the Toys Directive and the relevant European standard EN 71.\n\nWater Balz have been swallowed and lodged in the guts of children, requiring surgery to remove.\n"}

Each school has several different types of teams that compete against other schools. These contests are organized by FFA advisors and local experts. The purpose of these competitions is to determine which team and individuals have the best ability to evaluate a particular animal or item as compared to an \"official\". The official placings and answers are set by an expert in the discipline. Officials are often from agricultural universities or USDA employees.\n\nOne of the most popular competitions is Livestock Judging. This is where teams of four students judge a series of classes (usually of four animals each) and rank them based on criteria to choose the most superior animal (e.g. muscling, conformation). In Livestock judging, students only judge cattle, pigs and lambs; classes consist of animals in some cases from all over the region. Part of the contest is to give \"reasons\". This is basically a short persuasive speech in which the contestant explains their evaluation of the animals to an official for a score (0-50).\n\nAnother popular competition is Horse judging. This is similar to livestock, but students only evaluate horses again in classes of four. They evaluate the animals based on criteria such as conformation, gait, and muscling. Reasons are also given in Horse judging.\n\nMeat judging is also popular and consists of teams of 4 students. Meat judging is based on several contest areas and only includes pork, beef and lamb. Contest areas include class placing (four similar cuts or carcasses of meat evaluated on muscle, fat and bone), identification (correctly identifying the type of cut and where it came from on the animal) and carcass grading (determining the quality and yield grading of a beef carcass).\n\nEach state has statewide competitions each year in which students compete for the state title in each contest area. Many of the state winners go on to compete in national competitions (some held at the National FFA convention).\n\nThere are many other contest areas including:\n\nIn the 2004 comedy film, \"Napoleon Dynamite\", the title character tastes defects in milk while competing in a Dairy Competition.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10685", "title": "Filk music", "text": "Filk music\n\nFilk music is a musical culture, genre, and community tied to science fiction/fantasy/horror fandom and a type of fan labor. The genre has been active since the early 1950s, and played primarily since the mid-1970s.\n\nThe term \"filk\" (originally a typographical error) predates 1955. (See also below.)\n\nIt is used \n\nAs Interfilk's \"What is it?\" page demonstrates, there is no consensus on the definition of filk. Attempts have been made to define filk based on various criteria.\n\nFilk has been defined as folk music, usually with a science fiction or fantasy theme, but this definition is not exact. Filkers have been known to write filk songs about a variety of topics, including but not limited to tangentially related topics such as computers and cats. In addition, while the majority of filk songs are in the folk style, other styles such as blues, calypso, and even rock appear from time to time.\n\nFilk has been defined as what is sung or performed by the network of people who originally gathered to sing at science fiction/fantasy conventions. This definition might be summarized as, \"We can argue what it is until we're red or green or blue, but when filkers get together it's the thing we do.\"\n\nYet another definition focuses on filking as a community of those who are interested in filk music and who form part of the social network self-identified with filking. As described later in this article, the origins of filk in science fiction conventions and its current organization emphasizes the social-network aspect of filking. The social aspect of filk as contrasted with the \"performer vs. audience\" dichotomy of much of modern music was described in a speech by ethnomusicologist Dr. Sally Childs-Helton.\n\nBy any of these definitions, filk is a form of music created from within science fiction and fantasy fandom, often performed late at night at science fiction conventions, though there are now dedicated filk conventions in Canada, England, Germany, and the USA. The boundaries of filking are vague. For example, filking overlaps with the singing and music performed by participants in the Society for Creative Anachronism or at LARPs.\n\nIn keeping with the folk-culture roots of filk, the musical styles and topics of filk music are eclectic. While a plurality of filk is rooted firmly in acoustic-instrument folk music, other pieces and artists draw inspiration from rock, a cappella vocal groups, or other styles. The hobbyist and itinerant nature of filk events (especially filk circles) gives some advantages to acoustic-vocal soloists and small groups, who need only carry a lightweight instrument or two and whose rehearsals do not need to balance scheduling logistics against regular work and other obligations. One of the few rock-style groups in filk has been Ookla the Mok, whose studio recordings use techniques common in modern rock. Some styles of filk rely heavily on sampling the original source material and integrating it into electronica and hip-hop music such as 76's \"Objects in Space\" (an homage to the popular TV show \"Firefly\", which itself featured several filk songs) and DJ Qbert's \"Wave Twisters.\"\n\nThe range of topics in filk songs stems from its cultural roots in fandom. Many songs honor specific works in science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. Other songs are about science, fantasy, computers, technology in general, or values related to technological change. Yet others are about the culture of fandom, including filk itself (both as a phenomenon within fandom, and as a sub-culture). Many filk songs (such as Leslie Fish's \"Carmen Miranda's Ghost Is Haunting Space Station 3\") are humorous while others treat their subjects seriously (like Steve Macdonald's \"Journey's Done\").\n\nHowever, some common themes do not fall neatly into filk's science fiction origins. Such topics include songs about cats, popular culture, and politics. These are perhaps best explained as an outgrowth of filk as a folk culture, open in some respects to expansion by individual artists.\n\nA significant number of filk songs are parodies, whether in the original sense of simply re-using a tune or in the modern sense of specifically humorous re-use. Some are parodies of songs from popular culture, others are parodies of existing filk songs. Although parody is not the primary focus of the filk music culture, the proportion of parody songs found in filk is higher than in other musical cultures.\n\nOne subtype of filk songs is the \"ose\" song, one on themes of death and gloom. The term derives from the word \"morose\", as in \"ose, morose, even-more-ose\". A further variant is \"cheeri-ose\": ose songs to cheery tunes, or treating such a subject lightheartedly; cf. Tom Lehrer's (non-filk) \"Irish Ballad\".\n\nFor the first few decades of the occasional science fiction convention, there had been late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms. Part of this practice may have been rooted in an older folk culture of fans. Some of the oldest filks coming out of fandom were protest songs with original words and music written by a group of New York fans called The Futurians, and were written by Fred Pohl and Cyril Kornbluth (see Damon Knight's book of the same name, which contains the words and music to several of them). With the break up of the city clubs common during the Great Depression, filking moved to science fiction conventions, often in the form of late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms, lobbies, service passages, or wherever else the filkers could find enough room to play/sing music uninterrupted.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the term \"filk music\" started as a misspelling of \"folk music\" in an essay by Lee Jacobs, \"The Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music\". Wrai Ballard, then editor of the Spectator Amateur Press Society refused to publish it for fear that the article's bawdy content could get them into trouble with the Post Office under the Comstock Laws, but found the typo itself amusing, and mentioned it repeatedly; thus, Jacobs' typo became the self-identified term for the genre/subculture while it was still an informal, unrecognized activity at conventions. Its first documented deliberate use was by Karen Anderson in \"Die Zeitschrift für vollständigen Unsinn\" (\"The Journal for Utter Nonsense\") #774 (June 1953), for a song written by her husband Poul Anderson.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the first formal publication of filksongs, generally as lyric sheets, but occasionally complete with (often original) music. While many of those original songs faded into obscurity, some remained popular for decades. By the late 1970s, periodicals such as \"Kantele\" and \"Philk Fee-Nom-Ee-Non\" offered a ready outlet for filk writers.\n\nAt the 1974 World Science Fiction Convention author Bob Asprin announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the Dorsai Irregulars, and a singing session ensued later that night. In the 1970s and 1980s, filking slowly became established as an acknowledged activity at science fiction conventions. Some convention organizers allotted hotel function space late at night for filkers, or filking occurred in hallways, bars or any other place that the filkers could find. Some convention organizers in the 1980s began inviting guests specifically for their filking. Some specialized conventions focused entirely on filk, beginning with FilkCon in Chicago in 1979, organized by Margaret Middleton and Curt Clemmer, later joined by BayFilk in Northern California; the Ohio Valley Filk Fest (OVFF) in Columbus, Ohio; ConChord in Los Angeles and in San Diego, California; Musicon in Nashville, Tennessee; FilKONtario near Toronto, Ontario; a rotating British filkcon, and one (NEFilk) in the northeastern US; the German FilkCONtinental; and others.\n\nThese efforts grew to include raising funds for traveling filkers. The first was a British Filk Fund. Then, in the early 1990s, several active organizers in North America created Interfilk, which is now the most active traveling filker fund. Beginning with British filker Mike Whitaker in 1992, 40 filkers were the beneficiaries of Interfilk subsidies in its first decade. OVFF began presenting the Pegasus Award annually for excellence in filk in 1984, and FilkOntario started the Filk Hall of Fame in 1995, honoring contributions to the community as well as to the music.\n\nAfter years of amateur tape recordings made at filksings, a trickle of studio-produced albums and tapes began to arrive in the 1970s. These included \"Folk Songs for Folk Who Ain't Been Yet\", featuring Leslie Fish and friends, and \"Children of the Future\" by Karen Willson.\n\nOff Centaur Publications was one of the first formal attempts to regularly produce and promote filk albums, followed by many others since. As the costs of amateur album production dropped in the 1990s, more filkers created albums and, more recently, audio files available for downloading online.\n\nE-mail and the internet have also fostered the networking of self-identified filkers. In the late 1980s, California filker Kay Shapero created the filk group on the Fidonet hobbyist network of electronic bulletin boards. The later creation of other electronic forums — the Usenet group, a United Kingdom e-mail list FILK_UK and the German language list, an IRC channel devoted to filking, and a growing cluster of filkers blogging on LiveJournal (including a LiveJournal community), to pick a few examples — have mirrored the growing connections among other self-identified social networks (or subcultures). The availability of several hundred albums labeled filk, the proliferation of specialty filk conventions, and the continued growth of electronic means for community connections have led to an intensification of community building. A few years into the 21st century, filking as an identifiable community exists on at least three continents.\n\nOn the album \"Precious Friend\", Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie perform \"Old Time Religion\", in a filk version. Most of the verses of this version were by Gordon Dickson; when Seeger finally discovered this, after the album was issued, he sent royalties on to Dickson.\n\nFilk music is most commonly performed in a gathering known as a \"Filk Circle\". Similar to the Drum Circles and Bardic Circles found at SCA events and other fannish events, filk circles can be formed in any location where filkers gather.\n\nFilk circles are different from concert-style musical performances. Although filk music can also be performed in front of an audience, and there are concerts scheduled at filk conventions and science fiction conventions worldwide, filk circles are a more common occurrence. The purpose of a filk circle is for musicians to share songs with other musicians, so performing and listening are given equal emphasis. In a filk circle, there is no stage, there is no audience. Those who participate in a filk circle may choose to perform, to listen, or both. Performers may know only one song, or may know an extensive library of songs. Participants are usually encouraged to join in and sing along or play along on their instruments.\n\nFilk circles can be formalized parts of larger events, such as being assigned a specific time and location on the schedule of a science fiction convention, or they can be completely informal and spontaneous, forming organically in hotel hallways and lobbies. Filk-specific conventions will usually have multiple filk circles happening simultaneously in different rooms, with some circles focused on a single style or topic. Local parties called \"housefilks\" are day-long events in which a single filk circle performs in the host's home.\n\nAs the name implies, a rough circle of chairs is usually formed. The details depend on the available space and furniture, and it may not even end up being circular, or even have chairs at all. The purpose of the circular formation is both symbolic and functional: By having everyone face each other, it honors all participants as equals, it emphasizes both listening and performing, and it makes each participant visible to every other participant.\n\nA formally organized filk circle can have the chairs set up ahead of time, with the organizers estimating the number of participants and adjusting the size of the circle as best they can. A circle that is too large for the number of participants tends to feel uncomfortably empty, but a circle that is too small must enlarge as the number of participants grows. The disruption that results from attempting to enlarge a filk circle in progress can break up the flow of the songs and change the mood, so enlarging the circle is often avoided in favor of adding extra layers (concentric circles) outside the inner circle, space permitting.\n\nTraditionally, filk circles are started in the evening and tend to continue very late into the night. Of course, this depends upon the location, the participants, and the organizers. Filk circles have been known to continue all night, or at least into the early morning hours. Those organizing formal filk circles at conventions usually make arrangements with the hotel to have space available for the entire night. There are many exceptions to this; it's not uncommon to find a housefilk scheduled to start in the early afternoon and end in the early evening, for example, to allow participants to get home to sleep.\n\nAt most filk circles, the participants are expected to bring their own musical instruments (if they play an instrument at all), although sometimes you will find organizers or performers bringing a collection of extra instruments so that others may borrow or experiment with them. Most performers who bring instruments such as guitars are usually happy to loan their instruments to someone who comes to the circle without one.\n\nA wide range of instruments can be found in a filk circle, although the most common is the acoustic guitar. Acoustic instruments are more common than electric instruments, although portable keyboards and even theremins are not unheard of. Small, easily portable instruments are more common than large ones, although larger items such as small drum kits and upright basses can be found at some filk circles. A large filk circle might play host to an array of folk and Celtic instruments such as fiddles, mandolins, dulcimers, banjos, flutes, recorders, bodhráns, bongos and darbukas.\n\nSongs are presented very informally. They can be given with spoken introductions and explanations, or they can be simply played and allowed to speak for themselves. Songs can be chosen to fit the current mood or theme, or they may be chosen to deliberately change the mood. Songs can be performed by individuals, duos, groups, or groups hastily assembled from other participants. Songs can be accompanied by instruments or be performed a cappella. Songs can be original songs, covers, parodies, instrumentals, or even spoken-word pieces such as poetry and stories.\n\nAn active and well-attended filk circle, at its peak, will usually be a somewhat continuous stream of songs, with only a small amount of conversation between songs. Filk circles that are just getting started or winding down may have more talking and socializing than music.\n\nFilk circles are often given an organizational structure to make it easier for participants to know when it's time to perform or time to listen to other performers. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the most common types of filk circle are listed below.\n\nIn a bardic circle, each person in the circle (as well as those sitting in concentric circles around the inner circle, if any) goes in turn, with each turn moving sequentially either clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle. Each participant is given the choice of \"pick, pass, or play\". \"Pick\" means they can request a specific song, a specific performer, a general topic or style, or any other similar request from an individual or from the circle in general. \"Pass\" means they skip their turn and the choice passes on to the next person in sequence. \"Play\" means they can perform any song they choose, either specific to the current topic or mood, or deliberately different from the current topic or mood.\n\nThe advantage of the bardic circle is that it has a clear structure, which enforces politeness. It ensures everyone in the circle gets their turn, so that even shy people can have a chance to request or perform. There are disadvantages, however. A bardic circle with large numbers of participants will take a long time to traverse the entire circle, making people wait too long for their turn. Such a circle was lamented in a filk by Suzette Haden Elgin: \"I've been here with my song at the ready since day before yesterday night.\" There is less spontaneity in a bardic circle than a chaos circle, and the chance of being able to play a good \"follower\" song is reduced.\n\nIn a chaos circle, there is no sequential organization. Any performer can simply begin playing a song after the prior song is finished, or any participant can shout out a request. Care must be taken to prevent two songs from starting at the same time. Frequently the word \"follower!\" is shouted in a chaos circle, meaning that a performer believes they have the perfect song to follow the prior song, and they want to play it now.\n\nThe chaos circle's advantage is its spontaneity and energy. \"Runs\" of songs will frequently get started, with each new song intended to make some sort of connection to or commentary on the prior song's topic. The disadvantage is that it takes concentration and effort to be polite and respectful in a chaos circle: It's easy to accidentally interrupt another performer who's trying to start up a song of their own, especially in a very large circle where one might not be able to easily hear the other performer on the opposite side of the room. Chaos circles thus have a reputation of favoring bold, loud performers who can command attention. One countermeasure to such conflicts is for someone, generally not one of the current/starting-up performers, to shout \"Filker up!\", possibly pointing to the one being interrupted. This alerts the room, and specifically the (usually unintentional) interrupter, to be quiet and pay attention to the filker who has started performing.\n\nA token bardic circle, also known as a \"poker-chip\" bardic circle, attempts to combine the enforced politeness of the bardic circle with the freeform nature of the chaos circle. A container full of some type of token such as poker chips is supplied for the circle. Each person participating in the circle is given a fixed number of tokens when they enter the room (frequently two tokens), and can throw a token into the center of the circle at any time to claim a pick or play turn (see \"Bardic\", above). When all the active tokens in the circle are used up, they are scooped up and redistributed for the next round.\n\nThe advantage of a token bardic is that there's still a chance for spontaneity and followers, yet it's easy to be polite to other performers because you can easily see when another performer wants a turn. The disadvantage is that, like bardic, in a large circle it may take a long time for you to get another turn after you've used up your existing turns.\n\nThere are variations of these styles, some of the variants involving a person acting as a moderator. A given circle can change its style mid-stream, if the participants agree. It's common to see the participants of a bardic circle \"go chaos\" or vice versa, for example.\n\nThe etiquette of the filk circle begins with a respect for all music, including (and perhaps especially) amateur music and amateur performers. Everyone is encouraged to perform, regardless of their skill level. No one is criticized except to occasionally give tips or suggestions.\n\nAlthough singing along and playing along with instruments (including improvisation) is usually encouraged, filk circles are not like jam sessions. Jam sessions are usually focused on extended instrumental improvisation with everyone performing simultaneously, whereas filk circles tend to be more focused on a single performer or group singing an individual song during their turn. Singing along and playing along are expected to be done politely, contributing to the song rather than overshadowing the song's performer. The exception to this rule is when a jam session is specifically scheduled at a filk convention.\n\nDisruptions and distractions are discouraged during a song. This includes walking through the circle, general noise, and conversations. If between-song conversations and noise get out of hand, it's common to hear someone shout \"Filker up!\" as a signal to end the conversations so that the next person can have their turn.\n\nThere are several shared values that come from the cultural creation of filk in a social network, even one that spans several continents.\n\nAt a deep level, the folk culture of filk validates creative arts in the midst of an explicitly technological culture. When accepting induction into the Filk Hall of Fame in 2003, ethnomusicologist Sally Childs-Helton said, \"We have taken our right to be creative and to literally \"play\" in the best sense of that word.\" Filk combines folk roots, live music circles, and dominant acoustical instrumentation, on the one hand, with high-tech cultural maintenance, on the other hand—a dense network of filkers' web pages, recordings, sound reinforcement at filk conventions, e-mail lists, and so on. The eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity, especially in connection with technology. (See for example Leslie Fish's Hope Eyrie.) While there are significant numbers of memorial songs, pessimistic songs blame carelessness, incompetence, and corruption, only rarely considering the frailties of a society built on technology or hopes for the future. Because these themes cross international boundaries in filk, they are not explainable as a purely American optimism vis-a-vis technology (in contrast to Nye, 1996).\n\nWithin the community, the folk culture of filk acknowledges the legitimacy of music created by artists with a broad range of skills. Those who actively identify themselves as filkers include professional musicians, musical novices, and all ranges in between. The repeat appearances of professional musicians at filk-specific conventions suggests a certain amount of respect given high levels of musical skill within filking, even while the culture is open to less experienced musicians. Whether the occasion is a housefilk in someone's home or a convention (festival) over a weekend, filk culture encourages respectful listening regardless of the performers' skill level and manifest opportunities for participation from single songs in a musical circle to scheduled concerts.\n\nThat openness to participation is a marked norm in filking, which makes it unusual in a larger society that glorifies competition and super-stardom in performance arts. Mentorship within the filk community includes formal workshops at conventions as well as the informal swapping of advice in various forums.\n\nOccasional discussions over the boundaries of filk indicates the extent to which participants in filking are both aware of and keenly interested in the definition of filk as a community. Newsgroup debates over such topics as whether 'Weird Al' Yankovic is a filker suggest the deep feelings involved. In practice, most formal recognition of filkers in various awards are to those who regularly attend self-identified filk events, not to professional artists whose work may be considered found filk.\n\nThe Pegasus Awards were founded to recognize and honor excellence in filking. These awards are given annually at the Ohio Valley Filk Fest (or OVFF). Anyone with an interest in filk can nominate songs or individuals for the awards, and anyone can vote. It is not necessary to be a member of the convention to be involved in the nomination and voting process.\n\nCurrently awards are given in six categories: Best Song, Best Performer, Best Writer/Composer, Best Classic Song and two topical categories that vary from year to year. Some examples of past categories include: Best Love Song, Best Literature Song, Best Techie Song, Best Sing Along, etc.\n\nThe OVFF convention committee solicits nominations for Finalists for the Pegasus Awards (the Nominating Ballot) during the late spring and summer. There is an opinion poll that runs during the year as well to help interested folk brainstorm ideas for the Nominating Ballot. The Finalist Ballot is distributed in the early fall, and must be returned by the opening night of OVFF. Voting can be done online—either to nominate Finalists, or to vote for the Finalists themselves. The final round of voting happens at OVFF itself, where handwritten ballots are collected after the annual Pegasus concert. The entire process is administered by the OVFF convention committee.\n\nThe Filk Hall of Fame was created by David Hayman in 1995 as a complement to the Pegasus Awards. While the Pegasus Awards acknowledge writing and performing, and therefore often reflect who or what is currently popular, the Hall of Fame was intentionally designed to acknowledge long-term or lasting contributions, including those largely behind the scenes.\n\nAnyone may make a nomination. A nomination consists of a description of what the nominee has contributed to filk music and the filk community. Nominations are reviewed annually by a jury consisting of the convention committee of FilKONtario (with the exception of David Hayman, who serves as administrator) and a representative from the committees of each of that year's other filk conventions. The jury members vote independently by secret ballot, and thereby select that year's inductees. Typically, three people are inducted each year, at the banquet at FilKONtario. A small editorial committee combines and edits the text of the nomination(s) to produce a citation, which is read aloud at the banquet, presented to the inductee along with a plaque, and posted on the Hall of Fame web site.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5895192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895192", "title": "Hiatus (television)", "text": "Hiatus (television)\n\nIn American English, the term hiatus may be used to refer to a break of several weeks or months in the normal broadcast programming of a television series in the United States. Such a break can occur part-way through the season of a series, in which case it is called a mid-season break, or between distinct television seasons (usually starting in June and ending in September, when shooting starts for the next season). On the Northern Hemisphere, the breaks between late November and early February are also referred to as winter breaks or, in the Christian cultural sphere, Christmas breaks.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, summer breaks were sometimes replaced by summer replacement series.\n\nTelevision stations often implement a hiatus for their programs to split up a season so it will run longer until the next season. Some programs also go on hiatus so that their television networks can reserve episodes for airing during ratings sweeps, wherein networks compute their television advertising fees based on their programs' ratings during that period. Programs return from a hiatus in time for the sweeps period so as to generate high ratings, and as such usually include special content in programming such as guest stars, controversial and unexpected plots or topics, extended episodes, and finales. Television programs tend to have a hiatus for the late-November, throughout December and early January holidays or the summer if the season does not end before, resuming at some point after, most often mid-January in the case of Christmas and New Year, and September in the case of the summer.\n\nIn the USA, hiatuses may also be common during the Major League Baseball playoffs in October, the Olympic Winter Games in February and various ceremonial awards in March. The mid-season break in the USA usually starts at Thanksgiving in late-November, sometimes ending with a Thanksgiving or Christmas episode, and lasts until Super Bowl in late January and early February.\n\nThe final episode airing before the Christmas break is usually referred to as the midseason finale, or in the northern hemisphere, \"winter finale\".\n\nAt this time, other TV series may be launched.\n\nA network may put a show on hiatus before canceling it. This may be to evaluate the series' quality, warn the television producers in an effort to push them to produce a more profitable product, fill its timeslot with another program to compare ratings, or warn viewers that the show is not pulling its weight in ratings to see how the show performs in reruns before deciding whether or not it deserves another season.\n\nA series may be put on hiatus for other reasons. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike forced several television series (including \"Pushing Daisies\", \"Eli Stone\", \"Chuck\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", and \"Heroes\") to go into un-planned hiatus and deferred the scheduled returns of other series such as \"24\" for an extended period. A show may go on hiatus in reaction to its content: The \"Pokémon\" anime was put on hiatus in Japan from December 17, 1997 until April 16, 1998 after the airing of an episode which caused 685 viewers to have seizures. A show may also be put on hiatus due to personal issues with a cast member, or an illness or death: examples are the death of \"8 Simple Rules\" actor John Ritter; \"The Royal Family\" being retooled after the death of Redd Foxx; and \"Sonny with a Chance\" actress Demi Lovato departing Disney Channel to deal with personal issues, leading to that show's retooling around the show within a show \"So Random!\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5696227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5696227", "title": "ITV (Thailand)", "text": "ITV (Thailand)\n\niTV was a television station in Thailand that was owned by iTV Public Company Limited, a unit of Shin Corporation. As Thailand's first UHF channel, the station was started in 1995 when the company was granted a 30-year concession by the Office of the Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office to operate a free-to-air television station in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrum at 510-790 MHz (from Channel 26 to 60). After a lengthy dispute over unpaid concession fees to the Prime Minister's Office, the government's Public Relations Department took over the station in 2007. Its name was changed to Thai Independent Television (TITV). Following a previously unannounced order of Thailand's Public Relations Department delivered the same day, the station closed on January 15th, 2008. In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Service Act, the channel's frequency was assigned to the Thai Public Broadcasting Service (Thai PBS).\n\nThe original name of iTV's holding company was Siam Infotainment Company Limited. Its major shareholders were Siam Commercial Bank, the Crown Property Bureau (the investment organization of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Through by Sahacinema Company), and the Nation Multimedia Group. Siam Infotainment won a 30-year concession to run a commercial television station, after offering only approximately $3.3 million USD in royalties (a rival company had offered approximately $17.5 million USD). This irregularity was subject to a government investigation in 1996, but the results of the investigation were never made public.\n\nEstablished as an independent television station, the company barred any one shareholder from having more than a 10% stake. Free from government control and shareholder liabilities, the station became known for its in-depth coverage of public affairs and investigative journalism.\n\nDuring the East Asian financial crisis of 1997, the station faced heavy financial loss. In addition, high concession fees (approximately $708 million USD to be paid over 25 years) threatened to close the station. In 2000, iTV lost 775 million THB (USD $18 million). The Democrat government worried that if iTV collapsed, shareholders like Siam Commercial Bank and the Crown Property Bureau would be adversely affected. So in order to attract outside capital, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai lifted the 10% limit on share ownership in the station. Shin Corporation, owned by future Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, purchased a large portion of the company's shares for USD $60 million, considered a high price for the ailing company.\n\nUnder new ownership, journalists reported being pressured to downplay negative news about Shin Corporation's then-owner, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and his Thai Rak Thai party. Twenty-one journalists were fired for speaking out. They later won a court case against iTV and were awarded several years of back pay.\nOriginally, iTV's news-to-entertainment ratio was about 70/30. In the station's latter years, iTV increased its entertainment-based programming so that about half of its shows were entertainment. Among its popular programs was the Thailand version of the \"Big Brother\" reality TV show.\n\nIn 2004, iTV was granted permission by an arbitration panel to increase the amount of entertainment programming. Additionally, iTV was required to pay the government only 6 million USD in annual licensing fees, a reduction from the original agreement of 25 million USD.\n\nIn June 2006, as a result of iTV's changes in programming, Thailand's Central Administrative Court invalidated the arbitration panel's ruling, saying the news-to-entertainment ratio must be returned to 70/30 and that the broadcaster must pay 2.1 billion dollars in fines. iTV contested the court's decision.\n\nMedia-reform activists in Thailand, such as Supinya Klangnarong and Jon Ungpakorn, had suggested that the station model itself as a public broadcaster, similar to the BBC, PBS, NHK or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Proponents believed that a public model would allow iTV to achieve its original mission as an independent public network, free from political intervention and business interests. As Jon Ungpakorn told \"The Nation\", \"The goal of founding iTV back in 1995 was to provide a public service via a truly independent network. That ideal should continue to be supported as we shouldn't forget that this network was set up following the 'dark age' of information which led to the Bloody May events of 1992.\"\n\nIn 2006, Shin Corporation, iTV's majority shareholder, was acquired by Temasek Holdings, the investment company of the Singaporean government. Thai media activists strongly criticized the sale. After the 2006 military coup that ousted Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand's interim civilian government voiced intentions to take over iTV if it failed to pay 2.8 billion USD in fines. In February 2007, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont appointed a new executive board consisting exclusively of civil servants. The station was renamed \"Thailand Independent Television\" (TITV).\n\nPrime Minister Surayud Chulanont announced that the government would acquire the station, intending to hand operations to the Public Relations Department, which already ran TVT Channel 11. Surayud promised that the station would not be taken off the air despite the controversy over concession fees. However, in 2007, the Prime Minister's Office announced that the station would be taken off the air at midnight on 6 March 2007, following the Cabinet's revocation of iTV's concession in early March 2007. Surayud apologized for not keeping his word.\n\nThen on 7 March 2007, Surayud reversed his decision and ordered that iTV continue broadcasting after the deadline had passed.\n\nOther government-controlled television stations like MCOT were expected to reap windfalls if iTV ended.\n\nOn 14 January 2008, Thailand's Government Public Relations Department delivered a non-negotiable letter ordering closure of the station. The station complied, ending the TITV broadcast at 00:08 AM the next day. In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Service Act, the station was transformed into the Thai Public Broadcasting Service or Thai PBS.\n\n\n"}

In many genres (such as Peking opera and Cantonese opera), this role requires heavy face painting. As a result, it is also known as Hualian (\"Painted face\"). However, not all characters with painted faces fall into this category, with \"Chou\" (clowns) being another major painted-face role type. \n\nThis type of role will entail a forceful character, so a actor must have a strong voice and be able to exaggerate gestures. Depending on the repertoire of the particular troupe, he will play either primary or secondary roles. The colour and face design represents the identity and personality of the character.\n\nFace painting in Chinese theatre probably began with masks, and actors painted their faces as early as 9th-century Tang dynasty (618–907). During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) red and white facial designs were used in opera to distinguish good characters from bad ones. After the 14th century, facial patterns multiplied, and new colors have been introduced. Peking opera now boasts 15 basic facial patterns, but there are over 1000 specific variations. Each design is unique to a specific character. The patterns and coloring are thought to be derived from traditional Chinese color symbolism and divination on the lines of a person's face, which is said to reveal personality. Easily recognizable examples of coloring include: \n\n\nLater designs introduced other colors, such as:\n\n\nTo emphasize a character's height and strength, the forehead is generally elongated, with the face design covering the entire face, from the crown to the chin and extending to both ears.\n\nThree main types of roles are often seen. These include , roles that heavily involve singing, , roles with less emphasis on singing and more on physical performance, and , martial and acrobatic roles.\n"}

She wrote two scholarly books in the 1980s which used an analytical technique called neoformalism. As well, she has co-authored two widely used film studies textbooks with her husband David Bordwell.\n\nThompson earned her master's degree in film studies at the University of Iowa (1973) and a Ph.D. in film studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. She has held teaching positions at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Iowa, Indiana University, the University of Amsterdam, and the University of Stockholm.\n\nShe co-wrote the film textbook, \"Film Art: An Introduction\", with husband David Bordwell. \"Film Art\", with a tenth edition published in 2013, was originally published in 1979 and has become a standard in the field of film aesthetics. To date, it has been translated into seven languages.\n\nThompson predominantly relies on an analytical method drawn from Russian Formalism known as neoformalism. This method formed the basis for her dissertation, which subsequently became her first scholarly book, \"Eisenstein's \"Ivan the Terrible\": A Neoformalist Analysis\". Neoformalism is also the basis for the later, \"Breaking the Glass Armor\".\n\nIn 1994, she co-wrote another textbook with Bordwell, \"Film History\". In early 2001 she did a series of lectures at Oxford University. She holds an honorary fellowship in the Department of Communication Arts at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nThompson argues that a small number of television shows stand out as quality television shows, due to their use of \"...a quality pedigree, a large ensemble cast, a series memory, creation of a new genre through recombination of older ones, self-consciousness, and pronounced tendencies toward the controversial and the realistic.\" She claims that television shows such as \"Twin Peaks\", \" Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"The Sopranos\", and \"The Simpsons\" exhibit traits also found in art films, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines.\n\nShe notes that David Lynch's \"Twin Peaks\" television series have \"...a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity.\" She compares Lynch's film \"Blue Velvet\" and the television series \"Twin Peaks\" and asks \"...whether there can be an \"art television\" comparable to the more familiar \"art cinema.\" \n\nAs well, she points out that series such as \" Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"The Sopranos\", and \"The Simpsons\" \"...have altered longstanding notions of closure and single authorship\", which means that \"...television has wrought its own changes in traditional narrative form.\" She states that \"The Simpsons\" uses a \"...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the program as a television show.\"\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Thompson's interest in Hollywood norms led her to write a monograph about the popular fantasy trilogy \"The Lord of the Rings\": \"The Frodo Franchise: The Lord of the Rings and Modern Hollywood\". According to Thompson, the book \"[...] examine[s] the larger phenomenon of this hugely successful franchise, examining the film's making but also its marketing via the Internet, its merchandising (particularly DVDs and video games), and its impact on world cinema.\" It is based on the author's interviews with many of the artists, writers, and business people who participated in the making of \"The Lord of the Rings\" motion pictures.\n\n\n"}

Balanchine and Jerome Robbins are considered the founding choreographers of the company. Léon Barzin was the company's first music director. City Ballet grew out of earlier troupes: the Producing Company of the School of American Ballet, 1934; the American Ballet, 1935, and Ballet Caravan, 1936, which merged into American Ballet Caravan, 1941; and directly from the Ballet Society, 1946.\n\nIn a 1946 letter, Kirstein stated, \"The only justification I have is to enable Balanchine to do exactly what he wants to do in the way he wants to do it.\" He served as the company's General Director from 1946 to 1989, developing and sustaining it by his organizational and fundraising abilities.\n\nThe company was named New York City Ballet in 1948 when it became resident at City Center of Music and Drama. Its success was marked by its move to the New York State Theater, now David H. Koch Theater, designed by Philip Johnson to Balanchine's specifications. City Ballet went on to become the first ballet company in the United States to have two permanent venue engagements: one at Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater on 63rd Street in Manhattan, and another at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, in Saratoga Springs, New York. The School of American Ballet (S.A.B.), which Balanchine founded, is the training school of City Ballet.\n\nAfter the company's move to the State Theater, Balanchine's creativity as a choreographer flourished. He created works that were the basis of the company's repertory until his death in 1983. His vision influenced dance both across the United States and in Europe. He worked closely with choreographer Jerome Robbins, who resumed his connection with the company in 1969 after having produced works for Broadway.\n\nNYCB still has the largest repertoire by far of any American ballet company. It often stages 60 ballets or more in its winter and spring seasons at Lincoln Center each year, and 20 or more in its summer season in Saratoga Springs. City Ballet has performed \"The Nutcracker\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and many more. City Ballet has trained and developed many great dancers since its formation. Many dancers with already developed reputations have also joined the ballet as principal dancers.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1960, Balanchine mounted City Ballet's \"Salute to Italy\" with premieres of \"Monumentum pro Gesualdo\" and \"Variations from Don Sebastian\" (called the \"Donizetti Variations\" since 1961), as well as performances of his \"La Sonnambula\" and Lew Christensen's \"Con Amore\". The performance was repeated in 1968.\n\nIn 1972, Balanchine offered an eight-day tribute to the composer, his great collaborator, who had died the year before. His programs included twenty-two new works of his own dances, plus works by choreographers Todd Bolender, John Clifford, Lorca Massine, Jerome Robbins, Richard Tanner, and John Taras, as well as repertory ballets by Balanchine and Robbins. Balanchine created \"Symphony in Three Movements\", \"Duo Concertant\", and \"Violin Concerto\" for the occasion. He and Robbins co-choreographed and performed in \"Pulcinella\". Balanchine had produced an earlier Stravinsky festival in 1937 as balletmaster of the American Ballet while engaged by the Metropolitan Opera. The composer conducted the April 27th premiere of \"Card Party\".\n\nIn 1975, Balanchine paid his respects to the French composer Maurice Ravel with a two-week \"Hommage à Ravel\". Balanchine, Robbins, Jacques d'Amboise, and Taras made sixteen new ballets for the occasion. Repertory ballets were performed as well. High points included Balanchine's \"Le Tombeau de Couperin\" and Robbins' \"Mother Goose\".\n\nIn 1981, Balanchine planned a two-week NYCB festival honoring the Russian composer Peter Ilyitch Tschaikovsky. Balanchine, Joseph Duell, d'Amboise, Peter Martins, Robbins, and Taras created twelve new dances. In addition to presenting these and repertory ballets, Balanchine re-choreographed his \"Mozartiana\" from 1933. Philip Johnson and John Burgee's stage setting of translucent tubing was designed to be hung and lit in different architectural configurations throughout the entire festival.\n\nIn 1982, Balanchine organized a centennial celebration in honor of his long-time collaborator Igor Stravinsky, during which the City Ballet performed twenty-five ballets set to the composer’s music. Balanchine made three new ballets, \"Tango\", \"Élégie\", and \"Persephone\", and a new version of \"Variations\". The choreographer died the following year. Balanchine’s 50th Anniversary Celebration was held by the company in 2002.\n\nOn April 26, 1984, NYCB celebrated the 20th anniversary of the New York State Theater. The program started with Igor Stravinsky's \"Fanfare for a New Theater,\" followed by Stravinsky's arrangement of The Star-Spangled Banner. The ballets included three of Balanchine's works, Serenade, Stravinsky Violin Concerto, and \"Sonatine\"; and Jerome Robbins' Afternoon of a Faun. The performers included Maria Calegari, Kyra Nichols, Heather Watts, Leonid Kozlov, Afshin Mofid, Patricia McBride, Helgi Tomasson, Karin von Aroldingen, Lourdes Lopez, Bart Cook, and Joseph Duell.\n\nAfter Balanchine's death in 1983, Peter Martins was selected as balletmaster of the company. After 30 years, Martins was judged to have maintained the New York City Ballet's financial security and the musicality and performance level of the dancers, but he has not emphasized the Balanchine style to the extent that many observers expected he would. Martins retired from his position in 2018.\n\nFor the company's 40th anniversary, Martins held an American Music Festival, having commissioned dances from choreographers Laura Dean, Eliot Feld, William Forsythe, Lar Lubovitch, and Paul Taylor. He also presented ballets by George Balanchine and Robbins. The programs included world premieres of more than twenty dances. Martins contributed \"Barber Violin Concerto\", \"Black and White\", \"The Chairman Dances\", \"A Fool for You\", \"Fred and George\", \"Sophisticated Lady\", \"Tanzspiel\", \"Tea-Rose\", and \"The Waltz Project\".\n\nA major component of the Spring 2008 season was a celebration of Jerome Robbins; major revivals were mounted of the following ballets:\n\n\n\nFriday, June 27, 2008, the first \"Dancers’ Choice\" benefit was held for the Dancers' Emergency Fund. The program was initiated by Peter Martins, conceived and supervised by principal dancer Jonathan Stafford, assisted by Kyle Froman, Craig Hall, Amanda Hankes, Adam Hendrickson, Ask la Cour, Henry Seth, and Daniel Ulbricht, and consisted of:\n\n\nand excerpts from:\n\n\n\nOn June 14, 2009, the second \"Dancers’ Choice\" benefit was held at a special evening performance. The program included \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Union Jack\". The program was supervised by principal dancer Jenifer Ringer.\n\nNYCB performs fall, winter and spring repertory seasons at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center as well as George Balanchine's \"Nutcracker\" during November and December; they have a summer residency at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and regularly tour internationally.\n\nIntroductory talks about a current performance, called First Position Discussions, are held before some performances or during some intervals in the fourth ring, house right; the docents are volunteers and include laymen as well as former dancers. Hour-long Inside NYCB events explore the history and inner workings of New York City Ballet through performance and discussion, often with dancers and artistic staff.\n\nOther public programs include Family Saturdays, one-hour interactive programs for children 5 and up; Children's Workshops and In Motion Workshops, pre-performance explorations of the music, movement, and themes of a ballet featured in the matinee performance for children ages 5–8 and 9-11, respectively; and Ballet Essentials, a 75-minute informal ballet class for adults ages 21 and up with little to no prior dance experience. These programs are all facilitated by NYCB dancers.\n\nNew York City Ballet offers day-of tickets to patrons age 30 and under for $30, the day of the performance at the box office. Availability is announced on Mondays during performance periods.\n\nNew York City Ballet's Fourth Ring Society offers discounted tickets to members. This program was closed to new members in 2011.\n\nCity Ballet's Choreographic Institute was founded by Irene Diamond and Peter Martins in 2000. The institute has three main programmatic programs: choreographic sessions, providing choreographers with dancers and studio space; fellowship initiatives, annual awards in support of an emerging choreographer affiliated with a ballet company; and choreographic forums, symposia and round-table discussions on choreography, music, and design elements.\n\nThe following is the current artistic staff (except dancers, who are listed at List of New York City Ballet dancers):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 66-member NYCB Orchestra is an important symphonic institution in its own right, having played for virtually all of the thousands of performances NYCB has given over the decades. It is one of the most versatile orchestras in the world, on any given week performing perhaps three or four times the repertoire that another symphony might be expected to do. Principal players of the orchestra also perform the majority of the concertos, other solos, and chamber music in the NYCB repertory as well. The orchestra accompanies the ballet on all of its North American tours, and while the ballet uses local orchestras on its international tours, members of the NYCB Orchestra often go along as soloists or extras.\n\nBesides the members of the orchestra, the NYCB has six pianists on full-time staff. They all perform in the pit with the orchestra on a regular basis.\n\nThe NYCB Orchestra also occasionally accompanies other dance companies when they visit The David H. Koch Theater from other cities. These engagements have included the Australian Ballet in the spring of 2012, and the San Francisco Ballet in the fall of 2013.\n\nOver the decades the NYCB Orchestra has welcomed other noted orchestral musicians to collaborate on special performances. Included among this group was John Serry Sr., who served as the lead orchestral accordionist during the NYCB's 20th anniversary season in the premiere of Jacques d' Amboise's \"Tchaikovsky Suite\" (1969).\n\nAndrew Litton was appointed to the position on December 16, 2014, and started in September 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

On 1 August 2014 the archive was amalgamated with Sound Archives Ngā Taonga Kōrero and the Television New Zealand Archive to form Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision.\n\nIn 2010, a collection of 75 previously thought to be lost American silent films, were discovered in the New Zealand Film Archive. The films dated from 1898 to 1929 and were previously thought to be lost films.\n\nDuring the time period that the films were performed films were shipped to countries along a \"distribution line\" format, with New Zealand often being the last place the films would be shipped. Because of the high cost of transport during this time and the flammability of the early film stock, most of the films would not be shipped back to the United States and were stored into government archives, were destroyed, or were given or sold to private owners.\n\nThe films were discovered during the visit of Brian Meacham, a Los Angeles film preservationist, to the archive. Meacham was curious as to what films the archive held, upon which it was discovered that the archive held a large amount of early American films. The New Zealand Film Archive's Steve Russell said \"It's one of the rare cases where the tyranny of distance has worked in our and the films' favour\".\n\nIn order to export the films back to the United States for restoration, the movies have had to be transported in U.N.-approved steel barrels in incremental doses. Many of the films had begun to deteriorate, with film preservationist Annette Melville saying \"About a quarter of the films are in advanced nitrate decay and the rest have good image quality, though they are badly shrunken\".\n\nOf the 75 films discovered in the New Zealand archive, some of the more notable examples were John Ford's 1927 film \"Upstream\" and the 1923 film \"Maytime\". It was also noted by the \"New York Times\" that many of the films that were recovered \"underline the major contribution made by women to early cinema\". Sony has assumed the costs for the restoration of \"Mary of the Movies\".\n\nThe Hitchcock film \"The White Shadow\" was discovered in the collection, mislabeled as the movie \"Twin Sisters\" and lacked a title credit. The discovery of this film was named as one of Movies.com's \"Biggest Surprises of 2011\".\n\nThe archive has many silent American films that had been shipped to New Zealand at the time of their release, but were thought not worth the expense of shipping back to the United States after they ran in theaters. The films were supposed to be destroyed after being sent to New Zealand and seen there at the end of their distribution run, but some were stashed away instead, then later put into the archive. Only about 20 percent of films from the silent era were still in existence as of 2010.\n\nThe organisation has a strong commitment to repatriating old films to their country of origin. In 2009, the archive agreed with the (American) National Film Preservation Foundation to repatriate 75 silent American films, all rare or previously thought by American archivists and scholars to be lost (the archive continues to hold many other silent-era American films). About 70 percent of the copies were complete. The films, all on highly volatile and dangerous nitrate stock, were to be shipped back to the United States for restoration and copying, except for \"Upstream\", a 1927 film by John Ford, which was determined to be so precious that transportation could not be risked before it was restored and copied in New Zealand. Other films in the cache include \"Mary of the Movies\" (1923), the earliest C.B.C Film Sales (Columbia Pictures) feature film known to have survived, \"Maytime\" (1923; starring Clara Bow); the first surviving film Mabel Normand directed (and starred in); an episode of the serial \"The Active Life of Dolly of the Dailies\", as well as industrial films, documentaries and newsreels. The agreement to repatriate the films came after an American film preservationist from the Academy Film Archive visited the New Zealand archives while on vacation and began discussing the New Zealand institution's holdings with archivists there.\n\n"}

{"id": "33713408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33713408", "title": "Piano music of Gabriel Fauré", "text": "Piano music of Gabriel Fauré\n\nThe French composer Gabriel Fauré (1845–1924) wrote in many genres, including songs, chamber music, orchestral pieces, and choral works. His compositions for piano, written between the 1860s and the 1920s, include some of his best known works.\n\nFauré's major sets of piano works are thirteen nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed during several decades in his long career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are \"Romances sans paroles\", Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, \"Thème et variations\" in C major, and \"Huit pièces brèves\". For piano duet, Fauré composed the \"Dolly Suite\" and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\".\n\nMuch of Fauré's piano music is difficult to play, but is rarely virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement.\n\nAlthough for much of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly preferred the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, \"In piano music there's no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all.\" Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as \"Piano piece No X\". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, \"the greater they are, the worse they play me.\" Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, \"I've run out of fingers\". Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns wrote to him in 1917, \"Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to get to the end of it by dint of absolute determination.\"\n\nAs a man, Fauré was said to possess \"that mysterious gift that no other can replace or surpass: charm\", and charm is a conspicuous feature of many of his early compositions. His early piano works are influenced in style by Chopin, and throughout his life he composed piano works using similar titles to those of Chopin, notably nocturnes and barcarolles. An even greater influence was Schumann, whose piano music Fauré loved more than any other. The authors of \"The Record Guide\" (1955) wrote that Fauré learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, \"and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated.\" When Fauré was a student at the École Niedermeyer his tutor had introduced him to new concepts of harmony, no longer outlawing certain chords as \"dissonant\". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Fauré anticipated the techniques of Impressionist composers.\n\nIn later years Fauré's music was written under the shadow of the composer's increasing deafness, becoming gradually less charming and more austere, marked by what the composer Aaron Copland called \"intensity on a background of calm.\" The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the accessible earlier piano works, rather than the later music, which expresses \"such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation\" that listeners are left uneasy. The Fauré scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux writes:\n\nThe nocturnes, along with the barcarolles, are generally regarded as the composer's greatest piano works. Fauré greatly admired the music of Chopin, and was happy to compose in forms and patterns established by the earlier composer. Morrison notes that Fauré's nocturnes follow Chopin's model, contrasting serene outer sections with livelier or more turbulent central episodes. The composer's son Philippe commented that the nocturnes \"are not necessarily based on rêveries or on emotions inspired by the night. They are lyrical, generally impassioned pieces, sometimes anguished or wholly elegiac.\"\n\nNectoux rates the first nocturne as one of the best of the composer's early works. It is dedicated, like Fauré's song \"Après un rêve\", to his friend and early patron Marguerite Baugnies. Morrison calls the piece \"cloistered and elegiac.\" Though published as the composer's Op 33/1 in 1883, it was written considerably earlier. It opens with a slow, pensive melody, followed by a more agitated second theme and another melody in C major, and ends with the return of the opening theme. The pianist and academic Sally Pinkas writes that the work contains many hallmarks of Fauré's style, including \"undulating rhythms, syncopation of the accompaniment against the melody and layered textures are already in evidence.\"\n\nThe second nocturne opens with a bell-like passage, \"andantino espressivo\", recalling – although Fauré said it was unconscious – the sound of distant bells that he heard frequently when a boy. Nectoux singles out \"the light footed episode in alternating fifths and sixths\" and its extremely delicate passagework, and points to the influence of Fauré's former teacher Saint-Saëns in the \"allegro ma non troppo\" toccata section. Saint-Saëns himself declared the piece \"absolutely entrancing.\"\n\nIn the third nocturne, Morrison notes that the composer's fondness for syncopation is at its gentlest, \"nostalgia lit by passion.\" Like its predecessors, it is in tripartite form. An expansive melody with syncopated left-hand accompaniment leads into a middle section in which a \"dolcissimo\" theme metamorphoses into bursts of passion. The return of the opening section is concluded by a gentle coda that introduces new harmonic subtleties.\n\nThe fourth nocturne, dedicated to the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau, contrasts a lyrical opening section and an episode in E minor with a sombre theme recalling the tolling of a bell. The first theme returns and is followed by a short coda. The pianist Alfred Cortot, generally a great admirer of Fauré, found the piece \"rather too satisfied with its languor.\"\n\nBy contrast with its predecessor, the fifth nocturne is more animated, with unexpected shifts into remote keys. Nectoux writes of its undulating outline, and the \"almost improvisatory, questioning character\" of the opening.\nThe sixth nocturne, dedicated to Eugène d'Eichthal, is widely held to be one of the finest of the series. Cortot said, \"There are few pages in all music comparable to these.\" Morrison calls it \"among the most rich and eloquent of all Fauré's piano works.\" The pianist and writer Nancy Bricard calls it \"one of the most passionate and moving works in piano literature.\" Fauré wrote it after a six-year break from composing for the piano. The piece begins with an emotional, outpouring phrase, with echoes of Fauré's song cycle \"La bonne chanson\". The second theme, at first seemingly tranquil, has what the composer Charles Koechlin calls a persistent inquietude, emphasised by the syncopated accompaniment. The initial theme returns, and is followed by a substantial development of a gentle, contemplative melody. A recapitulation of the principal theme takes the piece to its conclusion. Copland wrote that it was with this work that Fauré first fully emerged from the shadow of Chopin, and he said of the piece, \"The breath and dignity of the opening melody, the restless C sharp minor section which follows (with the peculiar syncopated harmonies so often and so well used by Fauré), the graceful fluidity of the third idea: all these elements are brought to a stormy climax in the short development section; then, after a pause, comes the return of the consoling first page.\"\n\nThe seventh nocturne departs from the A–B–A form of Fauré's earlier nocturnes; in Pinkas's view is it constructed more like a ballade than a nocturne. It opens with a slow (\"molto lento\") theme of harmonic ambiguity, followed by a second theme, equally ambiguous in key, though nominally in D major. The central section is in F major, and the re-emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion. Morrison finds in this piece a sense of bleakness, and of the composer's struggle against despair. Pinkas, however, regards the work as a \"contrast between ambiguity and joy, ending in reassurance.\" It is sometimes known as the \"English\" nocturne, having been composed while Fauré was staying in the UK, and being dedicated to the English pianist Adela Maddison.\nFauré did not intend the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His publisher collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as \"8 pièces brèves\", allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.\nThe ninth nocturne, dedicated to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, is the first of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.\n\nLike its immediate predecessor, the tenth nocturne is on a smaller scale than those of Fauré's middle period. In contrast with the ninth, however, the tenth is darker and angrier. The composer applies the A–B–A form less rigorously than in earlier nocturnes, and the opening bars of the piece recur intermittently throughout, eventually building to a fierce climax, described by Morrison as \"a slow central climb ... that inhabits a world of nightmare.\" The piece ends with a calm coda. It is dedicated to Madame Brunet-Lecomte.\n\nThe eleventh nocturne was written in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.\n\nWith the twelfth nocturne Fauré returned to the scale and complexity of his middle-period works, but both melodically and harmonically it is much harder to comprehend. There are deliberate dissonances and harmonic ambiguities that Pinkas describes as \"taking tonality to its limit while still maintaining a single key.\" Morrison writes that \"the ecstatic song of No 6 is transformed in a central section where lyricism is soured by dissonance, held up, as it were, to a distorting mirror.\" The work is in Fauré's customary nocturne form, A–B–A, but with a reiteration of the material of the second section, harmonically transformed, followed by a coda that draws on material from the opening section.\n\nFauré scholars are generally agreed that the last nocturne – which was the last work he wrote for the piano – is among the greatest of the set. Nectoux writes that along with the sixth, it is \"incontestably the most moving and inspired of the series.\" Bricard calls it \"the most inspired and beautiful in the series.\" For Pinkas, the work \"achieves a perfect equilibrium between late-style simplicity and full-textured passionate expression.\" The work opens in a \"pure, almost rarefied atmosphere\" (Nectoux), with a \"tone of noble, gentle supplication ... imposing gravity and ... rich expressive four part writing.\" This is followed by an \"allegro\", \"a true middle section in a virtuoso manner, ending in a bang\" (Pinkas). The repeat of the opening section completes the work.\n\nBarcarolles were originally folk songs sung by Venetian gondoliers. In Morrison's phrase, Fauré's use of the term was more convenient than precise. Fauré was not attracted by fanciful titles for musical pieces, and maintained that he would not use even such generic titles as \"barcarolle\" if his publishers did not insist. His son Philippe recalled, \"he would far rather have given his Nocturnes, Impromptus, and even his Barcarolles the simple title Piano Piece no. so-and-so.\" Nevertheless, following the precedents of Chopin and most conspicuously Mendelssohn, Fauré made extensive use of the barcarolle, in what his biographer Jessica Duchen calls \"an evocation of the rhythmic rocking and lapping of water around appropriately lyrical melodies.\"\n\nFauré's ambidexterity is reflected in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard as well as in the bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.\n\nLike the nocturnes, the barcarolles span nearly the whole of Fauré's composing career, and they similarly display the evolution of his style from the uncomplicated charm of the early pieces to the withdrawn and enigmatic quality of the late works. All are written with compound time signatures (6/8 or 9/8), except number 7, which is in 6/4.\n\nThe first barcarolle was dedicated to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. Caroline Montigny-Rémaury) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique in 1882. The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in 6/8 time. It develops into a more elaborate form before the introduction of the second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass. Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance.\n\nThe second barcarolle, dedicated to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, and points to the influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 in the middle of the piece.\n\nThe third barcarolle is dedicated to Henriette Roger-Jourdain, wife of Fauré's friend, the painter . It opens with a simple phrase that is quickly elaborated into trills reminiscent of Chopin. The middle section, like that of the first, keeps the melody in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated ornaments above and below. The pianist Marguerite Long said that these ornaments \"crown the theme like sea foam.\"\n\nOne of the best-known of the set, the fourth barcarolle is \"tuneful, quite short, perhaps more direct than the others.\" (Koechlin).\nDedicated to Mme la Baronne V. d'Indy, the fifth barcarolle was written after a five-year period in which Fauré composed nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile. It is the first of Fauré's piano works in which there are no identifiable sections; its changes are in metre, not in tempo.\n\nKoechlin brackets the sixth and seventh of the set together as a contrasting pair. Both pieces show \"an economy of writing\", the sixth \"more moderate and tranquil in expression\". The Fauré scholar Roy Howat writes of a \"sensuous insouciance\" with an underlying virtuosity and wit under the \"deceptively nonchalant surface\".\n\nThe seventh barcarolle contrasts with its predecessor in being more restless and sombre, recalling Fauré's \"Crépuscule\" from his song cycle \"La chanson d'Ève\".\n\nDedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau, the eighth barcarolle opens in with a cheerful theme, which soon gives way to melancholy. The second episode, in C minor, marked \"cantabile\", is succeeded by an abrupt ending with a \"fortissimo\" chord.\n\nThe ninth barcarolle, in Koechlin's view, \"recalls, as in a hazy remoteness, the happiness of the past\". Nectoux writes that it consists of \"a series of harmonic or polyphonic variations on a strange, sombre, syncopated theme, whose monotony recalls some sailor's song\".\nDedicated to Madame Léon Blum, the tenth barcarolle stays more closely within conventional tonality than its predecessor, \"with a certain sedate gravity ... the monotony appropriate to a grey evening\" (Koechlin). The melancholy theme is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's Venetian themes from \"Songs Without Words\", but is developed in a way characteristic of Fauré, with \"increasingly animated rhythms and, at certain points, excessively complex textures\" (Nectoux).\n\nDedicated to Laura, daughter of the composer Isaac Albéniz. The eleventh and twelfth of the set can be viewed as another contrasting pair. The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the prevailing austerity of Fauré's later style.\n\nDedicated to Louis Diémer, the twelfth barcarolle is an \"allegretto giocoso\". It opens in what was by now for Fauré a rare uncomplicated theme, in the traditional Venetian manner, but is developed in more subtle rhythms. Despite the increasing complexity of the polyphonic lines, Fauré keeps the melody prominent, and the piece ends with it transformed into \"a theme of almost triumphal character\" (Nectoux).\n\nThe last of the set is dedicated to Magda Gumaelius. Koechlin writes of it: \"bare, superficially almost dry, but at heart most expressive with that deep nostalgia for vanished bright horizons: sentiments that the composer suggests in passing rather than comments on in loquacious or theatrical oratory; he seemed to desire to preserve the soothing and illusory serenity of the mirage.\"\n\nCortot compared the first impromptu to a rapid barcarolle, redolent of \"sunlit water\", combining \"stylised coquetry and regret\".\n\nDedicated to Mlle Sacha de Rebina, the second impromptu maintains an airy tarantella rhythm. It is scored less richly than the first of the set, giving it a lightness of texture.\n\nThe third impromptu is the most popular of the set. Morrison calls it \"among Fauré's most idyllic creations, its principal idea dipping and soaring above a gyrating, moto perpetuo accompaniment\". It is marked by a combination of dash and delicacy.\n\nDedicated to \"Madame de Marliave\" (Marguerite Long), the fourth impromptu was Fauré's return to the genre in his middle period. Unlike much of his music of the period, it avoids a dark mood, but Fauré had by now moved on from the uncomplicated charm of the first three of the set. His mature style is displayed in the central section, a contemplative \"andante\", which is followed by a more agitated section that concludes the work.\n\nNectoux describes this impromptu as \"a piece of sheer virtuosity celebrating, not without humour, the beauties of the whole-tone scale.\" Morrison, however, writes that the work \"seethes with unrest\".\n\nThe last work in the published set was written before numbers four and five. It was originally a harp piece, composed for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1904. Cortot made a transcription for piano, published in 1913 as Fauré's Op 86 \"bis\". The outer sections are light and brilliant, with a gentler central section, marked \"meno mosso\".\n\nThe four valses-caprices are not a cycle, but rather two sets of two, the first from Fauré's early period and the second from his middle period. Morrison calls all four \"more 'caprice' than 'waltz, and comments that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Saëns waltzes. They show Fauré at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting in and out of unexpected keys. Aaron Copland, though generally a keen admirer of Fauré's music, wrote, \"the several \"Valses-Caprices,\" in spite of their admirable qualities, seem to me essentially foreign to Faure's \"esprit\". His is too orderly, too logical a mind to be really capricious.\" Cortot, by contrast, spoke approvingly of their \"sensual grace ... perfect distinction ... impassioned tenderness.\"\n\nChopin's influence is marked in the first two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to that at the end of Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (\"Au bord d'une source\") in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's \"Grande Valse Brillante\", Op, 18.\n\nOrledge writes that the second two valses-caprices are subtler and better integrated than the first two; they contain \"more moments of quiet contemplation and more thematic development than before.\" There still remain touches of virtuosity and traces of Liszt, and these two valses-caprices are, in Orledge's words, the only solo pieces in the middle period to end in a loud and spectacular manner.\nNo 3 is dedicated to Mme. Philippe Dieterlen, No 4 to Mme. Max Lyon.\n\nFauré wrote these three \"songs without words\" while still a student at the École Niedermeyer, in about 1863. They were not published until 1880, but they then became some of his most popular works. Copland considered them immature pieces, which \"should be relegated to the indiscretions every young composer commits.\" Later critics have taken a less severe view; Morrison describes the Romances as \"an affectionate and very Gallic tribute to Mendelssohn's urbanity, agitation and ease.\" The commentator Keith Anderson writes that although they were a popular French counterpart to Mendelssohn's \"Songs without Words\", Fauré's own voice is already recognisable. Instead of placing the slowest piece in the middle of the set and ending with the lively A minor piece, Fauré, already with musical views of his own, switches the expected order, and the set ends \"pianissimo\", fading to nothing.\n\nThe first romance, in A major, has as an opening theme an uncomplicated melody with Mendelssohnian syncopations. The theme is presented first in the higher and then in the middle register, before flowing evenly to its conclusion.\n\nThe second romance, in A minor, an exuberant piece, has a strong semiquaver figure supporting the theme, and running high into the treble and low into the bass. This was later to become one of Fauré's most recognisable characteristics. After a lively display, the piece ends quietly.\n\nThe final piece of the set, in A major, is a serene \"andante\", with a flowing tune in the Mendelssohnian style. After gentle variation, it equally gently fades to silence at the end.\n\nThe Ballade, dedicated to Camille Saint-Saëns, dates from 1877. It is one of Fauré's most substantial works for solo piano, but is better known in a version for piano and orchestra that he made in 1881 at Liszt's suggestion. Playing for a little over 14 minutes, it is second in length only to the \"Thème et variations.\" Fauré first conceived the music as a set of individual pieces, but then decided to make them into a single work by carrying the main theme of each section over into the following section as a secondary theme. The work opens with the F major theme, an \"andante cantabile\", which is followed by a slower section, marked \"lento\", in E minor. The third section is an andante introducing a third theme. In the last section, an allegro, a return of the second theme brings the work to a conclusion in which Nectoux comments, the treble sings with particular delicacy.\n\nMarcel Proust knew Fauré, and the Ballade is thought to have been the inspiration for the sonata by Proust's character Vinteuil that haunts Swann in \"In Search of Lost Time\". Debussy, reviewing an early performance of the Ballade, compared the music with the attractive soloist, straightening her shoulder-straps during the performance: \"I don't know why, but I somehow associated the charm of these gestures with the music of Fauré himself. The play of fleeting curves that is its essence can be compared to the movements of a beautiful woman without either suffering from the comparison.\" Morrison describes the Ballade as \"a reminder of halcyon, half-remembered summer days and bird-haunted forests\".\n\nThe Mazurka was composed in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883. It is a tribute to Chopin, and contains echoes of the earlier composer's music. Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Fauré wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Fauré's part. The piece owes little to Polish folk-dance rhythms, and may have had a Russian influence through Fauré's friendship with Sergei Taneyev at around the time of its composition.\n\nThe \"Pavane\" (1887) was conceived and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In the form of an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the \"Pavane\" was not a piece of German romanticism.\n\nWritten in 1895, when he was 50, this is among Fauré's most extended compositions for piano, with a performance time of about 15 minutes. Although it has many passages that reflect the influence of Schumann's \"Symphonic Studies\", in Jessica Duchen's words \"its harmonies and pianistic idioms\" are unmistakably those of Fauré. As in the earlier \"Romances sans paroles\", Op 17, Fauré does not follow the conventional course of ending with the loudest and most extrovert variation; the variation nearest to that description is placed next to last, and is followed by a gentle conclusion, \"a typically Faurean understated finish.\" Copland wrote of the work:\nFauré's opera based on the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first performed in 1913, after which the composer published a version of the prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble \"andante moderato\" theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.\n\nFauré did not intend these pieces to be published as a set; they were composed as individual works between 1869 and 1902. When Hamelle, his publishers, insisted on issuing them together as \"Eight Short Pieces\" in 1902, the composer successfully demanded that none of the eight must be allocated its own title. When he moved on to another publisher, Hamelle ignored his earlier instructions and issued subsequent editions with titles for each piece. Nectoux comments that the labelling of the eighth piece as \"Nocturne No 8\" is particularly questionable (see \"Nocturne [No 8]\", below). In the first decade of the 21st century the publisher Peters issued a new critical edition of the Eight Pieces with the spurious titles removed. The eight pieces take less than three minutes each in performance.\n\nCapriccio in E major: Dedicated to Madame Jean Leonard Koechlin. Morrison calls it \"capricious indeed\", and notes a harmonic twist at the end \"as nonchalant as it is acrobatic\". It was originally written as a sight-reading test for students at the Paris Conservatoire, of which Fauré was the professor of composition from 1896 and director from 1905 to 1920.\n\nFantaisie in A major: Koechlin calls this piece a pleasant \"feuillet d'album\".\n\nFugue in A minor: This, like the other fugue in the set, is a revised version of a fugue Fauré composed at the start of his career, when he was a church organist in Rennes. They are both, in Koechlin's view \"in a pleasant and correct style, obviously less rich than those in the Well-Tempered Clavier, and more careful, but whose reserve conceals an incontestable mastery\".\n\nAdagietto in E minor: An \"andante moderato\", \"serious, grave, at once firm and pliant, attaining real beauty\" (Koechlin).\n\nImprovisation in C minor: Orledge calls this piece a middle period \"song without words\". It was composed as a sight-reading test for the Conservatoire.\n\nFugue in E minor: See Fugue in A minor, above.\n\nAllégresse in C major: \"A bubbling perpetuum mobile whose surging romantic feelings are only just kept under restraint\" (Orledge). \"A song, pure and gay, uplifted to a sunlit sky, a youthful outpouring, full of happiness.\" (Koechlin).\n\nNocturne [No 8] in D major: As noted above, this piece stands apart from the larger-scale works to which Fauré gave the title \"nocturne\". It would not be listed among them were it not for the publisher's unauthorised use of the title in this case. It is the longest of the eight pieces of Op 84, but is much shorter and simpler than the other 12 nocturnes, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.\n\nThe nine préludes are among the least known of Fauré's major piano compositions. They were written while the composer was struggling to come to terms with the onset of deafness in his mid-sixties. By Fauré's standards this was a time of unusually prolific output. The préludes were composed in 1909 and 1910, in the middle of the period in which he wrote the opera \"Pénélope\", barcarolles Nos. 8–11 and nocturnes Nos. 9–11.\n\nIn Koechlin's view, \"Apart from the \"Préludes\" of Chopin, it is hard to think of a collection of similar pieces that are so important\". The critic Michael Oliver wrote, \"Fauré's Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness ... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity.\" Jessica Duchen calls them \"unusual slivers of magical inventiveness.\" The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No 3, takes between four and five minutes.\n\n\"Andante molto moderato\". The first prélude is in the manner of a nocturne. Morrison refers to the cool serenity with which it opens, contrasted with the \"slow and painful climbing\" of the middle section.\n\n\"Allegro.\" The \"moto perpetuo\" of the second prélude is technically difficult for the pianist; even the most celebrated Fauré interpreter can be stretched by it. Koechlin calls it \"a feverish whirling of dervishes, concluding in a sort of ecstasy, with the evocation of some fairy palace.\"\n\n\"Andante.\" Copland considered this prélude the most immediately accessible of the set. \"At first, what will most attract you, will be the third in G-minor, a strange mixture of the romantic and classic.\" The musicologist Vladimir Jankélévitch wrote, \"it might be a barcarolle strangely interrupting a theme of very modern stylistic contour\".\n\n\"Allegretto moderato.\" The fourth prélude is among the gentlest of the set. The critic Alain Cochard writes that it \"casts a spell on the ear through the subtlety of a harmony tinged with the modal and its melodic freshness.\" Koechlin calls it \"a guileless pastorale, flexible, with succinct and refined modulations\".\n\n\"Allegro.\" Cochard quotes the earlier writer Louis Aguettant's description of this prélude as \"This fine outburst of anger (\"Ce bel accès de colère\")\". The mood is turbulent and anxious; the piece ends in quiet resignation reminiscent of the \"Libera me\" of the \"Requiem\".\n\n\"Andante.\" Fauré is at his most classical in this prélude, which is in the form of a canon. Copland wrote that it \"can be placed side by side with the most wonderful of the Preludes of the \"Well-Tempered Clavichord\".\"\n\n\"Andante moderato.\" Morrison writes that this prélude, with its \"stammering and halting progress\" conveys an inconsolable grief. After the opening andante moderato, it becomes gradually more assertive, and subsides to conclude in the subdued mood of the opening. The rhythm of one of Fauré's best-known songs, \"N'est-ce-pas?\" from \"La bonne chanson\", runs through the piece.\n\n\"Allegro.\" In Copland's view this is, with the third, the most approachable of the Préludes, \"with its dry, acrid brilliance (so rarely found in Faure).\" Morrison describes it as \"a repeated-note scherzo\" going \"from nowhere to nowhere.\"\n\n\"Adagio.\" Copland described this prélude as \"so simple – so absolutely simple that we can never hope to understand how it can contain such great emotional power.\" The prélude is withdrawn in mood; Jankélévitch wrote that it \"belongs from beginning to end to another world.\" Koechlin notes echoes of the \"Offertoire\" of the \"Requiem\" throughout the piece.\n\nSubtitled \"Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les thèmes favoris de l'Anneau de Nibelung\" (\"Fantasy in the form of a quadrille on favourite themes from \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\"\"). Fauré admired the music of Wagner and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.\nFrom 1878, Fauré and his friend and ex-pupil André Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw \"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walküre\" at Cologne Opera; the complete \"Ring\" cycle in Munich and London; and \"Die Meistersinger\" in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw \"Parsifal\". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\", written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from \"The Ring\". It consists of five short sections in which Wagner's themes are transformed into dance rhythms. The manuscript (in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris) is in Messager's hand.\n\nBetween 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic work for full orchestra. The piece was first heard in 1873 when Fauré and Saint-Saëns performed it in a two-piano version, but that transcription has not survived. Léon Boëllmann made a new transcription of the first movement in 1893.\n\nThe \"Dolly Suite\" is a six-section work for piano duet. It was inspired by Hélène, nicknamed \"Dolly\", daughter of the singer Emma Bardac with whom Fauré was intimately associated in the 1890s. The opening piece was a present for Dolly's first birthday, and Fauré added the other five pieces to mark her subsequent birthdays and other family occasions. Unusually for Fauré, who generally favoured strictly functional titles, the movements of the suite have whimsical titles associated with Dolly and her family.\n\nIts six movements take about fifteen minutes to perform. The first is a Berceuse, or cradle-song. \"Mi-a-ou\", despite a title suggesting a cat, in fact represents the infant Dolly's attempts to pronounce the name of her brother Raoul; after \"Le jardin de Dolly\", the \"Kitty Valse\", again confounds its feline title, being a sketch of the family's pet dog. After the gentle \"Tendresse\", the suite ends with a lively evocation of Spain, which, Orledge notes, is one of Fauré's few purely extrovert pieces.\n\nFrom the orchestral suite drawn from his music for the stage presentation \"Masques et bergamasques\", Fauré made a transcription for piano duet, which was published in 1919. Like the orchestral suite, it consists of four movements, titled \"Ouverture\", \"Menuet\", \"Gavotte\" and \"Pastorale\".\n\nFauré made piano rolls of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. The rolls that survive are of the \"Romance sans paroles\" No 3, Barcarolle No 1, Prelude No 3, Nocturne No 3, \"Thème et variations\", \"Valses-caprices\" Nos 1, 3 and 4, and piano versions of the \"Pavane\", and the \"Sicilienne\" from Fauré's music for \"Pelléas and Mélisande\". Several of these rolls have been transferred to CD. Recordings on disc were few until the 1940s. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by Kathleen Long, including the Nocturne No 6, Barcarolle No 2, the Thème et Variations, Op 73, and the Ballade Op 19 in its orchestral version. Fauré's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s.\n\nIn the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies built up a substantial catalogue of Fauré's piano music, performed by French and non-French musicians. The piano works were first recorded largely complete in the mid-1950s by Germaine Thyssens-Valentin, with later sets being made by Grant Johannesen (1961), Jean Doyen (1966–1969), Jean-Philippe Collard (1974), Paul Crossley (1984–85), Jean Hubeau (1988–89), and Kathryn Stott (1995). Recital selections of major piano works have been recorded by many pianists including Vlado Perlemuter (1989), Pascal Rogé (1990), and Kun-Woo Paik (2002).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n"}

The title was a borrowing from the Russian \"Iskra\".\n\nThe first paper of that name was edited by Romanian revolutionaries in Bolshevist Russia, appearing throughout 1919 in the city of Odessa.\n\n\"Scînteia\" reemerged as the official voice of the Communist Party of Romania on August 15, 1931, being published clandestinely in Bucharest until 1940 (when the hostility between Romania and the Soviet Union grew to a level where a crackdown on communist propaganda became imminent).\n\nWith Romania withdrawing from the Axis and joining the Allies in August 1944, \"Scînteia\" was yet again being published, to remain the approved, sanctioning, body of communist politics. During Communist Romania (since early 1948), it was the barometer of policy changes, and the main medium through which the regime indicated its aims (for example, \"Scînteia\" served as the tribune for slander campaigns against intellectuals such as Tudor Arghezi). Moreover, (indicative of the relations between the official voice and other media), in 1961, August 15 was declared the \"Romanian Press Day\".\n\nThe headquarters of the paper were the main feature of the Socialist Realist \"Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii \"I.V.Stalin\"\", a name later reduced to \"Casa Scînteii\", after it dropped the reference to Joseph Stalin during De-Stalinization. Today, the building goes by the name \"Casa Presei Libere\" (\"The House of the Free Press\").\n\n\"Scînteia\" was accompanied by a youth version, one edited by the Union of Communist Youth (a branch of the Party that resembled the Soviet Komsomol up to a point). Scînteia Tineretului (or \"Scânteia tineretului\"; approximately \"Youth's Spark\") began its edition in November 1944. It was also published under the names of \"Tinerețea\" (\"The Youth\") and \"Tînărul Muncitor\" (or \"Tânărul Muncitor\"; \"The Young Worker\").\n\nWith the Romanian Revolution came the outlawing of all Communist Party institutions, including all its newspapers. \"Scînteia\"'s assets were mostly taken over by the post-communist \"Adevărul\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The controversy was an important historical event for the Lingayatas who were provoked to rethink their image in the public sphere. The controversy threw open several questions related to Lingayata history, literature and philosophy. The Lingayatas had to assert their identity as a community and they accomplished it by actively participating in the debates and discussions. The controversy proved to be a guiding force for scholars like P. G. Halakatti to refashion Lingayata literature and history.

The concerto premiered at Carnegie Hall on April 29, 2008 with Roven conducting the American Symphony Orchestra with Glenn Close narrating.\n\nComposer Glen Roven first conceived of writing a piece based on \"The Runaway Bunny\" after having seen the 2001 film \"Wit\" based on the play of the same name by Margaret Edson. In the film, \"The Runaway Bunny\" is read to Emma Thompson by Eileen Atkins. \nRoven's first sketches were for a concerto for violin, singer and orchestra, however upon advice of the Israeli violinist Ittai Shapira, (for whom the solo violin part was originally written), it was decided to replace the singer with narration integrated into the overall musical structure. The work is in a single movement, with numerous tempo changes depicting the bunny's adventures.\n\nAccording to the composer, \"The Runaway Bunny\" is similar to other classical concert works based on children's stories such as Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\", Kleinsinger's \"Tubby the Tuba\", Chappell's \"Paddington Bear's First Concert\" or Poulenc's \"L'histoire de Babar.\" The composer has subsequently arranged the orchestral score for piano trio and piano solo.

Brown claimed that her inspiration for \"The Runaway Bunny\" came from \"Chanson de Magali\", a love song based on French Provençal folklore. The call-and-response (music) structure of Brown's text provides an emotionally compelling depiction of a small child's first burst of independence and a mother's affirmation of unconditional love.\n\nThe broad popularity of Glen Roven's setting of Margaret Wise Brown's text has attracted many international celebrities including:\n\n\n\n"}

The game was developed and published by Sega for PlayStation 3. It was unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2007 and released in 2008.\n\nA second \"Yakuza\" series spin-off set in samurai era, \"Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!\", was released in 2014 on both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 systems. \"Ishin!\" is set two centuries later than \"Kenzan!\", hence the plots are not related to each other since both games focus on different characters, the historical figures of Sakamoto Ryōma (1836-1867) and Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645) respectively.\n\nThe gameplay shows minimal evolution from the first two episodes except for the new item storage system which allows to access an unlimited amount of items from savepoints. However the graphical engine's improvement is obvious during the numerous real-time 3D cutscenes.\n\nThere are four fighting styles in the game; fists, one blade, two blades and two-handed blades. There are also QTE-based special moves that the player can execute, known as 'heat action'.\n\nThis spin-off is set in Kyoto during the Edo period, in 1605. It is an account of the life of Miyamoto Musashi. The main adventure is completed with sidestories including minigames and a hundred \"sub-stories\".\n\nAfter being defeated by the Tokugawa clan at the historical Battle of Sekigahara which took place on October 20, 1600, Miyamoto Musashi retired from his great swordsman life to become a modest \"yojimbo\" (bodyguard) in Gion (祇園), Kyoto. Five years after the battle, a little girl named Haruka comes to Gion seeking a local hitman known as Kazumanosuke Kiryu which is actually Miyamoto's new identity. After eventually finding Kiryū, Haruka asks for him to assassinate an impostor pretending to be Miyamoto Musashi. At first, Kiryu refuses, then when the girl goes as far as becoming an indentured servant in an opulent \"oiran\" brothel in order to pay the assassination mission he accepts the one-ryō request.\n\nThis is the first game in the series where the games's main characters have their face modeled in 3D after their voice actors who are Japanese celebrities. Cyberware's color 3D scanner (model PS) was used to analyze each actor's head & face in order to collect data on its shape and appearance, then this file was worked with the Softimage XSI 3D graphics application.\n\n\nTwo playable demos were released on January 7, 2008 via the Japanese PlayStation Store. The first demo included sandbox play, and the second had a collection of various combat and romantic gameplay segments.\n\nAs part of the pre-ordering campaign, the Japanese first print was bundled with a limited item, a monography called \"Kamutai Magazine\" (March 2008 issue). Sony celebrated the Japanese release of the game with a 10,000 pieces limited edition Satin Silver 40GB model \"PlayStation 3 Like a Dragon Kenzan! Pack\" (龍が如く 見参！パック, \"ryu ga gotoku kenzan! pakku\") SKU including a \"Rising Dragon\" (昇竜, \"noburyu\") stickers set to customize the console case.\n\nThe Japanese version was released on March 6, 2008 in both Japan and South East Asia, while Sony published it in South Korea on March 25, 2008 with a subtitled script book.\n\nIn late December 2009, commenting the opportunity of a western release, Sega Australia managing director Darren Macbeth said \"there is nothing in the plan at this stage for Yakuza Kenzan. Right now we are focusing on the release of Yakuza 3. The feedback we get from this release will help us in making future decisions\". In March 2010, \"Yakuza 3\" had a western release as did in 2011 \"Yakuza 4\". Then again, in 2012, a second spinoff was also released abroad and localized as \"\".\n\nThe \"Ryu Ga Gotoku Kenzan! Original Sound Track\" (HCV-381) album was published by Wave Master in Japan on March 6, 2008. Music was composed by Hidenori Shoji, Hideki Sakamoto, Hiroyoshi Kato, Keisuke Ito and Yuri Fukuda. This OST is noticeable for an exotic track, a flamenco piece titled \"Baile con la mariposa\" (Spanish for \"Dance with the Butterfly\") which is the theme for the duel between Musashi Miyamoto and Itto Ittosai. The track list has 31 titles (details are available below).\n\nAdditional soundtrack includes two songs by Japanese hip hop artists Zeebra and Ketsumeishi ; Zeebra collaborated later with the \"Yakuza 4\" opening theme, \"Butterfly City\". \n\nClothes manufacturer Cropped Heads collaborated with Sega to produce licensed \"Ryu Ga Gotoku Kenzan!\" tee-shirts, and Ace Cook produced \"Ryu Ga Gotoku Kenzan!\" cup noodles.\n\nAs of July 9, 2008, the game has sold 270,438 copies in Japan, according to \"Famitsu\".
